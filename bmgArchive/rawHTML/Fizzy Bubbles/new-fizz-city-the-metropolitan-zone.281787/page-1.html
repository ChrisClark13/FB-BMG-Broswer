																					<span style="font-size: 12px">New
																						Fizz City stands as a shining
																						beacon of hope and prosperity
																						for the world of Fizzy Bubbles.
																						Built on the shores of Cape
																						Effervescence over two centuries
																						ago, the city started root as a
																						trading port which fell into
																						great prosperity during the
																						industrial revolution. The port
																						town attracted people from far
																						and wide in search of a better
																						life, quickly growing into a
																						diverse and bustling metropolis
																						sprawling for miles across the
																						land and stretching way up into
																						the clouds. As the modern urban
																						center of Fizzytopia, New Fizz
																						City boasts significant
																						high-rise development,
																						widespread use of cars and
																						motorcycles and one of the most
																						extensive transit systems in the
																						world; from its subway and
																						commuter trains to the
																						world-famous yellow cabs that
																						shuffle along the city streets,
																						there is just about nowhere you
																						can’t get to in the city.<br />
																						<br />
																						Famed for its vibrant
																						neighborhoods and unparalleled
																						culture, New Fizz City is a
																						proud cultural melting pot where
																						you are sure to encounter
																						trainers from every walk of
																						life. While city folk have a
																						strong sense of community you
																						will find them just as welcoming
																						to outsiders, although tourists
																						are advised to keep out of
																						certain districts after dark
																						with growing poverty giving rise
																						to increased crime and gang
																						activity. While green spaces are
																						hard to come by in the concrete
																						jungle, many species of Pokemon
																						have learned to adapt to urban
																						life. Resident strays have a
																						certain street smart about them
																						making them valuable companions,
																						provided you can win their
																						trust. As the locals will tell
																						you, the city that never sleeps
																						holds adventure on every street
																						corner. If you can make it here,
																						you can make it
																						anywhere!</span>&#8203;

																						tallest high-rises in the city.
																						The biggest, busiest and most

																						downtown it is a hive of
																						activity for both shoppers and

																						you're not mesmerized by the
																						city's soaring skyscrapers and
																						monuments, you'll be blown away
																						by its flourishing arts, food,
																						and fashion scenes. From famed

																						district and gave it new verve.
																						They converted the abandoned
																						warehouses into lofted art

																						and coffee shops buzzing with

																						the materials and workspace, but
																						you probably saw some of that
																						from inside, huh?&quot;<br />
																						<br />
																						&quot;Sure. Some of it.&quot;
																						The vocal pattern his Rotom put

																						clear from the ear cuff. Of
																						course, Hint sounded dubious.
																						&quot;But why are we heading
																						here now? Are you planning to

																						<br />
																						&quot;Ehhh, sorta?&quot; Aiden

																						&quot;I kinda wanna see if

																						<br />
																						&quot;Well, at least we'll

																						the idea of putting his entire

																						Pokéballs had gotten into his

																						had to make the Pokéballs
																						<i>himself</i>, which he
																						<i>should</i> be able to do once
																						he got a chance to see how
																						Pokéballs were actually put
																						together and assuming that the
																						futuristic look was mostly
																						detailing, he'd absolutely do
																						it, just to be able to, one, say
																						he did it, two, for the
																						aesthetic, but mostly so he
																						could match them all to
																						Hint's.<br />
																						<br />
																						He ducked into the door to The
																						Foundry and glanced around for
																						someone working on Pokéballs.
																						Hopefully, they'd know a thing
																						or two about Hint's Pokéball and
																						be able to point him in the

																					New Fizz City’s Little Kanto would
																					certainly be just as exciting.<br />
																					<br />
																					Hugo wandered through the street,

																					tourists to visit specific

																					Gary let out a deep sigh as he
																					walked down the street in the
																					Municipal Plaza. It wasn’t very
																					often that he left his research
																					expeditions in the mountains or
																					across the seas for a more urban
																					setting, but his reason for being in
																					the region’s capitol city was
																					strictly business; he had just
																					finished a meeting at the
																					Fizzytopian Gym League headquarters
																					where he reported on his findings at
																					the Typhon’s Depths Gym over the
																					past several months.<br />
																					<br />
																					Now that his business was complete,
																					Gary was walking down the street
																					idly as he prepared to depart back
																					for his home. While he was no
																					stranger to the city life, the
																					Azalea Town native had always lived
																					in small rural villages, spanning
																					over the decades from his hometown
																					to his years getting a degree in
																					Humilau City, and even his time
																					since moving back to Fizzytopia had
																					been spent on the isolated
																					mountainside of Mt. Zephyria. He
																					wasn’t exactly a hermit, but there
																					was an element of comfort in being
																					isolated within nature for
																					him.<br />
																					<br />
																					As his mind wandered, Gary began to
																					look around at his surroundings. It
																					was a bustling city all right, but
																					he noticed signs and advertisements
																					everywhere. Surely there was a lot
																					more to take in than he gave the
																					city credit, but he had just never
																					put in the time to look around.
																					<i>“That’s it,”</i> he thought as he
																					began to let his curiosity take
																					over, <i>“I think it’s time I see
																						what all there is to offer
																						around here.”</i> True to his
																					self, Gary immediately began to
																					think about the Fizzby Harbor. He
																					had heard rumors that there are some
																					good fishing spots in the area, but
																					never had a chance to check them out
																					before. Making up his mind, Gary
																					hopped on the subway and set course
																					on the route for Cape
																					Effervescence.</span>

																					style="color: khaki"><b>King
																						Ghidorah: </b>It felt like
																					years. It <i>had </i>been years.
																					Your last time in New Fizz had been
																					a bittersweet one, a trip to the
																					local Power Plant that had gone awry
																					in more ways than one, and yet, had
																					also provided you with one of your
																					strongest companions.<br />
																					<br />
																					Now, you're looking to start over,
																					much like the very city itself has.
																					Away from the noisier, more
																					metropolitan side of New Fizz, you
																					find yourself instead being pulled
																					toward a much more picturesque sort
																					of neighborhood - Little
																					Kanto.<br />
																					<br />
																					You tell yourself it probably isn't
																					too different from the real deal -
																					your surroundings <i>looks
																					</i>authentic, or at the very least
																					quite traditional. You haven't
																					spotted any egregious mistakes
																					either, like Slowpoke Tail sellers
																					from Johto trying to pass them off
																					as genuine Kantonian delicacies. The
																					scents, in fact, are just as much
																					part of the area's appeal as the
																					sights. A far cry, and a welcome
																					one, from the drab and austere Power
																					Plant you found yourself trapped in
																					last time.<br />
																					<br />
																					&quot;You sir, are a
																					scam!&quot;<br />
																					&quot;Oh, so now you insult my
																					cooking <i>and </i>my
																					honor?!&quot;<br />
																					&quot;Indeed I do, sir! A thousand
																					times if I must!&quot;<br />
																					<br />
																					The commotion seems to come from a
																					nearby food stall on the side of the
																					main street. A small crowd is
																					starting to gather, as it always
																					does at the slightest suggestion of
																					drama.<br />
																					<br />
																					&quot;How dare you call this filth
																					traditional fried Farfetch'd?! It is
																					a crime against the
																					palate!&quot;<br />
																					&quot;Preposterous! What would I
																					call it then, if not exactly what it
																					is?!&quot;<br />
																					&quot;Again you mock me sir? You
																					think I would not be able to tell
																					genuine Farfetch'd from common
																					Ducklett?!&quot;<br />
																					<br />
																					The angry customer at the heart of
																					this scuffle - undoubtedly Galarian,
																					from accent to posture - is leaning
																					over the counter, face red and
																					contorted in rage behind his rather
																					impressive gray moustache. From
																					where you're standing you can't
																					quite catch a glimpse of the cook's
																					face, but you can't imagine he looks
																					much happier...<br />
																					<br />
																					&quot;YOU! Kind sir!&quot; The
																					customer suddenly turns to you after
																					briefly scanning his surroundings.
																					&quot;Would you be so kind as to
																					help us settle this?&quot;<br />
																					<br />
																					The whole affair seems vastly
																					exaggerated all things considered...
																					Is this something you even want to
																					be involved in?</span></div>

																							<br />
																							Myahoo:</b> Breaking through
																						into the large, multi-storey
																						warehouse felt like stepping
																						into a furnace, the temperature
																						creeping up a few notches as
																						sweat trickled down your brow.
																						The workers were climatized to
																						the heat and then some, sparks
																						flying as they busily put their
																						welding talents to work, casting
																						all sorts of nondescript parts
																						before your eyes. The cacophony
																						of grinding and hammering is
																						enough to mute your entry,
																						although two of the metalworkers
																						must have paid mind, finishing
																						stoking one of the kilns before
																						ambling your way. Removing their
																						faceguards the two looked almost
																						identical in every way sans for
																						age, faces dappled in freckles
																						with fiery red hair tied back in
																						ponytails; the younger of the
																						two’s hair was curlier on closer
																						inspection and not near as
																						long.<br />
																						<br />
																						“Welcome to The Foundry, kid,”
																						The welder in his twenties
																						declared, “I’m Fouco and this is
																						my little brother Fuego. We
																						don’t own this place but we’ve
																						been workin’ here since near
																						enough kids! We can help out
																						with any of your metalworking
																						needs!” You gingerly pass over
																						your Rotom's cyberball, black
																						with pulsating yellow lines
																						evocative of a computer’s
																						motherboard. The metalworker’s
																						brow furrows in confusion as he
																						handles the ball, while his
																						teenage brother’s eyes light up
																						with enthusiasm.<br />
																						<br />
																						“Hmm… That’s a tall order kid,
																						y’know it’s not the sort of ball
																						you can just up and weld, it
																						requires cybernetic enhancements
																						to work properly,” you feel a
																						sense of deflation as he hands
																						it back to you, until the
																						younger of the red-haired pair
																						pipes up.<br />
																						<br />
																						“What about that new CAD system,
																						big bro? There are instructions
																						on building these sort of balls
																						on there. Imagine if it works,
																						we’ll be the first independent
																						ball makers to offer ‘em!”<br />
																						<br />
																						“Emphasis on the <i>new</i>,
																						little bro – it just came in
																						last week, so I’m not so sure
																						about testing it out on a
																						customer.” A brief back and
																						forth between the siblings
																						ensues, the younger of the two
																						practically begging at this
																						point, desperate to put his
																						welding skills to work on a ball
																						outside of The Foundry’s typical
																						fare.<br />
																						<br />
																						“Okay fine.” Fouco relents, “But
																						you’d be using it at your own
																						risk, knowing that if you make a
																						single mistake the ball could
																						very well wipe the captured
																						Pokemon out of existence - if
																						you’re willing to take that risk
																						my brother Fuego will show you
																						the ropes.” Surely the older
																						brother was joking, right? What
																						will you do?</span><br />

																						to the city’s famed harbour

																					style="color: darkkhaki">&quot;New
																					Fizz City?&quot; Danny asked as he
																					read over the text Ritchie had sent
																					him a third time. There was a newly
																					constructed city that seemed to have
																					just popped out of nowhere, and
																					Ritchie had wanted them to head over
																					there together, but there was no
																					time, so Danny went on his own.
																					Ritchie was tangled up in his own
																					adventure anyway. So, looking over
																					the city map, Danny decided to head
																					over the Rail Yard, because trains
																					are fucking awesome machines, that
																					he needed to study so he could build
																					his intellect. There's no point of
																					something existing and him not
																					knowing about it, after all.<br />
																					<br />
																					So he set out to the rail yard. Once
																					he get there though, he was
																					disappointed. The rail yard was
																					already defunct. Some random
																					powerful Pokemon ravaged the whole
																					place, but it was gone now, at
																					least, that's what the brochure
																					said. The rail yard, due to the high
																					amounts of mechanical technology and
																					iron that had been left over, the
																					yard had become a home for Steel
																					types, likely the Aron species was
																					dominant, as they were known to eat
																					iron, and a run down railway is an
																					iron buffet. The rails led down,
																					leading to brightly graffitied
																					walls, the art was, to be put
																					simply, both revolting and stunning.
																					<br />
																					<br />
																					After reading to the bottom of the
																					brochure, Danny found out that there
																					were crime and gangs around at
																					night.<br />
																					<br />
																					&quot;They could be dealing in
																					Pokemon, illegally.&quot; Danny
																					thought aloud. &quot;Well, looks
																					like I got something to
																					do.&quot;</span>

																									Ghidorah: </b>It
																								felt like years. It
																								<i>had </i>been years.
																								Your last time in New
																								Fizz had been a
																								bittersweet one, a trip
																								to the local Power Plant
																								that had gone awry in
																								more ways than one, and
																								yet, had also provided
																								you with one of your
																								strongest
																								companions.<br />
																								<br />
																								Now, you're looking to
																								start over, much like
																								the very city itself
																								has. Away from the
																								noisier, more
																								metropolitan side of New
																								Fizz, you find yourself
																								instead being pulled
																								toward a much more
																								picturesque sort of
																								neighborhood - Little
																								Kanto.<br />
																								<br />
																								You tell yourself it
																								probably isn't too
																								different from the real
																								deal - your surroundings
																								<i>looks </i>authentic,
																								or at the very least
																								quite traditional. You
																								haven't spotted any
																								egregious mistakes
																								either, like Slowpoke
																								Tail sellers from Johto
																								trying to pass them off
																								as genuine Kantonian
																								delicacies. The scents,
																								in fact, are just as
																								much part of the area's
																								appeal as the sights. A
																								far cry, and a welcome
																								one, from the drab and
																								austere Power Plant you
																								found yourself trapped
																								in last time.<br />
																								<br />
																								&quot;You sir, are a
																								scam!&quot;<br />
																								&quot;Oh, so now you
																								insult my cooking <i>and
																								</i>my
																								honor?!&quot;<br />
																								&quot;Indeed I do, sir!
																								A thousand times if I
																								must!&quot;<br />
																								<br />
																								The commotion seems to
																								come from a nearby food
																								stall on the side of the
																								main street. A small
																								crowd is starting to
																								gather, as it always
																								does at the slightest
																								suggestion of
																								drama.<br />
																								<br />
																								&quot;How dare you call
																								this filth traditional
																								fried Farfetch'd?! It is
																								a crime against the
																								palate!&quot;<br />
																								&quot;Preposterous! What
																								would I call it then, if
																								not exactly what it
																								is?!&quot;<br />
																								&quot;Again you mock me
																								sir? You think I would
																								not be able to tell
																								genuine Farfetch'd from
																								common
																								Ducklett?!&quot;<br />
																								<br />
																								The angry customer at
																								the heart of this
																								scuffle - undoubtedly
																								Galarian, from accent to
																								posture - is leaning
																								over the counter, face
																								red and contorted in
																								rage behind his rather
																								impressive gray
																								moustache. From where
																								you're standing you
																								can't quite catch a
																								glimpse of the cook's
																								face, but you can't
																								imagine he looks much
																								happier...<br />
																								<br />
																								&quot;YOU! Kind
																								sir!&quot; The customer
																								suddenly turns to you
																								after briefly scanning
																								his surroundings.
																								&quot;Would you be so
																								kind as to help us
																								settle this?&quot;<br />
																								<br />
																								The whole affair seems
																								vastly exaggerated all
																								things considered... Is
																								this something you even
																								want to be involved
																								in?</span>

																				</blockquote><span
																					style="color: khaki">The crowd that
																					had gathered turned simultaneously
																					to face Hugo who was suddenly thrust
																					into this awkward encounter whether
																					he liked it or not. So much for
																					laying low. These sort of things
																					always seemed to happen to Hugo. Why
																					was that? Why was it always so hard
																					for him to fade into obscurity? He
																					was always the one who got pulled
																					into these situations. Almost as if
																					someone, or a perhaps multiple
																					people, were intentionally coming up
																					with especially complicated
																					scenarios for him.<br />
																					<br />
																					Nah, that’s just crazy talk.<br />
																					<br />
																					Nevertheless, the cook, the
																					mustachioed gentleman, and the crowd
																					were looking to Hugo for a reaction.
																					He didn’t really want to make waves
																					and get involved…but he <i>was</i>
																					pretty hungry after all. The
																					Farfetch’d…or Ducklett…or whatever
																					it was did smell quite tasty; Hugo’s
																					stomach growling in response,
																					beckoning him to settle the matter.
																					It was the right thing to do after
																					all, right? These guys asked him for
																					his help. Common courtesy would
																					indicate that he really should lend
																					them a hand. It was innocent stuff,
																					where was the harm?<br />
																					<br />
																					“Who? Me? Well, I don’t know. I
																					don’t really want to get in the way
																					here.” Hugo was pretty good at
																					faking incredulousness. Seem
																					unwilling and maybe this can go off
																					without a hitch. “But I mean…if you
																					really need my help, I suppose I
																					could give it a try. Please know
																					that I’m no culinary expert. But if
																					you’re asking me to participate in
																					some kind of taste test…perhaps
																					provide me will a full meal at
																					absolutely no cost to me…then I
																					guess I could help.”<br />
																					<br />
																					Was that too direct?
																					Probably.</span>

																					<br />
																					But he looked at the chef. The man

																					perhaps even his entire livelihood.
																					<br />
																					<br />
																					Hugo thought back on the Power

																					<br />

																					<br />
																					“Oooh, yes. So tender. Much flavor,”

																					<br />
																					You know, really hamming it up.

																					<br />
																					Hugo felt the eyes on him and

																									style="color: deeppink"><b><u>The
																											Foundry</u><br />
																										<br />
																										Myahoo:</b>
																									Breaking through
																									into the large,
																									multi-storey
																									warehouse felt like
																									stepping into a
																									furnace, the
																									temperature creeping
																									up a few notches as
																									sweat trickled down
																									your brow. The
																									workers were
																									climatized to the
																									heat and then some,
																									sparks flying as
																									they busily put
																									their welding
																									talents to work,
																									casting all sorts of
																									nondescript parts
																									before your eyes.
																									The cacophony of
																									grinding and
																									hammering is enough
																									to mute your entry,
																									although two of the
																									metalworkers must
																									have paid mind,
																									finishing stoking
																									one of the kilns
																									before ambling your
																									way. Removing their
																									faceguards the two
																									looked almost
																									identical in every
																									way sans for age,
																									faces dappled in
																									freckles with fiery
																									red hair tied back
																									in ponytails; the
																									younger of the two’s
																									hair was curlier on
																									closer inspection
																									and not near as
																									long.<br />
																									<br />
																									“Welcome to The
																									Foundry, kid,” The
																									welder in his
																									twenties declared,
																									“I’m Fouco and this
																									is my little brother
																									Fuego. We don’t own
																									this place but we’ve
																									been workin’ here
																									since near enough
																									kids! We can help
																									out with any of your
																									metalworking needs!”
																									You gingerly pass
																									over your Rotom's
																									cyberball, black
																									with pulsating
																									yellow lines
																									evocative of a
																									computer’s
																									motherboard. The
																									metalworker’s brow
																									furrows in confusion
																									as he handles the
																									ball, while his
																									teenage brother’s
																									eyes light up with
																									enthusiasm.<br />
																									<br />
																									“Hmm… That’s a tall
																									order kid, y’know
																									it’s not the sort of
																									ball you can just up
																									and weld, it
																									requires cybernetic
																									enhancements to work
																									properly,” you feel
																									a sense of deflation
																									as he hands it back
																									to you, until the
																									younger of the
																									red-haired pair
																									pipes up.<br />
																									<br />
																									“What about that new
																									CAD system, big bro?
																									There are
																									instructions on
																									building these sort
																									of balls on there.
																									Imagine if it works,
																									we’ll be the first
																									independent ball
																									makers to offer
																									‘em!”<br />
																									<br />
																									“Emphasis on the
																									<i>new</i>, little
																									bro – it just came
																									in last week, so I’m
																									not so sure about
																									testing it out on a
																									customer.” A brief
																									back and forth
																									between the siblings
																									ensues, the younger
																									of the two
																									practically begging
																									at this point,
																									desperate to put his
																									welding skills to
																									work on a ball
																									outside of The
																									Foundry’s typical
																									fare.<br />
																									<br />
																									“Okay fine.” Fouco
																									relents, “But you’d
																									be using it at your
																									own risk, knowing
																									that if you make a
																									single mistake the
																									ball could very well
																									wipe the captured
																									Pokemon out of
																									existence - if
																									you’re willing to
																									take that risk my
																									brother Fuego will
																									show you the ropes.”
																									Surely the older
																									brother was joking,
																									right? What will you
																									do?</span></span>

																						style="color: deeppink">It was
																						<i>hot</i> in the Foundry. And
																						<i>noisy</i>. Which was really
																						to be expected from a space like
																						this, what with people actually
																						putting things together and
																						hammering metal and all. Aiden
																						resisted the urge to pant as he
																						spotted a pair of metalworkers
																						heading in his direction. They
																						took off their faceguards on the
																						way over, revealing matching
																						freckled faces and red hair tied
																						back and out of the way.
																						Probably relatives, if he had to
																						guess.<br />
																						<br />
																						&quot;Welcome to The Foundry,
																						kid,&quot; the older one said.
																						&quot;I'm Fouco and this is my
																						little brother, Fuego. We don't
																						own this place, but we've been
																						workin' here since near enough
																						kids! We can help out with any
																						of your metalworking
																						needs!&quot;<br />
																						<br />
																						Aiden quirked a grin at him as
																						he dug out Hint's yellow
																						Cyberball. &quot;Nice to meet
																						you guys. I was, uh, hoping
																						you--or someone--could help me
																						make a set of these? Like, maybe
																						five of them? For a whole team,
																						y'know.&quot; His grin widened
																						and went sheepish as he passed
																						the Cyberball to Fuoco, while
																						Fuego's eyes lit up.<br />
																						<br />
																						Fuoco took Hint's Cyberball with
																						a furrowed brow and examined the
																						glowing lines. &quot;Hmm. That's
																						a tall order, kid. Y'know, it's
																						not the sort of ball you can
																						just up and weld; it requires
																						cybernetic enhancements to work
																						properly.&quot;<br />
																						<br />
																						&quot;Ah.&quot; Aiden took the
																						Cyberball back and tucked it
																						away, shoulders slumping a bit.
																						Well, <i>that</i> sounded like
																						the idea was a bust, but he
																						probably shouldn't be surprised;
																						not like he'd ever heard about
																						Cyberballs in any other region,
																						after all. He barely heard the
																						beginnings of Hint's
																						consolations over the noise in
																						The Foundry when Fuego broke
																						in.<br />
																						<br />
																						&quot;What about that new CAD
																						system, big bro? There are
																						instructions on building these
																						sort of balls on there. Imagine
																						if it works; we'll be the first
																						independent ball makers to offer
																						'em!&quot;<br />
																						<br />
																						Aiden glanced over at Fuoco and
																						heard Hint fall silent in his
																						ear.<br />
																						<br />
																						&quot;Emphasis on the
																						<i>new</i>, little bro--it just
																						came in last week, so I'm not so
																						sure about testing it out on a
																						customer.&quot;<br />
																						<br />
																						<i>Very</i> new system, then.
																						Fuego slowly wore his older
																						brother down, a sequence of
																						events that Aiden was...actually
																						<i>really</i> familiar with,
																						though usually from within the
																						situation instead of watching it
																						from the outside like he was
																						now.<br />
																						<br />
																						&quot;Okay fine,&quot; Fuoco
																						finally relented. &quot;But
																						you'd be using it at your own
																						risk, knowing that if you make a
																						single mistake, the ball could
																						very well wipe the captured
																						Pokémon out of existence.&quot;
																						<i>What?</i> Aiden choked in
																						surprise and almost missed the
																						rest of Fuoco's words. &quot;If
																						you're willing to take that
																						risk, my brother Fuego will show
																						you the ropes.&quot;<br />
																						<br />
																						Aiden cleared his throat.
																						&quot;Uh, does, does it have to
																						be done on an occupied Pokéball?
																						The process? Because, to be
																						honest, I was planning to do it
																						on some new 'balls and then just
																						transfering the Pokémon in
																						afterwards,&quot; he explained.
																						&quot;Mostly because I...don't
																						actually <i>have</i> that many
																						Pokémon yet.&quot; He ducked his
																						head sheepishly and peered up at
																						the brothers. &quot;I, uh,
																						brought a few empty Pokéballs?
																						Three regular ones and a pair of
																						Premiers, since I didn't know if
																						there'd be a difference.&quot;
																						And also so he knew what kind
																						he'd have to get his hands on
																						afterwards. Regular Pokéballs,
																						he could continue to sneak from
																						Melissa, but Premiers? He was
																						already a bit worried that she'd
																						notice she was abruptly out of
																						them.</span></span>

																								<br />

																					style="color: khaki">Hugo realized
																					why he couldn’t blend in with his
																					surroundings. Because he did this to
																					himself. He always seemed to take it
																					to one extreme or the other, rarely
																					the middle ground. Probably some
																					kind of underlying prognosis there.
																					Ah, well. <br />
																					<br />
																					Hugo watched as the man stormed
																					away, having promised we hadn’t
																					heard the last of him. <br />
																					<br />
																					“Phew, good thing we’ve heard the
																					last of him,” he said, turning to
																					the cook. <br />
																					<br />
																					Despite doing the Kantonian a solid,
																					Hugo was a little surprised at the
																					gruffness with which he was
																					received. Certainly there’s
																					something to be said about being
																					selfless and not doing good deeds
																					for the sake of the reward or
																					adoration, but even so, Hugo still
																					felt a bit slighted. He packed the
																					<b>Leftovers</b> away, sure to use
																					them another time, and joined the
																					chef – and his somewhat abrasive
																					attitude – within the stall. <br />
																					<br />
																					Hugo eyed the various ingredients –
																					many of them unidentifiable – and
																					cooking apparatuses that the cook
																					had accumulated. Quite impressive
																					for a street vendor. Something told
																					Hugo there was something out of the
																					ordinary about this gentleman. That
																					there was more than may meet the
																					eye. This, of course, was confirmed
																					when he approached Hugo with an
																					unspecified proposition. <br />
																					<br />
																					“As a general rule,” Hugo began to
																					explain, “I don’t typically accept
																					shady offers from random street
																					people, especially when they don’t
																					really even hint at what they’re
																					getting at.”<br />
																					<br />
																					Today, however, Hugo was feeling
																					especially bold.<br />
																					<br />
																					“But what the hell? Why not? Tell me
																					what you have to offer me, my
																					friend.”<br />
																					<br />
																					He picked up the scent of
																					alcohol.<br />
																					<br />
																					“And how about pouring one for
																					me?”</span>

																						You amble down the production

																						“Once the metal has cooled down
																						enough we’ll place it in a

																						The tour finally takes you to a

																						metals, beside him a fire-type
																						using a concentrated burst of
																						flame to emulate the same
																						process. Fuego snags a Pokeball
																						from the end bench; grey, hollow
																						and unfunctional. “But that just
																						leaves you with an empty shell,
																						right?” He remarks, catching it
																						in the air, “This is where we
																						transfer the ball to our
																						printer, where we surface mount
																						all of the various
																						microprocessors, components and
																						connectors onto a printed
																						circuit board. The ball you are
																						after is unique as it features
																						processors on the exterior as
																						well as interior – it’s a
																						delicate process, but our new
																						CAD system should have no
																						problem handling it.”<br />
																						<br />
																						“Then it’s just a quick paint
																						job and voila, you have yourself
																						a fully functioning Pokeball!”
																						He had switched the empty shell
																						with a finished product which he
																						tosses a few times with a wide
																						grin. Your head was spinning
																						from the impromptu tour,
																						wondering perhaps if you should
																						have searched the shops at
																						Commercial Boulevard or even the
																						Trader’s Bazaar for something
																						readymade. Fuego takes you to a
																						cluttered desk space to talk
																						business, stretching his head as
																						he draws up a materials list:
																						“The base Pokeball shell will be
																						molded with aluminium, then
																						nickel is used in the circuit
																						board components of the
																						Cyberball. I can’t guarantee the
																						CAD system will be capable of
																						producing five of ‘em though,
																						you’ll have to wait and see when
																						you boot it up.”<br />
																						<br />
																						“We can offer the raw materials
																						and equipment hire at $200 per
																						ball, or if you have Pokemon
																						capable of helping with the
																						<b>heating</b>, <b>pressing</b>,
																						<b>cutting</b> and
																						<b>welding</b> processes I’ll
																						knock off an extra $50 per
																						process, per ball. You hear that
																						– if you are capable of helping
																						with all of those stages I’ll
																						give you the balls free of
																						charge!’ It was an enticing
																						offer for sure, provided you
																						were confident your Pokemon had
																						the diverse range of abilities
																						necessary to get the job

																						<i>apparently</i> thought
																						Aiden's reactions to losing a
																						Pokémon to some kind of glitch
																						was funny as the guy laughed at
																						Aiden as he scrambled to offer
																						up an alternative. At least he
																						let Fuego show Aiden
																						around.<br />
																						<br />
																						But, first, there was protective
																						equipment because getting burned
																						or catching on fire was bad for
																						business. Aiden dutifully suited
																						up and followed Fuego to a
																						furnace.<br />
																						<br />
																						&quot;This here is the forge, a
																						type of hearth we use for
																						heating metals which are molded
																						into special Pokéballs,&quot;
																						Fuego explained. &quot;We
																						require the firepower of a
																						Pokémon for this process, and
																						oftimes if we're creating a ball
																						with special properties--like
																						say a Ghost Ball--we'll have a
																						Pokémon imbue the type energy
																						into the melted ore.&quot;<br />
																						<br />
																						Hint hummed consideringly in
																						Aiden's ear. Aiden dropped his
																						voice, so that Fuego hopefully
																						wouldn't hear him 'talk to
																						himself' and asked,
																						&quot;What?&quot;<br />
																						<br />
																						&quot;Nothing.&quot; Aiden
																						rolled his eyes and tried to
																						radiate unimpressed. It didn't
																						take long for Hint to cave.
																						&quot;It looked like it'd be
																						interesting to see how it worked
																						from inside. That's
																						all.&quot;<br />
																						<br />
																						&quot;Please don't.&quot; A
																						possessed forge? Granted, the
																						only things he <i>knew</i> Hint
																						had possessed were a computer
																						and the special ear
																						cuff-slash-hands-free device
																						Aiden'd made for it. It'd
																						probably also possessed whatever
																						the NFCPD wanted it to when it
																						still belonged to them...but
																						that wasn't exactly something it
																						probably <i>wanted</i> to do for
																						itself. &quot;...or, at least
																						wait until we have the other
																						Cyberballs before you go
																						wreaking havoc on their
																						machinery.&quot;<br />
																						<br />
																						Hint sniffed. &quot;I'm not
																						going to <i>wreak havoc</i>; I
																						know you want to be able to come
																						back here. I just thought it'd
																						be interesting to see the
																						insides and then get
																						out.&quot;<br />
																						<br />
																						Aiden let the topic lie and
																						turned his attention back to
																						Fuego and the...giant flattening
																						machine in front of them now.
																						&quot;Once the metal has cooled
																						enough, we'll place it in a
																						special mold. The Foundry uses a
																						hydraulic press for shaping the
																						metal, although hammers or even
																						tough Pokémon are sometimes
																						needed to finish the
																						job.&quot;<br />
																						<br />
																						He then moved on to a machine
																						that was engraving, cutting, and
																						marking sheet metal with exact
																						precision. Probably
																						computer-guided, if Aiden didn't
																						miss his guess. &quot;Once we're
																						happy with the shape and
																						density, we use a laser cutter
																						to trim away the unwanted edges.
																						Again, it's not uncommon for
																						gifted Pokémon to lend a hand
																						with this process.&quot;<br />
																						<br />
																						Fuego led them over to a welding
																						block, sparks showering Aiden's
																						protective equipment as someone
																						welded a pair of metal pieces
																						together with a Fire-type
																						working parallel to them. Their
																						tour guide picked up a Pokéball
																						from the bench and showed it to
																						Aiden. Grey, hollow, not
																						functional. Aiden grimaced.
																						&quot;But that just leaves you
																						with an empty shell,
																						right?&quot; Aiden nodded as
																						Fuego tossed the Pokéball into
																						the air. &quot;This is where we
																						transfer the 'ball to our
																						printer, where we surface mount
																						all of the various
																						microprocessors, components, and
																						connectors onto a printed
																						circuit board. The ball you are
																						after is unique as it features
																						processors on the exterior as
																						well as interior--it's a
																						delicate process, but our new
																						CAD system should have no
																						problem handling it.<br />
																						<br />
																						&quot;Then, it's just a quick
																						paint job and voila, you have
																						yourself a fully-functioning
																						Pokéball!&quot; Fuego swapped
																						the unfinished Pokéball for a
																						finished one that he tossed into
																						the air a few times with a wide
																						grin. Aiden grinned back, though
																						he was frantically parsing
																						through the info dump for the
																						most relevant information.<br />
																						<br />
																						Okay, okay. So, first, heat the
																						metals and maybe infuse energy
																						for Type balls. Then, press into
																						a mold with the hydraulic press.
																						Trim away the excess, then set
																						the circuits on the inside,
																						<i>and</i> the outside for
																						Cyberballs, paint and
																						done.<br />
																						<br />
																						Put like that, it didn't sound
																						like so much, but Fuego still
																						had more to say. He led the way
																						to a cluttered desk space and
																						started jotting down a list, as
																						he spoke. &quot;The base
																						Pokéball shell will be molded
																						with aluminium. Then, nickel is
																						used in the circuit board
																						components of the Cyberball. I
																						can't guarantee the CAD system
																						will be capable of producing
																						five of 'em, though; you'll have
																						to wait and see when you boot it
																						up.<br />
																						<br />
																						&quot;We can offer the raw
																						materials and equipment hire at
																						$200 per ball, or if you have
																						Pokémon capable of helping with
																						the heating, pressing, cutting,
																						and welding processes, I'll
																						knock off an extra $50 per
																						process, per ball. You hear
																						that--if you are capable of
																						helping with all of those
																						stages, I'll give you the balls
																						free of charge!&quot;<br />
																						<br />
																						Aiden could <i>feel</i> himself
																						deflating as Fuego went over the
																						business details. Materials,
																						he'd be willing to track down
																						and dig up--he'd done it
																						before--but labor costs?
																						Readily-available raw materials?
																						He didn't have an official
																						<i>Trainer account</i>, let
																						alone Trainer <i>cash</i>. And
																						the Pokémon he <i>did</i> have
																						weren't exactly suited to
																						metalworking. He could hack
																						Melissa's account again, risk
																						catching her attention to steal
																						the money, but...to be honest?
																						He'd rather put in the work
																						himself now.<br />
																						<br />
																						...except the Pokéball thing. It
																						wasn't like she was using them
																						at any rate she'd really notice,
																						anyway.<br />
																						<br />
																						He flashed Fuego a quick, polite
																						grin. &quot;Yeah. That sounds
																						awesome. I just...&quot; Aiden
																						tried to run a hand through his
																						hair, but bumped into the
																						faceguard. He made a frustrated
																						noise, let his hand drop, and
																						shrugged. &quot;I don't think I
																						can afford it right now.&quot;
																						He sighed. &quot;Thanks for the
																						tour.&quot; He turned to
																						go.<br />
																						<br />
																						&quot;Wait.&quot; Aiden stopped,
																						blinking in surprise. Hint
																						sounded...angry? &quot;Are
																						you...what are you
																						doing.&quot;<br />
																						<br />
																						Aiden glanced back at Fuego and
																						shot him an apologetic smile,
																						gesturing that he was taking a
																						call before turning his back and
																						lowering his voice. &quot;What
																						do you mean, what am I doing? We
																						don't have any money. None of
																						the Pokémon I have are suited
																						for this kind of
																						work--&quot;<br />
																						<br />
																						&quot;What about me?&quot; Hint
																						demanded.<br />
																						<br />
																						&quot;What <i>about</i>
																						you?&quot; Aiden returned,
																						exasperated. &quot;You're an
																						Electric-Ghost and you don't
																						exactly have the kinds of moves
																						that would work for
																						this.&quot;<br />
																						<br />
																						&quot;I'm an Electric-Ghost
																						<i>that possesses
																							machines</i>,&quot; Hint
																						snapped. &quot;I'm pretty sure
																						I'm 'decently suited' for at
																						least <i>one</i> part of this
																						kind of work.&quot;<br />
																						<br />
																						Aiden paused, mouth open to
																						argue back, as he processed that
																						fact. Hint was a Rotom; Rotom
																						could possess machines. Wasn't
																						he <i>just</i> thinking about
																						how Hint would probably like to
																						possess <i>more</i>
																						machines?<br />
																						<br />
																						&quot;And, before you turn back
																						to Fuego, I'd like to remind you
																						that we picked up a tiny Bug
																						recently who I <i>know</i> knows
																						Fury Cutter because I <i>asked
																							him</i>,&quot; Hint
																						emphasized. There was a pause
																						before it reluctantly continued,
																						&quot;Not to mention, Melissa's
																						meddling
																						Gothita...<i>suggested</i> that
																						Kaito and Dust pick up
																						Incinerate and Iron Tail,
																						respectively, the last time she
																						contacted me.&quot;<br />
																						<br />
																						Aiden slowly turned back to
																						Fuego, probably looking a bit
																						dumbfounded. Apparently, he
																						might have been better equipped
																						for this than he thought, though
																						he wasn't sure how he felt about
																						how that Gothita kept
																						manipulating things behind her
																						trainer's back. Even if it was
																						to his benefit, it was...more
																						than a bit unsettling, if he was
																						being honest.<br />
																						<br />
																						He pulled himself together and
																						coughed sheepishly, rocking back
																						onto his heels. &quot;So. I
																						maaaay actually have the Pokémon
																						to do this thing. I
																						just...didn't realize I
																						did?&quot; He hoped Fuego didn't
																						read <i>too</i> much into that,
																						though anything he read into it
																						was...<i>probably</i>
																						true.</span></span>

																					While the art itself was great, what
																					it was depicting was gruesomely
																					disgusting. The railway itself got

																					thorns spiraling and sprouting all
																					around, cracked flagstones covered
																					in moss and spiky weeds, the broken,

																					light, making the railway have a

																					about this place was disgusting,
																					that was for sure.<br />
																					<br />
																					&quot;This place definitely was

																					thought aloud, and Drizzile nodded

																					along with it, making a noise in the

																					Danny's eyes darted from side to

																					&quot;You think, Liz?&quot; Danny

																					Danny jogged over to the terminal,
																					and got a better look of the corpse.
																					It was a gruesome sight, to say the

																					old and dusty, its stomach
																					completely open, the rib cage open
																					to the air. Danny inched closer
																					carefully, spotting a Scraggy
																					rummaging through the Aggron's
																					corpse! Was it looking for scrap

																					&quot;Ouch!&quot; Danny yelped in

																				<span
																					style="color: rgb(247, 218, 100)">With
																					understandable reservations, you
																					nevertheless decide to join the chef
																					inside the stall. It is remarkably
																					well-equipped, even if he seems to
																					be selling Ducklett for Farfetch'd.
																					In fact, there is definitely a great
																					amount of care on display here, from
																					the razor-sharp, high-quality
																					kitchen knives to the impeccable
																					organization of every pot and pan.
																					The dissonance is definitely curious
																					- if this man is so serious about
																					cooking, why is he fooling his
																					customers?<br />
																					<br />
																					The man - whose demeanour has
																					changed drastically from forcibly
																					polite to rough and bitter as soon
																					as the crowd dispersed - looks at
																					you with a very annoyed expression
																					as soon as you ask him for a drink.
																					His eyes rapidly shift to a large
																					bottle of cheap, store-bought whisky
																					before turning back to you.<br />
																					<br />
																					&quot;I don't need the help of
																					someone who loves alcohol as much as
																					I do. Either keep off the bottle and
																					be useful or take a hike,&quot; he
																					dryly replies as he slumps back into
																					a small wooden stool, shoulders
																					dropped in defeat.<br />
																					<br />
																					&quot;Sorry. Sorry about that. It's
																					just...&quot; He half-heartedly
																					points to a worn-looking white
																					bandanna pinned to the wall just
																					above the miniature refrigerator in
																					the corner. &quot;I used to be
																					phenomenal. My name is Edogawa; I
																					was a big deal back in Kanto,
																					y'know?&quot;<br />
																					<br />
																					He reaches for the whisky bottle on
																					the ground without getting up and
																					shakes it in front of his
																					eyes.<br />
																					<br />
																					&quot;Fell into ruin because of
																					this. Even nowadays, any money I
																					make off this miserable stall
																					doesn't last me a day. So that's why
																					I need you - and sober.&quot;<br />
																					<br />
																					Finally, he gets back to his feet,
																					reaches for the old bandanna and
																					straps it around his head.<br />
																					<br />
																					&quot;I intend to get back into the
																					culinary spotlight with my legendary
																					dish! The greatest fried Farfetch'd
																					recipe in the world - the <i>Edogawa
																						CLIMAX!</i>*&quot; he declares
																					with sudden determination, punching
																					the air in dramatic fashion.
																					&quot;Thing is, I... I need you to
																					buy the ingredients. They ain't
																					cheap, and I don't trust myself to
																					spend the money where it needs to be
																					spent, if you know what I
																					mean.&quot;<br />
																					<br />
																					With that, he grabs a dirty envelope
																					tucked away on the small shelf
																					beneath the counter and hands it to
																					you.<br />
																					<br />
																					&quot;There's $3000 in there. I know
																					where I'd be spending it tonight;
																					that's why I need you to spend it
																					*properly* instead. Go to the market
																					at the end of the main street; I
																					need you to buy me a handful of very
																					spicy berries, a couple of sweet
																					ones and, most importantly, a live,
																					healthy Farfetch'd, best one you can
																					grab from the lot on sale. That
																					money oughta be enough.&quot;<br />
																					<br />
																					As if sensing a need for
																					reassurance, he finally
																					adds...<br />
																					<br />
																					&quot;You stand to make a nice
																					profit if we pull this off. You
																					gotta trust me on this... 'cause
																					you're really my only hope at this
																					point. So... you in?&quot;<br />
																					<br />
																					You stare at the envelope in your
																					hand, weighing your options. Helping
																					out this weird fellow is definitely
																					a choice, or you could try and milk
																					a more solid deal out of him before
																					hopping aboard. And then there's the
																					other option: you've just been
																					handed a clean $3000 in hard cash,
																					after all...</span></div>

																						Lucky enough you had a voice in

																						industrial grade furnace but
																						offering up suggestions for each

																						production line. With a plan of

																						head: “Fantastico! If you want
																						to get your Pokemon instructed
																						and ready at each stage in the
																						production line, that should
																						speed up the process some,” he
																						adds with a grin, weighing and
																						handing you the aluminium alloy
																						for the heating step. “I should
																						mention, me and my brother have
																						a <i>huge</i> order of Sports
																						Balls to fulfill for the city
																						Parks and Recreation department,
																						so we’ll have our hands full
																						most of the morning. If you get
																						stuck just yell out!” The idea
																						of being left to your own
																						devices with such specialist

																						ball, although he wouldn’t have
																						put you in charge of anything
																						you couldn’t handle.
																						Right?<br />

																						Throwing caution to the wind you
																						amble to the furnace, its heat
																						coaxing fresh sweat out from
																						your glands onto your shirt.
																						With Hint taking the reigns you
																						hope he’ll require little
																						instruction, the spectre jolting
																						from your earpiece to the kiln
																						ahead. The fiery machine
																						swallows his essence whole,
																						sparks flying up and down its
																						surface as the Rotom hacks into
																						its circuits with little
																						resistance. The appliance
																						quickly flickers an orange hue
																						as Rotom’s possession takes
																						shape, a red field of plasma
																						giving form to a pair of arms.
																						Completing the transformation, a
																						rod-like protrusion rises from
																						his apex as a pair of red eyes
																						blink open, the giant Rotom-Heat
																						grinning feverishly. Firing up
																						the kiln in preparation for your
																						raw materials he tests his new
																						<b>Overheat</b> function, an
																						inferno swilling around his
																						belly eliciting a belch of
																						smoke. You realise this isn’t
																						the desired reaction as Hint
																						falls into a wheeze, fumes
																						seeping from the cracks in his
																						door like a burning oven... With
																						the coughing fit too much to
																						handle Rotom’s door swings open
																						with incredible force, a whole
																						corner of The Foundry going up
																						in a puff of smoke! The haze
																						settles quick enough, as does
																						Hint’s coughing indicating
																						whatever was lodged up inside
																						him had made an escape. You get

																						<b>Pulse</b> of energy forward,

																						On all fours and in close

																						flying every which way. You
																						determine the Scraggy is
																						surprisingly strong for its size
																						and would have the upper hand in
																						bareknuckle combat if left
																						unchecked. Feeling the air
