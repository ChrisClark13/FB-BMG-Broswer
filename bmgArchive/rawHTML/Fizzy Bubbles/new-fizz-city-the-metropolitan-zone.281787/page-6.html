<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: deeppink"><span style="color: lightseagreen"><b>Faiyaa:</b> While troubled skies were a welcome sight a troubled sea dweller was not. With an affinity for all things aquatic and a degree to show for it, you’re quick on the scene for closer assessment. Without the cool of the ocean the beached Wailord was <b>Thrashing</b> and kicking up sand with snowballing anxiety, requiring a delicate touch to return to open water. In a sudden brain wave you bring Pickle to the fray, barely sizing up to the Float Whale's eye which elicits several laughs from nearby bystanders. They would see soon enough that big things often come in small packages as the Sea Cucumber Pokemon begins its hike up the blimp-like creature and gets to work <b>Soaking</b> it down. Pickle’s sticky membrane allows her to fasten on as the Wailord flails with diminishing resistance, the water soothing its dried-out skin some. A pair of nearby trainers follow your lead, their Dewott and Corsola shifting from ploughing efforts to hosing the Wailord down with gentle <b>Water Guns</b>.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: deeppink"><span style="color: lightseagreen">Although the crude oil runs off in some places it’s just as stubborn in others, demanding Pickle’s <b>Purification</b> technique to finish the job. The Wailord didn’t seem to mind as the little Pyukumuku got between all the tight crevices and sopped up the impurities, not dissimilar to the symbiotic cleaning stations that existed for the species in the wild. Spectators who had initially scoffed at Pickle were now cheering her on, one of the two trainers clapping you on the back as he made for an introduction. “I’m Elijah and this is my sis, Renee.” She smiled at you and her brother warmly before fixing back on the task at hand. The pair of outwardly avid beachgoers looked like they could be twins, sharing the same matted surfer hair and sunburned completion.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: deeppink"><span style="color: lightseagreen">“That purification technique is pretty handy, huh. We were thinking once it’s safely off the beach we could use our Pokemon create a current out to the open ocean. We could really use your help purifying the path if you don’t mind getting a little wet. Say, where did that little thing get to?” The Wailord was all of a sudden wriggling like an upstream Magikarp, Pickle inadvertently finding her way into one of its tickle spots! The tremors while muted by the sand are almost enough to knock you off your feet, while the Pyukumuku’s sticky mucous fails to keep her fastened as she bounces about the Float Whale’s back like a bouncy castle. She finds stability lodged in the Wailord’s blowhole, the gigantic Pokemon sensing the blockage and unclogging with an almighty <b>Water Spout</b>! Plan averted, the Pyukumuku is sent flying into the clouds before careening back down at even greater velocity. While the species were known for their resilience, it would be kind to spare her such a death defying drop. What will you do?</span></span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: lightseagreen">Things had been going as Gary planned in Pickle’s attempt to soothe the thrashing Wailord and clean it up. A pair of trainers even offered their assistance in rinsing the oil slick off of the giant whale’s blubber, while the malleable Pyukumuku worked on the harder to reach areas. Initially received by the crowd of onlookers with scorn, the plucky Pickle’s efforts eventually roused a round of applause, and the two trainers who had joined in on the rescue attempt introduced themselves as Elijah and Renee. Gary smiled and returned the introduction back at the siblings, “Thanks for the help, my name’s Gary. Once we get the oil cleaned off of the Wailord I think we might be able to get it calmed down and safely transported back into the water.” Gary had still planned on executing his strategy of swatting a Pokeball into the ocean in an attempt to move the 900 lb. creature, but Pickle would need to finish her duty first.<br />
<br />
Gary scanned his eyes across every visible inch of the massive whale, but Pickle seemed to have disappeared as the ticklish Wailord began to squirm and shake the surrounding area. The Wailord seemed to pressurize a bit and Gary began to put two and two together. “Pickle? You okay up there?” he called out as the Wailord’s blowhole seemed to be blocked. Just as Gary began contemplating scaling the slippery Wailord’s back, the creature exhaled a powerful spout of water into the air that cascaded down on the beachgoers like rain. Gary held a hand over his eyes to shield them from the sun as he scanned the air for a flying green blob. The invertebrate might not have any bones to break, but a fall from that height would surely do some damage so he’d have to act quickly.<br />
<br />
Holding a Pokeball up into the air, Gary considered recalling Pickle back into her own Luxury Ball, but at the speed of terminal velocity it would be very risky and difficult to aim at the small target. Instead, Gary leaned on the natural instincts of a creature that was far more comfortable in the air than he. “Catch her, Artemis!” he called out as a tall blue bird emerged and flapped its wings. Gary was still in the process of getting to know the Cramorant, but he knew that despite their appearances, they were precision hunters who were adept in both the air and the sea. While her wings were not suited for long distance travel, the Cramorant quickly flapped them as she prepared to dart through the air and snatch the Pyukumuku before <b>Stockpiling</b> to cushion their landing.</span></div>

<br />
Maskerade:</b> Humiliation hangs in the air as defeat starts to sink in; the match was over before it had really started, your teammates robbed of the chance to demonstrate their potential. While you can’t help feeling the sensei has you confused with someone else, you decide to entertain her offer – if only for a chance to salvage some lesson from the disastrous schooling. She bows farewell to her students, most dispersing to the bustling city streets while others made for the temple. With her Pokemon drawing line, she ushers you to do the same, leaving the razed battleground behind and with any luck, the lingering sense of failure.<br />
<br />
“You are welcome to call me Sensei, but my real name is Sen Hime, or Sen for short. Which is not that far from Sen<i>sei</i>, now that I think of it,” Sen has the sort of playful demeanour that many lose in their later years, wearing a smile more often than not. She makes a point to escort you past the mob of mixed martial artists, their fighting style a complete juxtaposition to her’s.<br />
<br />
“A people without the knowledge of their history is like a tree without roots,” She remarks, “Our descendants fight with the energy of the big city but they forget their ancestry; fighting for them is entertainment, where we came from it was a way of life.” She leaves you to chew on that thought as she guides you through a traditional Torii gate and into the temple grounds. You are greeted by the cloying aroma of sakura trees, blossoms coating their branches like pink frosting. The grounds were bustling with monks and spiritually inclined Pokemon, some chanting prayers while others sat in deep meditation.<br />
<br />
“This temple exists as a reminder of the old ways, our roots in Kanto. It changes like the seasons, but at its heart remains the same – come and see.” She pulls you through the tranquil bustle to an ornate pillared structure. Soft candlelight illuminates its entrance, a fog of incense attacking your senses as you gingerly approach. The room has all the typical trappings of a place of holiness, lined with statues of Pokemon held sacred in the shared lore of Kanto and Johto – leading to an odd wooden box which seems notably shabbier than the rest of the fixtures. There were all sorts of offerings piled up in front of the unusual monument, from berries to gold coins. <br />
<br />
“This shrine came from our homeland; it is not unlike the one in Johto’s Ilex Forest. Please, take a closer look.” She shoos you forward eagerly. Before you can step any further you are overcome with a strange sensation, triggered by merely locking eyes with the shrine. The feeling of inertia is not unlike that of the singularity at Dialga’s Gate. It was said that the trace energies lingered about the city to this day... but here, and now? Such thoughts were impossible to hold onto as the dizzying feeling intensifies and your vision starts to blur – memories of past, present and future playing over in your mind like a movie reel. You feel your legs give way as the ground falls from beneath your feet…<br />
<br />
<b><u>Mysterious Location</u></b><br />
<br />
You come to with a weary groan, crawling to your feet and batting away the dust. Your mouth is dry with thirst, the weather all of a sudden humid, like you had been cast into a different climate altogether. It felt like waking up from a deep slumber, your mind taking a moment to recollect what had happened the moments before sedation; Red Devil, Over Mind and Black Fist appear equally nonplussed. You were spread about a deserted street, rows of traditional Kantonian houses on either side topped with thatched, pointed roofs reminiscent of a bygone era. There was a still silence in the air, the local taverns and bath houses shuttered without a soul in sight. Beyond the street you were surrounded by rolling hills littered in autumn foliage, and not a skyscraper to be seen. It was clear you weren’t in the big city anymore.<br />
<br />
A beat of rapid footsteps breaks the silence, setting your team on high guard. The sound reaches a crescendo and a

break onto the scene, each sporting a green armband. The speed of their sprint sends the alley up in dust, the duo vaulting up onto the roof as a means of avoiding your unintended roadblock. They were gone as quick as they came, paying you no mind in their hurriedness. The noise of their footsteps against the rafters seems to stir a local proprietor out of hiding, dressed in traditional Kantonian garb and sporting a look of trepidation.<br />
<br />
“What the hell are you doing outside my tea shop? Did you not hear that we are <i>under siege</i>?!” </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: khaki">His homeland of Galar had its share of silly tales, mutts holding swords in their teeth and all that nonsense… but good ol’ Kanto had always been in a league of its own as far as mystic crap was concerned.<br />
<br />
“Nice box,” he managed to say through his teeth in a poor effort to sound respectful. From what little he’d come to know of Sen Hime, Blake doubted she would mind his lack of effort. “I mean, shrine.”<br />
<br />
As per her insistence, he approached the supposedly holy artifact, OVER MIND inclined to do the same with much more conviction than its master. BLACK FIST, too young to know the concept of “pretending to care”, rolled its eyes and yawned loudly. But then…<br />
<br />
<i>This again? I’ve felt this before… This aura…</i><br />
<br />
The Meditite felt it too, Blake could tell. A powerful energy emanated from the unassuming wooden object, something that reminded them both of…<br />
<br />
<i>Dialga?!</i><br />
<br />
Before he could make any sense of it, his head started spinning, a rush of unwanted and uninvited memories came flooding through his mind and, for some reason, he felt himself falling down into an invisible abyss…<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
“Ugh… The bloody hell was that?...”<br />
<br />
His head hurt, but for someone who’d just fallen into a void of nothingness, thankfully nothing else did. He could stand, and walk, but he couldn’t make sense of any of this.<br />
<br />
<i>We ain’t in Little Kanto anymore…</i><br />
<br />
Mercifully, all three of his companions were there with him – looking every bit as confused. Everything around them was different, alarmingly so. It was as if… all of New Fizz had suddenly been styled after that small historical center where he’d just had his ass handed to him by a cheeky old woman.<br />
<br />
Cutting his thought process short, a noise in the distance made him tense up. RED DEVIL, seemingly healed, and OVER MIND both assumed battle stances, clearly having heard it too, while BLACK FIST simply continued to look around in awe, oblivious to any commotion.<br />
Before long, a Riolu and Mienfoo came into view, running side by side at incredible speed. Barely paying them any attention, the duo casually leaped over them and continued to run along the rooftops of the funny-looking buildings, making a ruckus as they went. RED DEVIL, whose senses were the sharpest, clearly noticed the green armbands they wore, but Blake too caught a quick glimpse of a green blur as the Pokemon rushed through.<br />
<br />
“… hear that we are under siege?!”<br />
<br />
Wathcing the two Pokemon vanish into the distance, Blake only paid attention to the very last words spouted by the nearby man in a weird attire, but they were enough to peak his interest, as if everything else going on wasn’t strange enough as it were.<br />
<br />
“Oy oy, ‘scuse me mate! Yeah you, the bloke who dresses funny! The hell’s all this about some siege? And where’s Sen Hime? Old hag was ‘ere a minute ago.”<br />
<br />
OVER MIND shot him a side glance in disbelief. How much more rude could Blake be to a complete stranger?...</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><b><span style="color: rgb(247, 218, 100)">King Ghidorah:</span></b><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgb(247, 218, 100)">Enough is enough, you say to yourself. Right from the start, you have been thwarted time and time again in your earnest attempts to help a Kantonian chef fallen from grace. How can something as simple as going grocery shopping on someone’s behalf else go so spectacularly wrong at every turn? If there’s any consolation to be had, it’s that you helped a young woman follow her dreams and a whole flock of Farfetch’d find their way to freedom. But Edogawa is no closer to recreating his legendary recipe, and you can’t seem to rid yourself of the single most obnoxious Galarian man you’ve ever met (perhaps the first?) no matter where you go.<br />
<br />
So, you do the only rational thing you can at this point. You quit.<br />
<br />
<s>Congrats on finishing your adventure, I hope you had a terrible time!</s><br />
<br />
“Yes indeed, run away like the fraud you are! I cannot wait to see you and that vile man begging on the streets for Ducklett leftovers in a hopefully-near future! Culinary justice will always pre- ugh!...”<br />
<br />
A sudden loud thud cuts the man’s diatribe, followed by nothing more than complete silence. Though music to your ears, it is unquestionably curious. Part of you might hope he had a sudden stroke and bumped his head on the concrete floor, but as you turn around, you witness the next best thing.<br />
<br />
“Faaar…”<br />
<br />
The Galarian gentleman lies on the floor face down, knees bent as if in prayer, but in reality knocked out cold. On his head rests a big leafy stalk, held firmly by a black wing. A familiar-looking Galarian Farfetch’d looks straight at you with a nonchalant expression, not moving one inch from its spot!<br />
The two heavy bags filled to the brim with berries, which the man had hoarded to prevent you from buying them, have been dropped to the ground, some of the precious fruits scattered all about. But as you move to grab them, Farfetch’d finally decides to move, blocking your path with its weapon!<br />
<br />
“Fetch’d!”<br />
<br />
It seems that, in return for defending your honor, the bird is now looking to collect – having been separated from its lifelong rival in their newfound freedom, it would appear Farfetch’d is in search of a new one. And in true knightly fashion, it won’t just let you swoop in and steal something that was – regardless of intentions – rightfully purchased: it’s time to prove your worth!<br />

<br />
<span style="color: deeppink">Myahoo:</span></b><span style="color: deeppink"> Inches from <i>GAME OVER</i> you are handed a lifeline in the form of an unusual power up; somewhere deep within the enemy’s subconscious you had an ally, enabling Rotom to hack into the matrix and even the odds some. With the elemental beam about to raze your entire team from existence, Hint sets his grow spurt into motion without delay. His antenna looks more like a radio tower as he meets the foe’s colossal stature, electric ectoplasm emanating from his body like an immense thundercloud. <br />
<br />
With the <b>Tri-Attack</b> fully charged Hint has a split second to deliver a decisive <b>Sucker Punch</b>, disrupting the foe's aim and sending the technicolour beam hurtling into empty space. You are given a much needed moment of respite as the two giants prepare their follow up assault, the cybernetic kaiju <b>Locking On</b> to its target while Hint <b>Charges</b> his batteries, sparks the size of lightning bolts flying from his exterior, shoring up his special defences. With a slight speed advantage Rotom is first to break into attack, letting loose his excess electricity. The <b>Thunderbolt</b> cuts crazy zig zag patterns against the black canvas, followed hotly by a cracking boom. The Porygon-Z reels as the sparks run up and down its body, its seizure intensifying from the sizeable hit. The enemy isn’t about to let up, lifting its ovoid limbs to form a <b>Shadowy Ball</b> which it sends careening forward. Hint is given no chance to dodge due to the foe’s advanced targeting, the projectile socking him point blank for a devastating blow! While the clash of titans was only just getting under way, it is clear Porgyon-Z has gained a slight early lead. You’ll have to pull out all the stops to pull the game back. What will you do?</span></span><br />

<span style="color: khaki"><span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Mysterious Location</u><br />
<br />
Maskerade:</b> Being flung through space and time only one thing was clear... you weren’t in Little Kanto anymore. The befuddlement is only exacerbated as a pair of passing Pokemon leave you choking in their dust, drawing the attention of a grumpy old proprietor. He studies you with a furrowed brow, the elder’s name eliciting a huff on his part.<br />
<br />
“Sen Hime?! I assume she is safe behind the fortifications of her castle – you should watch how you speak of a child of noble birth!” Your words seem to leave a nasty taste in the villager’s mouth; he seems all too content in returning to his safe refuge and leaving you to contend with the impending invasion alone, until he hesitates at his doorframe.<br />
<br />
“Come inside. We may not be warriors, but the people of Celadon are not the sort to turn our back on a stranger, especially in a time of war.” You gather there must be some legitimacy in his cause for concern for him to be so insistent on helping you, and his invitation does come with a chance to get to the bottom of this unravelling mystery. Brushing the dust away you follow him through the sliding doors to a traditional tearoom, decked with quaint floral arrangements and traditional ink paintings. There are no seats to speak of but small alcoves featuring thick, woven straw mats where it was custom for patrons to kneel, the accompanying tables standing no more than a foot off the ground. The elder offers you a pew as he sets a teapot to boil. <br />
<br />
“So tell me, which province are you from? You speak with an unusual tongue and you are clearly not one of the warlord’s men – the Saffron soldiers wouldn’t be caught dead in your unusual garb.” It was difficult to know how to play such a strange situation, the prickly stranger’s offer of refuge from whatever war was waging in the village was tantalising, but perhaps your time was better spent actively searching for a way back home. Will you stay for tea and gather intel, or head back out to the dangerous streets?</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: lightseagreen"><b><u>Cape Effervescence</u></b></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: lightseagreen"><b>SpinyShell:</b> With oxygen stores ticking away there was just one thing keeping you from the surface, an undead coral with a score to settle. You quickly rally your Pokemon into defensive manoeuvres with the hope that, once calmed down, the Corsola could perhaps be reasoned with. The task would prove easier said than done as the pair of Water-types snapped back with a <b>Liquidated</b> assault, the hardy foe shouldering the hits with relative ease before <b>Sapping</b> away their <b>Strength</b> and replenishing its health back to full. With a sinister grin it continued its widespread assault, bleached hide flickering blinding white as <b>Powerful Gemstones</b> burst outward. Lime and Stone wince against the pelting while Dewy lets out an high pitch screech, hanging on by the skin of his teeth.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: lightseagreen">“I think we’re outmatched…” Atla exclaims with a look of pure dread. While her form had bleached and crumbled, harbouring a decade long grudge had left her mind more powerful than ever, albeit completely unhinged. With a loud rumble the tail end of the ship begins to shift from behind the Corsola as her <b>Psychic</b> powers begin to manisfest.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: lightseagreen"><i>Do you know how it feels like to have the life squeezed from out of you?</i><br />
<br />
With a look of intense concentration, the Corsola heaves tonnes of iron from the sandy seabed like it is weightless, sand running off its corroded surface as it rises from its slumber. She was about to bring your nightmare to life, having revenge on humankind in the most poetic way imaginable. You are unsure whether to fight or flee at this point, until you catch something wriggling in the corner of your eye… the shifting sand had seemingly unearthed something from the seabed: a clump of seaweed, tugging against what looked like an anchor wrought red with rust. Having been trapped beneath the vessel for years it was making feeble attempts to wrestle free, but appeared to be missing something... What will you do?<br />
<br />
<b>Faiyaa:</b> Pickle was in a real pickle. Sent hurtling toward the heavens and back down at an even greater pace, you have just a few precious seconds to break her fall. Thinking on your feet you bring Artemis onto the scene, built for this sort of mission as young as she was; the species had an innate knack for getting a moving prey into their gullet and a rescue of this nature would be no different. With a squawk she took to the skies and made a beeline for her freefalling teammate. It seems an impossible distance to cover but she folds her wing feathers to break into a swift glide, opening her maw in preparation for the catch. In the nick of time the Cramorant successfully intercepts, the Pyukumuku lodging safely in her gullet. The impact is enough to knock her out of flight, breast puffing up as she <b>Stockpiles</b> energy to cushion the fall. To your relief the pair land safely against the sand, the light shock enough to dislodge Pickle from Artimis’ throat. <b><i>Artemis gains one level!</i></b><br />
<br />
“Way to go, li'l bird!” Elijah and Renee were jumping with enthusiasm, the wider mob of beachgoers breaking into applause. Your work wasn’t over just yet though, Pickle just as quickly returning to her Wail’ washing post with a renewed sense of caution. To your relief there are no further hiccups and it’s not long until the beached blimp is looking good as new. <i><b>Pickle gains two levels!</b></i> With the Wailord settling down and the wider rescue team seemingly satisfied with the clean-up effort, they begin making preparations for the next phase of the plan.<br />
<br />
“I’ll bring the boat around and meet you in the shallows, then we’ll escort it out to the ocean and see if there’s anything else we’re needed for out there.” Renee calls her Dewott over while Corsola waddles to Elijah’s flank, the siblings about to head to the nearby jetty. “You okay doing what you gotta do to get the Wailord into the water?” </span></span></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: khaki">Blake’s eyebrow rose instinctively. How was he the one who dressed “unusually”? Coming from some guy who dressed like he was in a bloody medieval fair, no less?<br />
<br />
He felt a sudden urge to shake the man violently and order him to stop playing games, but something about all this was off in how… “right” it felt. Like none of this was staged. The props were too realistic, and especially the attention paid to the outdoors scenario. And what had the man just said?<br />
<br />
“… Celadon?”<br />
<br />
And some nonsense about Sne Him being a young girl in a castle? He struggled not to give away his confusion. If he was being played, well, he had an Infernape next to him, so the charade was only going to go so far until the other man realized he could end up hurt, hopefully. And if all of this was somehow real, well…<br />
<br />
“Beg your pardon for askin’, but I seem to have hit my head pretty hard a little while ago. What year is this again, and why are you, uh… “under siege”?...”<br />
<br />
He tried his hardest to sound natural. But between the weird effect the shrine had on him, the old hag’s disappearance, the sudden change of scenario and this talk of war between Celadon and Saffron, thousands of miles away from New Fizz City… There was only so much an old Gym Leader like him could interpret on his own before flipping out. He’d always punched better than he talked, and only Arceus knew how badly he wanted to punch someone right now.</span></div>

<br />
<span style="color: rgb(247, 218, 100)">Enough is enough, you say to yourself. Right from the start, you have been thwarted time and time again in your earnest attempts to help a Kantonian chef fallen from grace. How can something as simple as going grocery shopping on someone’s behalf else go so spectacularly wrong at every turn? If there’s any consolation to be had, it’s that you helped a young woman follow her dreams and a whole flock of Farfetch’d find their way to freedom. But Edogawa is no closer to recreating his legendary recipe, and you can’t seem to rid yourself of the single most obnoxious Galarian man you’ve ever met (perhaps the first?) no matter where you go.<br />
<br />
So, you do the only rational thing you can at this point. You quit.<br />
<br />
<s>Congrats on finishing your adventure, I hope you had a terrible time!</s><br />
<br />
“Yes indeed, run away like the fraud you are! I cannot wait to see you and that vile man begging on the streets for Ducklett leftovers in a hopefully-near future! Culinary justice will always pre- ugh!...”<br />
<br />
A sudden loud thud cuts the man’s diatribe, followed by nothing more than complete silence. Though music to your ears, it is unquestionably curious. Part of you might hope he had a sudden stroke and bumped his head on the concrete floor, but as you turn around, you witness the next best thing.<br />
<br />
“Faaar…”<br />
<br />
The Galarian gentleman lies on the floor face down, knees bent as if in prayer, but in reality knocked out cold. On his head rests a big leafy stalk, held firmly by a black wing. A familiar-looking Galarian Farfetch’d looks straight at you with a nonchalant expression, not moving one inch from its spot!<br />
The two heavy bags filled to the brim with berries, which the man had hoarded to prevent you from buying them, have been dropped to the ground, some of the precious fruits scattered all about. But as you move to grab them, Farfetch’d finally decides to move, blocking your path with its weapon!<br />
<br />
“Fetch’d!”<br />
<br />
It seems that, in return for defending your honor, the bird is now looking to collect – having been separated from its lifelong rival in their newfound freedom, it would appear Farfetch’d is in search of a new one. And in true knightly fashion, it won’t just let you swoop in and steal something that was – regardless of intentions – rightfully purchased: it’s time to prove your worth!<br />

<br />
HALLELUJAH.<br />
<br />
REJOICE.<br />
<br />
You couldn’t describe Hugo’s feeling as anything short of total euphoric elation. The old loudmouth had <i>finally</i> shut the hell up, and had done so in a fairly violent and well-deserved manner. Hugo wanted to be the one to do it, but he need not risk his own hide once again in New Fizz City. So the sound of the Galarian Farfetch’d leak colliding with the man’s skull was music to Hugo’s ears. And the berries. Well, there they were, ripe for picking. <br />
<br />
But not so fast. The Galarian Farfetch’d, as they were notoriously known, was a bird of honor, after all. While it was clear Farfetch’d realized the “gentleman” was a total blowhard, it was also not about to allow Hugo to simply collect on work he did not do. Hugo was apparently still going to have to prove himself, not to his constant foil, but to Farfetch’d himself.<br />
<br />
Without saying a word, Hugo nodded in both understanding and as a sign of respect. “If that’s how this needs to be,” he thought to himself, “then so be it. It’s the least I can do, after all.”<br />
<br />
He pondered for a moment, which partner should he choose? Farfetch’d of the Galar Region were quite different from their standard counterparts. Despite being a bird, they had shed their Flying-type for Fighting. Hugo had an idea.<br />
<br />
He grabbed a Luxury Ball from his waist and released Zubat. The Poison-type emerged, fluttering skittishly about in the evening air. The Farfetch’d seem unmoved, only eyeing the bat as she flapped about. <br />
<br />
“Okay,” Hugo said to his quacking opposition. “You want this? Then let’s do it.”<br />
<br />
He took his position opposite the duck, Zubat between them.<br />
<br />
“Zubat! <b>Aerial Ace</b>! And follow it up with <b>Supersonic</b>!”</span></div>

Lilbluecorsola:</b> Faced with a choice of reprimanding or embracing her missing girls, the Drifloon decides on neither. She shrinks down to the size of a blueberry and vanishes into the background, a fly on the wall able to gather intel on the Sinistea without risk of spoiling the child’s play. While nonplussed at first, the cleft cup goes back to conversing with the girls who remain none the wiser. <br />
<br />
<i>‘Ahem. More tea, Ms. Cake, Ms. Cake?’ </i>it asks in mock elegance, eliciting giggles down table. The balloon spies on the play for some time, listening into all sorts of light chit chat. The small talk eventually moves onto the Sinistea’s history with the Patisserie’s proprietors, the balloon’s ears piquing with interest.<br />
<br />
<i>‘The poor papa and mama lost their boy. That’s why I moved in upstairs, I gotta stay until I fulfill my purpose!’ </i>Before it can reveal what said purpose was, a ding from the kitchen oven interrupts their conversation, signalling the completion of a bake foreshadowed in their nursery rhyme. While Patty offers to fetch the dessert she had so dutifully assembled, the <b>Poltergeist</b> obliges with their shadowy levitation trick. <br />

</i></b>. While the presentation was on the sloppy side, it came with a surprisingly delectable aroma, although having seen the state of the kitchen it was sourced from is almost enough to draw the balloon out of hiding. Before the kids can even cut into the cake, a loud rap startles them from their seats. There was a forceful wrestle with the door and upon realising it is bolted closed, a mob of ghouls phase on through anyway; it was a Gastly, Haunter and Gengar, all topped with a fedora and wicked smiles stretching from ear to ear.<br />
<br />
<i>‘Well lookie here’, </i>the Gengar sneers,<i> ‘You think you can just open a business in the underworld without tellin’ nobody?’ </i>The mobsters scan the premises for an authoritative presence and upon realising there is none, dawn on the children with toothy grins.<i> ‘Let’s see here… a teacup, a candle, and a Pikachu cosplayer?’ </i>Gengar’s lackies erupt into laughter. <br />
<br />
<i>‘They don’t make ‘em like they used to!’</i> Chuckled the Gastly.<br />
<br />
‘<i>Who do you think you’re talkin’ to!’</i> the cup squeaked in a fleeting moment of courage, their voice cracking as they raised it, only eliciting more laughter.<br />
<br />
<i>‘So you’re the boss around here?’</i> Gengar goads, his tone taking a more menacing turn, <i>‘A fancy place like this, you’re gonna need to cough up some protection money, or we don’t need to tell ya what’ll happen…’ </i>the racketeers circled in on the trembling cup, Gastly baring its fangs menacingly while Haunter pumped a floating fist into a floating palm. What will the minimised mom do?</span></span>

<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: RGB(71, 85, 119)">More confused than concerned by the menacing mother's bizarre behavior, the sentient beverage blinked in bewilderment as it watched the petite party balloon sail up to the ceiling, bemusedly shrugging its handle before returning attention to its blissfully ignorant audience.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Ahem. More tea, Ms. Cake, Ms. Cake?&quot;</i><br />
<br />
It politely offered, putting on a pretend posh accent. The girls giggled as they gladly accepted refills on their drinks, continuing on with the conversation they had clearly been in the middle of when their unknown eavesdropper arrived. Shamelessly eager to listen in on her children's idle chitchat, Blue thus craned in closer, especially curious as the dialogue turned to the stranger's relation to the café owners above ground.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;The poor papa and mama lost their boy. That’s why I moved in upstairs, I gotta stay until I fulfill my purpose!&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Before it could elaborate further though, a chime from the other room announced the completion of the cake aforementioned in the teacup's tune. Patty clapped her hands in delight, ready to witness the results of her handiwork.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Oh, there's the cake done! Thanks so much for letting me use your kitchen; Mom never lets me near the stove without supervision, especially when making food for guests... She still doesn't think I can cook on my own, but I want to practice so I can prove to her I can make something good to serve customers too...&quot;</i><br />
<br />
The Drifloon deflated slightly upon hearing how hard her daughter was working in secret to try and impress her, guilt growing in her conscience as the candle offered to retrieve the baked confection from the convection oven herself, but her host shook its head with a smile. Showing off its own specialty, the dark slab of plum dessert came magically floating in on a silver plate, depositing on the tablecloth with a whimsical flourish like an enchanted scene out of a Disney movie. While the bloated block appeared a bit plain and lopsided (perhaps resembling a chunk of solid brick rather than something edible), a surprisingly delicious aroma arose from the dish up towards the roof where the Drifloon was hiding. (Although remembering the sorry - if not highly unsanitary - state of the facilities the sweet stemmed from nearly drew her out for a different reason.)<br />
<br />
Just as Patty was about to proudly slice into her masterpiece to provide sufficiently large sample portions for the patient taste testers, a loud sudden banging at the entry startled the three out of their seats. Someone seemed to be forcibly trying to turn the knob from outside to no avail, and upon realizing the door was barred shut the intruders simply ghosted through instead, grinning mischievously as the trio of gangsters tipped their fedoras in mock greeting.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Well lookie here,&quot;</i> the leader Gengar sniggered, glancing around the mostly empty setting as it sought to pinpoint the source of the scrumptious scent. <i>&quot;You think you can just open a business in the underworld without tellin’ nobody?&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Taking in the images of the terrified tots at the table, the group guffawed at such a pitiful sight.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Let’s see here… a teacup, a candle, and a Pikachu cosplayer?&quot;</i> The Gengar snickered again, as Mimi took particular offense to being called a pale imitation of her idol (who more accurately was only at a pre-evo stage to begin with).<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;They don’t make ‘em like they used to!&quot;</i> Its Gastly lackey cackled in contempt, as the first target of the insult puffed up bravely in order to defend its newfound friends.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Who do you think you’re talkin’ to!&quot;</i><br />
<br />
It piped up with as much bold pluck as it could muster, pitch unfortunately cracking like its rim in the process. The mug squeaked meekly in embarrassment as the elder ethereals merely burst into derisive mirth again.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;So you’re the boss around here?&quot;</i> Gengar grilled with an intimidating leer, its interrogee shrinking in fear under its ominous shadow. <i>&quot;A fancy place like this, you’re gonna need to cough up some protection money, or we don’t need to tell ya what’ll happen…&quot;</i><br />
<br />
The three threatening ghouls encroached on their prey, Gastly revealing its glistening teeth whilst the silent bruiser Haunter beside it smacked a disembodied fist into its palm. As the cup cowered with dread, Blue bristled crossly, deciding enough was enough; it was time to break up this fight before the poor little beaker got beaten. How dare these delinquents gang up on a small, defenseless child? She would teach them a lesson to pick on someone their own size... Or so she thought, as she charged at the Gengar in rage only to bounce harmlessly back, barely impacting beyond a mosquito bite - or at best a pea shooter - absently swatted away without even being noticed by anyone amidst all the tension.<br />
<br />
Mimi, on the other hand, was about to make her own ire known as her eyes glowed with fury like burning hot coals, wriggling serpentine shades seeping from beneath her cloak as she couldn't stand to see her companion in distress.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;No. Bully. My. Friend.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
She hissed, beginning to angrily approach the mob; but Patty held onto her sister's rag, staying the Mimikyu's wrath momentarily as she raised a finger to her lips, mutely indicating to shush and keep calm for now (as well as distant for the baby's own safety).<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Wait, I've got a plan,&quot;</i> she whispered quietly. <i>&quot;Can you use <b>VOODOO BUGALOO</b> to make a copy of Gengar? I'll hold onto it and <b>ALLY SWITCH</b> into the center, then use <b>CONFUSE RAY</b> to trick them into thinking they're still attacking us when really they're hitting the doll. I'm also gonna blow a <b>SMOG</b> as cover so we can escape, so stay clear until I give the signal for the two of you to hold your breath and run, okay?&quot;</i></span></span></span></div>

<span style="color: lightseagreen"><b>SpinyShell:</b> With oxygen stores ticking away there was just one thing keeping you from the surface, an undead coral with a score to settle. You quickly rally your Pokemon into defensive manoeuvres with the hope that, once calmed down, the Corsola could perhaps be reasoned with. The task would prove easier said than done as the pair of Water-types snapped back with a <b>Liquidated</b> assault, the hardy foe shouldering the hits with relative ease before <b>Sapping</b> away their <b>Strength</b> and replenishing its health back to full. With a sinister grin it continued its widespread assault, bleached hide flickering blinding white as <b>Powerful Gemstones</b> burst outward. Lime and Stone wince against the pelting while Dewy lets out an high pitch screech, hanging on by the skin of his teeth.<br />
<br />
“I think we’re outmatched…” Atla exclaims with a look of pure dread. While her form had bleached and crumbled, harbouring a decade long grudge had left her mind more powerful than ever, albeit completely unhinged. With a loud rumble the tail end of the ship begins to shift from behind the Corsola as her <b>Psychic</b> powers begin to manisfest.<br />
<br />
<i>Do you know how it feels like to have the life squeezed from out of you?</i><br />
<br />
With a look of intense concentration, the Corsola heaves tonnes of iron from the sandy seabed like it is weightless, sand running off its corroded surface as it rises from its slumber. She was about to bring your nightmare to life, having revenge on humankind in the most poetic way imaginable. You are unsure whether to fight or flee at this point, until you catch something wriggling in the corner of your eye… the shifting sand had seemingly unearthed something from the seabed: a clump of seaweed, tugging against what looked like an anchor wrought red with rust. Having been trapped beneath the vessel for years it was making feeble attempts to wrestle free, but appeared to be missing something... What will you do?</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: rgb(32, 178, 170)">The duo, or, more accurately, trio of Water types charged at the creepy coral, smacking into it in a <b>Liquidation </b>assault in the hopes that they might knock some sense into her. The Corsola was thrown across the seafloor, but tanked the hits nonetheless, shaking them off with a fiendish look on her face as her ethereal branches glowed pink. <b>Sapping </b>the <b>Strength </b>from Limestone and Dewy like an undersea vampire, the Corsola healed away the damage the two sea dwellers had just dealt her. Her vigor restored, a mad wicked grin spread across her rocky face as she began to approach them. Glowing white gemstones erupted from the seafloor as her body flashed blinding white, a flurry of sand thrown up by the currents, obscuring the ghostly Pokémon so that only her beady red eyes could be seen, glowing through the haze.<br />
<br />
Sil drew a breath and anxiously balled her fist, waiting for whatever the Corsola would launch at them. Several tense moments passed, Dewy and Limestone too nervous to try and strike the Corsola shrouded by the sand cloud. And then, like glittering meteors, the <b>Powerful Gemstones </b>burst from the cloud, scattering the sand as they sped towards the opposing Water types. Lime and Stone winced as the rocks scraped across their rocky hide while Dewy let out an agonized screech. The water spider looked to be on the brink, several deep cuts and scrapes from the jewels visible on its frail limbs. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #20b2aa">“I think we’re outmatched…” Atla said, her voice full of dread. Sil looked towards the surface, wondering if she could possibly reach Hailstone, but as she turned back to the manic coral, she realized that even a four-on-one with the igloo shrew included was still an uneven fight--in the Corsola’s favor. It seemed that years and years of harboring her grudge had increased her <span style="font-size: 15px">strength</span>--including her mental capacities--tenfold. Her body overflowing with </span><b><span style="color: rgb(32, 178, 170)">Psychic </span></b><span style="color: #20b2aa">power, she held up her stubby legs as the rusted ship began to shift and shake.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgb(32, 178, 170)"><i>Do you know how it feels like to have the life squeezed from out of you?</i><br />
<br />
A furrow appeared on the Corsola’s rocky visage as she began to concentrate, the hefty boat rising ominously out of the depths, sand trickling down the metallic leviathan’s rotted hide. It seemed unreal, like a scene out of a movie. But this wasn’t a movie. This was a nightmare brought to life, and it seemed like they were running out of options to wake up. Sil was too caught up in the panic, unable to decide whether to fight or flight. As she frantically looked around for anything that could give them an edge, something caught her eye. It appeared to be a rusted anchor, wrapped in seaweed, desperately struggling to free itself from underneath the boat. It looked like a certain Pokémon… a familiar Pokémon...<br />
<br />
“Atla… Atla give me that compass you found! I think that anchor thing over there is a Dhelmise--and I think your compass is its eye!” Sil cried. She then turned to Dewy and Limestone. &quot;Do you think you guys could get the compass to that anchor over there?&quot;<br />
<br />
She hoped this would work. </span></div>

Still, the task at hand is simple and straightforward enough - if you want the Berries, to at least have <i>something</i> to give Edogawa, you're going to have to earn them.<br />
<br />
You call out your Zubat, a fast and nimble Pokemon that might just be ideal to counter Farfetch'd and its more sluggish movements as well as counter its Type. The bird, however, remains unfazed at the sight of your choice of partner, firmly gripping its vegetable sword like a two-handed claymore. Its eyes narrow, and the battle is on!<br />
Zubat strikes first, dive bombing towards the floor before making a sharp turn at the last second and speeding mere inches above the floor straight toward Farfetch'd, a difficult flight pattern more resembling a swallow than a bat. Owing to its swift nature, the move is supposedly unavoidable, but Farfetch'd eyes remain narrow and fixed on the incoming threat, allowing it to <b>Detect</b> the upwards strike that follows at the last second - in a rather impressive and anatomically improbable display of skill, the bird bends backwards, bridging its body as if it were a movie stunt, and Zubat flies past it, ever-so-narrowly missing the mark!<br />
<br />
Farfetch'd attempts to capitalize on the surprise dodge to hold Zubat for a <b>Brutal Swing</b>, but by the time it regains its posture to perform the grab, your Pokemon has already flown out of range. The flightless bird can't follow, and Zubat retaliates with a high-pitched soundwave that induces a powerful migraine on Farfetch'd; its eyes glaze over and the warrior seems completely out of it...<br />
Suddenly, before you can mount any sort of offense, something hits your Zubat from <i>behind</i>.

<br />
Jumping into the fray with its katana-like leek in its mouth, the Kantonian variant you also set free - and bitter rival to your current opponent - looks to fight <i>alongside</i> its lifelong enemy! The smaller, quicker Farfetch'd looks at Zubat and then at you, greeting you with a challenging grin. But why? And what are you going to do now, in this unexpected 2-on-1 scenario?</span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: khaki">Hugo was a bit surprised to see the return of the Kantonian Farfetch’d as well. Despite what appeared to be on the surface a very bitter rivalry with no love lost, it seemed that the two birds harbored respect for one another, to the point of coming to each other’s defense. Knight and samurai, samurai and knight. They came from two different worlds, but at their heart, much of what they stood for was the same and it appears they have chosen to stand together in this.<br />
<br />
While Hugo could respect their sense of honor, he still had berries to collect. So what was one more duck, at the end of the day? If he could go through one, he could go through two.<br />
<br />
Zubat, of course, would not be able to handle both Farfetch’d on her own, however. While she carried certain advantages over the Galarian Farfetch’d, many of those dissipated in comparison to the Kantonian Farfetch’d. Hugo needed balance. What Zubat provided in terms of speed and evasiveness, Hugo decided he would need to make up for with pure, brute strength. With Zubat caught between the two ducks (one of which seeming a bit dazed thanks to Supersonic), he tossed a Pokeball in the center.<br />
<br />
Croconaw emerged. The Water-type faced the Kantonian Farfetch’d, its head tilted downwards but its eyes locked on the bird. And the eyes hated. Zubat remained focused on the Galarian counterpart.<br />
<br />
“So,” Hugo said, addressing the Kantonian Farfetch’d, “you want to be the hero. Well in that case, you’ll have to slay the beast.”<br />
<br />
Croconaw, without moving, glanced its eyes toward its trainer.<br />
<br />
“Do it.”<br />
<br />
Without missing a beat, Croconaw slammed one foot on the ground and let out a ferocious roar, before immediately becoming engulfed in a white glow. <br />
<br />

But it was Feraligatr that emerged. The beast snarled hungrily at the bird before him. The struggle between waterfowl and crocodilians continues. <br />
<br />
“ZUBAT! Go after the Galarian one! Hit it with <b>Wing Attack</b>! Hit it with <b>Zen Headbutt</b>!”<br />
<br />
“FERLIGATR! Take the other one! <b>ICE FANG</b>! <b>IRON TAIL!</b>”</span></div>

<span style="color: rgb(247, 218, 100)">Deciding to even the odds, and then some, you send out a ravenous Croconaw into the the field, which promptly removes the self-imposed lock on its potential to achieve its true form.<br />
<br />
The Kantonian Farfetch'd glances sideways at its dazed companion, and in a somewhat unexpected display of selflessness, moves to position itself between its Galarian counterpart and the two foes before them. Zubat strikes first, the nimbler of your two Pokemon, but while it takes aim at the Confused enemy, the Kantonian samurai's positioning makes it impossible to land a direct hit. Instead, the Wing Attack is blocked expertly by an upwards swing of the katana-like Leek - an expert <b>Aerial Ace</b> even Zubat could stand to learn from - while the subsequent Zen Headbutt manages to hit, but once again the wrong Farfetch'd, who continues to shield its ally.<br />
<br />
Feraligatr growls ominously; unlike Zubat it doesn't have to worry about the roadblock, because its target <i>is</i> the Kantonian Pokemon. Seeing it reel back from the bat's headbutt, the apex predator moves in for the kill. Surprisingly agile for its size, Feraligatr dashes toward the stunned Farfetch'd, fangs glowing white; Farfetch'd's superior Inner Focus allows it to regain composure at the last second, however, though all it can muster is to kick up a cloud of dust into the incoming beast's eyes. The haphazard <b>Sand Attack</b> proves invaluable, however, causing the temporarily blinded Water Type to narrowly miss its murderous bite! Still, a vicious swing of its iron-like tail sweeps the Kantonian Farfetch'd, striking it in the chest and sending it flying and crashing into the still-dazed Galarian variant.<br />
<br />
Snapped out of its confusion from the sudden impact, the black-feather knight rises to its feet and stares in disbelief at the fainted rival at its feet. Quickly putting two and two together, a flame of revenge ignites in its eyes. Its body becomes engulfed in harsh light and, as if cloaked in divine light, it suddenly dashes straight at Feraligatr, the surprise <b>Sky Attack</b> hitting the much larger foe and dealing critical damage! Still, even the almighty blow fueled by rage isn't enough to knock out the fundamentally much stronger Water-Type, and the gasping Galarian Farfetch'd is still left facing two opponents in the end.<br />
<br />
Enjoy overwhelmingly favourable odds now, what will you do? Is it time for the <i>coup de grâce</i>?</span></div>

<b><span style="color: rgb(247, 218, 100)">King Ghidorah:</span></b><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgb(247, 218, 100)">Deciding to even the odds, and then some, you send out a ravenous Croconaw into the the field, which promptly removes the self-imposed lock on its potential to achieve its true form.<br />
<br />
The Kantonian Farfetch'd glances sideways at its dazed companion, and in a somewhat unexpected display of selflessness, moves to position itself between its Galarian counterpart and the two foes before them. Zubat strikes first, the nimbler of your two Pokemon, but while it takes aim at the Confused enemy, the Kantonian samurai's positioning makes it impossible to land a direct hit. Instead, the Wing Attack is blocked expertly by an upwards swing of the katana-like Leek - an expert <b>Aerial Ace</b> even Zubat could stand to learn from - while the subsequent Zen Headbutt manages to hit, but once again the wrong Farfetch'd, who continues to shield its ally.<br />
<br />
Feraligatr growls ominously; unlike Zubat it doesn't have to worry about the roadblock, because its target <i>is</i> the Kantonian Pokemon. Seeing it reel back from the bat's headbutt, the apex predator moves in for the kill. Surprisingly agile for its size, Feraligatr dashes toward the stunned Farfetch'd, fangs glowing white; Farfetch'd's superior Inner Focus allows it to regain composure at the last second, however, though all it can muster is to kick up a cloud of dust into the incoming beast's eyes. The haphazard <b>Sand Attack</b> proves invaluable, however, causing the temporarily blinded Water Type to narrowly miss its murderous bite! Still, a vicious swing of its iron-like tail sweeps the Kantonian Farfetch'd, striking it in the chest and sending it flying and crashing into the still-dazed Galarian variant.<br />
<br />
Snapped out of its confusion from the sudden impact, the black-feather knight rises to its feet and stares in disbelief at the fainted rival at its feet. Quickly putting two and two together, a flame of revenge ignites in its eyes. Its body becomes engulfed in harsh light and, as if cloaked in divine light, it suddenly dashes straight at Feraligatr, the surprise <b>Sky Attack</b> hitting the much larger foe and dealing critical damage! Still, even the almighty blow fueled by rage isn't enough to knock out the fundamentally much stronger Water-Type, and the gasping Galarian Farfetch'd is still left facing two opponents in the end.<br />
<br />
Enjoy overwhelmingly favourable odds now, what will you do? Is it time for the <i>coup de grâce</i>?</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: khaki">”We don’t have to do this!” Hugo yelled to his quacky opponent. “YIELD!”<br />
<br />
He knew that would get him nowhere, however. The duck duo were rooted in principle; there would be no giving up. Hugo would have to go through them. And he knew that’s how they wanted it anyway. <br />
<br />
They were proving to be a formidable pair, though. Despite Zubat’s speed and Feraligatr’s power, they were managing parry each blow as best as they could. Were they not both such deft combatants, Hugo would have made quick work of them. But it was evident that their time training together – and against – one another had created a strong chemistry between them. Their battling styles complemented each other very well. Perhaps he could get one of them (or both…) to join his side when all was said and done.<br />
<br />
But all complimenting aside, Hugo was in this to win it at this point. He was certainly grateful to have the old bastard silenced, but he was not going to let this opportunity slip through his fingers. <br />
<br />
He stared down the Galarian Farfetch’d. He had landed a substantial Sky Attack on Feraligatr, but he seemed to be getting a bit gassed. Two-on-one was never easy, even for the most skilled warriors.<br />
<br />
“Have it your way, then,” Hugo announced. “Zubat, go after it with <b>Brave Bird</b> and then recover with <b>Roost!</b>”<br />
<br />
Feraligatr stood by, waiting for his command almost motionless, in that really creepy way that alligators do right before they launch for the attack.<br />
<br />
“Feraligatr, power up with <b>Dragon Dance</b> and then bring down the <b>Waterfall!</b>”</span></div>

<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: khaki">Hugo was having second thoughts about…well, everything. He had initially wanted to help Edogawa, who he felt had hit some hard times but deep down, had the right intentions. Now, not so much. Alcoholism was a disease; that much Hugo knew for sure. But that doesn’t give alcoholics free reign to be asses to the rest of us. Actions do have consequences. Edogawa claimed this was going to restore his honor…but how, exactly? He makes food people want to eat, but then immediately eliminates any goodwill he developed with more drunken nonsense? And besides, as much as Hugo <i>hated</i> the food critic, taking the berries from him was stealing; there was no other way to phrase it. And where exactly is the honor in that? <br />
<br />
And at what cost would it come? Of everyone involved in this tangled mess of a situation, only the Farfetch’d seemed to have any shred of humanity (ironic, no?) that deserved Hugo’s help. Handing them over to Edogawa was certain death. They didn’t deserve that, certainly not for Edogawa or for the food critic, and he had promised to help get them out of this meat market. Besides, they came back to help him; could he really just leave them now?<br />
<br />
“Mr. Edogawa, I’m sorry, but this business relationship we have going on here, it’s just not going to work out,” Hugo said, his voice full of disdain. “The berries are there. Sure. You’re right. But I didn’t buy them. He did.” Hugo gestured vaguely at the critic, still unconscious probably. “Taking them now would be <i>theft</i>,” he said, emphasizing the last word just a bit louder in case anyone was nearby to hear. “I haven’t touched them. And I’m not going to touch them. I’m not your mule. If you want them, you can steal them yourself.”<br />
<br />
He looked back at the Farfetch’d pile.<br />
<br />
“As for the birds, well, they’re already criminals.” This was true; they assaulted the Galarian, unprovoked. Hugo had not asked them to, so technically he was not responsible for their actions. “They beat this man into the ground, and I need to see that they get what they deserve. Consider this a citizen’s arrest. The birds are and will remain in <i>my</i> custody. You can try and take them…”<br />
<br />
Zubat let out an ear-piercing screech. Feraligatr glared at the cook, licking his crocodilian lips hungrily. Right on cue.<br />
<br />
“…but I wouldn’t, if I were you.”<br />
<br />
Hugo positioned himself and his Pokemon, shielding the Farfetch’d from Edogawa.<br />
<br />
“I genuinely am sorry that I couldn’t help you, Edogawa. But the help that you need is much greater than what I can provide. I hope you someday you get it, but I’m not going to let anyone else get hurt.”<br />
<br />
He took the pouch containing the money that Edogawa had given him and tossed it back at the man’s feet.<br />
<br />
“Now you need to leave.”</span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: khaki">Hugo really needed to work on making friends. Or being a better judge of character. Actually, both.<br />
<br />
Edogawa was pretty inebriated at this point, as he made abundantly clear. But Hugo didn’t know if that intensified or neutralized his threat level. Sure, it may hinder his ability to form a coherent strategy, but it can also just make him more reckless and dangerous. Especially considering he had unleashed two fairly powerful Pokemon in his defense.<br />
<br />
Through Hugo’s experiences with his own Muk, as well as what he knew about Snorlaxes, both were known for being bulky but also for their fairly diverse movepool. Hugo would have to hit them hard, but also be prepared for any number of counterattacks they could retaliate with. Feraligatr could match either of them, but Zubat? She was fast, but much smaller in comparison. Could she fare against them? Well, I guess we would find out. Her aggressive fluttering and hissing toward the opposition made it very clear that she was not intending to sit this one out. Feraligatr, meanwhile, stared down the Snorlax with hunger in his eyes. So. Much. Meat.<br />
<br />
“Alright then,” Hugo said to Edogawa, his voice barely above a whisper. “I guess we’re going to have to do this the hard way.”<br />
<br />
“Zubat! The Muk! Hit with <b>Aerial Ace</b>! Hit it with <b>Zen Headbutt</b>! But BE CAREFUL! It can use Electric and Ice and Rock attacks! Hit and then get the hell out of there!<br />
<br />
Feraligatr, take the Snorlax! Hit it with another <b>Iron Tail</b>! Go for the head with <b>Crunch!”</b></span></div>

<span style="color: rgb(247, 218, 100)">Edogawa stands across the dimly lit street from you, four Pokemon standing in between. Regardless of how capable he might be to battle adequately, you know he must be no joke if, in his rare moments of sobriety, he was capable of raising both a Snorlax and a Muk.<br />
<br />
Zubat, the fastest of the group, moves first; despite its lack of eyesight, it can move adeptly in the night guided by sounds. As a result, it maneuvers adeptly across the air, going for the same move it had already used against Farfetch'd with little difficulty! The bat slams into Edogawa's Muk... and vanishes from sight, engulfed completely by the massive pile of living sludge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bahahah! I usually feed it the rotten leftovers of anything I couldn't sell at the stall, so imagine how hungry it must be for fresh food!&quot;<br />
<br />
Muk doesn't look the least bit fazed by the Zubat's intrusion; you wonder if it even noticed. But it must have - because moments later, it discharges a violent <b>Thunder</b> upwards. Once it slithers slowly out of the way, Zubat's unconscious body can be seen lying on the floor, smoke rising from it... The vicious electrical attack, combined with the previous damage from Brave Bird and the fatigue from the earlier fight with the Farfetch'd were too much to endure altogether.<br />
<br />
Feraligatr, in turn, is entirely focused on the gargantuan Snorlax in front of it. Fearlessly - hungrily even - the predator dashes forward, striking its opponent with a hardened tail across the rotund belly. Snorlax is forced back a few steps, but something tells your its fat must have softened the blow somewhat.<br />
Looking to keep up its momentum, Feraligatr aims straight for the head as if looking to decapitate the opponent right there, maw wide open for a close range Crunch. Snorlax, however, doesn't remain idle for long, holding the Water-Type's jaws open with its bare hands, inches away from its face. Then, using its overpowering <b>Strength</b>, it lifts Feraligatr and tosses it overhead, your companion's back hitting the concrete floor hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bahaha, a Trainer getting his ass kicked by a chef! Come on Greg, it isn't too late to give up and just give me the birds!&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite not issuing a single order to either of his Pokemon, it's clear Edogawa has raised them very well. Feraligatr is still raring to go, but unless you have another partner on standby, the number's game is in your opponent's favor now. Is this how the Farfetch'd felt when it tried to fend off your two Pokemon all by itself?...</span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: khaki">Not an overly surprising outcome. Zubat, despite her eagerness to keep up the fight, simply was not powerful enough to try and take on the Muk by herself. She fought valiantly, but she need to rest. Hugo recalled her to her Pokeball. <br />
<br />
Fortunately, he had a backup plan. He pulled a ball and released Tyrunt. The Royal Heir Pokemon quickly surveyed the situation and let out a fierce, but relatively high-pitched roar. He was just a child after all. <br />
<br />
“Alright, Tyrunt, read to fight?!” Hugo asked.<br />
<br />
The dinosaur looked over its undersized shoulder back at its trainer, and shook its head with a resounding “No.”<br />
<br />
“What?! What do you mean “no”?! I really need your help here.”<br />
<br />
Tyrunt glared back at his trainer, giving him a look that said “you know what you need to do.” Hugo took the hint.<br />
<br />
“That? Look, man. We don’t have time for that right now, but I promise we can do it lat—”<br />
<br />
The Tyrunt snarled at Hugo, as if to say “just do it.”<br />
<br />
“Alright, <i>fine</i>! If that’s what it’s going to take, I’ll just do it, damn it.”<br />
<br />
Hugo cleared his throat. And then softly began to sing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1MhLVsvmc&amp;feature=emb_logo" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D1H1MhLVsvmc%26feature%3Demb_logo&amp;hash=c12ca7802336370ed04e39d6d3ff3a57" rel="nofollow noopener">this song</a>, getting louder as the notes became more dramatic. <br />
<br />
Tyrunt cheered happily. This was his psyche up music. He noticed a puddle nearby left over from Feraligatr’s Waterfall. He stomped his foot on the ground, but the water didn’t ripple. He stomped again, still nothing. Frutstrated, he stomped a third time, and it shook…boy, did it ever. Because much like had happened with Feraligatr, the excitement triggered something in Tyrunt…<br />

So much so that Tyrunt evolved into Tyrantrum!<br />
<br />
The newly evolved Despot Pokemon let out a terrifying roar, causing even Hugo to jump in startle. Meanwhile, on the other side, Feraligatr rose to his feet, energized by the evolution of his longtime rival and friend, positioning Muk and Snorlax between the two reptiles.<br />
<br />
Internally, Hugo rejoiced.<br />
<br />
“Let’s do this! Feraligatr, another <b>Waterfall</b> on Snorlax! Tyrantrum, go for Muk with <b>Psychic Fangs</b>!”</span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: khaki">Hugo’s Tooth Brigade was holding their own against Edogawa’s Muk and Snorlax, but the battle raged on and both lizards were being to show wear. While Feraligatr suffered some direct hits from the powerful Snorlax, Tyrantrum was being worn down through poison and stat reductions. <br />
<br />
Though Feraligatr was able to go toe-to-toe with the Snorlax, the bulkiness of the opposing Pokemon made it challenging for Hugo to find a weak point. He was confident that Feraligatr would be able to overpower Snorlax; the question was <i>how</i> though. Hugo racked his brain. He needed to utilize Feraligatr’s natural, evolutionary instincts. When crocodilians go in for the kill what is it that they do? They do the “gator roll.” Okay, now we’re thinking. And Feraligatr had taken some nasty hits from the Snorlax already, plus he had gone through the battle with the Farfetch’d so his HP was teetering. Ah ha! It all seems so clear now.<br />
<br />
“Feraligatr, use <b>Flail</b>!”<br />
<br />
As for Tyrantrum, the clock was ticking. If Muk didn’t take him down on his own accord soon, the poisoning certainly would. The urgency was upon them, but the Venom Drench had wreaked havoc on his ability to attack. Unlike Feraligatr, Tyrantrum wasn’t able to rely on Swords Dance or Dragon Dance to bring him back to the baseline. So if you can’t get back up, why not bring your opponent down?<br />
<br />
“Tyrantrum, use <b>Tail Whip!</b>”<br />
<br />
Arguably the most frustrating part of all of this was that Edogawa didn’t even have to do anything here. He could retire to his own drunken stupor while letting his Pokemon handle the fight on their own. That irritated Hugo greatly. Not to mention that all of this started because Edogawa had sent Hugo on a wild goose chase. Why exactly couldn’t Edogawa have gathered these ingredients himself? Perhaps the reason Edogawa was never able to get the help he needed was because he somehow was always getting everyone else to do the work for him, allowing him to drink and slack off. Enabling the behavior, really. Well, Hugo had enough of that. He wanted to put an end to this. And he wanted to do it now. Time to go all out. Overwhelm the opposition.<br />
<br />
“CORNER THEM! GIVE THEM ALL YOU’VE GOT! FERALIGATR, <b>THRASH</b>! TYRANTRUM, <b>THRASH</b>!”</span></div>
