<div class="bbWrapper">OOC: Ordinarily I'd have waited for Dave to post so I could continue all three current storylines at the same time, but the idea for this came to me, and I started writing, and before you know it, I had this done, and I just couldn't resist, so here we are.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #944D94"><span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Captain Stomach, Rubeus, Vi, Conis, Brittany, Amelia</u></b>: As the superhero Swalot struggled with the Ursaring, the four Pokémon continued on their way. &quot;Heh, hear that?&quot; sneered the Ursaring, in spite of his perpetually weakening state. &quot;A weirdo, she called you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard, all right,&quot; Captain Stomach replied, his mustache continuing to drain Ursaring of energy. &quot;And she also called you a clown.&quot; With that, the green tendrils of energy vanished, his mustache returning to normal as Ursaring collapsed in an unconscious heap. &quot;And that's enough funny business out of you,&quot; the bold blob remarked. Then, he bounded away with swift swiftness, intent on making sure the Ursaring's underlings weren't trying to cause trouble on their own, sure though he was that he had scared them off.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, as the girls continued their trek, along with the berries they had gathered, no more vicious gangs of Pokémon barred their way. In fact, for a little while, they saw no other Pokémon, until they arrived at a clearing, peppered with nests for various species of Pokémon. It was a small village, though most of the activity seemed to be going on in the center. Vi and the others could spot a Stunfisk surrounded by numerous Pokémon, all of whom looked very young- Zigzagoon, Whismur, Sentret, Rattata, Diglett, and even a couple of Bunnelby could be seen at a glance. Oddly, the Stunfisk's fins appeared to be pure white, along with the exclamation mark that adorned his back.<br />
<br />
The Stunfisk seemed to be focusing hard, and as they looked on, the exclamation mark on his back glowed with white light, and a glowing yellow egg materialized above it. The egg then floated forward, entering the body of what appeared to be a considerably injured Patrat. As the egg entered Patrat, the <b>Soft-Boiled</b> move did its work, and Patrat's injuries cleared up almost immediately. &quot;Wow, thanks, mister!&quot; the Patrat exclaimed happily. A couple of Watchog nearby, obviously this Patrat's parents, sighed in relief.<br />
<br />
Just then, one of the Sentret who was standing on its tail seemed to notice the Combusken, Spheal, Mareep, and Taillow. &quot;Hey! Hey, guys, look!&quot; the Sentret exclaimed. &quot;They got <i>berries</i>!&quot;<br />
<br />
As one, the group of Pokémon raced over, and before they knew it, Vi and the others were surrounded by a group of very young wild Pokémon, all of them looking up at them in obvious awe. &quot;Wow, yeah, they got berries!&quot; said a Zigzagoon excitedly. &quot;I never seen so many at once! How'd ya do it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you get past the Ursaring?&quot; squeaked a very young Whismur. &quot;They're really mean!&quot;<br />
<br />
One of the Bunnelby turned to face a nearby Diglett. &quot;I bet that Combusken decked 'em all with Sky Uppercut or somethin'! Ursarings is weak to Fightin' types!&quot; the Bunnelby exclaimed eagerly, excitedly making punching motions with his ears as he spoke.<br />
<br />
As they continued to chatter excitedly, the Stunfisk flapped his side fins like wings and flew over to them. &quot;My name is Rubeus,&quot; he introduced himself. &quot;You see, this is Oran Village, named for the multitudes of berry trees not far from here, particularly Oran trees. I just found this place an hour ago myself, but from what I've heard, it seems that nobody in town can actually gather berries from the trees and bring them back to town anymore. Every time somebody tries, they're stopped by a gang of Ursaring who believe that the berry trees should belong to them and them alone. They eat from those trees constantly, and they show no mercy to anyone who takes berries from the trees. It's possible to maybe get away with a single berry, but even then, you'd have to be insanely lucky to achieve even that much without attracting their attention. This has been going on for almost a year now, apparently,&quot; he sighed, shaking his head. &quot;I've been spending the past ten minutes healing everyone who tried to gather berries yesterday. Nobody's even dared to try today, thank Arceus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Mr. Wubeus is weally nice,&quot; chimed in a baby Bidoof who couldn't have been much more than a week old. &quot;He, he did that thing wiff the egg, you know, wike a Bwissey does, and, and he made me feew aww bettew.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But how is it you all managed to get past them completely unscathed, and with so many berries?&quot; the Stunfisk asked. &quot;I mean, I would certainly believe the four of you to be capable of holding your own against them. You in particular don't look like someone to be messed with,&quot; he said, his latest sentence directed at the Combusken. &quot;That said, though, the gang would still outnumber you... two to one, if what I hear is correct? If I didn't know any better, I'd say you got past the Ursaring without a fight at all... how did you get past the Ursaring?&quot; he asked, sounding highly curious and vaguely impressed.</span></span></div>

Despite his evolution, Mustrum was still unable to break through Toby's defences, the Grotle boosting at every turn. Crunch met Reflect, Charge Beam was blocked by Amnesia, and relieved the Grass-type of his paralysis into the bargain, while a Razor Leaf struck a weak spot in the Eelektrik's soft body. Hissing in displeasure, the lamprey watched as Toby began to rush him, preparing to unleash an assault. Mustrum's eyes narrowed as spit gathered around his jawless mouth, some dripping to the ground. A hiss grabbed his attention. Glancing down, he saw the grass wilting where his saliva had dripped. Of course, he could spit <b>Acid</b> now! That should help against a Grass-type like Toby! Then he could try to stun him with another <b>Headbutt</b>, and finish with another solid <b>Crunch</b>! No need to go overboard on the Poison attacks - this was only a sparring match after all...<br />
<br />
<br />
<u>Salazar, Conina, Darktan, Gold:</u><br />
&quot;Chocolate, huh? Our Skiploom knows an attack like that, though I think it's more of a Bomb-like attack.&quot; Darktan replied. &quot;Still, she uses it to cheer us up sometimes. Just fires it into the middle of an empty space and chocolates come out of nowhere.&quot; he explained. &quot;Strange attack, that one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, Darktan?&quot; a very small voice interrupted. Looking around, the Raticate cast his gaze up the Mother Tree until he found one of the lower, stout branches, upon which sat a very small purple dot...<br />
<br />
&quot;Conina! What are you doing all the way up there!&quot; he shouted, dashing over to the base of the trunk.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you I was gonna climb it! I just... may not have thought how to get back down!&quot; the Venipede replied, hugging the branch for dear life. &quot;Could you catch me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...probably not!&quot; the Raticate replied. &quot;Stay there, I'll go look for someone to lift you down!&quot; he said, looking around for any nearby Flying-types. He soon spotted one, but... &quot;Oh no.&quot;<br />
<br />
Conina turned just in time to see the Swellow streaking toward her, talons outstretched. Instinctively, the Bug-type went into a <b>Defence Curl</b>, losing her grasp on the branch. The bird slammed into her, but was unable to get a good grip on the rolled-up Venipede, squawking in annoyance as the impact cast its would-be meal over the edge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Conina!&quot; Darktan yelled, watching his friend plummet toward the ground. Due to how close she was to the trunk of the tree, she started rolling down it, lessening her speed as she spun at an incredibly pace, faster than a five-turn Rollout attack. But she was still going too fast to survive such an impact... which she must have known. A familiar white light burst from the rolling Poison-type, looking like a shooting star as she continued her fall. Her curled-up body grew into a fully tyre-like shape, increasing its size several times over. By the time the glow faded, the new creature was large enough and slow enough to withstand landing. Steering toward a buttress of the tree, Conina rolled down it toward another tree on the forest's edge, smashing into it with an audible thud. The tree swayed dangerously, catapulting the

back toward the other Pokémon, where she gradually rolled to a stop.<br />
<br />
&quot;...you can't tell anyone that happened.&quot; she said, somehow. Her mouthparts were buried somewhere in her wheel-like body, only her piercing yellow eyes visible. &quot;The part about the Swellow is good, just not the whole 'falling to her death like an idiot' bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you were saying evolution was a big deal.&quot; Darktan smirked, remembering what she'd told him not so long ago. &quot;Looks like your theory of 'Evolving in mortal danger' holds up yet again, Salazar.&quot; he said to the grey Scolipede, his fangs bent into a grin.<br />
<br />
{Congratulations! Your Conina evolved into Whirlipede!}<br />

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: #944D94"><span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Gytha, Mustrum, Toby, Zyra, Pomona, Dennis, Meowth, Iachima, Arondight:</u></b> The fight was getting intense, though Toby seemed to currently have the advantage in terms of health. And then, as some of Mustrum's saliva caused a hissing sound upon contact with the grass, Pomona and Dennis exchanged knowing glances. The Bulbasaur and Ivysaur, as well as Meowth, all knew what this meant- how many times have they heard that sound before? Nagini, James, Goyle, they all knew the move, too- Acid. And now it seems that evolution granted Mustrum access to this move as well. The Eelektrik wasted no time in putting his new move to good use, and sprayed some <b>Acid</b> in Toby's direction. The Grotle took the blow directly, his Special Defense buffs cancelled out by Mustrum's Special Attack boosts. Toby grunted as he felt the super effective Poison move assault his body, before deciding now was the time to act. Taking full advantage of his lack of further paralysis, Toby charged forward in a <b>Tackle</b> attack. With Mustrum having not completely gotten used to the fact that Toby was no longer paralyzed, the Eelektrik was caught off-guard and took the full force of the attack, even moreso than he would have done ordinarily- it was <b>a critical hit</b>!<br />
<br />
Mustrum was now in close range, so this was as good a time as any- he rammed the Grotle with a <b>Headbutt</b>, scoring a direct hit, albeit not a very powerful one- the Grotle's slightly buffed Defense had a hand in this. But Toby's Defense wasn't shielding him from one thing- the sight of Mustrum suddenly charging in for the attack, now it was Toby's turn to be caught off-guard- the Grotle <b>flinched</b> from the Headbutt, all thoughts of using Rock Smash gone from his mind! And the Eelektrik charged in yet again, this time attacking with his teeth, landing a powerful <b>Crunch</b>, a Crunch that pierced the soil shell on Toby's back, a Crunch that rendered the Grotle a little less ready to take physical blows than before- <b>Toby's Defense fell!</b><br />
<br />
But now it was the Grotle's turn to act, and after missing his chance with Rock Smash, Toby was ready to get back in the game. His claws glowed with energy, and Toby lunged, trampling the Electric-type underfoot with a powerful <b>Rock Climb</b>. Though it had the potential to disorient its target, at least Mustrum was able to keep his head in the game and not succumb to confusion. Of course, that didn't make the attack hurt any less...<br />
<br />
Things were starting to swing more in Toby's favor as the battle went on, though the loss of his Defense boost had the potential to pose a problem. They were still relatively evenly matched in terms of energy, but when it came to health, that was a whole other swarm of Yanma. The Eelektrik was running low on health by this point, and while the battle was still not a foregone conclusion for either side, it was getting close to it.<br />

<br />
<b><u>Salazar, Conina, Darktan, Gold:</u></b> At the mention of Chocolate Magic, Darktan related a similar move his Trainer's Skiploom knew, only this one sounded more like a bomb than a blast of molten chocolate. &quot;That sounds like Chocolate Bomb,&quot; Salazar remarked. &quot;It's a different move, and Hermione knows that one, too. And Bellatrix, our Trainer's Skuntank. Oh, and Joy, too. She's... Well, I wouldn't exactly call her our Trainer's Audino...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, see, here's the thing,&quot; explained Gold. &quot;See, our Trainer's Shuppet, Helena, she's his sister. She was a Trainer when she was alive, and the one Pokémon she'd always wanted to catch but never could, it was Audino. So then one day, Keith hatches an Egg, and it's an Audino, and Helena's going on like it's the cutest thing in the world. Well, naturally, Keith noticed this, and he asked if Helena wanted to take care of the Audino. She agreed right away. She and Joy train almost constantly, Helena's actually a pretty decent Trainer herself. See, thing is, from a technical and legal standpoint, Joy belongs to Keith, because it'd be too difficult to legally have Joy recognized as Helena's Pokémon, seeing as how she's a Pokémon herself now, y'know?&quot;<br />
<br />
Salazar opened his mouth, but whatever he intended to add to this was lost as he heard a very small voice from very high up. Conina may have planned to climb the Mother Tree, but as far as getting back down from it? Not so much. She asked whether the Raticate could catch her, an idea met with healthy skepticism from Darktan. He urged the Venipede to hang on, and told her he would try to find a Flying-type. &quot;Good idea,&quot; nodded Salazar, as he scanned the skies. &quot;I'll keep an eye out, maybe my Trainer's Swoobat or Tranquill will be around her- oh, crap,&quot; he added as he noticed what Darktan had noticed- there was indeed a Flying-type in the area, but this one wasn't likely to be very helpful to Conina. No, the Swellow was diving down at the Venipede, intent on having her for lunch. Conina noticed this and instinctively used Defense Curl, which unfortunately only served to force her to relinquish her grip on the tree branch. Swellow's talons couldn't get a grip on the spherical Venipede, and merely knocked her off the branch, sending her falling down from her tall, tall, <i>tall</i> perch. Salazar's mind raced as he tried to think of some way to slow Conina's descent, but nothing came to mind, even as she started to roll down the tall trunk of the Mother Tree. And then, her spherical, rolling form suddenly became a glowing, spherical, rolling form. Conina was evolving as she shot down the tree at blinding speeds, and as she reached the bottom, stopped only by colliding with another tree, it became clear that not only was Conina unharmed from this little incident, she was now also a Whirlipede.<br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations,&quot; Salazar said. He couldn't help but grin slightly as Conina swore the Raticate to secrecy as to the circumstances of her evolution, so as to not make her sound bad. Darktan then remarked on how Salazar's theory of evolving in mortal danger seemed to be holding up yet again. &quot;Looks like it, yeah,&quot; the Scolipede nodded. &quot;And I won't tell anyone, Conina,&quot; he added to the newly evolved Whirlipede. &quot;In fact, my Trainer and a lot of my teammates still don't know the exact circumstances of my own evolution from Venipede to Whirlipede.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, congrats,&quot; grinned Gold.<br />
<br />
&quot;Little advice for you, though,&quot; Salazar added. &quot;When you think you might be getting close to evolving again, even if you're not completely sure, you'll want to start avoiding small areas. Anywhere that doesn't look like I'd be able to fit into comfortably... the indoors in general, actually... I started evolving into Scolipede inside someone's Secret Base, Keith had to rush me outside before I became too big for the room.&quot;</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #FF0000"><b><u>Gemini, Nagini, Norbert, Godric, James, Lily, Six, Rune, Rincewind, Rhys, Osage, Lumiere:</u></b> &quot;Nice to meet you, Rhys!~&quot; Lumiere chimed as the last of the Fearow were knocked out. &quot;Hey, look, it's Rune!&quot; he shouts as the remaining children cheer upon the return of Rune and Gemini. <br />
<br />
The Weezing briefly converses with Nagini as a certain Exeggcute pokes around a peculiar stone. The stone happens to be a leaf stone, causing the little Grass-type to evolve into an Exeggcutor. &quot;Just great...&quot; Osage grumbles, but Nagini had a plan. Calling up Lily, the Venomoth Teleports herself and the large Exeggcutor away. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, children, climb aboard. We're taking you back to your parents now! Lumie, you come too, things have wrapped up over here,&quot; Rune directs to the little ones. &quot;Okay~&quot; Lumiere wisps, waiting for the Grass-types to climb atop the Flygon and Weezing before climbing atop Rune as well. <br />
<br />
Before long they take off while the remaining Pokemon at the cliff climb and dig back down to meet with the other party. James, Six, Rincewind, Norbert, along with this new Nidorino, seemed to have finished things up back on the ground as well. Osage looks around to witness a sea of unconscious Fearow scattered about. He's not really one for compliments, but he was definitely impressed with the work they've done. &quot;They'll definitely feel it in the morning,&quot; he scoffs, &quot;I guess we should check on the village and see if the kids are home safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
To their surprise, they return back to the village to see it lit up with cheers and joy and music. &quot;WELCOME BACK, HEROES!&quot; the booming crowd shouts. Out before them laid a massive long table filled with a delicious assortment of fruit, berries, and treats. Lumiere was already there digging into the feast as Rune respectively looked for the party's return. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on guys, the food's great~&quot; Lumiere spouted, spitting pieces of a Bluk Berry as he spoke. Osage remained silent, but was happy to oblige, walking over to a corner of the table as he helped himself to a slice of Oran Berry Pie. <br />
<br />
A team of Bellossom stood before the group, including the mother of the Oddish who they rescued, and began an intricate synchronized dance for the saviors. Rune smiled upon the cheerful atmosphere. A victory feast after a battle like that hits just the spot. She rose briefly to speak to her new friends. &quot;Excuse me, everyone. I would just like to take a moment to thank you all for helping me find and save Lumie. If it weren't for you guys, he, along with the children of this village, would not have been safe. I suppose we will be heading our separate ways after this feast, so once again, thank you. Lumiere and I are in your debt.&quot; <br />
<br />
She sits back down, a smile full of gratitude and joy illuminating her draconion face. &quot;Hear, hear!&quot; Lumiere chimes. <br />
<br />
<b><u>Marvolo, Fang, Eous, Sterope:</u></b> &quot;Great, thanks.&quot; Sterope interrupts before galloping towards the direction of the lake. &quot;Hey, wait!&quot; Eous whines, before turning back to the Carnivine and Seviper. &quot;Um, thanks kind strangers!&quot; he bows before chasing after his teammate. <br />
<br />
Before them they see beautiful, clear lake spanning across the horizon. Sterope has already ducked her head to enjoy some water as Eous comes to join her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eous, be cautious of those guys. They eat Pokemon like us. Luckily, they didn't that time, but who knows if they'll come back,&quot; the Blitzle scolds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, don't be so judgey. They seemed nice,&quot; the Ponyta casts it off.<br />
<br />
&quot;They won't be so nice when they take a bite off your rear. Stay alert, that's all I'm saying. We'll rest here briefly, but then we're heading to a different area away from those guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, fine...&quot;<br />
<br />
They continue to drink, allowing the fresh water to ease the thirst caused from their running...</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px">&quot;Charge!&quot; roared a Vullaby, mounted atop the head of a Herdier.<br />
<br />
Clinging onto the dog's head for dear life, the bird looked at her opponent with a look of determination, her eyes locked onto the Skorupi sitting atop the back of the Tirtouga sliding towards them. They were locked in a battle of the ages, the series of challenges that had preceded the final challenge had been equally won by either side.<br />
<br />
&quot;You shall rue the day you challenged me!&quot; screamed the scorpion in her sort of weird chattering voice. <br />
<br />
The turtle and the dog collided with each other... causing the bird and the scorpion to go flying into the air. <br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like they are having fun,&quot; said Zoran, leaning against a large tree as he watched Gina, Eddie, Sheldon and Scorpina.<br />
<br />
&quot;A little bit too much fun,&quot; said Dot, hovering next to the Shiftry. &quot;You know that it won't be too long and they will do something to hurt themselves and then where will they end up going? To me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zoran looked over at the Ledian, his eyebrow cocked, &quot;You called yourself the team mother, as in you literally called yourself the team mother when you introduced yourself to all of them. What did you think would happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I didn't think that they would be such a... violent bunch. I don't know how they managed to get Eddie involved, this is the first time that I think I've ever seen him this active,&quot; she replied, watching Gina and Scorpina wrestling on the group while Eddie and Sheldon sat back and laughed at them.<br />

The few who weren't rendered unconscious were hauling tail feather out of there as fast as they could flap. One of them, however, turned his head to glare at the Pokémon, at James, Lily, and Six in particular. &quot;You haven't seen the last of us,&quot; he declared. &quot;Next time we meet, revenge will be ours!&quot; With that, he faced forward once more and flew off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just ignore that,&quot; grinned James as he and Lily approached Six. &quot;I'll bet we never see those Fearow again.&quot; Of course, it's a damn good thing James didn't actually make any sort of bet about that, <a href="http://forums.upnetwork.net/showpost.php?p=641407&amp;postcount=36" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.upnetwork.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D641407%26postcount%3D36&amp;hash=81b28b06b718dc48f50ef257bf16a389" rel="nofollow noopener">am I right?</a> The Vileplume and Venomoth smiled at Six, and Rincewind as well, and the Foongus smiled back up at his parents.<br />

It was around then that the rest of their party showed up, having gotten down from the cliff. Osage, the Sneasel, seemed impressed with what had happened, almost as though against his will. He then voiced the idea that they should meet up at the village to ensure the kids made it back safely. &quot;I'm all for that,&quot; nodded Lily, and her teammates chimed in with general murmurings of agreement. Therefore, off they went.<br />
<br />
As they reached the village, they were surprised to discover that the Grass-types, in their gratitude, had thrown together a surprise party. The others were already there, Lumiere helping himself to a Bluk Berry. He urged the others to dig in, and after such hunger-inducing activity, they needed very little encouragement. Norbert happily munched on some Sitrus Berries; Godric bravely munched on a Tamato Berry, quickly finding out that its legendary spiciness was in no way exaggerated; Nagini politely munched on a Durin Berry; Gemini helped himself to some Razz Berries, while Mustard, his second head, chowed down on a couple of Iapapa Berries; Lily made her way slowly but surely through a huge Watmel Berry; James gathered an extremely large pile of assorted berries and began munching on them like his stomach was a bottomless pit, to the general astonishment of the wild Grass-types; Six was nibbling on a neatly sliced Wiki Berry.<br />
<br />
As they ate, a number of Bellossom, among them the mother of the Oddish they saved, put on a performance for their heroes, an intricate dance. And then, the Flygon rose to address her new friends, thanking them for helping her save Lumiere.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was no trouble, really,&quot; Nagini replied modestly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Happy to help,&quot; Gemini and Mustard said simultaneously (this surprised their nearby teammates- contrary to what one might expect from a pair of conjoined Weezing heads, they actually very rarely, if at all, said anything in unison like that).<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... Um... Th-thank you,&quot; Six squeaked quietly, blushing at the praise and attempting to cover this up by lowering his cap over his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm glad I could help!&quot; smiled Norbert. &quot;Hey, Rune, Lumie&quot; he added, addressing the Flygon and Litwick. &quot;I'll tell you where my Trainer's Secret Base is- that way you can come visit us whenever you like!&quot; The Axew was smiling, genuinely happy at the thought of his friends coming to visit him. &quot;Hey, maybe next time you guys see me, I'll have evolved, too!&quot; he added, before proceeding to tell them where they could find Keith's Secret Base.<br />
<br />
It was a happy ending all around- the Fearow were chased away, the local Grass-types were safe. In fact, though none of them would know this yet, the Fearow even decided to relocate their nests, leave the Tree Grove altogether, in favor of a quiet forest not far from the Hidden Mansion. As the group of Keith's Pokémon looked around, all they saw were happy, grateful Grass-types smiling at them (with the exception of a certain Exeggutor's parents, who were too busy trying to process their son's unexpected evolution). It was a good feeling, knowing that they had been able to keep these families from being mercilessly torn apart.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>Marvolo, Fang, Aria:</u></b> Elsewhere, however, something decidedly less heartwarming was going on. Marvolo smirked as the Ponyta and Blitzle left- he had just directed them to the nearest body of water rather then try to eat them as he normally would have. One reason for this was because he and Fang had just gorged themselves senseless on a whole hive of Metapod, and they were just too damn full for a snack right now. The other reason? Marvolo knew full well that Pisces was currently hunting in aforementioned body of water.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh,&quot; Marvolo chuckled, once they were out of earshot. &quot;Oh, this'll be good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you mean?&quot; asked Fang. &quot;All you did was tell them where to get a drink of water.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me ask you something, Fang,&quot; smirked Marvolo. &quot;Where exactly would Pisces be right about now?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Carnivine shrugged. &quot;Probably hunting somewhere in... in... in the lake,&quot; he said, slowly coming to the realization.<br />
<br />
&quot;And there it is,&quot; said Marvolo. &quot;I figured that even if we're in no state to eat them, no sense letting perfectly good food go to waste.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't argue with that logic,&quot; grinned the Carnivine.<br />
<br />
The Seviper and Carnivine lazed around a while longer in silence, digesting their meals and just relaxing, before the Seviper spoke up again. &quot;So, Fang,&quot; he said with a sly smirk. &quot;You and Aria, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Carnivine blushed, but grinned stupidly. &quot;Yep,&quot; he admitted. &quot;Ever since she evolved, I couldn't take my eyes off of her. And then, on Christmas, when Keith brought me out, and the first thing I saw was Aria standing under the mistletoe and looking up at me hopefully...&quot; Fang sighed. &quot;I... I can't even... I don't think the words exist to describe what I felt there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marvolo nodded. &quot;I know the feeling,&quot; he said, &quot;and I assure you, you're not the only one incapable of putting said feeling into mere words. I hope Aria is to you what Amethyst is to me,&quot; he said, his eyes involuntarily lighting up at the mere thought of his girlfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;The way you two act around each other, that sounds about right,&quot; nodded Fang, who was unable to stop grinning as he thought of his girlfriend. Well, OK, he's always unable to stop grinning, given how his mouth was structured, but point being, even if that wasn't the case, he still wouldn't be able to stop grinning.<br />
<br />
Just then, a voice sounded from behind them. &quot;Talking about me, boys?&quot; The sound of the voice caused Fang's eyes to light up happily; sure enough, a Roselia walked out in front of them, and tried to look at both of them, though her eyes were glued to Fang.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Aria,&quot; smiled Fang. &quot;Sorry we couldn't have lunch together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's OK,&quot; the Roselia smiled back. &quot;I don't have the mouth to be able to kill a Metapod with one bite anyway, and I know you wanted to demonstrate it for Marvolo. Besides, I did OK flying solo,&quot; she added, as she nonchalantly used her red rose to brush what appeared to be bloodstained beige hairs off of her blue rose. Marvolo flicked his tongue out in the direction of the hairs to get a good whiff of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zigzagoon, hm?&quot; the Seviper remarked. &quot;Not bad. They're fast, their movements can be erratic, not exactly the easiest of prey.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, the speed wasn't much of an issue,&quot; smirked Aria. &quot;The one thing I miss about being a Budew is being able to scatter all that toxic pollen, but I gotta say, Cotton Spore does the trick pretty well, too. Slowed it right down, let me take my time aiming Extrasensory. Then, once I had it with that, all I had to do was lift it up, and slam it into a nearby rock.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That'd do it, all right,&quot; nodded Marvolo. &quot;Well, I think I'll just leave you two alone for now,&quot; he added with another sly smirk, before slithering away. Fang and Aria both smiled as the Seviper left- they had nothing against his company, but still, they never said no to a little alone time with each other...<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>Pisces, Nagini, Eous, Sterope:</u></b> At the lake, a Blue-Striped Basculin was silently swimming around, eyes peeled for any sign of potential prey. It was nice and big, and not in that infernal Park, so she figured she'd have a nice variety to choose from. Alas, thus far she had come up with naught but a few Finneon, easily devoured, not very filling. She hadn't had a good hunting day since <a href="http://forums.upnetwork.net/showpost.php?p=657139&amp;postcount=42" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.upnetwork.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D657139%26postcount%3D42&amp;hash=e55b99e6e270ceab613c8d47a8e602a6" rel="nofollow noopener">that one day</a> at the beach- Remoraid, Goldeen, Horsea, Clauncher, and so forth, nicely topped off with her first taste of Kingler. Today, however... practically nothing.<br />
<br />
She wheeled around again, hoping in vain to see an unsuspecting fish where there wasn't one ten seconds ago, but instead of fish, she saw a decidedly more welcome sight- a Ponyta and a Blitzle, and they were drinking from the lake. A devilish grin spread across Pisces's face. For land-dwelling prey, she usually had to hunt on dry land, but now, here it was, land-dwelling prey coming right to her in the water. Oh, there was no way in hell she'd pass up this kind of opportunity, not when she was this hungry! Silently, she swam off towards the shore, sizing up the equine edibles, working out which to go for first. Well, that was no contest, she'd first go for the Blitzle. Blitzle are Electric-types, and the pair seemed like they were friends. Pisces knew that if she first went to the Ponyta, she'd be leaving herself wide open to a rather electrifying retaliation from the Blitzle. However, if she were to attack the Blitzle first, hopefully she'd be able to make the kill before encountering any electrical problems, and any retaliation on the Ponyta's part... well, Pisces didn't like the idea of taking a Stomp or something from those diamond-hard hooves, but considering the alternative, it seemed to her to be the lesser of two evils. She was getting closer now... She was within range... She jumped out of the water, ready for her first taste of Blitzle meat... purple coils came seemingly out of nowhere and gently pulled her away... wait, what?<br />
<br />
After the party had finished back in the Grass-types' village, and everyone had gone their separate ways, Nagini had headed to the lake for a cool drink of water to wash down the berries she had eaten. Once she got there, she had spotted Pisces, and saw her going for the Ponyta and Blitzle who were drinking nearby. Nagini didn't hunt, herself, and while she didn't object to her teammates hunting, she knew all too well about Pisces's tendency to go for Trainer-owned Pokémon, and she had a feeling that the Ponyta and Blitzle weren't wild Pokémon, a feeling she's usually right about, even if she can't explain it. Therefore, the Arbok had grabbed Pisces in midair, and now turned the Basculin to face her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please leave them be,&quot; said the Arbok. Her voice was calm, no trace of harshness or fury, and yet, in no way did it come off as weak. Indeed, all Pisces could do in response was nod silently. Nagini released her grip on the Water-type, who re-entered the water and swam away with no issue. She gave a small sigh of relief, then turned to address the pair of equine Pokémon. &quot;Sorry about her,&quot; the Arbok said. &quot;That was Pisces, one of my teammates. She's not a picky eater, and has very little in the way of restraint, I'm afraid. My name is Nagini, by the way,&quot; she added. &quot;Who might you two be?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>Stewie, Ginny, Gina, Eddie, Sheldon, Scorpina, Zoran, Dot:</u></b> Elsewhere, a Vullaby and a Shiny Skorupi were duking it out, while a Herdier and Tirtouga watched, as well as a formidable-looking Shiftry and Ledian. The Dark/Flying and Poison/Bug-types both looked very young, so it wasn't a very serious fight. And then, a dark grey Ledian descended onto the scene. &quot;What the deuce?&quot; he demanded as he recognized at least some of them. &quot;What the hell are all of you doing here, hmm? I thought I'd seen the last of you when your Trainer foisted me onto that Ethan fellow.&quot; It was then that he noticed the Vullaby and Skorupi fighting. &quot;Ooh, bloodshed,&quot; he said with a diabolical smirk. &quot;Ooh, now, this should be interesting to watch.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he watched the brawl, a Pawniard floated down beside the Shiftry and (non-Shadow) Ledian, by way of <b>Magnet Rise</b>. Her eyes, narrowed in distrust, remained on Stewie the entire time. Ginny was ready to act at a moment's notice if he gave her so much as the slightest of reasons to.</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px">Gina and Scorpina were still trying to work out who was the champion, via means of wrestling, when Scorpina suddenly scurried out from underneath the Vullaby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha ha!&quot; triumphantly cried Gina, &quot;This must mean that I am the true champion!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As if,&quot; said Scorpina, &quot;I was distracted by that Ledian over there... who doesn't really look much like Dot does. In fact it sort of looks like Erra, you know that whole 'shadow' thing he has going on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gina turned her head towards Stewie as Eddie slowly shuffled over to the Shadow Ledian, sniffing in his direction.<br />
<br />
&quot;He looks cool,&quot; said Gina, &quot;Maybe even a little strong!&quot; She started to waddle her way over to Stewie.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Zoran and Dot had discovered the very sudden appearance of Ginny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where did you come from?&quot; asked Dot, completely taken off guard by the Pawniard coming out of nowhere.<br />
<br />
Zoran, on the other hand, was much less surprised and more interested in how he hadn't detected her presence. &quot;Interesting,&quot; he said, &quot;It's not very often that pokemon are able to get near me without me sensing them. Not very often at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
While all the other pokemon were preoccupied, Sheldon had decided to take a little tour around the park. After all, it wasn't everyday that he was here, and dang nabbit he was going to make the best of it. One small thing that he didn't really factor into his plans was how much of the path he had decided to take was uphill, meaning that he couldn't just slide around on his belly. But if Sheldon was one thing, it was a trooper, and sure enough he still made his way along the uphill path, albeit sorta slowly.</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: #944D94"><span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Stewie, Ginny, Gina, Eddie, Scorpina, Zoran, Dot:</u></b> Stewie frowned as the Vullaby seemed to be claiming victory without having brutally slaughtered her opponent, but before he could say anything, both Gina and Scorpina were approaching him, showing interest, with the Vullaby remarking on how cool and strong he looked. This put a grin right back on Stewie's face as his ego was stroked. &quot;Well, well, it seems you two know power when you see it. I am the magnificent and all-powerful Stewie, future ruler of the entire world. Some of your older teammates may even be familiar with me, back before I evolved.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the Shiftry and (non-Shadow) Ledian seemed a bit surprised by Ginny's appearance. Well, OK, in the Shiftry's case, it wasn't so much surprise, so much as it was interest in how her appearance went unnoticed by him, which elicited a small smile from the Pawniard- considering how much she tried to be stealthy when tailing Stewie, she considered this high praise coming from such a high-level Pokémon. &quot;My name is Ginny,&quot; she said, speaking in a low voice so as to not attract Stewie's attention. &quot;That Ledian over there is a Shadow Pokémon. Very violent, and aspires for world domination. My Trainer has me follow him around to ensure he stays out of trouble, and believe me, he's capable of making trouble.&quot; She watched as Stewie introduced himself to the young Pokémon, though as she watched the Shadow Ledian give a satisfied smirk at the attention he was getting from the two young female Pokémon, she couldn't help but feel a stab of jealousy. Shoving that to the back of her mind, she continued to speak to the Shiftry and Ledian. &quot;What surprises me is, Stewie seems to recognize at least some of you... He was still a Ledyba when he was traded to our Trainer... By any chance, did your Trainer ever own a Shadow Ledyba?&quot; she asked Zoran and Dot.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>Chance, Sheldon:</u></b> Elsewhere, the Tirtouga had left the group, and was exploring the Tree Grove on his own, though he hadn't counted on this involving going uphill. Still, though, he made the climb, slowly but surely. As he climbed, a loud noise sounded off to his left- a Blastoise was scrambling up the hill at great speeds, as though some sort of expert <b>Rock Climb</b>er. Once she had made it to the top, she sighed and sat down, ready to just relax and enjoy the scenery. Then, she noticed the Tirtouga climbing the hill. &quot;Hey,&quot; the Blastoise called down to him. &quot;Need any help?&quot;</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: #944D94"><span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Hermione, Scorpius:</u></b> The situation looked well and truly hopeless- battered, beaten, and trapped in a corner, Hermione the Weedle could only watch as the pair of Swellow closed in. And yet, Hermione showed no outwardly signs of fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't eat me if I were you,&quot; she said calmly to them. &quot;My boyfriend wouldn't like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh!&quot; cawed one of the Swellow mockingly. &quot;Oh, Rayquaza forbid we get your precious <i>boyfriend</i> upset with us!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, what's he gonna do?&quot; chortled the other Swellow. &quot;Be our second course?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!&quot; added the first one. &quot;What, what is he, a juicy Caterpie? A savory Wurmple?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, I hope he's a Sewaddle, I like how they come with their own salad,&quot; smirked the second Swellow.<br />
<br />
Hermione said nothing, electing merely to watch as the pair of Swellow laughed and joked about the various possibilities as to who this Weedle's boyfriend could be, and how good of a second course he would make for them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, heh... Alright, enough of that,&quot; chuckled the first Swellow. &quot;Now, before we eat you, how about you tell me what your boyfriend is, so we can go for him next, hmm?&quot;<br />
<br />
At that moment, however, a large and ominous shadow loomed over the Swellow, causing their faces to register expressions of nervousness. Hermione, on the other hand, was looking calmer than ever. &quot;He's the large, angry Drapion right behind you,&quot; she said casually.<br />
<br />
The Swellow had little time to do much else than exchange looks of horror before they were grabbed from behind by horribly strong claws. Sure enough, they were lifted up and forced to look at, as Hermione had described, the large, angry Drapion right behind them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, listen good, because I'm only going to say this once,&quot; hissed Scorpius. &quot;I'm going to release my grip on you, and when I do, I want the both of you to fly as far away from here as your wings will carry you. And let me be clear about this- if I let go and you try to eat my girlfriend, <i>I am going to kill you.</i> Do I make myself clear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Inescapably clear,&quot; choked one of the Swellow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Understood completely,&quot; gagged the other.<br />
<br />
Scorpius relinquished his grip, and true to their choked-out, fear-motivated promises, the pair of Swellow hauled tail feather out of there, flying as fast as they could, and silently vowing to never eat a Weedle again.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was great, Scorpius,&quot; Hermione smiled as she started to crawl up her boyfriend. Ever since his evolution, Scorpius now towered over Hermione, the size difference more drastic than ever before. But they didn't care in the slightest, neither one of them. As she crawled onto one of Scorpius's arms, he very, very gently pulled her into an embrace.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I'm not about to just stand around and let you get eaten, am I?&quot; grinned Scorpius. &quot;Hell, only reason I didn't go for them sooner is because I thought you had them beat at first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not the only one who thought that,&quot; sighed Hermione, nuzzling Scorpius as best as she could. &quot;I didn't figure on them escaping the Electroweb before the Gummi Bomb went off. It all worked for the best, though- I kinda liked how it played out here, y'know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was pretty amusing,&quot; conceded Scorpius. &quot;But I <i>am</i> glad you're safe,&quot; he added. The Drapion lied down on the grass and sighed happily as Hermione snuggled up to him. They could spend all afternoon like this, and if uninterrupted, they probably would.</span></span></div>

<article class="message-body js-selectToQuote">
<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: MediumTurquoise"><span style="font-size: 9px"><u>Gytha, Mustrum, Toby, Zyra, Pomona, Dennis, Meowth, Iachima, Arondight:</u><br />
The battle was raging on, but Mustrum was starting to get worn down. Every time he got a lucky break, Toby got even more fortunate. Every critical hit took its toll, and he struggled to find a waythrough the Grotle's enhanced defences - only fitting for a tortoise-based Pokémon. Reeling from the last hit, he slithered backward through the air, his eyes fixed on his quarry as he bared his teeth again, ready to spring in for another strike...<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, that's enough.&quot; a firm voice stated as Gytha descended, placing herself between the sparring partners, causing the Eelektrik to come to a halt in mid-air, spluttering with indignation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gytha, what are you doing? This battle isn't over yet, you can't just call it off like this!&quot; he spat, his pride smarting.<br />
<br />
The Grass-type rolled her eyes slightly, before continuing, &quot;This isn't a real battle, Mustrum. When you battle for Dave then yes, you'll likely continue until you or your opponent are unconscious. But this is just a sparring session, and if you push much further you're going to faint.&quot; The motherly Grass-type unfolded her stubby legs, releasing a bundle of fat, yellow fruits onto the ground, rolling a few toward her teammate before pushing some back toward Toby. &quot;You've been through a lot today, evolving and all, you don't need to go to the limit. Here, have some Sitrus Berries to restore your strength so that you don't feel so battered. Don't you want to show your new body off for our trainer rather than limp home beaten and bruised?&quot;<br />
<br />
The EleFish froze, his headstrong nature and desire for self-improvement driving him onward, while his appreciation for the maternal Skiploom's advice held him back. As a Tynamo, his movepool had consisted of a whopping five moves, making him little better than a Magikarp, and forcing him to struggle to be as strong as possible. And now that he'd reached his next stage...<br />
<br />
Blinking, his body relaxed as his head bowed. &quot;...You're right. Thank you. There's no need to push myself so hard, especially after evolving.&quot; he replied, floating close to the ground and sucking up a few of the Sitrus Berries, feeling his condition improve drastically while the adrenaline rush of evolution began to subside. Once he had eaten his fill, he rose back into the air, obviously refreshed as the scars and bruises of battle faded away. A smile somehow worked its way onto his jawless face before he bowed his head toward the Grotle. &quot;Thanks for the session, Toby. We both got a lot out of it, and though your defences were too much for me this time around, I'd be happy to test them again if we cross paths in the future.&quot; he said, the yellow patches on his body lighting up with renewed energy. He next turned back to his teammate. &quot;I think that's enough excitement for one day. Shall we find the others and head on home?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Skiploom nodded. &quot;If the rest of them have had as action-packed a time as you, I think they'll need a rest.&quot; she replied. Mustrum nodded back, his body crackling with electricity as he fired a flare of voltage into the sky as a signal. Turning back to the other Grass-types and Meowth, the Cottonweed waved a stubby hand. &quot;It was lovely to meet all of you! If you're ever in the Sapphire Islands, feel free to drop by the small blue submarine&quot; she said, starting to rise into the air and back into the trees. &quot;Take care, lovies!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Catch you later, guys! Remember Toby, I'll get you next time!&quot; Mustrum added, following his teammate back into the forest, heading for their rendezvous point, leaving the clearing behind.<br />
<br />
<br />
<u>Salazar, Conina, Darktan, Gold:</u><br />
Still getting used to her new form, Conina rolled to and fro on the spot, still getting over the fact that she couldn't just uncurl and stretch her legs anymore - she was stuck in this wheel-shape until she was next able to evolve. Still, once she got used it it, rolling had to be a lot faster than simply scurrying around on the stubby legs Venipede were known for. As Salazar relayed his advice, she did her best to nod, though she really just spun very slightly. &quot;Noted, thanks. Hopefully that won't be so much of an issue, I'm rarely indoors myself, but good to know all the same.&quot; Even after evolving, the Scolipede was still over twice as tall as her.<br />
<br />
Darktan simply grinned, which was hard not to do with teeth like his, until a glimmer caught his eye. A burst of electricity shot up from the trees a fair distance away, sparkling across the sky just north of their position. &quot;Hey, did you see that?&quot; he asked, Conina wheeling around to face him. &quot;I think that was Mustrum's meet-up signal. Strange... it seemed a lot more powerful than I expected. Want to go check it out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, after almost falling to my death I could do with a breather. It's been a pretty exciting day for both of us.&quot; the Whirlipede replied, turning back to the other two Pokémon. &quot;Well, looks like we're off. It was nice to meet both of you, especially you, Salazar. It's always nice to meet another member of the Venipede line, especially one so distinctive.&quot; she added. If more than her eyes were visible, it's entirely possible that a blush would have been visible. Noticing the way she was starting to behave, the Poison-type blinked her piercing yellow eyes, catching herself quickly. &quot;Uh... anyway, must dash. Bye!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, she started to roll toward where the flare had popped up. Darktan simply shook his head. &quot;Nice meeting you, fellas. For predators, you two aren't bad at all.&quot; he grinned, flicking his tail to his head in a salute-esque gesture, before turning to follow his friend as she rolled away, soon lost from sight amid the trees.<br />
<br />
<br />
<u>Gemini, Mustard, Nagini, Norbert, Godric, James, Lily, Six, Rune, Rincewind, Rhys, Osage, Lumiere:</u><br />
The ground was thick with unconscious Fearow, but some weren't so battered that they couldn't get out of dodge. One of them looked back, hissing threats at the family of Poison-types. Rincewind snapped his jaws in reply before he flew off, before turning back to the trio. &quot;Jerk.&quot; he muttered, before smiling at the reunited family, happy to have helped out. At that, the rest of their group appeared, having made their way back down from the cliff, Rhys sliding down the tunnel Nagini had made. The two Ground-types regrouped. &quot;Have fun up there?&quot; Rincewind asked, a grin even more evident on his features than normal.<br />
<br />
Rhys chuckled. &quot;Something like that. Felt good to sink my teeth into those Fearow a few times. Though I would've been toast if Nagini hadn't been watching my back. She's seriously strong.&quot; the Sandile replied, casting another gaze over at the Arbok. &quot;And Osage and Lumiere came in useful too!&quot; he added, hurriedly, but Rincewind had noticed the tone his teammate had slipped into.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good, it was pretty action packed down here too, but looks like we managed to handle ourselves.&quot; he added, noticing that the rest of the group seemed to be moving off. &quot;C'mon, let's go.&quot; They soon ended up at the Grass-type village, where a party and banquet had been thrown in their honour. Both Pokémon's sizeable jaws hung open at the display of food, and soon enough they were tucking into the selection of berries indiscriminately, while enjoying the display of dancing provided by the troop of Bellossom.<br />
<br />
After a while, Rhys' sensitive eyes caught a flash of something, causing him to turn toward it. A burst of electricity spread over the sky from a location in the forest beyond the valley they'd ended up in. Nudging Rincewind with his tail, the Sandile spoke, &quot;Hey, I think I just saw the signal Mustrum said he'd send up when it was time to go home. I think we'd better get out of here.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Trapinch nodded. &quot;Sounds good, let's just say goodbye to everyone first.&quot; he replied, before walking over to the Pokémon he'd fought alongside on the ground, finding Lily, James, Six, Godric and Norbert fairly easily. &quot;Well guys, looks like I'm off. It was nice to meet you all, even if we did spend most of the time fighting those Fearow. I'll see you around sometime, take care. Especially you, Six. We made a pretty good team, huh?&quot; he clicked with a grin, waving one stubby leg in farewell before turning to leave.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Rhys had located the cliffside division, saying his own goodbyes. &quot;It was good fun fighting alongside you all. Well, maybe not 'fun'... but you get what I mean.&quot; he hissed, nodding to Rune, Lumiere, Osage, Gemini and Mustard in turn. &quot;Take care of yourselves, and congratulations on evolving again, Rune.&quot; Lastly, he turned to the powerful Arbok. &quot;Nagini... thanks for keeping an eye out for me. Those Fearow would have had me a couple of times if not for you. I really appreciate you watching my back and... I hope to see you again someday.&quot; he hissed quietly, trying not to display his emotions too obviously. Job done, he slunk back to meet his teammate, whereupon both burrowed into the ground, heading in the direction the flare had come from.<br />
<br />
<br />
Time for a shift change...<br />
<br />
<br />
<u>Fang, Aria, Agnes, Cuddy:</u><br />
Not far from where certain predatory plants were gathered, a Paras rummaged about in the shade of a tree, having unearthed some roots which it was busy drawing nutrients from, which were soon transferred to the pair of mushrooms on his back. The fungi were his armour, ensuring that any would-be predators would get a faceful of spores to leave some horrible lasting ailment while he could make good his escape. Just along from the Bug-type sat another odd plant, a sweet-smelling yellow bell supported by a long stem, planted in the ground in the sunlight. It wasn't long before the scent attracted visitors, a Combee flitting out to investigate the strange flower, intent on sampling some nectar to take back to its hive and convert into honey.<br />
<br />
This would prove to be a mistake. As the Bug-type got closer, it suddenly found itself caught as a pair of <b>Vines Whip</b>ped outward, lashing around its frail wings and holding it fast. Slowly, a pair of beady opened on the bell, while its opening widened to reveal it as the head and mouth of a Bellsprout. &quot;Mmm, lunch!&quot; she declared, and before the hapless insect could react it was crammed straight into the cavernous bloom, still alive. Though powerful secretions within would ensure that didn't last for long. After a few minutes, the meal was entirely digested, and she turned back to her fellow Grass-type. &quot;Well, that was delicious. How was your meal, Cuddy?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Paras turned, his mouthparts letting go of their hold on the tree roots. &quot;Not bad, bit musty though.&quot; he responded. &quot;Not quite as fresh as the live prey you're used to, Agnes.&quot; he sighed, a hint of jealousy in his voice. Though the mushrooms didn't have a huge stranglehold on his mind yet, they influenced his brain enough to steer him toward food they wanted him to eat rather than food <i>he</i> wanted him to eat. And thus he was in for a life of sucking tree roots dry. &quot;Anyway, shall we see what's going on around here?&quot; he asked, starting to look around the wooded area as his teammate slowly pulled her root-like feet up from below the ground, allowing her to move around more easily.<br />
<br />
<br />
<u>Pisces, Nagini, Eous, Sterope, Moist, Henry:</u><br />
In the depths of the lake, barely visible from the surface, a strange lightshow was taking place. Two bright yellow, teardrop-shaped lights would flicker on for a second, illuminating the surrounding water for a few seconds, before a few feet away several dots lit up, leading up to a small, fish-like shape. This alternated for a few minutes before all of the lights intensified, revealing their origins - a Chinchou and a Huntail, each testing out their bioluminescent lures. The former seemed smug. &quot;See? My lights shine way brighter than yours, Moist!&quot;<br />
<br />
The Huntail shrugged. Which is impressive when you have no arms. &quot;Brightness isn't everything, Henry. Well it is, but not that kind.&quot; he added with a mutter, brandishing his lure-shaped tail. &quot;A faint glow and the <i>shape</i> of bait is far more enticing. Simply dangle it in front of the mouth, wait for something to swim along, and...&quot; The Water-type's jaws suddenly distended to a horrifying size, snapping forward to where his tail had been, surely capable of engulfing even the biggest possible meal.<br />
<br />
His cohort nodded, evidently impressed. &quot;True. Though as an Electric-type, I can simply stun my prey and hold them in place when they get too close. Paralysed food is so easy to eat, there's almost no fighting back... unless it's a bloody Barboach, of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
The gulper eel showed a mouth full of teeth in a slack-jawed grin. &quot;There's always a way to get a meal. Tell you what, let's see whose lure is better the old-fashioned way - first to three courses wins?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're on.&quot; Henry replied, dimming his lights slightly to shroud his body in darkness, while Moist did likewise, only his fish-like tail visible amid the gloom, ready to see what would investigate...<br />
<br />
<br />
<u>Hermione, Scorpius, Angua, Carrot:</u><br />
To any nearby carnivores, the scent of cooked meat would have been heavenly. And indeed it had been. A pair of predators were just now finishing off a meal, the carcass of some poor unfortunate Pokémon further down the food chain utterly used up. A Luxio looked up, licking his lips. &quot;Mmm, delicious.&quot; he purred.<br />
<br />
His companion, a Houndour, did likewise. &quot;They say that if you let something get scared before you kill it, it spoils the flavour.&quot; she replied, a grin on her features. &quot;I disagree, if anything the adrenaline gives it more of a kick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You say that like you could taste it after you roast the food.&quot; the Electric-type responded, grinning back. Having a Fire-type on side did help spice up mealtimes, that was for sure. The canine released a burst of fire from her maw, incinerating the remainder of the unidentified body, before nuzzling up to her partner. &quot;You're a great cook though, thanks Angua.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem, sweetie.&quot; the Dark Pokémon replied, licking his fur once before standing up, her ears flicking around. &quot;Want to go see what else we can find now we've eaten?&quot; she asked of her boyfriend, Carrot rising along with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, we could always go that way and see what startled them in the first place.&quot; he replied, heading away from the scene of their feast with Angua walking alongside him. Behind them, scattered around the clearing, lay several deep blue feathers that wouldn't look out of place on a Swellow...<br />

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: #00FF00"><b>Vi, Brittany, Amelia, Conis, Rubeus, Captain Stomach:</b> It was a while after the girls left a gang of Ursaring to a superhero Swalot, but they eventually came across another group of Pokemon, but Toby and Zyra weren't with them. It was actually a village that they ran into, and many young Normal-type Pokemon and a few Diglett, along with their parents and a white-finned Stunfisk, could be seen in it. At one point, a Sentret noticed the four females--more importantly, the berries they were holding--and they were soon the center of attention as the young, wild Pokemon and the Stunfisk named Rubeus were all wondering how they got past the Ursaring. Vi, noticing she was getting special attention for how strong she looked, stood forward as the four explained what happened: &quot;<i>Hehe, you guys may be right, I probably could take 'em on...but we didn't have to.</i>&quot;<br />
&quot;<i>Yeah, this guy named Captain Stomach showed up and made short work of their leader!</i>&quot; Brittany said excitedly.<br />
&quot;<i>Uh-huh, we pwobabwy would've had somethin' weawy bad happen to us, but he saved us!</i>&quot; Amelia chirped in.<br />
&quot;<i>Mm-hmm, he's a real hero!</i>&quot; Conis added.<br />
&quot;<i><span style="font-size: 9px">Still think I could've taken 'em...</span></i>&quot; Vi muttered to herself. &quot;<i>Anyway,</i>&quot; she continued out loud, &quot;<i>those creeps shouldn't be giving you any more trouble once he's through with 'em.</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
Then they heard about how everyone in the village was trying to gather berries for themselves but were beaten up by the Ursaring every time they tried. &quot;<i>No wonder you want our berries...</i>&quot; Conis bleated sadly. The four soon looked at each other and nodded before Vi stepped forward again, setting down the armful of berries she was carrying. &quot;<i>Here, you can have these,</i>&quot; she said to Rubeus and the villagers as the others added their own berries to the pile. &quot;<i>We were going to take these to our teammates, but you probably need them more than we do.</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls were given a few moments to enjoy the company of the village before a Growlithe with a scarf signifying that he was one of the staff in the park appeared, sniffing around until he came towards the four girls. &quot;<i>You four belong to a human named Hyrem, right?</i>&quot; he asked.<br />
&quot;<i>Yeah, that's right,</i>&quot; Vi answered again. &quot;<i>What's up?</i>&quot;<br />
&quot;<i>Your trainer is looking for you,</i>&quot; the Growlithe explained.<br />
&quot;<i>Oh, I guess it's time to go then,</i>&quot; Brittany said sadly.<br />
&quot;<i>See ya around, everyone!</i>&quot; Vi waved to the village as they left.<br />
&quot;<i>Take care!</i>&quot; said Conis before turning to the Growlithe. &quot;<i>So are Toby and Zyra coming too? They're our teammates.</i>&quot;<br />
&quot;<i>Yes, another Growlithe is fetching them,</i>&quot; the Puppy Pokemon confirmed.<br />
&quot;<i>Wondew what it's about?</i>&quot; Mia asked.<br />
&quot;<i>Your trainer said something about gifts, I think.</i>&quot;<br />
&quot;<i>Gifts!?</i>&quot; Brittany asked, clapping with excitement. &quot;<i>Oh boy, let's go!!</i>&quot; she squealed as she rolled towards the entrance ahead of the others, who were running or flying right behind her.<br />
<br />
{Vi, Amelia, Brittany, and Conis have left the Tree Grove.}<br />
<br />
<b>Zyra, Toby, Mustrum, Gytha, Dennis, Pomona, Meowth, Arondight, Iachima:</b> The battle heated up even further as Mustrum wore down Toby's defenses with nasty <b>Acid</b> and <b>Crunch</b> attacks and even caused Toby to flinch from a <b>Headbutt</b> to the forehead! However, what Toby lacked in stat reduction, he more than made up for in outright damage as he could tell the Eelektrik was at a low amount of health after a critical-hitting <b>Tackle</b> and a <b>Rock Climb</b> made plenty of good bruises on his body. Still, Mustrum looked undaunted as he looked to make another lunge, but Toby stood his ground, ready to take whatever the lamprey was about to throw at him. Suddenly, Gytha intervened and stopped the match before Mustrum became too injured, causing the Eelektrik to stand down and gobble up the Sitrus Berries the Skiploom offered him. &quot;<i>Whew,</i>&quot; Toby let out a good sigh of relief, &quot;<i>that was a good match.</i>&quot; As he too was offered Sitrus Berries from Gytha, his eyes lit up at the sour fruits. &quot;<i>Mmm, thanks, Gytha!</i>&quot; he said before using his bigger jaws to squish the juiciest Sitrus Berry he could see, causing the berry to squirt its insides all over the place, though most of it did end up inside his mouth giving him tons of flavor to be happy about before he swallowed the mush down and repeated the process with some of the other berries as his lighter wounds were healed. <br />
<br />
&quot;<i>That was great!</i>&quot; Zyra soon said as she bounded towards him in an excited state. &quot;<i>You're really good at battling, Toby!</i>&quot;<br />
&quot;<i>Well, all a result of the training I had, I suppose,</i>&quot; he replied humbly before pushing two Sitrus Berries towards the Bulbasaur {remember that Zyra hadn't evolved yet!}. &quot;<i>Here, you can have the rest. I'm already healed up.</i>&quot;<br />
&quot;<i>Really!? Thanks!</i>&quot; she replied back, starting to blush again as she bit into the berries getting juice all over her face by the time she was done.<br />
<br />
Mustrum then expressed gratitude for being able to spar with Toby and then interest in having a real battle with him someday. &quot;<i>No problem!</i>&quot; Toby said in his usual, casual manner. &quot;<i>Feel free to ask for another battle if we do meet again!</i>&quot; At that point, Mustrum and Gytha decided it was time to go and said their good-byes. &quot;<i>Bye, Mustrum and Gytha! It was nice meeting you guys!</i>&quot; Zyra said with a wave. And, in reply to Mustrum claiming he'd win the next time they battled, Toby said, &quot;<i>You're welcome to try! We're at Cortoza, if you ever visit there!</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
Not long after the Skiploom and Eelektrik left, a Growlithe approached the group, specifically Toby and Zyra. &quot;<i>You two belong to a human named Hyrem, right?</i>&quot;<br />
&quot;<i>That we do~</i>&quot; Toby answered.<br />
&quot;<i>Good, he's calling for you. He said he had some gifts for his team, and he wants you to be there.</i>&quot;<br />
&quot;<i>Ooo, gifts~?</i>&quot; Zyra's eyes lit up at the word. &quot;<i>Let's go, Toby, let's go, I wanna see what they are!</i>&quot;<br />
&quot;<i>Sure thing,</i>&quot; Toby added. &quot;<i>I'm in the mood for some goodies.</i>&quot; He then lay his body down and tipped his shell toward Zyra. &quot;<i>Here, hop on, it'll be faster that way.</i>&quot;<br />
<i>H-h-hop on??</i> Zyra thought, starting to blush again. <i>He-he wants to give me a ride?? He's <u>gotta</u> love me if he's willing to do that... there's no other reason...</i><br />
&quot;<i>...Well? You coming on my shell or what?</i>&quot; Toby asked, wondering why she was acting so weird again.<br />
&quot;<i>O-oh, yeah...</i>&quot; Zyra came to her senses again and clamored on top of his shell as best she could.<br />
&quot;<i>All right, we're off then! Bye everyone, thanks for reffing for me and Mustrum, Meowth! Lead the way, Growlithe!</i>&quot; Toby said as he followed the dog back to the entrance of the park where Hyrem was waiting.<br />
<br />
{Toby and Zyra have left the Tree Grove.}<br />

******************<br />
<br />
<b>Luke, Selina, Henry, Moist, Sterope, Eous, Pisces, Nagini:</b> &quot;<i>Mmmm, you look so much more handsome now~</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
A Purrloin with a black cap that had a red &quot;P&quot; on it was busy following a blue lion with a black mane starting to grow in, and yellow on the inside of his ears, yellow eyes, a yellow star on his black tail, and two yellow rings on each foreleg. He was trying his best to ignore Selina's fawning over him, and in this case Luke was able to distract himself quite easily with the thrill of having evolved recently:<br />
<br />
<blockquote class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">
<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandContent ">
&quot;Let's finish this up and call it a day! Luke, use Spark, and Silas, use Flame Charge!&quot;<br />
<br />
As Shinx and Houndour collided with electricity and flames clashing against each other, they were both giving it their all and neither giving an inch. You'd think that with the Speed boost and the size advantage Silas would win out, but in the end the two attacks turned out to be evenly matched, and they both broke away with neither one being any more worse off than the other was. &quot;Okay, that should be good! Great work you two!&quot; Hyrem's words encouraged both Pokemon.<br />
&quot;<i>Dour dour!</i>&quot; Silas barked as he sat down and relaxed himself.<br />
&quot;<i>Shinx shiiiinx!!</i>&quot; Luke gave the best roar a lion cub possibly could when suddenly his body began to glow. &quot;Ah...&quot; Hyrem knew what was happening and got excited for it. As Luke's body began to grow to almost twice his size, his hair began to grow out, and his features became more defined. When the glowing stopped, his body was still blue, black, and yellow, but more of his body was covered by long, black fur. &quot;There we go, you finally evolved, Luke! Let's check it out...&quot; said Hyrem as he checked his Pokedex for more information:<br />
<br />
<b><i>Luxio, the Spark Pokemon, and the evolved form of Shinx. As Shinx evolve into Luxio, they break off into smaller groups. They communicate by touching someone with their claws and giving them a slight jolt of electricity. They subdue their prey by grabbing on and shocking them with their claws, causing their foe to faint from the paralysis.</i></b><br />
<br />
&quot;Great job! You finally evolved, Luke!&quot; Hyrem said before holding his hand out to pet him. Luke took it as his own opportunity to show off a new trick and put his paw on Hyrem's hand, giving it a nice jolt and causing him to draw his hand back a bit. &quot;Ow! Wait, was that...&quot; Hyrem looked at the Pokedex entry again and figured out that it was Luke communicating with him. &quot;Okay then, guess I'll need to figure out how to speak 'Luxio-shock-ese' or something...&quot; &quot;Luxio...&quot; Luke grumbled and rolled his eyes at the idiotic comment, but was still pumped about the evolution...<br />
<br />
<b>Evolution!!</b> Shinx evolved into Luxio!
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote>...even to this day. Now he was more capable than ever to handle a battle on his own, and it proved all his training wasn't going for naught. He absolutely felt stronger, much more than he could ever have been as a Shinx, and-<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Ooo, a lake!</i>&quot; Selina interrupted his thoughts. &quot;<i>Come on, Luke, let's go catch some fish!</i>&quot;<br />
&quot;<i>...Why?</i>&quot; Luke asked skeptically.<br />
&quot;<i>So we can have lunch, silly!</i>&quot; the Purrloin giggled. &quot;<i>I'm not up to anything, I promise!</i>&quot;<br />
&quot;<i>That's what you said last time,</i>&quot; came the indignant reply from Luke as he rolled his eyes. The last time he was brought into Selina's mischief, he was involved in helping Selina nab some special gem that was somehow valuable to humans (which made Luke question why Selina even needed such a thing in the first place if it didn't have much significance to a Pokemon). Of course, as Luke thought about this, Selina was already at the lake, which caused Luke to grumble before he followed her so that he would make sure she didn't get into any trouble as she usually would.<br />
<br />
As Selina approached the lake, she could see two lights right next to each other. &quot;<i>Ooo, I know what that is~</i>&quot; she said hungrily as she began licking her chops. Two bright lights next to each other was an obvious sign of a certain Pokemon trying to lure something in. &quot;<i>Time to go fishing...</i>&quot; She began to lay low before gently pawing the water, creating ripples in an attempt to cause the illusion of prey nearby and draw the Pokemon behind the lights closer to her...<br />
<br />
Luke rolled his eyes and said, &quot;<i>Have fun with that,</i>&quot; before going to a nearby area of the lake. He wasn't going to admit it to Selina, but he was slightly hungry as well. In fact, at that moment a tiny fish swimming through the lake caught his attention. Perhaps a light snack wouldn't hurt...he too crouched low but simply waited and watched to see where the little fish would go; if the fish came close enough to where he was, he was willing to make a grab for it, then he would only need to shock it and keep it from struggling, making it an easy snack...<br />
<br />
<b>Happy, Silas, Kenna, Ahri, Carrot, Angua, Scorpius, Hermione:</b><br />
Today would be the first adventure that involved four different Fire-type Pokemon: a Flareon, a Houndour, a Ponyta, and a Vulpix, all sharing the same ability, Flash Fire, hence the name they came up for themselves, Team Flash Fire. &quot;<i>Wow, this'll be our first adventure together!</i>&quot; the Flareon named Happy said with excitement, his fluff flowing in the nice breeze as he walked. Technically, Happy was the first Pokemon of the four Hyrem started raising, but his immaturity made it hard for his juniors to respect him.<br />
&quot;<i>It sure will be,</i>&quot; the Houndour named Silas added with more reserve than Happy. &quot;<i>So let's make sure the Pokemon around here have a good first impression of us.</i>&quot; Silas was more or less the level-headed Pokemon of the team and therefore considered the team's real leader unlike Happy.<br />
&quot;<i>Yeah, I'm ready for this like a Sunflora's ready for some good ol' sunshine!</i>&quot; the Ponyta known as Kenna chimed in as she trotted in between Happy and Silas. Sitting on top of her was a Vulpix who wasn't quite as enthused about being out here.<br />
&quot;<i>Just...as long as I don't have to set foot on the dirt roads out here, I'll be fine,</i>&quot; she whined, making sure she was keeping her balance on Kenna's back. It wouldn't do Ahri any good to fall onto the ground from a height like that, especially since there were occasional mud puddles about from the rain.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a loud screeching could be heard in the distance, and before anyone could react a dark blur zoomed just over Kenna...and right into Ahri! She quickly lost her balance and yelped as she began to fall, but Silas was just as quick and was able to position himself to catch the falling Vulpix onto his back. Still shocked from the fall, it took Ahri a moment to realize she didn't have a dirty fur coat but was on Silas's back instead. &quot;<i>Th-thanks,</i>&quot; she blurted out softly, to which Silas replied, &quot;<i>You're welcome,</i>&quot; as he glanced over his shoulder and onto the face of a fox that had an ever-so-slight blush to her cheeks. &quot;<i>Y'all okay?</i>&quot; Kenna asked as she lowered her body to allow Ahri to jump onto her back again. Silas nodded back, &quot;<i>She's fine, just a little shook up,</i>&quot; as Ahri chose to stay on Silas's back instead of mounting onto Kenna again; Silas's bony ridges felt easier to hold onto than Kenna's fiery mane. Well, that's the excuse she gave herself, at least.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>AAAH, AAAH, I'M ON FIRE!!</i>&quot; a voice could be heard from the other side, and the four Fire-types looked to find a Swellow rubbing its belly along the ground trying to put out the flames on it, though this tactic wasn't going to get rid of the flames on its back. This must have been the Pokemon that knocked Ahri over, and it likely took a down full of fire from Kenna's mane in the process! &quot;<i>We must help it! Happy, go calm it down so we can put out the flames for it!</i>&quot; Silas ordered. &quot;<i>Gotcha!</i>&quot; Happy nodded before blowing special pink bubbles towards the bird, and as they popped harmlessly against the bird it began to Yawn repeatedly until it fell asleep with the fires on its back and wings still active. The four quickly went to work, however, sucking the flames into their mouths and eating the fire, then bathing the poor, sleeping bird with their tongues until it looked as clean as possible, though many of its feathers were partially burnt away, and its tail feathers were quite short, meaning it may be a while before it could fly again.<br />
<br />
As the Yawn spell wore off, the Swellow woke up to find itself surrounded by its rescuers. &quot;<i>AAAH!! NO, DON'T EAT ME!!</i>&quot; it squawked loudly before trying to take flight and failing. &quot;<i>Calm down, Swellow!</i>&quot; Silas barked at the bird. &quot;<i>You'll need some time to recover before you can fly. Now would you please tell us what happened to make you fly by us so fast?</i>&quot;<br />
&quot;<i>You want me to tell you!? I'll tell you! My buddy 'n I were gonna eat a Weedle, but then a big, scary Drapion came and threatened to kill us 'n everything, so we flew away from them, then my buddy got ambushed by some predators while we were flyin' away, then he got cooked up and eaten, and I don't wanna be eaten too, pleeeease don't eat meeeeee!!</i>&quot; Swellow started sobbing and cowering before the Fire-types.<br />
&quot;<i>I dunno,</i>&quot; Happy replied, &quot;<i>I'm starting to get a little hung- PBBBBBBT</i>&quot; he didn't get to finish before his face got squished by Kenna's hoof Stomping him to the ground.<br />
&quot;<i>Y'all can ignore our lil' varmint here,</i>&quot; Kenna assured the Swellow. &quot;<i>We ain't gonna eat ya, I'll make sure of it!</i>&quot;<br />
&quot;<i>Y-y-y-you really won't?</i>&quot; said Swellow, his lower lip quivering from so much crying.<br />
&quot;<i>You'll get out of this unharmed.</i>&quot; Silas promised. &quot;<i><b>Right, Happy?</b></i>&quot; all three of the Flareon's teammates asking him at the same time.<br />
&quot;<i>Ogghay, 'm showwy...</i>&quot; he weakly spoke under Kenna's hoof.<br />
&quot;<i>Then it's settled,</i>&quot; Silas finished. &quot;<i>Swellow, I can carry you until we figure out how to help you fly again, would that be okay with you?</i>&quot;<br />
&quot;<i>I-I guess...</i>&quot; Swellow gave a few weak chirps before Kenna helped nudge his body onto Silas while Ahri had to jump onto Kenna again since there was no room on Silas's back for both Pokemon.<br />
&quot;<i>All right then... Team Flash Fire, let's move out!</i>&quot; Silas gave the order.<br />
&quot;<i>Aye!</i>&quot; the others responded before the four Pokemon--plus a Swellow in tow--began looking for some sort of help down the road.</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: #944D94"><span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Vi, Brittany, Amelia, Conis, Rubeus, Captain Stomach:</u></b> Vi was the first to speak, explaining that while they could've tackled the Ursaring themselves, it didn't actually have to come to that. The others explained that someone else had stepped in and fought off the Ursaring's leader. Once the name &quot;Captain Stomach&quot; was spoken, however, the young Pokémon began murmuring excitedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Captain Stomach!?&quot; exclaimed a Zigzagoon. He turned to the Zigzagoon next to him. &quot;I told you! I told you he wasn't a myth!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does he really use his mustache to suck the energy outta bad guys?&quot; asked an excitable Patrat.<br />
<br />
The Watchog parents who had just watched Rubeus heal their son approached the four and explained to them. &quot;Every so often, some Murkrow will visit our village and bring us food to try and help us out,&quot; the mother explained. &quot;And they always tell the children these stories about some superhero called Captain Stomach, who apparently fights crime every night in the cities. I didn't think he was real, until, of course, just now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Captain Stomach's real enough,&quot; Rubeus confirmed. &quot;My Trainer watches the news on TV every day, tries to keep up with Captain Stomach's heroic deeds. He's quite a fan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Vi and the others came to a decision- these Pokémon needed these berries way more than they did. They set their berries down and told the town that they could take the berries. This elicited excited cheering from the small Pokémon, and even some cheering from the parents, but at that point, several loud footsteps could be heard directly behind the Combusken, Mareep, Spheal, and Taillow. It was the Ursaring gang, sans their leader.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think so,&quot; smirked one of the Ursaring. &quot;Those berries came from our trees, so how about you just hand them over now, and- ulp!&quot;<br />
<br />
For at that moment, a pair of glowing green tendrils wrapped themselves around all the Ursaring, who immediately struggled to stand. As he collapsed, he revealed a tall purple blob behind him, dressed in a red outfit. The Ursaring groaned as Captain Stomach sucked out his energy through his mustache, the Giga Drain doing its work well.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought I said to leave them alone,&quot; said the superhero.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not a chance,&quot; growled one of the Ursaring, before charging at Captain Stomach. The <b>Dynamic</b> blob responded with a swift <b>Punch</b> to the Ursaring's gut, right in the middle of that yellow ring, and there was a powerful explosion on contact. The Ursaring was sent flying off into the distance, propelled by the blast. The young Pokémon were in awe at the sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I don't know about you, but I'm having a blast,&quot; quipped Captain Stomach, addressing the remaining five Ursaring. The Hibernator Pokémon exchanged looks and nods, before charging towards the superhero all at once. But Captain Stomach didn't seem too bothered by this. In fact, he looked rather bored. In fact, he was yawning! At first it looked to be a bored yawn, before a pink bubble came out of his mouth, revealing his yawn to be the <b>Yawn</b> attack. The big pink bubble popped against all the Ursaring, and they slumped to the ground, fast asleep before they knew what hit them. Then, Captain Stomach's Marvelous Mustache of Might extended itself once more, and this time wound tightly around the Ursaring, intent on <b>Wring</b>ing every last bit of strength <b>Out</b> of them before they could awaken. Finally, Captain Stomach belched up a length of rope, which he swiftly used to tie up the remaining Ursaring.<br />
<br />
Every resident of the village was cheering loudly, though Rubeus was watching Captain Stomach. Something about him looked familiar, but he couldn't place it.<br />
<br />
&quot;These jokers won't be bothering you anymore,&quot; he assured them. He grabbed the tied-up Ursaring and held them up over his head in an amazing feat of Strength. &quot;Captain Stomach, away!&quot; And he bounded away, intent on turning the Ursaring gang in to the park staff.<br />
<br />
Afterwards, a park staff Growlithe approached them and told Vi and the others that Hyrem was looking for them. They said their goodbyes, as did Rubeus and the grateful residents of Oran Village. Once they were gone, the younger Pokémon started helping themselves to the berries, while some of the parents cautiously headed off towards the Oran trees, wondering if it really was safe to pick berries again. Smiling at how things were turning out, Rubeus flapped his fins and flew around the village, knowing he still had a few more Pokémon to heal.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>Fang, Aria, Agnes, Cuddy:</u></b> Fang and Aria's alone time, however, proved to be rather short-lived, for not long after Marvolo left them alone, a Sweet Scent could be detected. The Carnivine and Roserade liked the scent, and it wasn't actually bothering them, the scent was attracting a number of mesmerized Combee and Mothim. As Fang noticed them, he started to salivate, a fact that did not go unnoticed by Aria, who gave a small smile. &quot;Feeling up for some dessert, Fang?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
The Carnivine's grin widened. &quot;I could eat,&quot; he conceded. Truthfully, he was still a little full from his lunch, but he never tired of seeing Aria in action.<br />
<br />
Still smiling, Aria sprang into action. With both of her flower bouquets glowing brightly, she aimed her arms at the entranced swarms of bugs and unleashed her <b>Dazzling Gleam</b>, the magical light inflicting damage upon every one of them, save for one Combee, who had the fortune to fly out of range of the attack (though considering what happened to it afterwards, one might not necessarily call it <i>good</i> fortune...). Many of the Combee and some of the Mothim collapsed to the ground, while the others remained airborne, though they all now were glaring at the Roserade. Undaunted, Aria nodded at Fang, who lunged at the fallen Bug-types, chomping them with great speed and efficiency. All he was missing was the Pac-Man sound effects. Outraged by Fang's actions, the Combee and Mothim all started to converge on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no, you don't,&quot; Aria said ominously. She focused energy into her feet, and though their surroundings were mostly grass anyway, the surrounding <b>Terrain</b> became particularly <b>Grassy</b>. Any exposed dirt was quickly replaced by lush, green grass, and the existing grass seemed to become much fresher and healthier. With that done, Aria then fired off a horribly powerful <b>Leaf Storm</b>, fueled not only by her being a Grass-type, but also by the Grassy Terrain, both of which combined to basically overcome the Bug/Flying-types' natural resistance to Grass. Falling Combee and Mothim started to litter the ground, and Aria raced towards them, feeling slightly more refreshed with each step she took on the Grassy Terrain. She knew the bugs would feel more refreshed the longer they were lying on the Grassy Terrain, so they had to work fast. Fang knew this as well, and continued going after the Combee and Mothim, managing to chomp many of them before they hit the ground. The ones that did hit the ground, Aria made short work of, dancing elegantly from one to the next as she unleashed her <b>Fury Cutter</b> upon them. Fang watched this as he chewed a particularly sweet Combee, never one to get tired of his girlfriend's dancing skills, and once all the Bug-types either lay dead on the ground or were being digested by Fang, Aria stopped her attack and started to feast on the nearest Mothim. Fang slowed down with his eating, more than willing to share with the Roserade.<br />
<br />
Just as the Grassy Terrain wore off, and they were down to a small pile of slaughtered Mothim, Fang and Aria could see a pair of Pokémon coming their way. One of them was a Bellsprout- another carnivorous plant, Fang and Aria both knew, especially as one of their teammates was a Victreebel, the final evolution of Bellsprout. The other, however, was a Paras, and Fang couldn't help but start drooling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, Fang, dear,&quot; Aria murmured, upon noticing this. &quot;Remember what happened the last time you went for a Paras?&quot;<br />
<br />
That was enough to stop Fang. Indeed, he remembered all too well, and suppressed a shudder at the memory. As he had discussed with Marvolo earlier, he had snuck up on a Paras from behind, only for it to, with priceless timing, fart in his face. That would've ruined his appetite coming from any species of prey in and of itself, but it got worse- that day was when Fang learned the hard way that Paras's Effect Spore comes out that end, in addition to coming out of the mushrooms. Oh, that was not a good day.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; Fang grinned, greeting the pair of Grass-types as they approached. &quot;I am Fang, and this is my girlfriend, the lovely Aria.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you're out hunting,&quot; Aria said to the Bellsprout, &quot;it's a good day for it. Me and Fang just got done with an entire swarm of Combee and Mothim.&quot; As she spoke, she pointed with her blue bouquet (which was stained with blood in places) to the pile of dead Mothim. &quot;Help yourself to these, by the way- we're full, and we'd rather they not go to waste.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>Pisces, Nagini, Eous, Sterope, Moist, Henry, Selina, Luke:</u></b> As Pisces swam away from Nagini and the Ponyta and Blitzle, she kept her eyes open for potential prey. Various wild Pokémon caught her eye, but she could find issue with each one of them. She first spotted the frilly blue appearance of a male Frillish, but dismissed it immediately- Frillish were Ghost-types, and composed almost entirely of water. They had very, very little in the way of meat, and from what Pisces had heard, it was pretty damn far from delicious. Ignoring the fancy jellyfish, she continued to look around. She didn't spare the Magikarp so much as a second of consideration- Magikarp's scales were obnoxiously tough, capable of shattering the toughest of teeth. And while Pisces enjoyed a good crunch as much as anyone, she greatly preferred said crunch to actually lead somewhere- Magikarp are all skin and bones, no meat at all, this was Pokémon predator basics. Something was splashing around near the surface, but a simple glance in that direction revealed to Pisces that it was merely a Purrloin's paw, the Purrloin clearly after her lunch. Pisces had half a mind to go after the Purrloin, confident she'd be a match for the Dark-type, but noticed the hat the Purrloin was wearing. The Purrloin clearly had a Trainer, and Pisces wasn't fool enough to go for obviously Trainer-owned Pokémon, not with Nagini in such close proximity. And then, the Blue-Striped Basculin's narrow eyes lit up hungrily- a Goldeen was swimming off in the distance, and it hadn't noticed her. <i>Perfect.</i><br />
<br />
Pisces silently swam off in pursuit of the Goldeen. They really did make amazing meals- their elegant appearance made for acceptable presentation, there was plenty of meat on them, and the horn could be used as a toothpick afterwards. Just the thought was making her even hungrier, and so she accelerated slightly, moving just the tiniest bit faster. The Goldeen still hadn't noticed that its days were numbered- or indeed, its minutes. And then, once Pisces was close enough, she focused energy into her right fin, and then with a sudden burst of speed, slashed at the Goldeen with the fin, the <b>Cut</b> attack taking the horned fish by surprise. Frantically, Goldeen proceeded to <u>Swim</u> away, its movements very <u>Swift</u> indeed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, good,&quot; smirked Pisces. &quot;Swift Swim- this means you don't have Water Veil. Because today I think I'd like my lunch served hot!&quot; As she said this, she punctuated the statement by unleashing a stream of <b>Scald</b>ing hot water from her mouth, striking the Goldeen directly and causing it to cry out in pain, the resisted attack more powerful than usual, thanks to Pisces's <u>Adaptability</u>. It was forced to stop, as the Scald attack left a nasty burn on one of the fins, and this allowed Pisces to move in close, mouth agape, razor-sharp teeth clearly visible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah- uh- um- eep!&quot; the Goldeen stammered, before enduring the pain from the burn and hastily swimming straight down, in hopes of losing Pisces by descending into the dark depths of the lake, where visibility would be minimal. It posed a risk to her as well, sure, but right now it was looking like the lesser of two evils.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you don't!&quot; roared Pisces, and she swam after her intended meal. As the chase continued, Pisces fired off another Scald, just as the Goldeen was about to swim past several strange dim lights in the water, several yards away from them. Pisces noticed these lights, and alluring though they looked, she had bigger fish to fry- literally. She unleashed a third Scald attack, this one hitting the frantic Goldeen right in the face. Pisces smirked her satisfaction- the lighting might be poor, but the Goldeen was starting to smell pretty appetizing. In a last-ditch effort to not die, Goldeen charged up, attempting to fend Pisces off with <b>Horn Attack</b>. In response, Pisces swam down and met Goldeen with a <b>Headbutt</b>, deftly swerving to avoid the horn and instead slam into the side. This caught Goldeen off-guard, allowing Pisces to make her move. Her tail fin glowed brightly, and she slammed the Goldeen hard with it in a terrific display of <b>Superpower</b>. The Goldeen was not launched nearly as far as the attack would've launched it on dry land, of course, but it still achieved a respectable distance, and more to the point, appeared to be unconscious... or perhaps a little worse off then that.<br />
<br />
But it mattered not to Pisces- whether the Goldeen was merely unconscious or whether that Superpower ended its life, it would be dead in a matter of seconds anyway. Charging at the nicely cooked fish, Pisces opened her mouth ravenously, revealing her razor-sharp teeth, and went to work. It was a gruesome spectacle, and if that Superpower hadn't killed the Goldeen, it was certainly dead now, considering half of it was now inside the Basculin.<br />
<br />
As Pisces sighed contentedly after swallowing another mouthful of cooked Goldeen, she noticed the lights again. This time, now that the adrenaline rush from hunting the Goldeen had worn off, she immediately realized something- the most likely source of light in such deep, dark water would no doubt be that of other predators. In a way, Pisces kinda envied the underwater predators that could light up parts of their body to draw in their prey. She had to take a very active approach in taking her prey, and while she found it to be good exercise, sometimes she liked the idea of being able to lure the prey in to her. That said, ever since befriending her Trainer's Shiny Slowbro, Pisces was of the opinion that aquatic predators should stick together. Turning back to the Goldeen carcass, she bit the horn off, and then slapped the half-eaten corpse with her tail fin, sending it gently floating in the direction of the lights, a little gift for her fellow predators. She was still a little hungry, but the half she had eaten made a significant difference. As the Goldeen carcass floated towards the lights, Pisces used her fins to take the Goldeen horn from her mouth and use it to pick bits of Goldeen meat out of her teeth. Tricky to do for a Basculin, but anyone who's gotten Goldeen meat between their teeth before would agree, absolutely necessary. And as she did so, she could hear the faint splashing sounds the Purrloin was making in an effort to draw in some fish. &quot;Hey,&quot; Pisces murmured to in the direction of the lights. &quot;Ignore that splashing up there. It's a Purrloin trying to lure in her lunch.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>Hermione, Scorpius, Angua, Carrot, Happy, Silas, Kenna, Ahri:</u></b> Elsewhere, a Houndour and Luxio just got finished roasting and eating their meal, and were now mildly curious as to just what had scared their prey. As it turns out, their meal had been... a Swellow. And so, as they headed off in the direction the Swellow had come from, they soon happened upon a clearing where a Drapion and a Weedle were now training. The Drapion was carrying a large and heavy log in his powerful claws, and as the Houndour and Luxio arrived, he set it down on the ground with a loud thump. The log towered over the Weedle, whose tail stinger was an inky black. Then, a <b>Shadow</b>y aura came over the distinctly <b>Claw</b>-shaped tail stinger, seeming to form an even bigger claw shape, and she charged forward, with remarkable speed for something with such stubby legs. As she drew nearer to the log, she sprang up into the air, and swung her tail stinger at the log, the shadowy aura seeming to pass straight through the log. And then, as the Weedle landed on the ground, the top half of the log slid down off the bottom half and fell to the ground- the Weedle had just used Shadow Claw to slice the log clean in half.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that was more like it,&quot; grinned the Drapion. &quot;I think you've really gotten the hang of the move.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so, too,&quot; agreed the Weedle. &quot;Thanks again for helping me with the move, Scorpius,&quot; she added.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was glad to do it,&quot; replied Scorpius. &quot;Even if I didn't love the idea of helping you, I'll take any excuse to use <b>Poison Tail</b> I can get.&quot; Then, a rumbling sound could be heard- it was coming from the Drapion's stomach. &quot;Eheheh,&quot; Scorpius chuckled sheepishly. &quot;Guess I worked up an appetite.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Same here,&quot; Hermione admitted. &quot;What say I cook up some of those Sitrus Berries we found earlier?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good to me,&quot; said Scorpius. With that, the Drapion and Weedle set to work. The Drapion hacked and Slashed at the remains of the log, reducing it to kindling, while the Weedle arranged stones around the pile of kindling, to keep what would soon be a fire from spreading. Then, the Drapion went off and fetched some sticks, and Hermione unleashed a Firestream from her mouth, igniting the kindling, and before long, the Drapion had speared some Sitrus Berries with the sticks, and was holding them over the fire. Hermione would inspect the Berries, occasionally sniffing at them, making excellent use of her species's keen sense of smell, and would occasionally instruct Scorpius to rotate them, so as to ensure they were evenly cooked on all sides.<br />
<br />
And then, Scorpius saw four Fire-types walking their way. A Ponyta with a Vulpix on her back, a Flareon, and a Houndour, the latter of which was allowing a passenger to ride on his back- a Swellow! The Drapion's eyes narrowed at the sight of one of the very same Swellow that had just tried to eat his girlfriend, but at the same time, he couldn't help but wonder how it got in its current state- it was badly injured, its feathers burned in places. &quot;What the hell happened to that Swellow?&quot; Scorpius asked. He was still holding the sticks on which the Sitrus Berries were roasting, but he was all set to shield Hermione should the Swellow's injured appearance turn out to be a mere ploy.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>Zyra, Toby, Mustrum, Gytha, Dennis, Pomona, Meowth, Arondight, Iachima:</u></b> Meowth watched as the Eelektrik and Grotle kept at it, until the Skiploom floated down between them, declaring the battle to be over. Mustrum wasn't too thrilled at this, but Gytha managed to convince him to stand- er, float- down. She then provided Sitrus Berries for both Mustrum and Toby, and they ate them gratefully, just as a park staff Growlithe approached them, informing Zyra and Toby that Hyrem was looking for them at the park entrance. Everyone said their goodbyes as the Bulbasaur and Grotle headed off. At the same time, Mustrum and Gytha went off to gather their teammates, the former launching an electric blast into the air as a signal to said teammates. This left Meowth, his Bulbasaur and Ivysaur teammates (remember, this took place prior to Dennis's evolution into Ivysaur), and a Scraggy and Shiny Hitmontop that had as of yet gone unnoticed, due to the excitement of the battle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that was an awesome battle!&quot; Dennis grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it was!&quot; smiled Pomona. &quot;Also... I think Zyra really likes Toby,&quot; she added. &quot;I get the same feeling with them I got with Rubeus and Bubbles.&quot; The Bulbasaur nodded- Pomona had told him the story before, of how she helped their Trainer's Stunfisk get together with his Corphish girlfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I tink dey'd make a good couple,&quot; agreed Meowth. He bit into one of the remaining Sitrus Berries at that point. &quot;Mmm,&quot; he added appreciatively. &quot;A few more o' dese, we gots ourselves lunch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good to me,&quot; said Pomona. Looking up, she could see numerous Sitrus Berries growing in the tree branches above. Focusing hard, Pomona charged energy into her flower, and tried to walk so she was in the best position to dislodge as many berries as possible... but she tripped on a rock. As she stumbled, she involuntarily unleashed the <b>Leaf Storm</b> she was charging up, right into Meowth. The powerful Grass move sent Meowth flying.<br />
<br />
&quot;GAAAAAH!&quot; Meowth screamed. &quot;MEOWTH'S BLASTIN' OFF AGAAAAAAIIIIN!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry!&quot; Pomona cried out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dat's okaaaaaaay!&quot; Meowth called back, before flying out of sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh,&quot; sighed Pomona. &quot;Didn't want to do that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, Meowth knows that, big sis,&quot; Dennis reassured her. &quot;I'm sure he'll be OK.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you're right,&quot; Pomona admitted. It was only then that she noticed the pair of Fighting-types. &quot;Oh! Oh, hi!&quot; she greeted them, eager to make new friends. &quot;I'm Pomona, and this is my little brother, Dennis. Who might you be?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>Meowth, Ruby:</u></b> As Meowth flew through the air, he had a remarkable bird's eye view of the Tree Grove. A sight he normally would've taken the time to enjoy, were he not now plummeting towards it at an alarming speed. &quot;Gah!&quot; he whimpered. Thinking fast, Meowth unleashed an <b>Icy Wind</b> attack from his mouth, aimed right at the ground. Slowly, gradually, he slowed down, and the Ice move served to slow his descent enough that he touched the ground completely unscathed. He hastily walked away from the frost-riddled blades of grass, disliking the cold sensation on his feet, but other than that, he was OK.<br />
<br />
&quot;Phew,&quot; Meowth sighed. &quot;Dat was close. Good ting Keith taught me dat Icy Wind move. And then, past several trees, he could see a most welcome sight- a Purrloin in a distinctive black hat- it was Selina! Meowth grinned at the sight of the Purrloin, but as he prepared to approach her, he got a better look at the situation- Selina wasn't alone. She was with a Luxio. And she was flirting with the Luxio. No, more like fawning over him, just as she had once done for Meowth.<br />
<br />
Meowth felt as though he had been stabbed with an icicle. Thinking back, he realized just how often Keith had met up with Hyrem, and of those time, how in nearly all of them in recent months, Hyrem did not have Selina with him, nor did he make any efforts to change this for Meowth's sake. He supposed he ought to have considered this possibility, that Selina had moved on from him. And he supposed it was better that he find out sooner than later, before he'd have the opportunity to do so before making any more of a fool out of himself. As Selina and the Luxio approached a lake and started to fish for their lunch, Meowth stormed away in the opposite direction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmph. Stupid fickle Purrloin,&quot; he grumbled. &quot;Can't believe I didn't see dat comin', wat wit da way she hits on anyting dat meows...&quot; He continued to grumble in this fashion, unable to focus on any of his surroundings, not even when a mischievous Houndour saw the perfect opportunity to set his tail on fire. When this resulted in nothing more than Meowth continuing to storm along like a disgruntled Charmander in a Meowth costume, the Houndour figured something was wrong. And she didn't like when something was wrong with Meowth. When she wasn't the cause of it, anyway.<br />
<br />
Ruby began to walk alongside Meowth. &quot;Meowth, what's wrong?&quot; asked Ruby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ehhh, nuttin' dat concerns youse,&quot; sighed Meowth. &quot;I been a fool, is all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, come on, you can tell me,&quot; whined the Houndour.<br />
<br />
Meowth sighed and stopped. &quot;If youse must know,&quot; he said, &quot;I saw dat Purrloin I was in love wit, hittin' on a Luxio like I didn't exist or nuttin'.&quot; He sighed again, looking as sad and pathetic as Ruby had ever seen him. Feeling sorry for Meowth, Ruby walked around him, discreetly kicking dirt onto his tail to extinguish the fire before he could notice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y'know, if Selina's that fickle that she moves on to someone else without even telling you, sounds to me like you could do way better than her,&quot; the Houndour said, trying to cheer Meowth up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meowth sat down. &quot;I guess,&quot; he conceded. &quot;Still, it's just...&quot; But whatever it was just, Ruby never found out, for Meowth simply buried his face in his paws at that point.<br />
<br />
Determined to cheer Meowth up, Ruby looked around, and saw a grove of Watmel Berries nearby. She crept over to the nearest one, which was huge, and pushed it with all her might, rolling it along the ground. Given that she didn't actually know Strength, this wasn't quite so easy for her, but she figured Meowth would like it. Once she got it over to where Meowth was, Ruby backed up a bit, then fired off a series of Dark Pulse rings at it, trying to angle the rings in a specific way. Three rings of dark energy sliced clean through the Watmel Berry at different angles, which caused it to fall apart into six equal slices. Happy with her work, Ruby turned back to Meowth and licked his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh- gah!&quot; Meowth grunted, trying to wipe the Houndour slobber off his face. &quot;Wat's da big idea- eh?&quot; he said suddenly, noticing the Watmel slices. &quot;Wat's all dis?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pomona always says Watmel Berries make a great snack if you're feeling down,&quot; replied Ruby. &quot;Go ahead, dig in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Tanks,&quot; Meowth said, a small grin of appreciation on his face as he grabbed the nearest slice and started munching on it. He never trusted Ruby too much, due to her tendency to play tricks on him, usually involving fire in some way, but this time, Meowth got the feeling there were no tricks in store, that she was just trying to comfort him. Ruby helped herself to another slice of Watmel Berry once she saw Meowth eating one, her tail wagging happily.</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Stewie, Ginny, Eddie, Scorpina, Gina, Zoran, Dot:</u></b><br />
Eddie's ears pricked up as he smelt something rather... familiar. He hadn't smelt it for a long time but there it was. His little brain went into overdrive trying to figure it out. Then it clicked. It clicked why the Shadow Ledian seemed to look and smell familiar. <br />
<br />
&quot;No way,&quot; he barked at Stewie. &quot;I remember you! You were part of our team when you were just a Ledyba!&quot;<br />
<br />
Gina looked at Eddie and then back at Stewie, &quot;Really? Well I guess he can't be that strong if he is longer part of our team, which is the strongest out there!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, we're the best there is!&quot; declared Scorpina, pointing one of her claws upwards.<br />
<br />
-----------------------<br />
<br />
Zoran listened to Ginny's question and thought for a couple of seconds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that you mention it, yes I do believe a Shadow Ledyba was a member of our team for a while. But unfortunately, Karmas couldn't deal with two shadow pokemon at the same time,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;One of our teammates is a Shadow Chimecho,&quot; Dot explained, &quot;And Karmas had his hands full dealing with both and eventually had to make a decision to rehome one of them. And Karmas had had Erra for longer, so he was the one who stayed.&quot; <br />
<br />
Zoran turned his gaze towards Stewie, &quot;So he never mellowed out, did he? Does he pose any danger towards me fellow teammates?&quot;<br />
<br />
<b><u>Sheldon, Chance:</u></b><br />
<br />
Sheldon looked up at the Blastoise, he had never seen such a big turtle before other than the very vague memories from back before he was fossilized. The Blastoise called down, her voice indicating that she was female, to see if he needed any help.<br />
<br />
&quot;Naah,&quot; he droned out, &quot;I think I should be able to manage it.&quot;<br />
<br />
He tried to climb up the hill faster, but due to his complete lack of experience it didn't work out too well. Sheldon didn't want to look like a complete lameo in front of the Blastoise, but he wasn't quite sure what he could do. Then it hit him. He tucked his back legs into his shell and yelled &quot;<b>Aqua Jet!</b>&quot; With that he burst forward, traveling up the hill propelled by a jet of water. Soon he had managed to get to the top of the hill, very pleased with himself that he only needed to use Aqua Jet once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;See I was totally able to manage it,&quot; he said with a dopey grin on his face. &quot;The name's Sheldon. S'up?&quot;</span></div>

<br />
Stewie smirked. &quot;Took you long enough to get there,&quot; he replied. &quot;I-&quot; But at that moment, however, Gina and Scorpina piped up, remarking that Stewie couldn't be that strong if he wasn't on their team. &quot;What the deuce- of course I'm that strong!&quot; Stewie snapped. &quot;Your Trainer was deluded to ever relinquish ownership of the future ruler of the world! And I'll fight any one of you here and now if I have to to prove my point!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can believe that,&quot; the Pawniard nodded, as the Shiftry explained that their Trainer used to own Stewie, but couldn't deal with two Shadow Pokémon at once. &quot;Stewie alone is a big handful, though my Trainer at least has me to help keep him in order.&quot; Dot, the (non-Shadow) Ledian, continued to explain- their Trainer also owned a Shadow Chimecho, and Karmas had to choose just one to keep, as keeping both was too much for him.<br />
<br />
Then, Zoran, the Shiftry, remarked on Stewie, how he didn't seem to mellow out. &quot;No, he didn't,&quot; sighed Ginny. &quot;Don't worry, though,&quot; she added in response to Zoran's question. &quot;As long as I'm keeping an eye on him, Stewie won't pose any sort of risk to your teammates.&quot; Indeed, as she spoke, Ginny continued to eye Stewie warily, ready to intervene should Stewie start firing attacks.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>Sheldon, Chance:</u></b> Elsewhere, the Tirtouga declined Chance's offer to help, though as he continued his attempts to climb the hill, the Blastoise heavily considered asking again. However, this turned out to be unnecessary, for at that moment, the Tirtouga made good use of his Aqua Jet attack, propelling him up the hill. He repeated the attack once more, and finally reached the top. Once there, he introduced himself as Sheldon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you, Sheldon,&quot; smiled Chance. &quot;Name's Chance. Cool Aqua Jet,&quot; she remarked.</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: #944D94"><span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Meowth, Ruby:</u></b> The remnants of sliced-up Watmel Berries littered the ground around Meowth and Ruby, as they lied on the ground, digesting their sizable snacks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh,&quot; sighed Meowth. &quot;Youse was right, Ruby- I'm feelin' better already.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad I could help,&quot; Ruby yapped happily, her tail wagging even as she lay lazily on the ground.<br />
<br />
After a few moments of silence, Meowth spoke up again. &quot;Y'know, Ruby, I don't get youse,&quot; he finally said. &quot;Ya play tricks on me all da time- more on me den on anyone else, in fact. Ya always seem so happy when I'm miserable, or complainin', or on fire, or watever... so why help me feel better when yer work's already done fer youse?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ruby did not reply right away. The Houndour thought about what Meowth had said. True enough, she derived a certain pleasure in seeing Meowth fall victim to her various pranks. Moreso than with other victims of aforementioned pranks, come to think of it. And yet, as she thought back, she realized- when Meowth had run away, she was the first to admit she missed him, she happily accompanied Keith to find him, and eagerly took on half a dozen Ursaring at once to protect Meowth. And now, Meowth was all bummed out, and she was trying to cheer him up instead of reveling in his misery?<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I don't like anyone screwing with you but me,&quot; the Houndour said finally.<br />
<br />
Meowth sat up and turned to look at Ruby- the Houndour was looking at him and blushing slightly. &quot;Huh,&quot; he remarked. &quot;I guess dat's sweet. Kinda.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; yapped Ruby. She and Meowth continued to look at each other, even after they had finished speaking. Meowth was starting to think to himself that maybe Ruby wasn't so bad. She certainly managed to make him feel better even after seeing Selina with that Luxio. Hell, she was even kinda cute... wait, <i>what?</i> Meowth blinked as he realized just what kind of thought just occurred to him, but he quickly realized that the thought was not an incorrect one.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Hey, Ruby?&quot; Meowth asked at length. &quot;I gotta know someting. When youse was still in yer Egg, did youse try and burn my paws on purpose?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Ruby replied. &quot;If you really want to know, I-&quot; At that moment, however, she lapsed into the kind of special barking only Houndour and Houndoom were able to understand. Meowth was no exception to this, either- he <i>hated</i> when Ruby did this to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, c'mon,&quot; grumbled Meowth. &quot;Ya know I hate when ya do dat. Wha'd ya say?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ruby said nothing, and merely grinned at Meowth in response. Resigning himself to the fact that he might never know the truth on that matter, Meowth flopped back down onto the grass, dwelling on the thoughts that had begun to occur to him, thoughts that shocked him to his core, and yet intrigued him at the same time, thoughts which involved himself and the Houndour lying nearby.</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: #944D94"><span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Meowth, Ruby:</u></b> For a while, the Tree Grove was quiet and peaceful. Almost as though nothing was happening there at all. But then, there came a horde of bipedal brown bears crashing through the foliage- a pack of Ursaring, all of them looking as though they were on the run from something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh... I think we finally lost 'em, boss,&quot; panted one of the Ursaring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; nodded the leader. &quot;Those damn Growlithe, trying to keep us locked up, when those greedy villagers are the ones trying to take our berries!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The nerve of those pint-size punks,&quot; growled another Ursaring. &quot;What say we go back and teach them some manners, hmm?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, not just yet,&quot; the boss shook his head. &quot;Soon, for sure, but not just yet... we gotta make sure that damn Captain Stomach ain't around-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Boss!&quot; interrupted yet another Ursaring. He was looking off to the group's right, mouth agape. &quot;Is that-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Mother of ass,&quot; the Ursaring leader hissed, eyes widening as he spotted Meowth and Ruby. &quot;That's that Meowth from that forest that night! And I'll be damned if that ain't the same Houndour what that started kicking our asses there, too,&quot; he added. &quot;Well, well, now I think I know how we'll pass the time waiting for Captain Stomach to leave that village alone. Boys, we're gonna get us some payback!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!&quot; the other Ursaring roared in agreement.<br />
<br />
~~~<br />
<br />
Meowth was now sitting up and looking over at Ruby. The thoughts and feelings that had started to occur to him were still occurring to him, and damned if he knew what to make of them. The Houndour was still lying on the grass, eyes half-closed lazily, the remnants of several Watmel Berries all around her. And then, a crashing sound from the nearby trees and bushes caught both of their attention. They looked around, and saw a horde of Ursaring towering over them. And what was more, Meowth and Ruby realized that <a href="http://forums.upnetwork.net/showpost.php?p=645272&amp;postcount=37" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.upnetwork.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D645272%26postcount%3D37&amp;hash=654f12afe36f1f32956392e3d7c10bcc" rel="nofollow noopener">they recognized these Ursaring</a>.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Oh, crap,&quot; Meowth whimpered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, did you miss us?&quot; smirked the Ursaring's leader.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah- in fact, we're not done missing you,&quot; snapped Ruby, baring her teeth and snarling at the Ursaring. &quot;So if you'll just leave-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave?&quot; interrupted the leader. &quot;I think not. See, you two humiliated us utterly that night, and now, I think we're good enough for some payback.&quot;<br />
<br />
In response, Meowth extended his claws and assumed a fighting stance. The Ursaring chuckled in response, before one of them lunged forward. Meowth also lunged forward, Fury Swipes at the ready, but the Ursaring struck first with a forceful <b>Hammer Arm</b> attack. Ruby gasped as Meowth was flung backwards into a nearby tree, but breathed a sigh of relief as the Normal-type revealed himself to be OK. Satisfied with this, Ruby turned back to the Ursaring horde and unleashed a plume of fire from her mouth. The flames started to swirl all around the pack of Ursaring, the <b>Fire Spin</b> starting to wear them down. Taking the opportunity, Ruby's mind concocted a <b>Nasty Plot</b>, while Meowth started to <b>Work</b> himself <b>Up</b>.<br />
<br />
Roaring their displeasure, the Ursaring pack broke through the Fire Spin, the flames fizzling out, but Meowth and Ruby were ready for them. Ruby howled as she unleashed a powerful <b>Dark Pulse</b>, and as they were wincing from the forceful Dark move, Meowth lunged forward, striking one of the Ursaring with <b>Take Down</b>. This proved too much- the struck Ursaring collapsed to the ground, unconscious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice!&quot; Ruby yapped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tanks,&quot; Meowth grinned, even as he saw the other six Ursaring converging on him. In response, Meowth took a deep breath and exhaled a horribly chilling <b>Icy Wind</b> upon the lot of them. This left them shivering, which Ruby took as her cue to warm them up with one <b>Flame Charge</b> after another, the Dark/Fire-type speeding up with each blow she dealt to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gaahhh, enough of this!&quot; roared the leader. &quot;Get them!&quot;<br />
<br />
In response, the Ursaring's five conscious underlings lashed out with their <b>Mega Punch</b> attacks, both Meowth and Ruby taking numerous blows, while the leader took the opportunity to <b>Bulk</b> himself <b>Up</b> a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Owww...&quot; Meowth groaned. He climbed back to his feet, only to see the Ursaring surrounding him, identical evil grins on their faces.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh,&quot; smirked the Ursaring leader as he approached Meowth, his <b>Arm</b> already glowing and in position to <b>Hammer</b> Meowth. &quot;I guess now we'll see if that whole 'nine lives' deal is true or not- GAH!&quot;<br />
<br />
For at that moment, Ruby, more enraged than anyone had ever seen her before, had lunged forward and pounced on the Ursaring. She was delivering nasty <b>Bite</b>s, blasting his head with <b>Flamethrower</b>, and to finish up, her skull helmet glowed red, and she slammed her head into the Ursaring, the <b>Rock Smash</b> hitting hard, even striking a weak point- the leader collapsed to the ground unconscious, that Rock Smash having been the straw that broke the Numel's back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ruby, tanks,&quot; Meowth murmured, gazing at the Houndour who was now standing between him and the remaining Ursaring, growling fiercely at them even as they advanced on her menacingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Out of the way, you stupid mutt,&quot; said one of the Ursaring. &quot;We're stronger than we were last time, so don't think this'll be a repeat of then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, guess what?&quot; Ruby snarled. &quot;I'm stronger, too! And you will not! Hurt!! Meowth!!!&quot; And with that, a bright light came over Ruby's body. The cunning canine grew larger, her legs lengthened, her tail got thinner and longer and developed a spear-like point at the end, and curled horns sprouted from the back of her head. Finally, with a bone-chilling, ominous howl, the glow faded to reveal one extremely pissed-off

</div>
.<br />
<br />
&quot;What- but- she's a Houndoom now!&quot; spluttered one of the Ursaring. &quot;What do we do?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a suggestion,&quot; Ruby piped up. &quot;How about you burn?!&quot; With that, she unleashed a terrifyingly hot, bright blue fire from her mouth that washed over the remaining Ursaring. They cried out in agony as the <b>Inferno</b> attack scorched them, leaving painful burns all over their bodies. Too pained to retort verbally, they settled for shooting angry looks at the newly evolved Houndoom before running off. They grabbed the two unconscious Ursaring, then hauled ass as far away from there as their feet would carry them.<br />
<br />
Satisfied that the Ursaring were dealt with, Ruby turned to Meowth, her face softening. &quot;You OK?&quot; she asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... Yeah, I...&quot; Meowth replied. He had just watched as Ruby stood up to the Ursaring, defended him, even evolved into Houndoom just to save him. And all the while, it was starting to scare Meowth less and less, what he was feeling. “I'm OK now, tanks,” he finally managed to say, as he and the newly evolved Houndoom gazed at each other. “So, uh,” Meowth added after a minute, “now dat dose Ursarings is taken care of, wat say we go and do sometin'? Together, ya know?”<br />
<br />
Ruby smiled. “I'd like that,” she replied. With that, they turned around and started walking, side by side. And as they did so, Ruby couldn't resist- she discreetly blew a single <b>Ember</b> onto Meowth's tail, curious to see how long it'd take him to realize it.</span></span><br />

<div class="bbWrapper">OOC: Okay dokey, this tree's been dormant for a while, but with permissions sorted here, it's time to give it some water and bug paste to help it blossom for the warmer months.<br />
<br />
IC: The Mother Tree.<br />
<br />
Without doubt, one of the natural wonders of Fizzytopia, this giant arboreal sanctuary stood as testament to nature's full power, that man alone will always be second fiddle to Her might, regardless of technological prowess. With its own pokemon government, the tree was in effect an autonomous state, protected by human law and annexed to stop people from trying to exploit the location for its pokemon and resources.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, this meant that trainers could leave their pokemon there as a sort of pokemon city. In any case, the sky had went from a verdant blue to a calming navy as night had started to settle in, and in one particular part of the tree, near the roots, a small hubbub was developing.<br />
<br />
The source of this hubbub was a fairly sizable group of pokemon, which seemed to be breaking off into its own little groups, with a main group in the middle. In the centre, addressing the pokemon, stood an Abomasnow, a metallic band round his arm with a marbled orb set inside an indent. Nothing fancy. Beside him, an Infernape thumbed at a large satchel, filled with small boxes, each one containing a few simple berries, varieties that people had bred to be delicious, but without the medicinal effects, designed for treats, as well as a scroll of paper with a list scrawled on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll be starting the scavenger hunt shortly, once we have approval from the council in the grove...or when Tantalia stops trying to outflex the guardsmon here...&quot; the ice type grumbled as he glanced at the Conkeldurr, who was busy striking poses with a pair of Machamp, the four armed pokemon enjoying the break in routine before one of them caught the hint and with a sheepish grin stopped the antics, before giving three thumbs up and a thumbs down. &quot;Alright, we have approval by majority.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll be starting in about five minutes, so just a quick reminder on the rules. Keep to the laws of the land, firstly. We're doing this for the sake of training and planning, not to pull off a heist. That's Fragarath's job.&quot;<br />
<br />
The groups shared a hearty laugh, though the Machamp seemed less than amused until the Muscular pokemon whispered something to them, causing the pair to crack a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Secondly, respect your opponents. That means no fighting, stealing or general jerkery to each other. Banter's fine, as is good pranking, but if they're in a spot of bother, give them a hand, or tentacle, or nub, or whatever you use to grasp with if you can. Thirdly, respect the place. The last thing we want is for this place to burst into flames or explode. This is an old place, be kind to it and its inhabitants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finally...have fun. First team to fill their list up gets the rewards, and do we have rewards or what!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As our portly fr-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As our bulky friend here says,&quot; the fire type chimed in, &quot;the first team to finish the list and return to this spot will have free access to all facilities and locales in the Grove for the next few days. This includes the food, the relaxation, the works. The council's approved of the game and rewards. For those who don't win but still manage to complete the list, the free access will run for them until the next day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, all we need to do is wait until the moon is visible. And no, Moonlight and Moonblast do not count.&quot;<br />
<br />
OOC: So to try and get some activity here on BMG, I decided to run a little RP-based game here. As expected, you should expect no physical rewards, as this is for the sake of improving RP skills, but you've all the freedom. You can have your pokemon take part or not, maybe even build a team with other folk.<br />
<br />
The only stipulations are that a team may not exceed 4 members. You can have pokemon go solo, and you may choose which items/objects are in the list, as long as there is at least five. By all means, RP with each other, this place is designed with character development of pokemon in mind.</div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: #944D94">Keith Masters had left his Pokémon at the Tree Grove, as he so often did while frequenting the Nightclub. Most of them were exploring the Nightclub elsewhere, but a handful of them ended up near the Mother Tree itself, by far the biggest thing in the entire Tree Grove, where a crowd had started to gather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, wow!&quot; exclaimed by far the most excited of the bunch, a brown-furred Weavile with pale blue plumage. Evolution had not diminished Lenny's energy and enthusiasm any. &quot;I wonder what's going on over there! Vi, c'mon, let's check it out!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... um... I... I dunno,&quot; murmured the Dunsparce shyly. That crowd looked awfully big... lots of Pokémon...<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, c'mon, Vi, it'll be fine,&quot; said Lenny. &quot;They could be gearing up for something fun! Wouldn't that be awesome if we could get in on that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Willow's all for it,&quot; added the Timburr by her side. &quot;And Violet, she says to lighten up a little bit. Well, OK, actually what she said was to be brave, that you have no reason to fear that crowd, I just thought it sounded cooler the way I said it. Yes it did,&quot; she added, now seeming to address the log slung over her shoulder. &quot;Yes it did! Yes it did!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W-well... o-okay, then,&quot; Violet conceded. &quot;C-could you guys... st-stay near me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You got it, Vi,&quot; grinned Lenny. Millicent nodded as well. A bit more at ease now, Violet slithered alongside Millicent and Lenny as they approached the crowd before them. And it soon became known to them exactly what was going on- a scavenger hunt! Immediately, the three of them (four if one counts Willow, and Millicent made damn sure they counted Willow!) decided they'd form a team and go for it.<br />
<br />
<br />
In another part of the crowd, a Dustox was fluttering around. He too wanted in on the scavenger hunt, it sounded like fun, but before he'd go to get his list, Severus first wanted to find some teammates. He would've liked to team up with James, Lily, and Six, but they didn't seem to be in the area. And he saw that Violet, Millicent, and Lenny had already formed a team, and he didn't see any of his other teammates around. Undeterred, Severus searched for any other Pokémon that might like to team up with him for this.</span></div>
