<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #944D94"><b><u>Meowth, Selina, Rubeus, Millicent/Willow:</u></b> After Hedwig flew off to give the two cats a little privacy, Selina revealed to Meowth her idea to hunt down and kill Neville for food. Meowth was in support of this plan, especially if it'd be him hunting alongside Selina. And then the Purrloin stroked Meowth's chin with her paw. Meowth nearly collapsed right there, thoroughly enjoying this. When he found his voice again, he said &quot;Let's do dis, then! Let's kill dat slimy Stunfisk together! Oh! Wait... speakin' o' Stunfisk, nearly forgot two of my trainer's Pokemon. One o' dem's a Stunfisk too, but we shouldn't hunt dat one, he's a decent guy.&quot; Meowth took out Keith's Pokedex and pressed a few buttons, and several Poke Balls materialized. Meowth threw them, unleashing a Stunfisk and a Timburr into the area. Though the Stunfisk merely flew off, idly looking for something to do, the Timburr greeted Meowth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Meowth,&quot; grinned Millicent the Timburr. She then looked at the log in her arms and added, &quot;Willow's asking who your girlfriend there is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meowth blushed and facepalmed at the same time. &quot;Dis is Selina,&quot; he said. &quot;Selina, dis is Millicent, my trainer's Timburr.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...And?&quot; prompted Millicent.<br />
<br />
&quot;And, nuttin',&quot; Meowth scowled. &quot;Hows about youse stops treatin' dat log like somethin' living, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How about you stop referring to her as 'that log'?&quot; demanded Millicent. &quot;Her name is Willow!&quot; Then she glanced over at her log again, then turned back to Meowth and continued. &quot;Willow agrees with me, and she also said something I don't think I should repeat. Let's just say it involved your mother and leave it at that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough!&quot; Meowth exclaimed, glaring at Millicent, a glint of Hypnosis in his eyes. &quot;Youse just turn around and walk away right now, ya hear me?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, master,&quot; Millicent droned, her eyes seeming to glaze over as she wheeled around and marched away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh,&quot; Meowth grinned as he watched this happen. &quot;Hypnosis never gets old.&quot; He then turned back to face Selina and continued. &quot;Like I was sayin', let's do dis,&quot; he grinned. &quot;Between youse and me, dat Stunfisk ain't gonna know what hit it!&quot;<br />
<br />
<b><u>Scorpius, Hermione, Toby:</u></b> As the Turtwig known as Toby asked about any spots to soak up some sun, Hermione seemed most intrigued. &quot;So you need to take in lots of sunlight, then?&quot; she asked. &quot;Most interesting... I've heard that most Grass-types functioned at least partly like plants, in that lots of sunlight is of vital importance to them...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hermione here likes learning a lot,&quot; Scorpius explained. &quot;She's as smart as she is cute,&quot; he grinned, making Hermione blush slightly. &quot;Anyways, there's a spot over that ways where the sun seems to be particularly strong,&quot; he added, pointing off behind him with his tail claws. &quot;C'mon, we'll show you,&quot; he said as he and Hermione turned to head that way.<br />
<br />
<b><u>James, Lily, Six, Sirius, Leila, Laika, Raijin:</u></b> Now rather willing to join in the game of tag, Six got James to lower his flower so the Foongus could jump off safely. Meanwhile, Leila reacted rather favorably to the arrival of Sirius, causing the latter to wag his tail happily. Six looked at the Emolga, waiting patiently to learn his name.</span></span><br />
<br />
OOC: Following their evolutions in the bar, the storyline of which chronologically comes before this one, I would like to ask everyone to treat Malfoy and Luna as though they had been Toxicroak and Swoobat respectively the entire time they were here.</div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: #ff8c00"><span style="font-size: 9px"><u>James, Lily, Six, Surgei</u>: <br />
<br />
Surgei had been greeted by all three Pokemon, and looked at them for a moment, lost in thought. Then, he darted away in an easterly direction into the park, flittering and fluttering over a specific patch of field, before he made a landing on the field, and picking something up with his legs. He flew back over to the Vileplume, Venomoth, and Foongus, and put a white flower with a yellow head on Foongus, apparently not having the dexterity to try and place it anywhere else. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is a chamomile, the national flower of Russia. I give this to you as a token of friendship. My name is Surgei, again. My trainer's name is Blaze, but he is not here because this park does not allow trainers...though you probably already know that. Anyways, the reason I came down is because I am feeling a little lonely, and was wondering if I could hang out with you guys a little bit.&quot; <br />
<br />
<u>Lemon Drop, Sarkahn</u>: <br />
<br />
Sarkahn expressed joy at the compliment on his size. Lemon Drop was still blushing like a high school girl....probably because that is where she was in the maturity stage in her life. She was a little put off by his very gruff attitude, but really wasn't paying attention to that. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why....hello there Sarkahn. Hehehe! Um...so...what are you doing here? Do you come here often?&quot; <br />
<br />
<u>Farseer, Static, Scorpius, Hermione</u>: <br />
<br />
Much to Static's relief, he found that both Scorpius and Hermione were actually quite glad that Farseer had greeted them. He was worried that Farseer could have still interrupted something, but managed to not say anything about that while he greeted the couple.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey you guys. It's me, Static. Been a little while since we last met.&quot; <br />
<br />
Farseer chimed in at this oppurtunity, &quot;It sure has, hasn't it. They say that Christmas is coming up soon, and although I am not entirely sure about the customs of this holiday, do you two have any special plans for the holidays?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Farseer, that it private you know that!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there is never any harm in asking is there?&quot;</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><b>Yay more pokemon~</b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px">“THERE IS A MENTALLY UNSTABLE STUNFISK IN THERE, AND YOU TELL ME THAT I CAN’T GO IN BECAUSE OF ONE STUPID RULE?” James yelled out at the Machoke who guarded the entrance. Tha Machoke simply nodded and looked out above James. James turned around and breathed out before reaching for his belt. His hand came back up with 3 Pokeballs and a Luxury Ball. “You four, come out. I need your help.” The four balls cracked open and released four pokémon: an Eevee, a Darumaka, a Numel, and a Budew. “Just go in there and try to find one of the others. Help them contain Neville.” James said, and afterwards put a few Cheri Berries into a pouch and gave them to the Budew. “Matthew, go around and help Neville’s victims. And Jojo, you’re the only other one with hands, so you should hold onto these.” James then handed the four balls to the Darumaka. The four Pokemon nodded, and they ran forward to help find Neville.<br />
<br />
<u>Chiaka, Millicent</u><br />
The first of those four, the fox-dog, found a Timburr rather quickly who was walking away from another group with a daze in her eyes. The Eevee jumped in front of her and sat down. &quot;Hi there! I'm Chiaka. Can I ask what's wrong? You look a bit confused.&quot; The Eevee said rather quickly, looking at the Fighting Type's eyes. &quot;And why do you carry around this? Is it special to you?&quot; Chiaka pointed her paw at the log Millicent carried. The DNA Pokemon then jumped back and gasped. &quot;I GET IT NOW! That log is possessing you to do evil deeds in the middle of the night! WE NEED AN EXORCIST OVER HERE!&quot; She cried out, glancing around and hoping that somebody would save her from the evil possesed being that stood infront of her.<br />
<br />
<u>Jojo, Oliver, Chrys, Burmecia, Ivana</u> <br />
The Darumaka seemed to have taken a seat ontop of the Numel and was riding towards a group consisting of a Deerling, a Burmy, and a Grimer. &quot;<i>Oliva</i>, go near those three. Let's see if they've seen the little <i>diablo</i>.&quot; She said to her mount, and Oliver slowly turned to walk in front of them. Before saying hello, Jojo jumped off of Oliver and waved. &quot;<i>¡hola</i>, friends! You wouldn't have happen to seen a Stunfisk flying around here, would you? The little <i>cabrón</i> escaped and he's most likely paralyzed quite a few people.&quot;<br />
<br />
<u>Matthew, Neville, Rubeus</u><br />
Neville had slipped between the roots of a tree and was waiting until a unsuspecting passerby came along, when suddenly he spotted an old &quot;friend&quot;. He jumped out of his cover, scaring the wits out of a poor baby Pichu, and flew to his friend, a fellow Stunfisk who he shared a tank with in the <s>hellhole</s> Adoption Center. &quot;Why hello there!&quot; He exclaimed, landing next to the pancake. &quot;I never thought I'd see you out of that place! Who saved you, hmmm?&quot;<br />
<br />
And suddenly, a Budew appeared from above. &quot;Stop, tormentor!&quot; He called out in an adorable high-pitched voice. &quot;I'm not letting you get away with paralyzing anybody else! Fear me, the Matt-ador!&quot; The Budew looked away for a second before mumbling under his breath. &quot;No, that's terrible... Scratch that, I'll think of something else.&quot; And then the Budew jumped on top of the criminal, only to be paralyzed by the Stunfisk's <b>Static.</b><br />
<br />
&quot;Tehehe, silly. You can't beat me!&quot; He said and rolled the Budew off of him. The Budew struggled a bit and a Cheri Berry fell out of his pouch. He couldn't reach it, however, and sat there in defeat.</span></div>

<article class="message-body js-selectToQuote">
<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #944D94"><b><u>Meowth, Myrtle, Selina, Cyanide:</u></b> After arguing with his trainer and glaring at the Shuppet who had inserted herself in the argument, Meowth reluctantly removed yet another Poke Ball from Keith's PC storage and threw it as far as he could, unleashing a female Eevee, who glanced around, snorted in boredom, and wandered about, looking for something to do.<br />
<br />
<b><u>Chiaka, Millicent/Willow, Cyanide:</u></b> Millicent found herself approached by a female Eevee. At first, she thought it was Cyanide, but realized it was a different one. The Hypnosis had worn off by that point, and as the Eevee asked why she looked so confused, Millicent opened her mouth to reply, when Chiaka interrupted, exclaiming that the log that Millicent was carrying around was the cause. This caused Millicent to awaken fully and defensively clutch her log. &quot;No!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;My trainer's Meowth hit me with Hypnosis, to make me stop arguing with him! Willow had nothing to do with it!&quot;<br />
<br />
At that point, Cyanide narrowed her eyes, recognizing yet another Eevee she had briefly shared a trainer with. This one wasn't nearly as cowardly as the one now known as Taki, though she asked entirely too many questions, as far as Cyanide was concerned. She sauntered up behind Chiaka and snorted.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, some poor sap got himself stuck with you,&quot; Cyanide said. &quot;Remember me? I got a name now. It's Cyanide. Remember it. What do they call you now?&quot;<br />
<br />
<b><u>Rubeus, Neville, Matthew:</u></b> As Rubeus was idly floating around, flapping his fins to stay airborne, another Stunfisk approached him, causing Rubeus's eyes to widen in shock. &quot;You!&quot; he exclaimed in tones of anger.<br />
<br />
At that point, however, a hero-wannabe Budew pounced on Neville, but only wound up paralyzed by Static, a sight not unfamiliar to Rubeus. As Neville rolled the paralyzed Budew off his back, Rubeus angrily flung a Mud-Slap into Neville's eyes, then moved closer to the Budew.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm very sorry about him,&quot; Rubeus said as he used his fin to push the Cheri Berry within the Budew's reach. &quot;I hope you don't think all Stunfisk are like him. My name's Rubeus, and I'm sorry to say I've known Neville for a long time. He and I were at the Adoption Center, where I opted to spend all my time cleaning up after his messes, alerting others to where he was hiding, and helping out those afflicted by his antics.&quot;</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><u>Chiaka, Millicent/Willow, Cyanide</u><br />
“Well, that wasn’t very nice of him. Sorry of accussing you of that… Willow?” Chiaka said, with respects to what her teammates had said about dealing with crazy people. Chiaka turned around to see another Eevee- one of the crueler ones who had tormented another while under the care of Wes. Upon hearing her name, Chiaka’s memory was jogged about Cyanide’s namesake, one of the things in the book Euen had showed her. “Cyanide… That’s a type of poison, isn’t it? Anyways, my name is Chiaka. Is that one girl who could see things here too?” Chiaka said, and then remembered her reason for coming here in the first place. “You wouldn’t have happened to see a Stunfisk around here, have you? I happen to be looking for him.”<br />
<br />
<u>Rubeus, Neville, Matthew</u><br />
“Oh, come on! There’s no reason to be so hostile towards me, friend. I did nothing of the sort while I was in that hellhole.” Neville said, SPORTing off the MUD on his face. “Now, “Matt-ador”, please leave us for now. I wish to talk to him in peace, thank you very much.”<br />
<br />
“No! I must defeat you!” Matthew said, swallowing the berry and standing up proudly. “Thank you, sir, for helping me. Now you will pay dearly, prankster!” His cheeks puffed up, and he spit out a BOMB in the shape of a SEED. Neville was hit square between the eyes and the small explosion shook him. <br />
<br />
“Oh no, you have defeated me. What will I ever do now?” Neville said in a sarcastic tone, rolling his eyes. He had no time for this, and slipped underneath the Budew and flapped upwards, using his body like a catapult to send the Budew rolling away. “Now, what was your name again? Rubeus? Trying to make people think not all of us are evil? I’ll admit I am the exception, not the rule, but people are strange. They will believe the bad things, not the good. Your quest is pointless, really.”</span></div>

<article class="message-body js-selectToQuote">
<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #944D94"><b><u>Millicent/Willow, Cyanide, Chiaka:</u></b> Millicent calmed down as Chiaka apologized to Willow. Millicent faced her log and looked at it intently, as if listening to something it was saying. After a few seconds, she nodded and turned to face Chiaka again. &quot;Willow says she accepts your apology,&quot; Millicent grinned. &quot;Good to meet you, Chiaka. I'm Millicent, and this is Willow,&quot; she said as she gestured to her log.<br />
<br />
Chiaka introduced herself to Cyanide, but not before inquiring as to whether Cyanide's name was in fact that of a kind of poison. The Eevee rolled her eyes as Chiaka asked yet another question, but answered it all the same. &quot;Naturally, it's a kind of poison,&quot; she smirked. &quot;My trainer picked it out for me, and frankly, I like it a lot. And I'll tell you what else, I obviously got the best deal out of any of us, going to the trainer I got. Keith's everything a Pokemon with any common sense would want in a trainer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you're one of Keith's Pokemon too?&quot; grinned Millicent. &quot;Good to meet you, I'm Millicent, and this is Willow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Willow?&quot; repeated Cyanide, smirking unpleasantly. &quot;You named your log? How pathetic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't name her,&quot; Millicent frowned. &quot;She told me her name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you think it talks to you?&quot; asked Cyanide incredulously, now chuckling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway,&quot; growled Millicent through gritted teeth, obviously wanting to change the subject before she was driven to start attacking, &quot;Like I was saying, I agree with you about Keith. He arranged to have me and Willow rescued from the Adoption Center when nobody else seemed to want us. I never knew why my first trainer just dumped me in there like that, but I'm telling you, I'm taking no chances. Keith is an incredibly kind and caring trainer, and the last thing I want is to somehow screw things up and get booted off the team.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cyanide looked as though she wanted to burst out laughing, but she instead scoffed at Millicent and focused on Chiaka once again, who had asked whether she'd seen another one of them, the one who could apparently see things. &quot;Oh, you mean Taki, as she's now called,&quot; said Cyanide as she rolled her eyes. &quot;Yeah, I've seen her around. Same basket case as ever.&quot; Chiaka then inquired about a Stunfisk. &quot;My trainer's got a Stunfisk, though I doubt he's the one you're after. The one you're after wouldn't happen to be named Neville, would he? Because I've heard the stories.&quot;<br />
<br />
<b><u>Myrtle, Rubeus, Neville, Matthew:</u></b> Rubeus found himself becoming increasingly furious as Neville denied any wrongdoing in the Adoption Center. &quot;Then explain to me why that Ekans that was in there recoiled in horror at the very sight of me, mistaking me for you!&quot; Rubeus exclaimed. &quot;Explain why the staff had to place a standing order with a Cheri Berry orchard the entire time you were there! Explain why my trainer's girlfriend wants you dead!&quot; At this point, the Budew known as Matthew thanked Rubeus for his help, then fired off a Seed Bomb at Neville. In spite of the direct hit, Fizzytopia's most hated and despised Stunfisk used his flat body as a catapult to launch the Budew away, and continued to talk to Rubeus, now trying to dissuade him from trying to help others see that not all Stunfisk were evil, claiming that such a quest was pointless.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've restored my trainer's liking for your kind,&quot; Neville retorted angrily. &quot;I've helped others, including the Ivysaur you traumatized. The look on her face when she saw me, the fear in her voice... how do you sleep at night?!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was then that Rubeus noticed a Ghost-type floating up behind Neville, pure hatred in her eyes. The Shuppet, Myrtle, was positively seething with rage. &quot;Well, hel-lo, Ne-ville,&quot; Myrtle hissed in a deadly voice. &quot;Re-mem-ber me? You should- Be-di-vere is still con-vinced that I would ac-tu-al-ly be stu-pid e-nough to have fee-lings for you! You... Ev-er-y-thing you did... E-ver-y-one you have hurt... There is no for-give-ness. E-ven Meat Sack, the most for-gi-ving per-son I know, has gi-ven up on you. And that is <i>BAD</i>. And as for me...&quot; Myrtle added ominously as she produced a needle from out of nowhere. Minerva had told her long ago that she would know when such measures were necessary. And now, she knew. &quot;As for me, I think this will say it all,&quot; Myrtle concluded as she stabbed her body with the needle, casting a <b>Curse</b> on the despicable Stunfisk. With Myrtle's less than impressive levels of power thus far, it was very much unlikely that the Curse she cast would have the power to kill, but it would most definitely induce such agony that not even this masochistic Stunfisk could possibly enjoy it.</span></span></div>

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><u>Millicent/Willow, Cyanide, Chiaka</u><br />
&quot;Millicent, I doubt your trainer would let you go. At the very least, you're kind. That trait alone is reason enough. And anybody with an ounce of curiocity would like to learn more about Willow here.&quot; Chiaka said in an attempt to assure Millicent that Keith wouldn't abandon her. &quot;Yep. That would be him. I do wonder while he is...&quot; Chiaka's eyes wandered around to the surrounding area, unsure of where the joker would be. &quot;I haven't actually met him yet, so I'm a bit afraid. I don't have any TM moves or anything either...&quot; Chiaka's fear was evident in her voice.<br />
<br />
And then somewhere far away, a scream echoed out across the Grove...<br />
<br />
<br />
<u>Myrtle, Rubeus, Neville:</u><br />
&quot;Simple, Rubeus. I don't. Too many people want me gone, so I <i>have</i> to stay awake for fear of death.&quot; Neville said with his grin on his face. And speak of the devil, one of these people appeared. Upon saying hello, Neville twisted around to see her. &quot;Oh, hello there Myrtle! Pleasure seeing you around here.&quot; She went on to say how nobody has forgivn him for what he has done. &quot;Well, what about the one who saved me? There's one right there.<br />
And then Myrtle pulled out a needle. Neville had a bit of a spasm at this point, sending out a TAUNT and an ATTRACT. Sadly, it was too late. <br />
<br />
Neville curled into a roll upon the first strike. It hurt like hell, clearly. Neville's fear of needles was not helping at this point either, his scream/laugh reflecting this. He was terrified of needles, after learning about what Minerva the Banette could do to him with one. The prankster continued having his miniature seizure before becoming somewhat still. Either the pain had subsided (not likely), or Neville was resisting it. &quot;You call me a monster... Hypocrites are some of my least favorite people.&quot; He said quietly under his breath, pain evident within it. He had done nothing wrong. Surely Myrtle was having her own pain at the moment... But it was doubtful she would ever feel the same as this. &quot;I think this is fair enough.&quot; Neville's mind focused on one goal: SPLITing his PAIN.</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: #944D94"><span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Millicent/Willow, Cyanide, Chiaka:</u></b> Chiaka's words seemed to reassure Millicent. &quot;Yeah, well,&quot; the Timburr muttered. &quot;It's just... I don't know where I went wrong with my original trainer, and whatever I did there, I don't want to repeat it by accident. Even with Willow, the Adoption Center is a lonely place...&quot;<br />
<br />
Cyanide snorted as Chiaka confirmed the Stunfisk in question to be the infamous Neville, and as she expressed fear of the hell-spawned Stunfisk. &quot;Well, I got a couple decent moves. I'm not afraid of that silly little Stunfisk. I got Toxic, Attract, Shadow Ball, Hidden Power Poison, good stuff like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
<b><u>Myrtle, Rubeus, Neville:</u></b> Myrtle smirked in savage satisfaction as Neville screamed and seized in obvious agony. The Shuppet was feeling the pain herself, but seeing Neville in such agony, seeing him finally taking pain and not laughing maniacally in response, it was so utterly satisfying that Myrtle was feeling more pleasure than pain. Then, he stopped his little seizure, apparently resisting the pain, and muttered that he hated hypocrites. &quot;I beg your frea-king par-don?&quot; Myrtle snapped, her eyes narrowing. &quot;Of course I call you a mons-ter! Your pranks were a-ny-thing but harm-less! I do not e-ven like Po-mo-na, but af-ter see-ing what you did to her, e-ven I felt sor-ry for her! You de-serve this pain, Ne-ville. Deep down, you have to know that.&quot; Then, she noticed that Neville seemed to be focusing intensely.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you don't!&quot; Rubeus shouted as he <b>Slap</b>ped another clump of <b>Mud</b> into Neville's eyes in an effort to distract him, break his concentration, and by extension stop the Pain Split before it began. He then turned to face Myrtle, who regarded her Stunfisk teammate with an indifferent look. &quot;I don't believe we've met,&quot; added Rubeus. &quot;My name is Rubeus, and I am another one of Keith's Pokemon. I must applaud you for what you did to this disgrace to my species here,&quot; he said, gesturing to Neville with one of his fins. &quot;Please, I beg you to understand that not all Stunfisk are like that one. Some of us are in actuality kind and benevolent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You ap-pear to be a de-cent sort, at least,&quot; Myrtle responded at length. &quot;Ve-ry well. Nice to meet you, Ru-be-us.&quot;<br />
<br />
<b><u>Luna, Elgyem, Cyndaquil:</u></b> Elsewhere, Luna the Swoobat was aimlessly flying around, when she noticed an Elgyem being followed by a Cyndaquil. Interested in meeting a fellow Psychic-type, she flew down to meet the Elgyem. &quot;Hi, there,&quot; Luna greeted him. &quot;My name's Luna, who are you?&quot;</span></span></div>

And Meowth was more than all for hunting that Stunfisk down and have him for a snack. But before that, Meowth took out a few more Pokeballs, unleashing another Stunfisk, a Timburr, and an Eevee. Rubeus simply flopped away as Selina partially wished she could just hunt him, but they were after another Stunfisk, one that people wouldn't mind seeing as a filet. The Timburr asked who she was ... or was that her log? Selina didn't really want to know, she thought Fighting-types in general were a little eccentric. Far off, the Eevee came out, and Selina could smell the pretentiousness even with that much distance between them. She'd set the Eevee straight later; right now, they had a Stunfisk filet to cook up. &quot;<i>Meow, I like that! Lead the way!</i>&quot; Selina purred happily.<br />

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: #944D94"><span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Myrtle, Rubeus, Meowth, Selina, Neville:</u></b> As soon as Selina told Meowth to lead the way, the Scratch Cat Pokemon gave a confident grin and got down on all fours, stealthily prowling through the grass, determined to not only catch the offending Stunfisk by complete surprise, but to also impress Selina with his hunting skills. As he approached, he noticed that there were two Stunfisk, one of them having to be Rubeus. That said, Myrtle was talking to one of the Stunfisk in a positively civil manner, so Meowth reasoned that the offending Stunfisk had to be the other one, currently fighting against the pain of the Curse he had been subjected to. Meowth raised his front right paw ever so slightly, and as a glowing orb formed around it, Meowth muttered, &quot;Please be a Fire move, please be a Fire move, please be a Fire move...&quot; So of course, the <b>Assist</b> brought forth nothing of the sort. Instead, what appeared to be a large glowing <b>Gummi</b> was fired out of the paw, softly ticking like some sort of <b>Bomb</b>. It stuck to the Stunfisk's tail fin, and Meowth knew that it would explode soon. He silently motioned for Selina to stay back, wanting to make sure neither one of them got caught up in the blast. He had seen Hermione practice this move, and knew for a fact that it was very hard to shake off a Gummi Bomb. Doable, but difficult.<br />
<br />
<b><u>Scorpius, Hermione, Toby:</u></b> Scorpius and Hermione led the way, and walked until they arrived at a nice, open area where the sun seemed to beat down on them particularly harshly. &quot;How's this?&quot; Scorpius asked Toby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, the sun is particularly strong in this area,&quot; Hermione observed. &quot;It's almost as though a Pokemon had used Sunny Day, in fact- I've read about how that move works, and this seems to fit... I would need to see someone try and use a SolarBeam, of course, to know for sure, but it does appear consistent with what I've read. Sunlight at that level of strength would definitely power up Fire-type moves, though. I must try this out...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you gonna try it out?&quot; asked Scorpius. &quot;Want me to use Flamethrower? Oh, not on you, though, don't worry,&quot; he added to Toby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, that might not be necessary,&quot; Hermione stated. &quot;On Christmas, Keith gave me this very hot drink that taught me a unique attack. I wish I had saved a little bit, to study it, see how it works... Anyway, watch this,&quot; she stated as she turned her head up and unleashed a Firestream into the sky.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa!&quot; Scorpius exclaimed as he saw his beloved unleash a stream of molten bubbles into the air. &quot;Whoa! Wow! Hermione, that's awesome!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, thanks,&quot; Hermione said, blushing slightly. &quot;I wish I could use Flamethrower like you, though, Scorpius.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that move looks awesome!&quot; Scorpius exclaimed. &quot;What's it called, anyway? I never even heard of an attack that makes you spew fiery bubbles like that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's called Firestream,&quot; Hermione explained. &quot;Apparently, Pokemon can only learn it by drinking a certain particularly hot and spicy beverage. I've done some reading on it, and no Pokemon learns that move without the help of such a drink.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; Scorpius murmured. &quot;With a move like that, you'd do great in battle!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You really think so?&quot; Hermione asked hopefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell yeah!&quot; nodded Scorpius. &quot;What do you think, Toby?&quot; he asked the Turtwig. &quot;You think Hermione here will do well in battle?&quot;</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Alright guys have a good time guys! Said Jake to his four pokemon before leaving them to have there fun. As Bubbles,Sparky,Pom and Telpo walked in they were amazed by the sights. As everyone went their separate ways Jake's words echoed inside Bubbles head. Now Bubbles can you please try to behave when your at The Tree Grove? If you do it will highly benefit you. Who cares if Jake said that! Thought Bubbles. I don't know the reward so it doesn't count! She said to herself before walking over to where a Shuppet and two Stunfisk were. As she over heard the entire conversation she saw a bomb in the shape of a gummi hit the rouge Stunfisk. I like his attitude thought Bubbles before jumping from her hiding spot and grabbing the bomb. After much struggle Bubbles managed to get the bomb off and threw it where it came from before hearing a thud. Bubbles smirked. The bomb had hit the attacker. It would be little time before it exploded. Bubbles then turned to the Stunfisk. Sorry about your attacker. Said Bubbles. I like your sense of humor. And I couldn't leave you to be hurt like that. Said Bubbles before smiling. Meanwhile Sparky and Pom were walking around,trying to find something to do. Ok Sparky if we encounter a poison type don't run away I'll help you. Said Pom still expressing concern about his teammates fear of poison. Ok grumbled Sparky before coming across a Weedle Turtwig and Skourpi. Come on Sparky lets make some new friends besides you know that Weedle already. Said Pom recognizing the Weedle quickly. Fine. Said Sparky still reluctant to Jake and Pom's idea of &quot;building relationships&quot;. Just then Sparky overheard the Skourpi's excitement at Hermione's firestream attack. Time to show off my strength! Thought Sparky before running over to the group. H-Hi! Said Sparky still slightly scared but trying to get over it. I ssee you like battles and moves. Sparky said to the Skourpi. If yyou want I can show you my moves. I also know the move firestream. You seem to think it's cool. Maybe I ccoould teach you it. Said Sparky trying his best to be kind.<br />
Meanwhile Telpo was wondering where to go. He then shuttered as he felt a eerie aura flowing from a distance. It was coming straight from the center of the grove! I got to tell the others! Thought Telpo just before he was about to tell the telepathy before he made up his mind that he'd go by himself. As he floated past many pokemon he saw a Meowth and a Purrloin hiding from a group of pokemon before firing a bomb into the group. Who are you and why did you fire that bomb? Asked Telpo to the cat pokemon before noticing that the Purrlion was the Meowth's girlfriend and deiced to embarrass him so he would learn his lesson. So who's your girlfriend? Asked Telpo. Whoever she is you can do better then that! Said Telpo before laughing. Ok sorry about that said Telpo. I just couldn't resist anyway my names Telpo,your Meowth aren't you? I've heard about you from my teammate Pom said Telpo. But just then a bomb in the shape of a gummi hit and stuck right to Telpo's head. Telpo started to freak out before telporting away.However since he hadn't mastered telport yet so instead of leaving the bomb behind half came with him and half stayed, both parts ready to explode! As Telpo finished his teleport he came to a group with a Timburr and two Eeevee. Hi! Said Telpo to the group hoping to make friends. But just then Telpo realized thhat half the bomb was still attached to his head. But it was to late to get it half because just then it exploded. Hitting Telpo and all the pokemon near him. </span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: #944D94"><span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Myrtle, Rubeus, Meowth, Selina, Neville, Bubbles, Telpo:</u></b> Meowth smirked in satisfaction as he waited for the Gummi Bomb to explode. However, at that moment, an Abra appeared out of nowhere, demanding to know why Meowth fired off that attack. &quot;Because dat Stunfisk happens ta be the most hated menace in da whole region,&quot; Meowth replied. &quot;And if tings go right, it'll soon be our supper,&quot; he added. Telpo then noticed Selina and told Meowth that he could do better than her. That got Meowth angry. &quot;Excuse me?!&quot; Meowth snarled as the Abra started laughing. &quot;Where do youse get off, sayin' dat about Selina?! Youse gots two seconds ta apologize before youse gets a faceful of Iron Tail,&quot; he threatened, his tail starting to glow as he spoke. However, at that moment, Telpo apologized, stating that he couldn't resist. He introduced himself, revealing that he was one of Pom's teammates. &quot;Oh, yeah, I met Pom,&quot; nodded Meowth, calming down somewhat. Just then, a Corphish came over, removed the Gummi Bomb, and launched it back in Meowth's direction, and it landed on Telpo's head, causing the Abra to freak out before vanishing. Meowth blinked, and then noticed to his shock that half the Gummi Bomb had been left behind! Meowth had to act fast- he couldn't send it flying away without getting it stuck to himself, and he could not, would not let Selina get hurt. He had only enough time to move in front of Selina before that half exploded. Meowth took the full force of the blast, his actions having been sufficient to protect the Purrloin. Naturally, Meowth didn't take the attack very well, and collapsed to the ground. Weakly, he tried to climb back to his feet, and managed to shoot an angry glare at the Corphish who was currently chatting with Neville.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Rubeus and Myrtle weren't particularly pleased to see a Corphish acting friendly to Fizzytopia's most wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are kid-ding, right?&quot; Myrtle scowled. &quot;Of course you could leave him to be hurt! Ne-ville is the nas-ti-est, most in-sane, back-stab-bing, and cold-heart-ed Po-ke-mon it has e-ver been my dis-plea-sure to have sli-thered in-to my life!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could not have said it better myself,&quot; added Rubeus as he frowned at Bubbles. &quot;Neville is a disgrace to my species.&quot;<br />
<br />
<b><u>Scorpius, Hermione, Pom, Sparky, Toby:</u></b> As Scorpius and Hermione were talking to Toby, an Aipom and Joltik approached them, the latter of whom Hermione recognized as Sparky, the Joltik who was afraid of Poison-types. &quot;Hello, Sparky,&quot; Hermione greeted the Joltik. &quot;Hello, Pom,&quot; she added to the Aipom. &quot;Scorpius, these are friends of mine, Sparky and Pom. Sparky, Pom, this is my boyfriend, Scorpius.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pleased to meet you,&quot; grinned Scorpius. &quot;So you know Firestream, too? That's really cool. Truth be told,&quot; he added, &quot;It wasn't so much the Firestream attack I liked, so much as it was the Pokemon using it.&quot; This statement caused Hermione to blush slightly as she nuzzled the Skorupi affectionately.<br />
<br />
<b><u>Millicent/Willow, Cyanide, Chiaka, Telpo:</u></b> As Millicent and the two Eevee were talking, Millicent suddenly frowned and turned to face the log she was holding. &quot;What, Willow?&quot; she asked. A second later, she nodded, grabbed Cyanide's tail, and stepped back as a frantic Abra materialized out of nowhere, and half of a Gummi Bomb stuck to her head exploded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gah!&quot; exclaimed Cyanide as she was dragged back. She growled at Millicent, but stopped as she heard the explosion &quot;What the hell?&quot; she demanded.<br />
<br />
Millicent and Cyanide had backed up sufficiently to avoid the blast altogether. Now, the Timburr ran forward, looking a little concerned for Chiaka and Telpo. &quot;Hey, you guys OK?&quot; the Timburr asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Millicent, how'd you even know?&quot; asked Cyanide. She was looking decidedly less pissed at the Timburr, now that she had actually done something right by her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Willow told me,&quot; replied Millicent with an air of stating the obvious.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, how is it that you can hear Willow and nobody else can?&quot; demanded the Eevee as she approached the chunk of wood, glancing at it dubiously. After a few seconds, Millicent nodded at the log and then spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;She says only those she wants to hear her will be able to hear her. Well, and other ghosts. Keith's 25% Gastly, you know, and I'm pretty sure he at least senses Willow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mm-hmm,&quot; replied Cyanide, unsure whether to believe any of this.</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px">OOC: Oh Bubbles, how I love you. &lt;3 My colour is also terrible for anybody using WOOPA GANGNAM STYLE, so I'm removing it. <br />
<br />
<u>Myrtle, Rubeus, Meowth, Selina, Neville, Bubbles</u><br />
Neville suddenly felt a large mass on his head, barely feeling it while under the remnants of the Curse. It was starting to fade, or so he thought, and the mass was little more to a bother to him. And as sudden as it came, it was picked off of his skin and thrown away. He heard a faint voice next to him. <i>Must be my... savior, I suppose. Why, thank you, random pokemon.</i> Thanked the Stunfisk in his mind, finally being able to form a complete thought. <i>Now to repay... her.</i> His flat eyes cracked open, and he could see a blurry red crab and the rag that had attacked him. His eyes slowly adjusted from the black insides of his eyelids to the Grove's light, and he finally opened his eyes. &quot;Very brave of you, c-cat...&quot; Neville said, his voice only a croak. &quot;It's a shame your trying to kill me, however. Thanks to you as well, Corphish.&quot; <br />
<br />
Neville then spurred into action, turning to Myrtle. &quot;Now, you. I think we have something to discuss, hehe...&quot; The flat pokemon lunged at the Shuppet, his thoughts only focused on PAYBACK. &quot;Listen to me. NEVER. DO. THAT. AGAIN.&quot; His <b>Static</b> triggered, freezing the Shuppet in place. &quot;I don't care how much you hate me. I just want you to understand that I am not one to be messed with. Understand?&quot; The Stunfisk's eyes crackled with electricity before releasing a SHOCK WAVE. Neville, running out of energy for his rapid attacks, decided enough was enough, and turned into a mini gingerbread Stunfisk with CAN'T CATCH ME to flee.<br />
<br />
<u>Millicent/Willow, Cyanide, Chiaka, Telpo</u><br />
&quot;I just don't know... Maybe he's watching us right now!&quot; Chiaka exclaimed, scanning the area around them. Millicent suddenly grabbed Cyanide's tail and pulled her away. &quot;Hey, what's going on?&quot; Chiaka quickly found out what was going on. The Abra flashed into existence and the Gummi on her head exploded almost simultaneously. Chaiak was knocked off her feet and thrown into the dirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oww...&quot; Chiaka groaned before shaking herself off. She glanced at where the flash of yellow had been, and ran over to it, ignoring Milicent and the pain in her side. Priorities. &quot;Oh gosh, are you okay?&quot; The Eevee nudged the Abra, hoping she would respond. <br />

The pain from the attacks and the paralysis wracked Myrtle's body, but what she had noticed the most was the intense rush of vengeance she had tasted during the assault. Neville was about as hell-bent on vengeance as any Shuppet or Banette, and the Stunfisk's thirst for payback was such a powerful negative emotion, she found herself momentarily stunned by it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Myrtle, are you alright?&quot; asked Rubeus.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Oh... Yes, I will be all right,&quot; Myrtle muttered to Rubeus, though her mind was elsewhere at the moment. The vengeance she had tasted from Neville, it was intense, it was unlike anything she ever tasted before. Why she was so fixated on this, however, was beyond her... Even the best of meals had never left her thinking about it so much afterwards. In fact, the only other time she could remember ever thinking about something so obsessively, aside from her grudge, of course, was whenever she had been talking to Bedivere... No. Oh, <i>FUCK</i>, no. No, this couldn't be what she was starting to think it was. She loved Bedivere, damn it! How much time did she spend trying to convince him that she loathed and despised Neville? How many times did she state again and again that the mere sight of that fish's handsome face made her want to puke- wait, <i>handsome</i>?! What was happening to her?! No, no, this wasn't acceptable! She loved Bedivere, she wanted Bedivere, and besides, Neville was insane, ruthless, cold-hearted, evil, and so full of sweet, sweet vengeance- GAH! What the hell was going on in that Shuppet's mind?!?!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. My. Arceus,&quot; came a voice from behind Myrtle. The Shuppet swung around to spot Luna, Keith's Swoobat, hovering right behind her, her mouth agape in pure shock. And Luna was never fazed by anything, it took a lot to really shock her. Something big. Something huge. Something so mind-bendingly impossible that some might consider it a sign of the apocalypse.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Myrtle said warningly. &quot;Do not say it. Do not.&quot; She didn't think she could bear to hear it spoken aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;DON'T!&quot; Myrtle interrupted. &quot;Do not say it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You love Neville,&quot; stated Luna quietly.<br />
<br />
Silence. A stunned silence filled the area at Luna's claim. Rubeus turned to face Myrtle, pure shock on his face. &quot;Myrtle,&quot; he said in tones of disbelief, &quot;is this true?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... No...&quot; Myrtle hissed, her tone implying she was trying to convince herself of the truth of her statement as much as she was trying to convince everyone else. &quot;No... It can-not be... It is Be-di-vere I love! I can-not... I can-not be in love with some-thing so... so vi-le... so... so e-vil... so... so full of... of ven-geance... sweet, sweet ven-geance... No,&quot; gasped Myrtle as she realized that the thoughts and feelings she was trying so hard to deny were finding a voice, in spite of her best efforts. &quot;No, this can-not be! Some-bo-dy stop this mad-ness!&quot; With that, Myrtle flew off, part of her hoping to leave those feelings behind, part of her hoping to find Neville again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it... Damn it...&quot; Myrtle muttered to herself as she flew around. &quot;Just mi-nutes a-go, I hit him with Curse... And I <i>care!</i> What is the <i>deal?!</i>&quot; As she muttered this, she started to feel the self-inflicted pain from her Curse- really feel it. But why? Minerva had told her that she would only feel joy if the Curse's target truly deserved it... But now the Shuppet was feeling terrible. Just then, she spotted the fleeing form of what appeared to be a small gingerbread version of a Stunfisk. And the sight did not repulse her as it usually did, something that seriously freaked the Shuppet out. Before she knew what she was doing, she called out to him. &quot;N-Ne-ville? Ne-ville, wait!&quot;</span></span></div>

As a Swoobat stated that the Shuppet liked Neville, Bubbles felt a small fire ignite inside of her. She was in love with Neville and that stupid Shuppet wasn't going to have him. As the Shuppet flew away in denial of being in love with Neville,Bubbles waited a minute before giving chase. It was a good few minutes that Bubbles was stalking the Shuppet before the Shuppet saw a gingerbread version of Neville running away. N-Ne-ville? Ne-ville, wait!&quot; Said the shuppet. Oh no you don't! Said Bubbles before firing a blizzard right at the Shuppet before walking over. Neville is mine and your not going to steal him from me you got that you idiot! Yelled Bubbles before continuing. You know what you remind me of Cyanide and I hate that and as such I saw punish you for that and for stealing my love! Said Bubbles before firing a toxic right at the Shuppet. <br />
<br />
Millicent/Willow, Cyanide, Chiaka, Telpo<br />
<br />
Yeah I'm ok. Said Telpo before getting up. Sorry about that explosion. Someone attacked me and I freaked out. Anyway my names Telpo. Just then Telpo felt a strong presence of a spirit. And not a good spirit either. An evil one and it was coming from the Timburrs log! Telpo rushed forward towards the Timburr. Um Timburr I need your log. Theres something wrong with your log! There's an evil spirit possessing your log1 I need to destroy it! Panicked Telpo. <br />
<br />
Scorpius, Hermione, Pom, Sparky, Toby:<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn't so much the Firestream attack I liked, so much as it was the Pokemon using it.&quot; This statement caused Hermione to blush slightly as she nuzzled the Skorupi affectionately. Sparky felt like he really bit the dust. Sorry I have to go now. Sparky lied before telling Pom it was time to leave. Your just jealous that Hermione was a relationship and you haven't even told your crushh that you like her. I don't have a crush! Said Sparky getting angry at Pom. Oh really? Because I swear you told me you like Kieth's Ivysaur Pomona. Said Pom clearly teasing Sparky. Shut up! Yelled Sparky before running away from Pom. Hoping to just get away from him.</span></span></div>

Bubbles yelled at Bubbles, claiming that Neville was hers, and-<br />
<br />
Myrtle could see Bubbles's mouth move, but all further talk was drowned out. A furious, boiling rage was welling up within the Shuppet, and were she still not a little worn from the last time she used that move, she'd have cast a Curse on the Corphish right then and there. Myrtle was more furious at this moment than she could ever remember being since her death. As Bubbles unleashed Toxic, Myrtle expertly blasted a <b>Water Gun</b> right at the highly poisonous fluid, cancelling the attack out.<br />
<br />
&quot;You bitch,&quot; hissed Myrtle, an ominous, somewhat insane grin forming on her face as fire danced in her eyes. &quot;You dare... You... You dare...&quot; As she said this, a bright glow overtook her entire body. To an onlooker, it would look like she was evolving, but this was not the case, of course- she was only level 5, and Shuppet need to reach level 37 to evolve into Banette. No, this glowing was harsh and almost too bright- Myrtle then rushed forward suddenly, slamming into Bubbles with a powerful <b>Sky Attack</b>, plowing the Corphish halfway into the ground. &quot;How dare you try and take that Stun-fisk for your-self! You des-pi-ca-ble bitch! I love Ne-ville!!!&quot; she shouted while firing off a wicked <b>Thunderbolt</b> at the Corphish, not seeming to realize just how loud she was shouting it, or indeed, just what she had just confessed. She wheeled around and continued to go after Neville.<br />
<br />
<b><u>Millicent/Willow, Cyanide, Chiaka, Telpo:</u></b> As Telpo got back up, he suddenly approached Millicent and asked for her log, stating that there was an evil spirit possessing it and he needed to destroy it. At these words, Millicent took several hasty steps back and hid her log behind her back. &quot;No!&quot; she exclaimed, horrified. &quot;Willow isn't evil! She's my best friend! You can't destroy her!&quot; There was a definite tone of panic in her voice as she pleaded with the Abra to spare Willow.</span></span></div>

The Shuppet fired a thunderbolt before yelling at Bubbles that she loved Neville. Loud enough for any pokemon passing by to hear. Before turning back to chase after Neville. Just then Sparky came running by to see his teammate crushed into the ground. Now normally Sparky wouldn't have cared if Bubbles was hurt or not but this situation felt different. Are you ok Bubbles? Sparky asked before running over. Yyeah I think so said Bubbles before getting up and checking to see if thhe Shuppet was still there. Hey slave can you help me? Asked Bubbles to Sparky hoping for some help for once. Only if you stop calling me slave. Said Sparky. Bubbles pondered it for a minute before saying, Ok shrimp. Sparky was still insulted but it was an improvement over slave. Alright Bubbles what do you need? Asked Sparky hoping it wasn't something over the top. I need your help defeating this Shuppet. She's trying to steal my crush. Alright I can help with that where is she? Asked Sparky. Bubbles pointed to the Shuppet who had made quite a bit of progress away from them by now. Alright lets do this! Said Sparky before giving chase with Bubbles right behind.<br />
<br />
Millicent/Willow, Cyanide, Chiaka, Telpo: &quot;No!&quot; the Timburr exclaimed, horrified. &quot;Willow isn't evil! She's my best friend! You can't destroy her!&quot; There was a definite tone of panic in her voice as she pleaded with Telpo to spare Willow. I won't harm the spirit said Telpo before putting a hand over his head. Please I'm just going to get that spirit out of the log. That spirit is giving me a serious headache! Yelled Telpo before teleporting behind the Timburr and snatched the log away from the Timburr. I'm just going to try to get the spirit out of the log said Telpo before using his psychic powers to try to lure the spirit away from the log.</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: #944D94"><span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Helena, Myrtle, Neville, Bubbles, Sparky:</u></b> As Sparky agreed to help Bubbles defeat Myrtle, this did not go unnoticed by another Shuppet who happened to be passing by- Helena, Keith's other Shuppet. She heard enough of the conversation to realize that not only had Myrtle actually fallen in love with Neville, but that Bubbles and Sparky were going to attempt stop her attempts at getting together with him. Now, Helena had heard all the stories about Neville, but she didn't think any less of her big sister for falling in love with him. And she sure as hell wasn't going to float idly by while knowing that there were those conspiring to keep them apart. She considered confronting them directly, but came up with a sneakier idea; she turned invisible and caught up to Myrtle, floating right by her side until she could tell that Bubbles and Sparky would have lost sight of her for a moment. At that instant, Helena made herself visible and went off in a totally different direction, one that would be clearly visible to the Corphish and Joltik. The idea was that they would mistake her for Myrtle and chase after her instead.<br />
<br />
<b><u>Millicent/Willow, Cyanide, Chiaka, Telpo:</u></b> &quot;No! No! You can't do that, this log is her home- NO!&quot; Millicent screamed as Telpo Teleported behind her and swiped the log. As he tried to use his psychic powers to get Willow out of the log, Millicent leaped forward and grabbed the log, desperately trying to pull it out of Telpo's grip. &quot;Please, please, I'll ask her to stop whatever it is she's doing that's giving you a headache, just don't take her out, please!!!&quot; wailed Millicent. And then, suddenly, the log started to vibrate ever so slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop,&quot; came an odd voice which seemed to be emanating from the log. &quot;I ask you to please cease your efforts to remove me from my home.&quot; the voice stated, appearing to address Telpo. Millicent's face showed no surprise at this, though it appeared as though Cyanide's mind was blown. Usually, this voice was only audible to Millicent, as well as Ghost-types and certain other special beings. But now, Willow was speaking for anyone within earshot to hear. &quot;I will not leave this log,&quot; the voice continued. &quot;I am sorry about your headache, but if I am causing it, I am doing so involuntarily and without my knowledge.&quot; The log then fell still and silent once more, and Millicent, making use of her formidable <b>Strength</b>, yanked the log out of Telpo's grip and hugged it close to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please...&quot; Millicent pleaded, tears forming in her eyes as she slowly backed away from the Abra. &quot;Willow is all I had in that wretched Adoption Center for all those months... Being able to talk to her was all that kept me going in there! When... when my original trainer dumped me in the Adoption Center, I felt scared and confused... I didn't know what I had done wrong, and over the next couple of days, many trainers came in and looked at all the Pokemon... None of them wanted me... I started to give up all hope, and I wanted to kill myself, but then, my log started talking to me. Willow's first words to me were, 'there is a right trainer for every Pokemon'... And she was right, too- Keith likes having us on the team, both me and Willow. She's my best friend, she's practically my sister... Please don't take her out of the log...&quot; finished Millicent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gonna butt in here for a second,&quot; added Cyanide. &quot;I'm gonna side with Millicent on this one. Least I could do- Willow's the one who warned her about the incoming Gummi Bomb, and she pulled me to safety, so yeah, I kinda owe them for that. Don't get used to it, though,&quot; she snapped to Millicent, though the Timburr smiled her appreciation nonetheless.</span></span></div>

Please...&quot; Millicent pleaded, tears forming in her eyes as she slowly backed away from the Abra. &quot;Willow is all I had in that wretched Adoption Center for all those months... Being able to talk to her was all that kept me going in there! When... when my original trainer dumped me in the Adoption Center, I felt scared and confused...

And she was right, too- Keith likes having us on the team, both me and Willow. She's my best friend, she's practically my sister... Please don't take her out of the log...&quot; finished Millicent. Despite Telpo's headache still being around Telpo felt guilty about hurting Millicent's feelings,remembering his own time in the adoption center. I I can relate said Telpo. When I got traded to my old trainer I i thought she loved me. I remember when I decided to take a short nap before showing my trainer just how good I was in battle. But when I was asleep she traded me to the adoption center for a stone. A stupid stone! Yelled Telpo before tears filled his eyes. Even though I wasn't there for long,it was traumatizing. None of the other pokemon would talk to me,they thought I wanted to hurt them. But all I wanted was to make some friends. Cried Telpo before breaking down from the memories of his terrible time at the adoption center.<br />
<br />
c, Myrtle, Neville, Bubbles, Sparky,Botch<br />
As Sparky agreed to help Bubbles defeat Myrtle, this did not go unnoticed by another Shuppet who happened to be passing by- Helena, Keith's other Shuppet. She heard enough of the conversation to realize that not only had Myrtle actually fallen in love with Neville, but that Bubbles and Sparky were going to attempt stop her attempts at getting together with him. Now, Helena had heard all the stories about Neville, but she didn't think any less of her big sister for falling in love with him. And she sure as hell wasn't going to float idly by while knowing that there were those conspiring to keep them apart. She considered confronting them directly, but came up with a sneakier idea; she turned invisible and caught up to Myrtle, floating right by her side until she could tell that Bubbles and Sparky would have lost sight of her for a moment. At that instant, Helena made herself visible and went off in a totally different direction, one that would be clearly visible to the Corphish and Joltik. The idea was that they would mistake her for Myrtle and chase after her instead. There was only one problem. A Grimer who was bathing in the water nearby who had saw the Shuppet and put two and two together. He needed to alert Sparky and Bubbles. Sparky Bubbles there's trouble! Bubbles and Sparky turned around shocked to see there new teammate &quot;running&quot; towards them. Whwhat is it Botch? Asked Sparky. Still troubled about Botch being his teammate. I heard what you guys were saying and I want to help but I just saw another Shuppet listening to your conversation and it didn't look happy. Said Botch before continuing. I think that Shuppet is going to try and trick you! Just then the trio turned around to see two Shuppet moving in two different directions. Alright I'll take the one going to the right (Helena) you guys take the one on the left (Myrtle) said Botch. That does it said Bubbles getting even angrier then before. Alright lets go said Bubbles Oh and thanks Shrimp and Stench for helping. Said Bubbles. No problem. Said Sparky. Anything for love and justice! Said Botch before the group went there separate ways.<br />
<br />
Helena,Botch<br />
<br />
After a bit of trailing Botch managed to catch up. So are you the Shuppet that my friends are after or the decoy?! Yelled Botch before continuing. Well, it doesn't matter either way your stopping my friend Bubbles from confessing to Neville her true feelings. Now prepare for justice criminal! Yelled Botch before using harden and then used mud slap and aimed right at the Shuppet's face.<br />
<br />
Myrtle, Neville, Bubbles, Sparky<br />
<br />
As Bubbles and Sparky caught up to the Shuppet,Bubbles almost immediately knew it was the Shuppet they were after.<br />
Hey! Yelled Bubbles to the Shuppet. I love Neville and you won't stop me from confessing that to him! Yelled Bubbles before firing a ice beam and then a toxic at the Shuppet. That's right Bubbles has her right to! Yelled Sparky before firing a thunder wave and fire stream at the Shuppet.<br />
