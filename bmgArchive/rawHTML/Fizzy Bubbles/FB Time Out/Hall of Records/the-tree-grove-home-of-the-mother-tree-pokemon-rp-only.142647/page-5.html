<article class="message-body js-selectToQuote">
<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><b>August, Durandal, Seath</b> - Despite Seath's initial reluctance to engage his powerful mother in battle, he was even more reluctant to disappoint her. His trust in the dragon that birthed him overcomes any fear that he may significantly harm her, and as a display of this trust, he fires off an <b>Ice Beam</b> at August. Certainly, the move was a good choice if he wanted to inflict significant damage and earn himself the advantage... But to open with one's trump card too early was nearly always a costly mistake, and Seath needed to learn that lesson before he made the blunder with a less forgiving opponent. Quick to react, August shields herself with <b>Protect</b>. She then breathes in deeply, letting the air turn caustic in her lungs, before unleashing her <b>Dragonbreath</b>. If Seath had been training well, the amount of time it took for August to prepare the attack (and to control the amount of breath so as not to completely obliterate her son) would be enough for him to spring out of the way when the spray of breath came... If not, it would certainly be a painful lesson that he needs more agility training. Not allowing herself to give her son too much time to escape the attack, August could only hope that she was calculating the right amount of breath. She assumed a creature of her own flesh and blood could take more than the little spit of breath that sent Lizzie writhing in pain, but certainly not as much as she would breathe in the face of his father, were she to battle him again. Indeed, in sharp contrast to the bloodlust and mania that she displayed in her passionate battle with Duran, August is far more calculating and precises in her movements and actions this time around.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Hedwig, Sangre</b> - Hedwig had made her kill with the precision and devastating efficiency that Sangre expected of one who belonged to his species. Of course, it would take more than taking down a single, noisy Mothim to impress Sangre, but at the very least, Hedwig had shown herself to be capable in contrast to her blunder in the Park. Sangre finds it vaguely amusing that Hedwig seems to be avoiding the flock of Venomoth. Was she full already? No, she had to still be thirsting, at the very least. Was she intimidated by the numbers? ...Or did she, perhaps, have some moral compunction against killing Venomoth? Well, Sangre had no such compunctions, and if there was one thing Sangre knew about flocks of insects, it was that such gatherings could work to his advantage just as easily as they could work to his detriment. A well-organized, powerful group could work together to ensure his downfall... but a disorganized group that easily falls into disarray could be used to his advantage. Besides, if the group happened to have a straggler... Well, he wouldn't want to disappoint Mr. Darwin, now, would he?<br />
<br />
Sangre takes a turn toward the group of Venomoth, eager to scope out their group. Though he remains focused on the task at hand, in the back of his mind, he can't help but wonder how Hedwig will react.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Lizzie</b> - A young Axew runs as fast as her little legs will carry her toward the Tree Grove entrance, all while being pursued by a man with a green bandanna and a standard-issue daycare uniform, complete with an apron covered in advertisements for the Fizzytopian Daycare - UPN Branch. Though the man's plastic name tag proclaims that he is &quot;happy to take care of your Pokemon,&quot; he does not seem quite so happy to be chasing down this impish little dragon as she high-tails it to the Tree Grove. As he runs, his arms and legs trail droplets of blood, and the jagged scars that are visible through his uniform look as if they've been inflicted with a sharp, thin blade.<br />
<br />
&quot;LIZZIE! LIZZIE, GET BACK HERE!!&quot; The man tries to recall Lizzie using the Pokeball her trainer provided, but each zap of the red beam barely misses the dodging, weaving Tusk Pokemon. The blood loss seems to be getting to the increasingly pale man, who stops briefly to scarf down a Sitrus Berry and pull out his phone. He attempts to break into another sprint, but before he can go any further, a burly-looking Machoke stops the man dead in his tracks. He points to the sign, proclaiming the entrance to the Tree Grove, and gives the Daycare Worker a stern look. Laughing nervously, the worker backs up, as he sheepishly describes the situation on his Xtranceiver;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have a situation, here. Lizzie made another break for it. Yeah, yeah, she unfortunately made it out this time. Jumped clear through the window. Not a scratch on the little bugger... I did follow her out! I got the scars to prove it, man! ....Er, well, y'see, there's a little problem. I-I... yes, I know. Yes, but the thing is, she's gotten all the way to the Tree Grove, and I can't - okay. Okay. Look, I have no idea what to tell the trainer, okay? She probably knows her Pokemon's a total - Yes. Yes. I understand. We'll let Marion take care of it. Yes. Okay, okay - Okay, bye.&quot; The man ends the call and sighs heavily, trudging his way back to the Daycare Center.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Lizzie smirks to herself as she explores the outskirts of the Tree Grove. <i>Made it to Sanctuary,</i> she thinks to herself with a smug sense of satisfaction. <i>Lock ME up in that miserable shop, will she? HAH! Serves her right. Now she has to take me home,</i> Lizzie muses, though her eyes suddenly flash with the slightest bit of panic. <i>I hope she won't be too mad at me...</i></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: #944D94"><span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Hedwig, Sangre:</u></b> Hedwig kept all her senses on high alert, hoping to get a whiff of a nice, blood-filled creature... Mmm, maybe a Miltank... Hedwig loved the taste of Miltank blood. She glanced around, although not really expecting to get anything by sight that her other senses would miss... Then, she saw that Sangre was heading off in the direction of the Venomoth swarm.<br />
<br />
Hedwig had to suppress the urge to sigh. Her teammates being who they were, the female Crobat had grown up with something of an aversion to feeding on Venomoth and Dustox (though her taste for Beedrill was in no way diminished by Melittin's presence on the team). Lily in particular was one of her oldest friends. But then again, this wasn't going to make her look especially good to Sangre, was it? He probably still didn't think much of her after what happened at the Park, and Hedwig was fuming at the thought of her hunting skills being called into question. Silently, she flapped after Sangre, swearing to herself that word of this would never get back to Lily. And even if she didn't eat any Venomoth herself, nothing was stopping her from accompanying Sangre. Besides which, Hedwig had to admit, she kinda wanted to see him in action.<br />
<br />
<b><u>Dudley, Lizzie:</u></b> On the outskirts of the tree grove, Lizzie the Axew was exploring the place, and soon enough, she would come across a Slowpoke, just laying on the ground, his tail dipped into the pool of water behind him. This Slowpoke, who, unusually for his species, was colored a pale shade of lavender, seemed at first to not notice Lizzie. Then, he blinked and slowly turned his head to face the Axew.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Wait a minute,&quot; he murmured. &quot;You not Norbert. Dudley not know who you are.&quot;</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #FF0000">&quot;Kukuku~ Onward my trusty steed!&quot; Lumiere roared with excitement as he zipped through the air on the back of Rune. &quot;I'm not your Ponyta, Lumie. As your senior, you should treat me with respect,&quot; buzzed the Vibrava. &quot;Silence, imbecile! No one is deserving of my respect! Don't make me unleash my rage upon you~!&quot; the newborn Litwick wisped, trying to sound tough. Rune shrugged it off with a laugh, &quot;Charm told me to look after you on our visit to the Tree Grove, but he didn't say I can't discipline you! I could easily drop you to the ground if I wanted to.&quot; &quot;... Sorry, m'am.&quot; &quot;... It's alright sweetie, just promise to behave. We can't have you turning out like Don.&quot; &quot;B-but Don is awesome! Charm told me that Don is the one who named me. He said it was French for Light!&quot; &quot;... Oh, boy. Listen, that Murkrow is not a good role model. He can be obedient, but he's also unpredictable and arguably evil.&quot; &quot;Yeah, whatever. Kukuku.~&quot; Rune was beginning to wonder why Charm would send little Lumie to a place like this in the first place with only her to supervise. Was this a test?<br />
<br />
The entrance was now within sight as Rune continued buzzing through the air at a moderate speed, so as to not drop Lumiere. &quot;Okay, Lumie. We have to check in with that Furret over there by the counter. No funny business, got it?&quot; the Vibrava said. &quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; Lumiere passively answered. Rune descended just enough to face the Furret, &quot;Hi! It's just us two entering today, I think. I'm Rune and this is Lumiere.&quot; &quot;Whatcha looking at, missy~?&quot; Lumiere said in his way of a greeting. The Furret looked curiously at the Litwick, then Rune, before nodding her approval. &quot;Eh, sorry about him. He's a newborn so he still lacks basic courtesy,&quot; Rune buzzed, apologizing for Lumiere before taking off once again. &quot;Lumie, I told you to behave!&quot; Rune chastised. &quot;Yeah, well, she looked at me weird,&quot; Lumiere answered. &quot;She had to at least inspect us to make sure we're not going to cause trouble. I'm surprised she let us through after what you said. You better be on your best behavior from now on, or else.&quot; &quot;... Sorry, m'am.&quot; <br />
<br />
Rune flew up to the base of the tree before landing. Lumiere demounted himself as they looked up in wonder. &quot;Woahhhh, this tree his huge!~&quot; the Litwick said in awe. &quot;It is. It's my first time here as well, so I don't know what to expect. Stay close to me at all times, never leave my sight. Got it?&quot; Rune looked down only to see Lumiere already scurrying along towards the tree. &quot;Hey, wait up!&quot; she flew after the Candle Pokemon, soon catching up to him as they both ventured into the vast Mother Tree.</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: #00FF00">&quot;<i>Fuffee!</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>No, I told you, my name is Fra-</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>FUFFEE!</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>FRANCIS!</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>FUFFEE!</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>FRA...</i>&quot; a heavy sigh echoed among the leaves of the Mother Tree, followed by the sound of soft wiping of wood and a tiny thud. &quot;<i>I give up. I simply cannot change your mind, can you?</i>&quot; A squirrel-like Pokémon smoothed his shiny fur, sitting on a branch in the company of what seemed like a floating pink ball. The ball did a backflip and squealed &quot;<i>Fuffee!</i>&quot; before hovering over the other Pokémon and landing on his head. &quot;<i>I shall say it one more time: my name is Francis Gaylord the First. And you had better start learning that, young lady, or I will not let you accompany me to the more sophisticated events.</i>&quot; Aisling the Igglybuff leaned over the forehead of her Pachirisu companion, staring at him with her big round eyes. She nodded with full confidence. <br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Fuffee.</i>&quot; <br />
<br />
Francis let out another sigh before returning to straighten the very straight pink hair on his fluffy tail. For some inexplicable reason, the young Igglybuff had taken a shine to the shiny Pachirisu that had recently joined Noriko's team. The keyword possibly being &quot;shiny&quot; - the shininess and pinkness of the Pokémon had attracted Aisling like a Murkrow to a pile of silver spoons. The fur had also earned Francis the nickname &quot;Fuffee&quot;, though it could also have been the fault of the Baby Pokémon's incapability to pronounce correctly. Luma, a Cleffa Aisling considered her little brother, had immediately started calling Francis &quot;Fuffee&quot; after hearing Aisling use the word upon first meeting the self-proclaimed noble Pachirisu. As much as Francis had intended to make relations with the other Pokémon he was living with, the Baby Pokémon had both been following him around absolutely everywhere they could, loudly crying the ridiculous nickname whether he was in their sights or not. The little male Cleffa would have been there himself if it hadn't been for the height of the tree and his incapability to climb up the branches - the poor thing had been left crying in the stroller prepared for him and his &quot;sister&quot; as Francis made a run for less baby-talk-filled areas, only to be followed by the balloon-like Aisling. The squirrel was certain he had now learned how single parents everywhere felt when attempting to socialize with anyone but their little ones. Aisling tried to hug his head with her stubby little arms with a big smile on her face, absolutely certain that a hug would make everything all better.<br />
<br />
Leaves rustled a bit as a black feline climbed on the branch. He glanced at Aisling briefly before giving Francis a look - schadenfreude mixed with a tiny bit of sympathy. &quot;<i>You'd think a rock tied to your leg is bad, but I say a balloon's worse.</i>&quot; Cherith smirked as Francis turned his head the other way, trying to show exactly how little he cared about the thieving Pokémon's opinion. &quot;<i>Boy, am I glad my spiky ball and chain can't get up here. I can actually have a life every once in a while! Well, social life calls and answer I must. Ciao!</i>&quot; The Purrloin leaped onto a thick branch nearby, and another and another, eventually leaping his way out of sight among the green leaves. Aisling wasn't exactly sure what was going on between Francis and Cherith, but it didn't sound nice and always made Fuffee look sad and angry. She tried another hug before settling for patting the Pachirisu's head in the most encouraging way she knew how. Pain pain go away.</span></div>

As he came closer for a better look, he recognized one of them. &quot;Hey! Hey!&quot; exclaimed Norbert as the Axew plodded over to where the two of them were. &quot;Hey, hey, Rune, right?&quot; he said to the Vibrava. &quot;I was on your team for a little while! I saw you evolve when I was traded to Keith! I have a name now, I'm Norbert!&quot; The Axew sounded thrilled to see his former teammate, though as he turned to face the Litwick, he didn't seem to recognize him. &quot;Um,&quot; he added, &quot;I don't remember seeing you before. What's your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
<b><u>Rubeus, Aisling, <s>Fuffee</s> Francis:</u></b> Not long after the black-furred Purrloin left the Shiny Pachirisu alone with the Igglybuff who was causing him so much irritation, another Pokémon landed on a nearby branch- this one was a Stunfisk, who had been keeping himself airborne by rapidly flapping his side fins like wings. As he caught his breath, he noticed that he was not alone in the tree, and turned to face the pair of pink Pokémon. &quot;Oh, hello,&quot; he said to them. &quot;I don't believe we've met? My name is Rubeus.&quot;</span></span></div>

I didn't think I'd run into you here!&quot; the Vibration Pokemon buzzed with delight. &quot;Oh, your name is Norbert now, that's a nice name! I don't know if you remember, but we played together a lot during the short time you were on Charm's team, but I was just an immature Trapinch at that time- it's nice to see you again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rune almost forgot about the Litwick beside her, &quot;Oh, where are my manners, this is Lumie. Charm hatched him soon after he hatched you.&quot; &quot;It's Lumiere, the Ruler of Everything, you insect!&quot; the Litwick wisped with irritation, flailing his stubby arms into the air to display his superiority. He turned to face Norbert again, &quot;Kukuku~ You would be wise to be on my good side, Norbert, or horrible things will happen. I guarantee it,&quot; Lumiere cackled. &quot;Lumie, behave. Norbert is a nice Axew,&quot; she chastised, causing Lumiere to tense a bit, &quot;So... Norbert, is your new trainer treating you well?&quot;</span></span></div>

 <div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: #944D94"><span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Norbert, Lumiere, Rune:</u></b> Rune appeared to be just as pleased to see Norbert again as Norbert was to see her. He nodded enthusiastically as the Vibrava wondered whether he remembered how they would play together during Charm's brief ownership of the Axew. &quot;Yeah! Yeah! I remember!&quot; Norbert replied. &quot;It's great to see you again, too!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then, Rune introduced the Litwick next to her, referring to him as Lumie. The Litwick was quick to correct the Vibrava, calling himself Lumiere, the Ruler of Everything. In spite of his ominous statement that horrible things would happen should Norbert not be on his good side, the Axew looked somewhat unfazed. Rune scolded Lumiere before changing the subject, asking Norbert if his new trainer was treating him well.<br />
<br />
Norbert nodded again. &quot;Yeah!&quot; he replied. &quot;His name's Keith, and he's actually more of a Poison-type trainer, but he's got a lot of other non-Poison Pokémon, too, though I seem to be the only Dragon on his team. I think. I'm still not sure I met the whole team, he has a lot of Pokémon! And still, he manages to give all of us attention, and he's really nice to us! Ooh, some of my teammates are actually here with me!&quot; he added. &quot;You guys should meet them, some of them are really cool! Like this Qwilfish, I think he can use every attack there is! He says he can't, but I know Qwilfish can't usually learn Flamethrower or Teleport or Psywave. And then there's this weird Ledian who wants to take over the world, only he's all purple and his eyes are red. He's not nice, but Marvolo says I can't eat him because apparently Ledian taste awful,&quot; he shrugged. &quot;Oh, yeah, Marvolo- he's my trainer's Seviper, he teaches me how to hunt all the time!&quot; he added. &quot;Hey, so, you guys wanna meet some of my teammates?&quot; asked the Axew.</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #FF0000"><b><u>Norbert, Lumiere, Rune:</u></b> Rune was relieved to hear Norbert's trainer was good to him, &quot;That's good to hear! Being the only Dragon on a team isn't easy, not everyone can understand our kind like we do.&quot; She listened with eagerness as the Axew spoke of his teamates, though Lumiere was already looking around with curiosity as his interest in Norbert faded. He spoke of a Qwilish with the knowledge of many moves, a Seviper that's been teaching him the ways of hunting, and an odd purple Ledian that dreams of world domination. The last bit caught Lumiere's attention, his head flame intensifying as he childishly wailed, &quot;This Ledian thinks he has what it takes to take over <i>my</i> world?! He has another thing coming for him, kukuku~&quot; Rune was quick to interject before Lumiere got out of hand, &quot;Sweetie, this is not your world or his.&quot; Lumiere was taken a back, but he calmly responded, &quot;Yes, for now... Kukuku~&quot; as he rubbed his stubby hands together while giving off an evil grin. <br />
<br />
The Vibrava sighed when she heard his words; she didn't like what Lumiere was becoming- he's still young, however, maybe he can be steered to the right path. She had to hope so, for the good of everyone on her team. When she heard Norbert offer to introduce them to his teammates, her eyes flickered with hope- maybe meeting new Pokemon would help steer Lumiere to the right direction. &quot;Sure! It would be easier to reach them by flight. Why don't you two hop on my back and you can direct me where to go? We'll have to fly a little slow, though. I'm not used to flying with lots of weight on my back.&quot; With that said, Rune leaned downward so as to provide easy mounting access. &quot;Eh, might as well,&quot; Lumiere yawned, before climbing aboard. &quot;Hey, you wanna fly or what?&quot; he asked the Axew with growing impatience.</span></span></div>

What did they say he was? A... a... Shadow Pokémon, I think they called him?&quot; Then, Rune offered to fly Norbert and Lumiere to the Axew's teammates, and Norbert's eyes lit up. &quot;Ooh, yeah, that'd be cool!&quot; he exclaimed. Almost before the Litwick finished asking if he wanted to fly or what, Norbert had climbed onto the Vibrava's back. He held on, ready for the Dragon/Ground-type to take to the skies. &quot;Hey, hey, we should head over that way,&quot; he added, pointing off to their left. &quot;I think I saw my trainer's Arbok over that way earlier, she's really nice.&quot;</span></span></div>

<br />
The Vibrava slowly flaps her wings as she ascends into the air, surveying the surroundings before getting a glimpse at a large purple cobra Pokemon. &quot;Ah, there she is,&quot; she buzzes before heading in that direction. Meanwhile, Litwick is sitting comfortably behind Norbert, his wax body attaching itself to Rune's back with minimal difficulty. &quot;So, Norbert, do you evolve into a flier like Rune? I bet not, kukuku~&quot; he snidely comments. &quot;My trainer told me that my evolutions can float around, which is kinda like flying. An ability like that would let me do all kinds of things,&quot; he lets out a smirk after that last comment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lumie...&quot; Rune interjects as she continues her focus on flapping her wings. &quot;S-sorry m'am,&quot; the Litwick apologizes, suddenly child-like again. &quot;Oh look, we're already here. Be on your best behavior, Lumie.&quot; She descends herself near the Arbok; a warm, &quot;Hello, there!&quot; buzzing out of her mouth.</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: #944D94"><span style="font-size: 9px"><b>Nagini, Norbert, Lumiere, Rune:</b> As Rune took flight, Lumiere asked Norbert whether he evolved into a flier as Rune did, while snidely voicing his confidence that he did not. &quot;No, I don't,&quot; Norbert admitted. &quot;But ohhh, my trainer showed me pictures of what I'm gonna become someday! It's this big, big, huge, really strong thing called Haxorus, and you see these tusks? They become like these big giant blades on either side of my mouth and they're supposed to be absolutely indestructible!&quot; The Axew's eyes lit up, he was clearly nothing short of thrilled at the thought of evolving into Haxorus. &quot;And my trainer also told me when I get strong enough and he's got enough of these things called Heart Scales, he's gonna take me to a place where I'm gonna learn some really powerful attack that only dragons can learn!&quot;<br />
<br />
At that moment, however, Rune had arrived at where the Arbok was relaxing. She turned to look at the newcomers as Rune buzzed her greeting. &quot;Oh, hello,&quot; she greeted the Vibrava politely. &quot;Norbert, these are friends of yours, I take it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Nagini!&quot; the Axew cheerfully greeted the Arbok. &quot;Yeah, these are my friends! This is Rune, and this is Lumiere,&quot; he said, gesturing to the Vibrava and to the Litwick respectively. &quot;Rune, Lumiere, this is Nagini, my trainer's Arbok, I think she was the first Pokémon he caught since coming to this region.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is true,&quot; nodded the Arbok. &quot;A pleasure to meet the both of you,&quot; she added politely.</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: #944D94"><span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Nagini, Norbert, Lumiere, Rune:</u></b> Rune was just as polite to Nagini as she was to them, though the Litwick was more interested in the Arbok's strength. The Vibrava told Nagini to not mind him, explaining that his intentions were not yet in the right place. &quot;It's quite all right,&quot; Nagini replied. &quot;I do happen to be one of the stronger Pokémon on the team, true enough, along with my trainer's Weezing, Crobat, Vileplume, and Qwilfish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Nagini's real strong,&quot; Norbert whispered to Lumiere. &quot;You don't wanna annoy her, she's real scary when she's mad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rune continued talking to Nagini, requesting that she tell them about her adventures. &quot;Well, I have gone on lots of adventures with Keith, true,&quot; nodded Nagini. &quot;Of course, not all of his adventures included me- ours is a large team, and Keith wants to make sure he has time for all his Pokémon. That's somewhere around 40-ish Pokémon, by the way, so it can't be easy for him. But there were definitely some memorable moments. I'll never forget the day Keith caught me...<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px">&quot;Ekanssss!&quot; hissed the agitated snake. In spite of the perilous situation currently at hand, she seemed much more concerned with the battle at hand. They were in a trashed room in an underground laboratory, which Keith had just learned was going to self-destruct in about ten minutes.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't have much time!&quot; Keith exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Koff, Koffing!&quot; nodded the Koffing floating before him.<br />
<br />
Keith nodded back. &quot;OK, Koffing, <b>Tackle</b> attack once more!&quot; As Koffing flew forward, Keith plucked a Poké Ball off his belt and flung it forward. &quot;Tentacool, go!&quot; he shouted, as a light blue jellyfish emerged, three ruby-like protrusions showing on its head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tentacool!&quot; exclaimed the Water/Poison-type. Once Koffing had Tackled Ekans, he regarded the marine menace with apprehension- Tentacool was, to put it mildly, unpredictable. The little monster could go from sweet and docile to irrationally angry to downright homicidal with little to no provocation. Right now, thankfully, it seemed ready and willing to do battle.<br />
<br />
&quot;<b>Cut</b> attack right now!&quot; Keith ordered.<br />
<br />
Tentacool flopped forward, ready to slash at the Ekans with one of its tentacles, but at that moment, the Snake Pokémon lashed her coils around her aquatic adversary, <b>Wrap</b>ping him tight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tentacool!&quot; Keith exclaimed. &quot;Koffing, <b>Tackle</b>!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Koffing!!&quot; bellowed Koffing as it charged forward, only for Ekans to throw Tentacool at the oncoming Poison-type. Both Koffing and Tentacool crashed to the floor, and Keith knew that at this pace, they wouldn't have time to escape.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, it's up to you!&quot; said Keith as he threw yet another Poké Ball. &quot;I choose you, Venonat!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Veno nat veno nat veno nat veno nat!&quot; chattered the Bug/Poison-type, hopping up and down hyperactively. Keith couldn't help but grin, despite the grimness of the situation- with Venonat's incessantly hyperactive nature, ending this battle quickly was starting to look a hell of a lot more feasible now.<br />
<br />
&quot;<b>Disable</b> attack now!&quot; ordered Keith.<br />
<br />
&quot;Naaaat!&quot; squealed Venonat, her eyes glowing blue as a similarly colored aura came over Ekans- she couldn't use her Wrap anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Venonat! <b>Tackle</b> it!&quot; Keith exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Veno nat!&quot; said Venonat, the Insect Pokémon charging forward at high speeds, ramming into Ekans. At that moment, however, the room started to shake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, crap,&quot; Keith murmured, hastily calling Koffing and Tentacool back to their Poké Balls. &quot;It's happening!&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Ekans was evading Venonat's repeated Tackles with astonishing speed and nimbleness. And then, the snake lunged- not at Venonat, but at Keith, fangs bared! Acting almost on instinct, Keith turned his cowboy hat backwards, and threw the red and white sphere clutched in his increasingly sweaty right hand. &quot;Poké Ball, go!&quot; Keith shouted.<br />
<br />
Mercifully, Keith's aim was dead-on. The ball hit Ekans right in the head, opened up, and sucked in the snake. It landed on the currently quaking floor, and started to wobble back and forth... and then it pinged, signaling a successful catch. Under ordinary circumstances, Keith would have taken a moment to celebrate. However, given the fact that they were currently in a room that was about to explode, he reasoned that any celebration could wait. He therefore withdrew Venonat, scooped up the ball containing his new Ekans, and ran for it.</span>

</blockquote>&quot;...At first, it was strange, being out of that laboratory,&quot; Nagini was saying. &quot;But it didn't take me long to warm up to life under Keith's ownership. Right away I could tell he was a much better person than the people running that lab. Many of my kind were being kept in there, constantly being experimented on. To this day I'm thankful for Keith getting me out of there when he did- apparently it really did blow up, though if what I hear is correct, the other Ekans managed to make it out safely.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, hey, Nagini,&quot; said Norbert, &quot;What about when you evolved?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, yes,&quot; smiled the Arbok.<br />
<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px">It was a dark and stormy day. The sea was churning violently, rocking the ship violently. The 16-year-old trainer clad in a sopping wet cowboy hat, however, was stubbornly gripping the railing, refusing to be blown away, for two of his Pokémon were in the sea, fighting off a group of particularly violent Pokémon- a Slowking and a Gyarados, and as though those weren't bad enough, now there was a Cloyster joining in on the action.<br />
<br />
Ekans and Qwilfish had both resurfaced, the former of whom was on the lookout for the Slowking- when suddenly, the Water/Psychic-type made its presence quite clear by shooting a <b>Psybeam</b> attack, right at Qwilfish.<br />
<br />
&quot;Qwilfish, no!&quot; Keith exclaimed. &quot;Use <b>ThunderPunch</b> atta-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ekanssss!&quot; Ekans hissed, as she lunged forward, taking the super effective move in place of Qwilfish.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ekans! Ekans, are you alright?!&quot; Keith exclaimed as the Snake Pokémon lay limp on the surface of the water.<br />
<br />
&quot;Slowking slow,&quot; the Slowking chuckled with a smug smirk as it turned its attention to the Mantine and Corsola that had been brought out by several members of the ship's crew. And then, at that moment, the limp and seemingly lifeless Ekans started to glow! Keith's eyes widened in awe as her whole body lengthened and thickened, a wide hood growing just below her head, and when the glow faded...<br />
<br />
&quot;Chaaaaaboka!&quot; hissed the newly evolved Poison-type. Currently at a loss for words, Keith took out his Pokédex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arbok, the Cobra Pokémon, and the evolved form of Ekans,&quot; droned the device. &quot;Arbok's markings are said to vary from region to region. It uses these markings to intimidate its opponents, and to freeze its prey with fear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! We're not down just yet!&quot; Keith exclaimed. &quot;Arbok! <b>Screech</b> attack!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chaaaaaaaaaa!&quot; screeched Arbok, forcing the Slowking to cover its ears in discomfort.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arbok, now use your <b>Poison Sting</b>!&quot; grinned Keith. Arbok was only too happy to comply with this order, firing off a barrage of poisonous needles at the Royal Pokémon.</span>

</blockquote>&quot;...That was quite a battle,&quot; smiled Nagini. &quot;Those Pokémon were amazingly strong- oh, but where are my manners?&quot; she said suddenly. &quot;Rune, Lumiere, why don't you two tell us about yourselves?&quot;</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #FF0000"><b><u>Nagini, Norbert, Lumiere, Rune:</u></b> Rune was relieved that Nagini wasn't ticked off by Lumiere's rudeness, and she was quite impressed to hear that there were four other Pokemon on Norbert's team that are as strong as her. Norbert then proceeded to whisper a warning to Lumiere, to which he began to reconsider his actions before whispering back, &quot;Hm, alright. I'll go easy on her,&quot; in a lame attempt to seem tough.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, 40 Pokemon?! You guys could build an army out of that!&quot; Lumiere blurted out in child-like astonishment. Thoughts began running through his head, there's more to this team than what it seems, he figured. Rune saw the look on the Litwick's face, and gave a quick glare at him to tell him to stop thinking whatever he was thinking. Lumiere immediately staggered back, before recomposing himself; it seemed that Rune wouldn't let him get away with anything as long as she's around to keep tabs on him.<br />
<br />
Rune was very interested in the stories Nagini was telling. How it took 3 Pokemon to capture her from an underground laboratory that was about to explode, and how she evolved while protecting her teammate, a Qwilfish, from a Slowking's Thunderpunch on a stormy sea. &quot;Wow, you've been through a lot!&quot; the Vibrava buzzed in wonder. She was in absolute awe of the Arbok before her, a strong-willed Pokemon with the presence and demeanor of a goddess. She wanted to be just like her someday. Meanwhile, Lumiere was quite close to dozing off, though he paid enough attention to get the jist of the stories.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, neither of us have been through anything in comparison to that,&quot; Rune replied when Nagini asked them about themselves. &quot;I was originally hatched by a trainer named Hugo, who I stayed with for a brief time before being traded to another trainer, Hallow. I stayed with him for a small amount of time as well before finally being traded to Charm. He was the first trainer to ever really take me in and treat me like family, and I've been with him ever since. Everything seemed great, but I never felt like I ever really fit in with the rest of the team. Charm has been great and made me feel welcomed, and everyone else seemed to show me respect the stronger I got, but I haven't really forged any real friendships yet. I haven't been on any adventures or battled anyone either, despite being on the squad for quite some time, so I lack the experience that some of my teammates have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, boo hoo,&quot; Lumiere interrupts, &quot;I, on the other hand, was only born a few weeks ago.&quot;<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px">It was a dark, cloudy day as a young trainer clad in dark clothing walked through the seemingly murky forest towards the Egg House, his arms grasped around a pulsing Fire Core Egg. To top the picture off, a Murkrow casually flew overhead before perching himself on the trainer's shoulder. <br />
<br />
&quot;I feel something special in this one, <i>Monsieur</i> Charm,&quot; the Murkrow spoke, hints of a French accent whispering out of his English-spoken words.<br />
<br />
&quot;You think so?&quot; the trainer cheerily remarked, not looking the least bit gloomy as his attire would imply.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know so,&quot; Don answered, &quot;I can feel the Otherworldly powers trying to get into the egg. It is... <i>magnifique</i>.&quot; The Murkrow closes his eyes for a moment, taking in the air of his surroundings and enjoying every bit of it.<br />
<br />
Soon, they arrived at the Egg House, and handed the now shaking egg to the receptionist. &quot;I can't wait to see what's in this one!&quot; Charm's eyes glinted with hope. The reception laid the egg on top of the machine as Charm and Don watched intently for what's to come. The egg began to glow a bright red, similarly to how most Fire Core Eggs glow, but then it began to change to a different color. The scarlet red glow began to morph into an ominous purple, as the trainer's eyes widened in surprise while Don began to cackle with excitement. The now violet egg began to take the shape of a candle, and before long the glowing stopped. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lit-wiiiiick~!&quot; the newborn cried out in triumph.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hehehe, welcome!&quot; Don said, looking overly happy. &quot;... Yeah, welcome,&quot; Charm said, somewhat unsure of what he's actually seeing. &quot;He's a Litwick, a Ghost/Fire-type Pokemon,&quot; the receptionist told him. &quot;Oh, that's a cool typing! What should we call him?&quot; he asks, and at that moment, the Litwick's flame lit up brightly, casting his shadow throughout the Egg House. <br />
<br />
&quot;... <i>Lumiere</i>,&quot; Don says. <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It means light.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm, I like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, Lumiere, come along now,&quot; Charm said as they exitted the Egg House. They walked back through the murky forest as Don flew over to the Litwick, giving a quick inspection before whispering, &quot;I've heard that Ghost Pokemon are the unrested souls of other Pokemon... What were you in your past life?<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... I dunno,&quot; Lumiere responds in his Litwick language. The Murkrow sighed, &quot;It seems it's too soon...&quot;<br />
<br />
Charm turned back to ask, slightly wary. &quot;Too soon for what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, nothing.&quot;</span>

</blockquote>&quot;Don has been really nice to me, but the other team members don't seem to like him too much. I think he's great though,&quot; Lumiere grinned. &quot;Don't get to close to him now, Lumie. He can be a troublemaker,&quot; Rune chastised. &quot;Yeah, yeah. Besides that, what do you guys do for fun around here?&quot; Lumiere yawned, becoming increasingly bored.</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: #944D94"><span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Nagini, Norbert, Lumiere, Rune:</u></b> Norbert couldn't help but giggle a little as Lumiere stated that he would go easy on Nagini, but otherwise didn't reply to it. At that moment, the Litwick then exclaimed in astonishment at the sheer number of teammates Norbert and Nagini had. &quot;Yes, it's quite a lot,&quot; Nagini nodded. &quot;Most of us are Poison-types, it's what Keith specializes in, though obviously he's made exceptions,&quot; she said, with a glance at Norbert as she spoke. &quot;Keith actually relies on his older and more responsible Pokémon to help out with the younger and more unruly Pokémon, like Pepperspray- he's a Koffing, he means well, but he's just so hyperactive it's hard to keep him in line. There's also Pisces, a Blue-Striped Basculin- she's a predator, and she doesn't care whether her potential prey has a trainer or not. And then there's Stewie,&quot; she said. &quot;He's a Ledian, and a Shadow Pokémon. As you can imagine, he's not easy to handle. Ginny's really the only one who can really keep Stewie under control. Ginny- she's Keith's Pawniard,&quot; she explained. &quot;She- Norbert, what is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
For at that moment, it was clear that Norbert's attention was elsewhere, his eyes were narrowed slightly as they followed a wild Raticate darting around in the distance. Once he realized Nagini had addressed him, however, he quickly turned to face her. &quot;Oh, oh, sorry, Nagini,&quot; he apologized. &quot;Didn't mean to... just kinda...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it's OK, I'm guessing you're hungry?&quot; the Arbok smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;A little, but I know how you don't like to hunt,&quot; the Axew murmured.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but it wouldn't be fair of me to stop you if it's what you like to do,&quot; replied Nagini. &quot;Go on, go for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; grinned Norbert. &quot;Excuse me a minute,&quot; he added to Rune and Lumiere. He then darted off, pausing only to <b>Hone</b> his <b>Claws</b> against a nearby rock. With incredible stealth, the Axew sneaked his way over until he was directly behind the Raticate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Personally, I don't like to hunt,&quot; Nagini explained to Rune and Lumiere. &quot;I know other Arbok do, but I prefer to not kill unless it's absolutely necessary, and I mean absolutely necessary. Of course, there are some of my teammates that don't share this view, and... well, watch Norbert. I think you'll be surprised.&quot;<br />
<br />
At that moment, the Axew's eyes, which normally gave off a friendly look, now blazed with a frightening fury. Norbert pounced, roaring and shrieking with pure <b>Outrage</b>. &quot;DIE!&quot; he bellowed as he hacked and slashed at the Raticate's neck with his tusks before the Normal-type could even begin to react. &quot;DIE! DIE! DIE!&quot; shouted Norbert, punctuating each &quot;DIE!&quot; with another swipe of his tusks, and soon he started swiping with his sharpened claws as well. Finally, the badly slashed-up, horribly bleeding, and clearly terrified Raticate tried to crawl away from Norbert, but the Axew put a stop to it by stomping on its tail. &quot;And just where do you think you're going?&quot; hissed the Axew, speaking in a sadistic tone that clearly wasn't usual for him. &quot;We're not finished here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;P-p-please...&quot; stammered the Raticate, his voice full of fear. &quot;P-please... Let me go... I'll do anything...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you'll do anything?&quot; repeated the Axew. &quot;No, no, see, that's gonna be a problem, because the only thing I want here is my dinner. And guess what? That's you!&quot; Right after saying this, Norbert made a sudden movement and chomped the Raticate's tail right off, causing the Mouse Pokémon to shriek in agony. Norbert slurped the tail down like a strand of spaghetti, sighed in content, and then resumed his assault. And then, not long after, the Raticate's screams and struggles stopped, at which point the Axew started to devour the corpse. In mere minutes, all that remained of the Raticate were a small pile of blood-soaked bones. Once he was done eating, Norbert started wobbling his way back over to the group. It didn't take him long to shake off the confusion which was a usual after-effect of Outrage, and once he got back, he looked like his usual cheerful self, albeit with blood caked around his mouth, tusks, and claws.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enjoy your meal?&quot; asked Nagini.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it was delicious,&quot; smiled the Axew. &quot;What did I miss?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing,&quot; replied Nagini. &quot;Now, as to Lumiere's question-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah- what to do for fun around here!&quot; nodded Norbert. &quot;Well, I hear there are lots of underground caverns around here, we could go explore those,&quot; he suggested. &quot;And it won't even be a problem that it's dark if you come with us, Lumiere!&quot; he added. &quot;What do you say?&quot;</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #FF0000"><b><u>Nagini, Norbert, Lumiere, Rune:</u></b> Norbert was beginning to doze off, his hunger getting the best of him as the stories went on. Excusing himself, he went after a nearby Raticate- ripping it to pieces and chowing down every last bit of him until all that remained of the Raticate was the skeleton. Lumiere looked quite intrigued and couldn't help but smile the whole way through as he watched his first glimpse of a predator eating his meal. Rune on the other hand wasn't quite as comfortable, &quot;... Wow,&quot; was all she could say. She never would've thought Norbert would have such a sadistic side to him. <br />
<br />
By the time the Axew came back from his meal, grinning tusk to tusk as the Raticate's blood decorates his mouth, claws, and tusks- Lumiere nudged over to him with a smile, &quot;Hehe, didn't know you had it in you.&quot; Meanwhile Rune adjusted herself to the now fed Axew. &quot;Uh... wouldn't the Raticate's friends be upset that their friend was eaten alive?... I hope they don't end up coming after us...&quot; she said with several pauses, still adapting to what occurred, while trying to make logic out of the situation.<br />
<br />
Norbert went on to suggest that they check out the underground caverns, and that having Lumiere around would give them an ample amount of light to properly explore. &quot;Yeah... sure,&quot; Lumiere buzzed. &quot;Finally, something to do!&quot; Lumiere innocently cheered.<br />
<br />
Then they were off. Rune hovered a few feet above the group as they approached the nearest cave entry. &quot;Alright, Lumie, we'll need your light,&quot; she said. &quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; tip of Lumiere's head bulbing a small purple flame.<br />
<br />
Rune descended back to the ground as they entered, maintaining a safe distance from Norbert and avoiding eye contact whenever possible. &quot;Remember to stay close, Lumie. We'll need your light,&quot; she reminded the Litwick. To which he doesn't bother to respond, and simply takes the lead while providing his light.<br />
<br />
They continued travelling deeper and deeper into the cavern, the light from the entrance nearly gone at this point as they heard the sounds of the residential wild Pokemon. Zubats, Sandshrew, Paras, and several other creatures all made their homes here. &quot;Do any of you know what we'll find at the deepest reaches of this place?&quot; the Vibrava asked, trying to lighten the mood.<br />
<br />
They've reached quite far into the caverns at this point, reaching an intersection between several other cave pathways as all light from the outside world was now gone. &quot;Hmm, which one should we take?&quot; the Vibrava asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kukuku~ You mean- how the hell do you get through here?&quot; he grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, what?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You heard me. So long, losers! Kukuku~&quot; he laughs, burning out his head light, leaving the place pitch black before running off to a random tunnel.<br />
<br />
&quot;LUMIE, NO!&quot; Rune cried out- but it was too late. He has deserted them.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have to find him! He doesn't know what he's doing!&quot; the Vibrava was breathing heavily at this point, panicking as she tried to make sense of the situation. &quot;My trainer is not going to like this...&quot; she gulped.</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: #944D94"><span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Nagini, Norbert, Six, Lumiere, Rune:</u></b> The Litwick and Vibrava had very different reactions to Norbert's decidedly gory mealtime spectacle- Lumiere was impressed, while Rune seemed rather unnerved. As Norbert returned and the Litwick commented that he didn't know he had it in him, the Axew giggled. &quot;You sound like Pisces,&quot; he replied. &quot;My trainer's Blue-Striped Basculin- she was impressed too the first time she saw me hunt. And Marvolo- my trainer's Seviper, he says I'm a natural.&quot; Rune, on the other hand, showed concern for what would happen when the Raticate's friends found out what happened. &quot;Well, there didn't seem to be any witnesses aside from you guys,&quot; the Axew replied. &quot;I doubt any of that's Raticate's friends saw anything. And even if they did, Nagini's more than a match for any Raticate.&quot; The Arbok smiled modestly in response to this, but did not contradict Norbert.<br />
<br />
The suggestion that they explore the underground caverns was well received all around, and so they were off. However, as they went, Norbert couldn't help but notice that Rune was keeping her distance from him and avoiding eye contact. This puzzled the Axew, and saddened him somewhat, as he recalled how happy the Vibrava was to see him again when they had first met up above ground. &quot;Rune?&quot; Norbert said. &quot;Is everything OK?&quot; He sounded concerned for the Vibrava, and indeed, he was- somehow, he didn't seem to register the notion that his devouring that Raticate may have had something to do with it. But before the Vibrava could answer, Lumiere took that opportunity to abandon them, extinguishing his light, leaving them in pure darkness. And Rune proceeded to freak out. Nagini scowled at the Litwick's betrayal, but she knew that right now, taking charge of the situation was the main thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's OK, Rune,&quot; Norbert said to the Vibrava. &quot;We'll find Lumie, and we'll get out of here safely. Nagini, we need to get some light in here... um... Oh! Oh, right! Nagini, start up a <b>Fire Fang</b>!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent idea,&quot; replied the Arbok as she opened her mouth, and allowed her <b>Fang</b>s to catch <b>Fire</b>, illuminating the trio. But before anyone could even start to think about where to go next, a small crying sound could be heard from down one of the tunnels.<br />
<br />
&quot;M-m-mommy?&quot; the voice was sniveling. &quot;D-d-daddy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; Norbert said. &quot;I know that voice. Six?&quot; he called.<br />
<br />
The sniveling subsided somewhat. &quot;Norbert?&quot; the voice squeaked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it's me!&quot; smiled the Axew. &quot;Are you OK?&quot;<br />
<br />
At that moment, what appeared to be a sentient Poké Ball rolled into range of the light from Nagini's Fire Fang, and then unfurled itself, revealing itself to be a Foongus who looked on the verge of tears again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I c-can't find them,&quot; Six whimpered. &quot;I d-didn't even realize I had r-rolled into the t-tunnels...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's OK, Six, we'll find your parents,&quot; Norbert said soothingly as he hugged the Foongus. Six seemed to calm down somewhat, and Norbert turned to face Rune. &quot;Oh, yeah,&quot; he added. &quot;Rune, this is Six, one of my teammates. Six, this is my friend and former teammate, Rune.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... H-hi,&quot; Six squeaked timidly. &quot;Um... C-can I go with you guys? I don't... I don't know how to get out of here...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure!&quot; replied Norbert. &quot;Say, Six, did you happen to pass any other Pokémon in that tunnel?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, n-no, I didn't hear any,&quot; the Foongus replied. &quot;Wh-why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're looking for one of Rune's teammates, a Litwick,&quot; explained the Axew. &quot;I guess he didn't go that way, then. So, which way should we try first, do you think?&quot; he asked Rune.</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: MediumTurquoise"><u><i>Meanwhile, at the surface...</i></u><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px">Any Pokémon around the western border of the Tree Grove would have felt a strange rumbling sensation pass them by. Though not enough to startle them, it did bring some interest before it faded away, the various Patrat and Zigzagoon forgetting about it as soon as it was out of earshot. The sound continued on, and as it came into view of the Mother Tree it manifested itself as a pile of earth and rubble bursting upward from under the grass, leaving a trail across the otherwise-featureless field until it suddenly stopped. Voices could be heard, slowly but surely rising in pitch until eventually the top of the tunnel burst open. A ruby-red exoskeleton became visible, its owner hoisting herself out of the earth until her antennae and piercing yellow eyes were exposed. Looking around, she took in the sight of the huge tree not too far away before scuttling out of the burrow. &quot;I <i>told</i> you we were going the wrong way! We're nowhere near Astoria!&quot; she screeched.<br />
<br />
Another pile of earth burst upward, this one revealing a huge pair of orange jaws. Another arthropod uncovered himself, looking around. &quot;Huh, how about that.&quot; he replied, trying to remember the map he'd look at before the party had taken leave of their trainer. &quot;I was sure it was East... and then South a bit... and then East again to Astoria.&quot; the Trapinch muttered, sounding increasingly sheepish as he went on. The first creature scuttled her way around to him, staring daggers.<br />
<br />
&quot;So we're lost. Is that it? Your excellent sense of direction strikes again.&quot; the Venipede accused, sounding more livid by the second. Rincewind backed off, eyeing drops of venom starting to ooze from the spikes covering the Bug-type's body.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-hey! Calm down, Conina! I told you, when I'm travelling I don't care where I'm going <i>to</i>! The key word is <i>from</i>!&quot; the Ant Pit Pokémon replied, his stubby legs carrying him backward from the furious centipede. Just as Conina was preparing to deliver a poisonous bite, another Pokémon leapt from the tunnel, placing himself between them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, knock it off!&quot; the purple rodent admonished, causing the female creepy-crawly to stand down. &quot;So we got lost, big whoop. We still seem to have ended up in a nice area. This actually looks better than Astoria - there's not even any humans about!&quot; the Rattata explained. Darktan was a new addition to the family, but was wise beyond his years and was a good mediator in the inevitable bust-ups that would erupt between certain team members. Behind him, more Pokémon emerged from the tunnel, a small white fish floating through the air while followed by a red plant carried by twirling leaves, and at the front of the pile of soil the eyes and nose of a crocodilian broke the surface. &quot;Come on Conina, Rincewind and Rhys were steering blind, you know that. We can still have fun here.&quot; Darktan concluded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose you're right... but I'm still not going to hang around that loser the whole time I'm here!&quot; the Venipede conceded, turning and scuttling toward the huge Mother Tree, curling up into her Rollout attack in order to pick up speed.<br />
<br />
The Normal-type sighed, turning to the others. &quot;I'll follow her and make sure she doesn't do anything stupid. Take care, you lot.&quot; And with a flourish of his tail he was away, following the rolling Bug-type. The others looked to each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;What now?&quot; clicked Rincewind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Gytha and I thought we might look around the grove and see what's what.&quot; the Tynamo squeaked while the Hoppip nodded along. Mustrum was a bit sad that most of his fishy friends hadn't been able to come with him on this trip, but he was the only one aside from Sybil who was able to move outside of water and attempts to use electromagnetism to levitate their PokéBalls had met with little success.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good, have fun with that.&quot; Rincewind replied, and the two floating Pokémon headed toward some nearby foliage. &quot;What about us then?&quot; he addressed his fellow Ground-type.<br />
<br />
Rhys shifted. He preferred to stay underground whenever possible. &quot;I think I can sense some caves and tunnels under the huge tree. We could always check those out?&quot; he suggested.<br />
<br />
Rincewind clicked in apprehension. He was a Ground-type but confined spaces weren't really his bag. Still, if the Sandile was going to be with him, he could probably stomach it. &quot;Alright then, lead on.&quot; he replied. Instantly, the submerged reptile dived into the ground, forming another tunnel toward the Mother Tree's crypts. Sighing, Rincewind jumped in after him, following the Dark-type along the newly-formed tunnel to see what they could find.</span></span></div>

To be more specific, a very, very large, grey something- a dark grey Scolipede, its entire body the kind of grey one would expect to see on a Shiny Charizard, yet its eyes were blood-red. As he was walking by, the Venipede rolled right into his leg. Due to the sheer difference in both size and level, this didn't actually hurt very much, though it did catch the Scolipede's attention, and he stopped to address the Bug/Poison-type, as well as the Rattata that was catching up to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sorry,&quot; he remarked. &quot;Didn't see you there. My name's Salazar, who might you two be?&quot;</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #FF0000"><b><u>Nagini, Norbert, Six, Rune, Rincewood, Rhys:</u></b> Rune was on the verge of tears as Norbert tried to calm her down, telling her it would be okay and that they would find Lumiere soon. Soon he told Nagini to illuminate the cave with a Fire Fang, and the Arbok did just so, opening her mouth as flames licked across her fangs- lighting the cavern up as everyone had their sight back.<br />
<br />
Rune took in a deep breath until a voice whimpered out not too far in the distance. The voice happened to belong to a Foongus called Six- one of Norbert's teammates who is looking for his parents. The Vibrava did what she could to keep it together, &quot;Hello, Six... Nice to meet you!&quot; she buzzes, trying to remain as cheerful as she can in front of the young Pokemon.<br />
<br />
Norbert asked the Foongus if he saw any Pokemon go through the tunnel he came from, to which he responds with a no. The Axew then asked Rune which course they should take, and she began to think until she heard another noise coming from the distance. She looks over and sees the vague shapings of a Trapinch and Sandile. &quot;Hey, you two!&quot; she calls out, scurrying over to the duo, &quot;Have you seen any Litwick go in that direction?&quot; her eyes glimmering with hope.</span></span></div>
