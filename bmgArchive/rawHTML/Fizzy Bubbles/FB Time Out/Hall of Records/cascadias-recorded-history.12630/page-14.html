You begin to panic as the ship sinks lower and lower into the sea. You scream out panicked orders to your Pokémon. Torchlight throws up a <b>Smokescreen</b> to hide Volante and himself. Volante flies forward and slams herself into the large sea monster in a <b>tackle</b>. Aipom jumps from the smoke and <b>scratch</b>es the Gyrados across the face. The blue sea snake <b>thrash</b>es again, this time through the smoke and hits Volante slamming to the deck in a K.O.! With your Pidgey unconscious, you desperately search for something you could cling onto should the boat sink now. The water begins to flood over the deck. Your ankles are suddenly wet with seawater. You still frantically search for anything to cling onto but the ship has no life boats and any kind of driftwood wouldn’t be able to support you. Torchlight, seeing that you’re currently vulnerable, creates another <b>smokescreen</b> to hide you. The Gyrados seeing that you are no longer fighting returns to its snack and chomps down another sailor. The water has completely filled the boat and plunges under the water. You struggle to keep yourself above the water but soon you can’t stay afloat any longer. Your head goes beneath the surface of the sea. You begin to choke on the water as it goes into your lungs soon everything goes black. <br />
<br />
You awaken from your dream to find yourself back at Oneiro Ruins. That was some kind of dream, but you look around to see that Torchlight stands beside you, Volante lies limp on the ground next to you, the Aipom still on your shoulder, and the Gyrados is rampaging towards a small village in the woods! Instinctively, you grab Volante and race through the woods towards the village. The Gyrados smashes through several huts in the village. As you get there, an elderly man with a staff yells at you, “You! You have brought this upon us all! I shall curse you by causing you to be bad luck to yourself and everyone around you!,” he waves his staff around wildly before stopping aghast, “It seems someone has beat me to the punch! You already have a curse placed on you! Well, now it is your responsibility to defeat this Gyrados. To help you I will give your Pokémon a boost,” the man says as he begins to chant in an unfamiliar language and wave his staff around wildly. Torchlight, Volante, and Aipom begin to glow and grow in size. The three have temporarily evolved and are completely rejuvenated! The man points his stick at the Gyrados, “Now go defeat that sea monster!”<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"><br />
<br />
<i>Note: Volante and Torchlight have temporarily evolved to Pidgeotto and Quilava respectively in Cascadia <b>only</b>. They can use all the attacks known by a Level 18 Pokémon of their species. In any other zone or shop, they are still the same Level 4 Pidgey and Level 6 Cyndaquil. You can also command the Ambipom with all of the attacks as a Level 18 Ampipom would.</i></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: darkorange"><span style="font-size: 9px">So she was bad luck all along. The girl was depressed to hear it this bluntly from an old man. She now knew one aspect of her past for sure. But why was she cursed? And by who? However, the girl now had to focus on the good side. She was not dead. That was always a good sign. She was better equipped to handle a ferocious man-eating beast. That's a good thing, right? And this elderly person could supposedly do no further harm than had already been done. After realizing the good side, the girl was adequately pumped. Thinking a bit too highly of herself, she belted out a mighty &quot;HEY, UGLY!!! YOU WANNA SHOW?&quot; After her brief bout of fish antagonizing, she turned her focus to her buddies. Okay, Torchlight, two Quick Attacks and a Smokescreen. Volante, Gust and a Sand Attack followed by a Quick attack. Ambipom, Tickle the sucker and deal it 2 rounds of Fury Swipes. Let's GO TO TOWN ON THAT... THING!&quot;</span></span></div>

Ordial Shrine; Arc_Angel – Opting for the Espiritu River to avoid the soldiers, Ranjona led Stacey through a much smaller path branching away from the cave's path, descending into a thicket of vines and tropical plants. They could hear the clamor in the background as more soldiers discovered their fallen comrades and began to recuperate and reorganize. Soon, it died away, however, as they sunk deeper into the jungle. Not long after, it was replaced by the sound of a rushing river, as they soon came to the banks of the mighty Espiritu.<br />
<br />
Stacey immediately noticed the sparkling waters dancing in the setting sun as they rushed over a maze of rocks and fallen trees, but she did not have long to admire the beauty of the river as Ranjona reiterated the expediency of their mission, “We must be going. I believe the soldiers are distracted for now, but I fear that we may come upon a fiendish foe soon enough.”<br />
<br />
Walking at a bit of a slower pace now, the two began north, heading away from the cave and destroyed village. Wanta floated lazily beside them, giving the occasional sigh to maintain his altitude. Their walk went uninterrupted for a good twenty minutes, allowing Stacey a moment to catch her breath. After a while, however, Ranjona became somewhat uneasy, though Stacey could not tell why. Afraid that she may be aware of something on the horizon, Stacey inquired as to the girl's nervousness.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I'm just becoming a bit anxious about this whole thing.” Ranjona replies, now much calmer around the quiet river, “I am so afraid of these terrible soldiers, and I have tried to be strong. I really do admire your strength, Stacey. I feel as if you truly are a strong-willed person.”<br />
<br />
Stacey accepted the comments gratefully, and attempted to give Ranjona some encouragement.<br />
<br />
“Thank you for such kind words, Stacey. I don't think I could do this without you.” Ranjona said, smiling slightly.<br />
<br />
The two of them walked down the riverbank for a moment, continuing their trek towards the city, eventually reaching another pool similar to the one at the cave's entrance. Another beautiful waterfall cascaded down slowly receding slope, flowing gracefully over the rock face in a mesmerizing amber-colored curtain.<br />
<br />
“This is one of my favorite spots in the forest, the Ambersap Cascades.” Ranjona commented, “We're here at the perfect time too; they get their name from how the sun hits them as it sets. It looks like liquid amber, does it not?”<br />
<br />
Stacey nods, awestruck by the gorgeous water. Suddenly, however, her tranquility was shattered as the water in the river at the ends of the falls began to stir. Both girls turned towards the pool, watching the water as the ripples began to grow. Stacey could see a look of apprehension grow on Ranjona's face as pulses began to run through the ground.<br />
<br />
All of the sudden, a flare of water erupted from the pool, spraying Stacey and Ranjona with a sheet of shimmering drops. From the water rose a twisting, snake -like monster, resembling a sea dragon and form and a fish in features. Angrily, the Gyarados gave a powerful roar, shaking the ground once again.<br />
<br />
“Wanta, hold back!” Ranjona ordered as the balloon Pokemon floated upwards out of the sea monster's range.<br />
<br />
Ranjona bent down, taking her necklace from her neck once again, and placed it into the water. A soft pulse of white light traveled through the crystallite liquid, and from the depths came a spiral-shaped spiked-shelled creature, who rose to the surface, revealing a soft blue body with a multitude of short tentacles and a beak-like mouth.<br />
<br />
“Spari, please assist us fight this monster!” Ranjona bequeathed, receiving a short nod from the Omastar.<br />
<br />
“Launch many stones at him, then barrage him with spikes!” she ordered.<br />
<br />
What will you do?<br />

The Silver Forest; Pearl's Perap - Actually, the events of other zones are considered to be unrelated, so you don't have to use any Potions.<br />
<br />
Sending out his two Pokemon to face down the nasty bugs, Zak issues a round of simple orders to begin with. Both Pokemon nod in recognition before taking battle poses. In response, the Scyther look angrily at the two Pokemon, moving away from the cowering Wurmple. Before the bugs notice, Zak slips around back and picks up the Wurmple, giving it consoling words to try to calm it down.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the battle begins. Both Scyther begin to circle around their respective foes, taking a duel approach to the battle. Before either can get an attack off, however, Luxio begins to <b>Charge</b> electrical energy within his body, hoping to increase the potency of his electrical attacks. Just as he finishes, however the two Scyther perform duel <b>Quick Attacks</b>, knocking both Pokemon into each other and stunning them just long enough for another attack. The two mantises raise scythes in an attempt to <b>Slash</b> their foes, but quickly get a face full of <b>Flamethrower</b> from Slowking and a <b>Thunderbolt</b> from the charged Luxio. With his first foe off his back, Slowking whips around, still spewing flames, and manages to lick the other Scyther with his fiery whip. Once the flames die, both Scyther look quite miffed. It seems that now that you've started the battle, you have no choice but to finish it.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span><br />

<span style="color: Yellow"><div style="text-align: center"><u><b>~Ion Island~</b></u>&#8203;</div><br />
Eletron Plant; Tyranidos – Seeing this as a good opportunity for some exploration and to find a new friend, Tyrant eagerly asks as to where the offending Magnemite reside.<br />
<br />
“Ah, yes, they tend to be concentrated around the main generator, but you'll probably be best off starting around the smaller ones first. Be careful, though,” he warned,”there may be some Magneton as well, and we've even have had a report of a Magnezone! They're very powerful Pokemon, especially when allowed to feed of this energy so freely!”<br />
<br />
Thanking him for his advice, Tyrant and his Combusken set off towards the main generator. Though it didn't exactly surprise him, Tyrant soon noticed how extensive the plant was after having to trek through hall after hall just to reach the first set of minor generators. Once they arrived, however, they came upon their target within seconds; a group of tiny Magnemite floated about a moderate-sized generator, causing it to fizzle and whir violently as the magnetic Pokemon interrupted the flow of power.<br />

The Silver Forest; Pearl's Perap - Actually, the events of other zones are considered to be unrelated, so you don't have to use any Potions.<br />
<br />
Sending out his two Pokemon to face down the nasty bugs, Zak issues a round of simple orders to begin with. Both Pokemon nod in recognition before taking battle poses. In response, the Scyther look angrily at the two Pokemon, moving away from the cowering Wurmple. Before the bugs notice, Zak slips around back and picks up the Wurmple, giving it consoling words to try to calm it down.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the battle begins. Both Scyther begin to circle around their respective foes, taking a duel approach to the battle. Before either can get an attack off, however, Luxio begins to <b>Charge</b> electrical energy within his body, hoping to increase the potency of his electrical attacks. Just as he finishes, however the two Scyther perform duel <b>Quick Attacks</b>, knocking both Pokemon into each other and stunning them just long enough for another attack. The two mantises raise scythes in an attempt to <b>Slash</b> their foes, but quickly get a face full of <b>Flamethrower</b> from Slowking and a <b>Thunderbolt</b> from the charged Luxio. With his first foe off his back, Slowking whips around, still spewing flames, and manages to lick the other Scyther with his fiery whip. Once the flames die, both Scyther look quite miffed. It seems that now that you've started the battle, you have no choice but to finish it.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span>

</blockquote>[Ah, thanks for letting me know, Jeri ;D My Slowking is now lvl 9 from various Christmas gifts, just thought i'd let you know]<br />
<br />
<span style="color: green">As the battle began to unfold in Zak's favour, he took the opportunity to check the Wurmple was alright. It seemed to be okay, but he couldn't be too sure, so he kept it his arms until he could give it a proper check over once the threat at hand had been taken care of.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good first move, you pair!&quot; Zak called out to the Luxio and Slowking who were awaiting their next orders before attacking the Scyther duo once more, &quot;Alright then, Slowking use <b>ice beam</b> and try to hit both of them, if it works we could have them frozen. As for you, Luxio, let's try another <b>charge</b> followed by <b>thunderbolt</b> combination again!&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking at the two battlers and the tiny bug pokémon in his arms, Zak smiled to himself, not only was he confident about his two battlers but he was sure that the Wurmple would be fine too. Though, to be completely sure, he had to try and end this battle as soon as he could, he knew that Scythers could be tricky pokémon, since they were fast and powerful, he simply had to wait and see.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can do it!&quot; he threw in as a morale boost for the royal and spark pokémon, knowing that the more he encouraged them, the more confident and friendly they would eventually become.</span></div>

<i>I, myself, have also had a four on four battle, but I did read in the Serebii FAQ that you’re only allowed to use two Pokémon in battle. Perhaps it’s the updator’s discretion. Anyways I don’t mind if you use four Pokémon in battle but that means less levels will be earned by each of them. Also if you use four could you please only use two attacks per Pokémon. Speaking of levels, I forgot last update that Freeze should have gained a level so <b>Level up for Freeze!</b>.</i><span style="color: red"><br />
<br />
You pull Freeze back from the battle and put Thunderfuzz in instead. Freeze doesn’t look too happy about having to stay back from the battle. He grudgingly falls back while Thunderfuzz steps forward. The Magbies help you out by powering up your Pokémon with their <b>Helping Hand</b>. Slice forms a <b>Shadow Ball</b> and fires it at the sole remaining Sableye. Right before it collides with the ghost, Thunderfuzz creates a burst of flames and fires it at the Shadow Ball. The <b>Flamethrower</b> hit the ball of ghost energy and causes an explosion of energy which sends the Sableye flying into the wall, knocking it out. As this happens, the second wave rushes forward to attack your Pokémon. Slice remembers his orders and fires a blast of <b>razor</b>-sharp <b>wind</b> at all five of the Sableyes. The attack causes all of the Sableyes to be cut up and ooze a black blood-like substance. Thunderfuzz catches the Mug of Fiery Fizzybrew Beer and takes a swig of it. Before anything happens, a Sableye <b>thief</b> runs forward and grabs the Pachirisu’s alcohol. It sniffs it and is utterly repulsed by the smell. It drops it and the bottle rolls around leaving a trail of alcohol. Thunderfuzz then belches a super powerful <b>flamethrower</b> that ignites the spilled beer. The burst of flames burns up two of the Sableye knocking them out. <br />
<br />
A large crash announces the presence of another Pokémon into the battle. A Magmortar has appeared on the scene! The Magmortar takes a look at the Magbies and starts to rush towards them. The third wave runs towards the fire Pokémon and attacks her. The Magbies look excited as they see their mother here to save them. They run forward and both use <b>ember</b> on a single nearby Sableye. The fourth wave seems to be antsy and runs forward to assist the second wave in attacking you. Slice rubs his wings together quickly to create a loud noise. The <b>Bug Buzz</b> visibly causes stress to the Sableyes’ ears. Thunderfuzz then grabs a Sableye and releases a large <b>Spark</b>, paralyzing the Sableye and dealing a good amount of damage to it. The Magbies both attack again. One <b>Fire Punch</b>es a Sableye while the other uses <b>Flare Blitz</b> to knock it out! A Sableye uses <b>Shadow Sneak</b> to go through the shadows and hit Slice. A second fires a bolt of <b>Nightshade</b> at Thunderfuzz and hits her! Another tries to fire a bolt of <b>Night Shade</b> but it accidentally hits a Sableye instead! <br />
<br />
Seven Sableyes are currently attacking you, but one is paralyzed. Five of these have three fourths of their health remaining. One has half of its health gone. The paralyzed one only has a third of its health left. Thunderfuzz has recovered completely while she was resting. Now she has lost an eighth of her energy and a minor amount of health. Slice has used about an eighth of his health and a fourth of his energy. <br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">Sorry It took so long, my pokes were in the training center.<br />
</span><span style="font-size: 9px"><br />
Here- 3-on-30-ish, You know the SPP rules can't be edited because of the forum Glitch, right?</span>:spin:<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Red">The <span style="font-family: 'Verdana'">batt</span>le took a turn from difficult to chaotic in a span of about two and a half seconds. The attacks from his pokemon hitting the Sableye, sending it flying, a trail of flames begining from some spilled alcohol and a giant flaming pokemon breaking through the ranks and defending her babies. The third wave had separated from the group and began attacking the fire pokemon all at once. This lightened the burdain on Tyson's pokemon and they took action. Slice singlehandedly damaged every single Sableye in the second wave, automatically being joined by the fourth wave. With Seven pokemon attacking his two and a third of his pokemon waiting in the back Tyson began to think of possible ways to take advantage of the situation. Then it happened...<br />
<br />
Slice's arms fell off of their sockets! Tyson almost went into shock before he saw the rest. His legs molded together, causing his three toes to become one, getting slimer in the process. Out of the empty arm sockets grew out a new set, which started out as long sticks that seemed to end in a sphere, which opened to reveal a serrated edge, pinsirs. Slice's wings became rounder too, but also shrunk. Then his head became more round, his snout disappearing and the spikes on his head sharpening. Something seemed to be happening to his skin that Tyson couldn't understand, all his extremities becoming more <i>polished</i>. He Levitated a bit, and then landed on his feet. &quot;Scizor!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyson was too overwelmed by the event so he brought out his pokedex. Quickly aiming the beam at Slice. The robotic voice came out with a reply: &quot;Scizor. The Pinser pokemon.Type: Bug/Steel. When a Scyther is traded with a Metal coat a chemical change occurs in Scyther's body making it stronger and more adapted for killing. Sometimes the effect can be delayed but evolution will always happen, especially in times of deep stress.&quot; So that's how it went down, a few weeks prior Tyson had helped a friend by trading Slice to him for a match, then received him through a trade again soon after. Where Slice received the metal coat was a mystery however.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well now that you have evolved we can kick it up a notch!&quot; The perfect plan spilled into Tyson's head, it just needed some forewarning. &quot;Freeze come back in, time to kick it!&quot; Freeze ran forward again itching to go. &quot;Let's hit it off with you, Freeze. I want you to use <b>Blizzard</b> on them. Don't cool it too much, I need it to melt into water, on top of every single one.&quot; He looked over at Thunderfuzz, signal she was next. &quot;Then you will follow that up with <b>Spark</b>.&quot; It clicked that second: Water conducted electricity, and electricity was damaging. &quot;Then Slice you use a <b>Razor Wind</b> to bring harm into them! Were not done yet though, in fact we're only beggining!&quot; There was one snag in the next part of the plan, but Tyson easily found the solution: &quot;Alright. Hey! Ms. Magmortar I'm going to need to ask that you jump when you hear Slice throw himself, Alright?&quot; Magmortar probably didn't know what would happen next, but it was a good idea to warn her. &quot;Alright, Freeze Charge up your <b>Hyper Beam</b>, it may take some time so I want you...&quot; Tyson said to Thunderfuzz &quot;... to defend him with a <b>Flamethrower</b> until he's done, Kapeesh?&quot; She nodded. &quot;This seems like a strange idea but,&quot; Tyson said to Slice &quot; since you are a steel type now you should be heavy enough to make a <b>quake</b> in this <b>Earth</b> with that secret move I taught you (<a href="http://bmgf.bulbagarden.net/showpost.php?p=689518&amp;postcount=26" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fbmgf.bulbagarden.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D689518%26postcount%3D26&amp;hash=9c1768fbbd7a42edad4580fdd41e174e" rel="nofollow noopener"><b>Earthquake/Hyper Beam</b></a>).&quot; Then he looked back at the Magbies: &quot;Hey Mabs! Could you guys please use Helping hand again? Greatly appreciated. Also jump when your mommy does. Thanks!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyson was trying to hide it but the stress of the battle was getting to him. Why are these Sableye attacking us? Why the Magbies? Why so many? There were too many questions for him and there was only one pokemon that could answer him. &quot;Who is your Leader!!! <b>I</b> want to fight you, Fist to Fist!&quot; Tyson yelled to the group of Sableye, waiting for an answer. &quot;SHOW YOURSELF!!&quot; Tyson yelled at the world, he wanted it to end. &quot;Freeze, Slice, Thunderfuzz, GO!&quot;</span></span></div>

Ordial Shrine; Arc_Angel – Opting for the Espiritu River to avoid the soldiers, Ranjona led Stacey through a much smaller path branching away from the cave's path, descending into a thicket of vines and tropical plants. They could hear the clamor in the background as more soldiers discovered their fallen comrades and began to recuperate and reorganize. Soon, it died away, however, as they sunk deeper into the jungle. Not long after, it was replaced by the sound of a rushing river, as they soon came to the banks of the mighty Espiritu.<br />
<br />
Stacey immediately noticed the sparkling waters dancing in the setting sun as they rushed over a maze of rocks and fallen trees, but she did not have long to admire the beauty of the river as Ranjona reiterated the expediency of their mission, “We must be going. I believe the soldiers are distracted for now, but I fear that we may come upon a fiendish foe soon enough.”<br />
<br />
Walking at a bit of a slower pace now, the two began north, heading away from the cave and destroyed village. Wanta floated lazily beside them, giving the occasional sigh to maintain his altitude. Their walk went uninterrupted for a good twenty minutes, allowing Stacey a moment to catch her breath. After a while, however, Ranjona became somewhat uneasy, though Stacey could not tell why. Afraid that she may be aware of something on the horizon, Stacey inquired as to the girl's nervousness.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I'm just becoming a bit anxious about this whole thing.” Ranjona replies, now much calmer around the quiet river, “I am so afraid of these terrible soldiers, and I have tried to be strong. I really do admire your strength, Stacey. I feel as if you truly are a strong-willed person.”<br />
<br />
Stacey accepted the comments gratefully, and attempted to give Ranjona some encouragement.<br />
<br />
“Thank you for such kind words, Stacey. I don't think I could do this without you.” Ranjona said, smiling slightly.<br />
<br />
The two of them walked down the riverbank for a moment, continuing their trek towards the city, eventually reaching another pool similar to the one at the cave's entrance. Another beautiful waterfall cascaded down slowly receding slope, flowing gracefully over the rock face in a mesmerizing amber-colored curtain.<br />
<br />
“This is one of my favorite spots in the forest, the Ambersap Cascades.” Ranjona commented, “We're here at the perfect time too; they get their name from how the sun hits them as it sets. It looks like liquid amber, does it not?”<br />
<br />
Stacey nods, awestruck by the gorgeous water. Suddenly, however, her tranquility was shattered as the water in the river at the ends of the falls began to stir. Both girls turned towards the pool, watching the water as the ripples began to grow. Stacey could see a look of apprehension grow on Ranjona's face as pulses began to run through the ground.<br />
<br />
All of the sudden, a flare of water erupted from the pool, spraying Stacey and Ranjona with a sheet of shimmering drops. From the water rose a twisting, snake -like monster, resembling a sea dragon and form and a fish in features. Angrily, the Gyarados gave a powerful roar, shaking the ground once again.<br />
<br />
“Wanta, hold back!” Ranjona ordered as the balloon Pokemon floated upwards out of the sea monster's range.<br />
<br />
Ranjona bent down, taking her necklace from her neck once again, and placed it into the water. A soft pulse of white light traveled through the crystallite liquid, and from the depths came a spiral-shaped spiked-shelled creature, who rose to the surface, revealing a soft blue body with a multitude of short tentacles and a beak-like mouth.<br />
<br />
“Spari, please assist us fight this monster!” Ranjona bequeathed, receiving a short nod from the Omastar.<br />
<br />
“Launch many stones at him, then barrage him with spikes!” she ordered.<br />
<br />
What will you do?<br />
</span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">With their destination decided Ranjona ran into the under brush with Stacey and Drusilla following shortly behind her. Their pace was quick taking advantage of the reprieve that Dru's maddened attacks had given them. Running in amongst the tropic wild plants they could hear the commotion behind them begin to quieten. Stacey sighed in relief when all sound of life from the soldiers evaporated and were quickly replaced by the gushing of water. They had travelled a long distance in a short time and had reached the Espiratu River already. <br />
<br />
It was quite beautiful in it wild natural state, the waters sparkled from the beams of the setting sun as the water forcefully rushed over rocks and fallen trees blocking its path. Drawn from her appreciation of their new surroundings Stacey turned to face Ranjon who warned that they must move, even if they had caught a break from the vile soldiers there maybe something worse lurking in the undergrowth ready to attack. Stacey always felt ready to take on any creature, any foe or challenge but nodded, understanding the need for prudence.<br />
<br />
The pace slowed now the immediate danger had passed and Stacey found herself enjoying the walk. The further away from the Ordial Shrine she was the more she came out of her shell. She felt almost herself again, something about that rock that had her entranced. Looking ahead to her guide she frowned upon noticing how twitchy she had become. Throughout this ordeal she had not looked as nervous as she does now.<br />
<br />
&quot;What has you so anxious Ranjona?&quot; she asked, &quot;We are far enough away from the threat are we not?&quot;<br />
<br />
“Oh, I'm just becoming a bit anxious about this whole thing.” Ranjona replies to her question “I am so afraid of these terrible soldiers, and I have tried to be strong. I really do admire your strength, Stacey. I feel as if you truly are a strong-willed person.”<br />
<br />
Stacey shook her head, her face still hidden by her hood, the bright white skull painted across it giving her a demonic appearance.<br />
<br />
&quot;From what you have told me so far, you are managing the best you can. You carry yourself well, with strength and honour defending your beliefs and right to live. I know very little of the horrors you have suffered, I am not so strong-willed as you will believe, I have just seen worse, if you are able to believe such a thing,&quot; she said vaguely as a manner of explanation before going silent once more. <br />
<br />
Ranjona seemed lifted by the small amount of encouragement and the pair continued on in comfortable silence, walking the length of the river arriving at a large pool. At its far end a gorgeous cascading waterfall ripped into the silence with its roars seding ripples and waves throughout the pool.<br />
<br />
“This is one of my favorite spots in the forest, the Ambersap Cascades.” Ranjona commented, “We're here at the perfect time too; they get their name from how the sun hits them as it sets. It looks like liquid amber, does it not?”<br />
<br />
Stacey had to agree, the water was a glorious gold colour and sparkled like glitter under the fading sun. Had she arrived hear under different circumstances she would have loved to remain here the night. It wasn't long though, as with most calm scenic moments she'd enjoyed that it was broken. The water began to ripple before violent waves cascaded throughout the pool. Ranjona looked extremely anxious and Stacey wondered what creature they had disturbed. Her question was answered as the water erupt spraying both woman as a large blue snake-like body slithered out from underneath the pool its eyes hard and filled with malice, its mouth wide open in an eternal scream. The Gyarados roared in fury the sound waves hitting them like a blast of wind. <br />
<br />
Ranjona ordered her Drifblim to hold back, the balloon floating up and out of the way as she placed her necklace into the pool. A white light shone from the crystal and shimmered deep into the water and summoned from beneath an ancient creature emerged. With a hard white shell covered in spikes, its blue tentacles wriggling back and forth as its dark eyes surveyed the water dragon before it. Ranjona asked the Omastar for help and the creature seemed happy to oblige. Stacey felt a tingle of fascination over Ranjona's ability to draw on such rare pokemon for assistance.<br />
<br />
She would not leave the battle to Omastar alone, not when she could assist. Looking back at Dru who was having withdrawls from the blood feast not too long ago she decided against using her in battle, opting to leave her to her derranged ranting. Pulling another Pokeball from her waist she enlarged it and threw it into the water next to Omastar. The ball snapped open and deposited its own occupant under the surface. Catching the ball as it returned she watched with a faint smile as her own ancient creature arose the water cascading off its hard brown shell. It turned to face her with bright red eyes and gurgled a few glutteral sounds on happiness to be out in the water again before it noticed the Omastar next to him. Wraith growled in defence and Stacey silenced him pointing to the much larger water beast and Wraith waggled his claws eager for a battle.<br />
<br />

Eletron Plant; Tyranidos – Seeing this as a good opportunity for some exploration and to find a new friend, Tyrant eagerly asks as to where the offending Magnemite reside.<br />
<br />
“Ah, yes, they tend to be concentrated around the main generator, but you'll probably be best off starting around the smaller ones first. Be careful, though,” he warned,”there may be some Magneton as well, and we've even have had a report of a Magnezone! They're very powerful Pokemon, especially when allowed to feed of this energy so freely!”<br />
<br />
Thanking him for his advice, Tyrant and his Combusken set off towards the main generator. Though it didn't exactly surprise him, Tyrant soon noticed how extensive the plant was after having to trek through hall after hall just to reach the first set of minor generators. Once they arrived, however, they came upon their target within seconds; a group of tiny Magnemite floated about a moderate-sized generator, causing it to fizzle and whir violently as the magnetic Pokemon interrupted the flow of power.<br />
<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: yellow"><span style="font-size: 9px">&quot;What, even Magnetons?&quot; Tyrant asked, amazed that such strong Electric Pokemon would show up around here. The professor continued on, even mentioning a rare sighting of a Magnezone. &quot;Really, a Magnezone?!&quot; Tyrant said, going crazy that he might be able to see this. With that, the professor finished his mission objective and advice, and sent Tyrant off into the Power Plant.<br />
<br />
After some time, Tyrant began to wonder when he would finally see even a Magnemite. &quot;There are halls after halls after halls.&quot; Tyrant sighed, seeing that Phoenix was getting a bit tired as well, hoping to get his muscles going. Suddenly, Tyrant felt some electric currents, as his hair began to rise a little. &quot;..hm?&quot; Tyrant said and looked up. He finally found one of the smaller generators, along with a group of Magnemite. &quot;Yeah, awesome! This is pretty cool, even though they are just Magnemite!&quot; Tyrant said, happy just to see some activity. He looked over to Phoenix, who was chirping excited and baring his claws. &quot;Well, I see that you want to show these Magnemite a thing or two! Start with an <b>Ember</b>, then <b>Double Kick</b>!&quot; Tyrant said, excited about the battle.</span></span></div>

You watch with a mixture of shock and delight as Slice sheds his Scyther image and evolves into a shiny Scizor. After consulting your Pokédex, you quickly take advantage of this pleasant turn of events with a new set of orders. During the evolution it also seems that Slice has regained all of his health and energy. Surprisingly, you pull Freeze back into the battle. He breathes heavily as he steps forward and breathes and extremely weak <b>Blizzard</b>. Whether this is because you ordered him to do so or if that was all the energy he could muster is uncertain. The ice in the attack melts away and wets four of the Sableye. Freeze stumbles backwards and holds his head as he has become extremely dizzy. The Magbies turn towards each other and nod as they release bright sparks from their <b>hand</b>s to <b>help</b> power up Thunderfuzz’s attack. Thunderfuzz jumps into the middle of the Sableye and discharges the electricity from her body in a giant <b>Spark</b>. The attack does great damage to all of the Sableye, but Thunderfuzz had been standing in the water, too. She accidentally shocked herself for a little damage. Two more Sableye fall down knocked out! Slice then uses the Magbies’ boost with his <b>Razor Wind</b>. He beats his metallic wings sending razor sharp air flying across the cave towards the Sableye. One of the Sableye gets struck right through the heart and falls down with a large puddle of black blood forming around it! One more is added to the death list. <br />
<br />
You look over to the Magmortar to see how she is faring. She <b>ThunderPunch</b>es one of the Sableye attacking her, knocking it out. Only two are still conscious that are facing her. Turning back to your battle, you see Freeze trying to stagger to his feet. It seems a Sableye has just used <b>Knock Off</b> to hit Freeze to the ground. He gets up and fires off a beam of massive energy at the Sableye. The <b>Hyper Beam</b> obliterates the Sableye. Its torso and half of its head are completely gone; the remains of that Sableye fall to the ground while another puddle of black blood-like substance forms around it. Freeze falls over with that; the energy strain is just too much for him. The white Weavile is knocked out! Thunderfuzz jumps forward and uses <b>Flamethrower</b> on a Sableye to which a Magby contributes a <b>Flamethrower</b> of his own. They spit fire out which hits the paralyzed Sableye, knocking it as well. Slice jumps into the air and slams himself down into the ground. Seeing their cue, the Magbies, Magmortar, and Thunderfuzz jump into the air to avoid damage from the <b>earthquake</b>. The ground violently shakes beneath the Sableye, also creating a large crevice that the four remaining Sableye fall into. <b>Level up for Thunderfuzz!</b> <b>Level up for Slice!</b> With all of waves one through four either knocked out or dead, you take a moment to relax. You count the remaining Sableye. With two waves remaining, plus seven searching for the Murkrow, and the two guarding the exit, that’s nineteen. You have already defeated twenty so that makes thirty-nine, but wait, wasn’t there forty Sableye to begin with? Then you see the last Sableye. He is on a rock overlooking the rest of the cave. On his head is a crown of jewels; he must be the king of the Sableye. Standing next to him is a green bird. The King motions to the Xatu who steps forward and squawks loudly. You look up toward the bird, and that is last thing you remember…<br />
<br />
When you come to, you see that you are once again tied up. Next to you, Slice, Thunderfuzz, the Magbies, and the Magmortar have also been tied up. Freeze is still knocked out and is also tied up. Digga’ has been released from her Pokéball somehow and is tied up. The eight of you are deeper into the volcano right in front of the magma. All of the still healthy Sableye are present. The King stands right next to the magma with a large red jewel in his hands. He shouts out and four of the seven Sableye that had left enter with the Murkrow being carried tied to a stick. It seems three of the Sableye have been knocked out on their quest. The Sableye walk forward and toss the Murkrow into the magma. The smell of burnt feathers rises to your nostrils as the Murkow dies a death IN FLAMES! You struggle to free yourself but you discover you’re stuck. The Sableye don’t seem to have gotten any smarter though, you can still reach your Pokéballs from where you are. Mortimer, Arrow, and your Carvahna could be summoned since the Sableye were unaware they even existed. But you realize that your Pokéballs are slightly out of reach, and it’ll cause noise and time to get to them. The Sableye might discover you and your chance of escape could be ruined. Perhaps if you had some sort of distraction, you could get to your Pokéballs.<br />

“<i>Dead? DEAD?! I didn’t mean to kill I just wanted to find my Illumise. I love her so. She means the world to me! It’s not for the sex! It’s my commitment to her to show her I love so! We’ll have our delightful babies that she’ll raise in my remembrance! This is the one night of the year that the Volbeats and Illumises mate, I’ll be dead by the next one anyone!</i>” Volbeat shouts back to Rocky. Relief washes over his face as he sees you wake up. “<i>There see he’s not dead!</i>” <br />
<br />
You agree to continue to help Volbeat find his lover which causes his eyes to light up with delight. He turns to Rock and explains the situation better since he can directly communicate with her, “<i>We were in the Spearow territory when the Spearows attacked us. I told Illumise to go back to the Tree while I fought them off. I finally managed to defeat the Spearow and came back but she was no where to be found. I think some of the Pokémon in the forest took her for a meal or something. The Silver Forest is divided into four different territories. The first is the Spearows’ territory, you’ve already been there. Then the spiders where you’ve been as well. Next is the hive where Combees dominate. Beedrill, Kakuna, Weedle, and Vespiquen are also quite common there. Finally is the area where the carnivorous plants live. Other than that the only other place she could even possibly be is up north of the hive where some birds nest. It’s not too likely she’ll be with the birds, but I haven’t looked there yet. Since we’ve already looked through the spiders’ place, we know she’s not there. Which area should we look in?</i>” The three of you make your way to a crossroads by the large tree in the clearing. There are three different ways you can follow; straight will lead you back to the Spearow’s territory, to your left will bring into the Combee hive, and your right holds the Victreebels and Carnvines and other carnivorous plants of the forest. <br />
<br />

Visibly disappointed at the attacks not working, you order Parabola to provide a distraction while you search for some sort of weakness the Phantom Spinda might have. Parabola’s eyes glow blue as it psychically sends the spirit flying with its <b>Confusion</b> attack. Meanwhile you run to the dresser and pull out some dusty old clothes and a small key. Deciding that that could come in handy later, you stuff it in your pocket. You then grab the diary and flip through to a random page. Meanwhile the Spinda stands back up or rather floats back up. It flies at Parabola who tightens up and <b>harden</b>s his skin. Spinda hits the Baltoy, but the Psychic type takes little damage with his harden. After skimming a few pages, you find a page in the diary and begin to read. It says, <br />
<br />
“<i>July 21<br />
Dear Diary,<br />
Today Purple accidentally stepped on Mr. Snugglebear. Spinny freaked out so much that he almost fainted! I guess no one messes with that Spinda’s teddy bear. <br />
<br />
-Polkadot Teishoku</i>”<br />
<br />
You look up from the diary to see the teddy bear sitting on the bed. This must be the teddy bear mentioned in the diary. Parabola fires a <b>Psybeam</b> at the phantom who looks confused for a moment but its Own Tempo allows it to shake the confusion off. The Spinda propels itself forward to punch in a very bizarre fashion. The <b>Dizzy Punch</b> perplexes Parabola, but thankfully, it doesn’t get confused. With the teddy bear now in your clutches, Phantom Spinda pauses and looks at you. Its eyes suddenly become sad and it looks at you with fear for its teddy.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span><br />

You are slightly depressed by finding out that you have been cursed, but you now have better chances of defeating the Gyarados which lifts your spirits. You immediately set out to your work. You yell out insults to the large water beast that causes it to turn around with anger in its eyes. It roars at you with the wrath of such intensity that the man shudders next to you. Torchlight dashes forward in his sleeker, faster Quilava form. He quickly dashes in and hits the Water Pokémon before it can do anything then spins around and hits it again. Volante flies up with powerful wingbeats with its new form. She flaps her wing with all of her power to send a <b>gust</b> of air into the sea monster’s face. The Gyarados rears backwards and throws itself at Volante, trying to <b>bite</b> her. Volante flies up higher than the sea beast can reach, however. Ambipom runs behind the Gyarados and uses both of its tail hands to <b>tickle</b> the monster. The big blue sea snake writhes with laughter as the purple monkey tickles it.(That was an odd sentence &gt;&gt;) With this distraction, Volante kicks up a cloud of sand into the Gyarados’s eyes. The foreign material causes the beast to be slightly blinded. Volante then <b>Quick Attack</b>es the monster to hit it again. The Gyarados tries a <b>Hyper Beam</b> but its lack of sight causes the beam to go off into the air. The beast uses some of its water from its water gun or some similar attack to wash the sand from its eyes. Now seeing its foes, the Gyarados <b>thrash</b>es the three Pokémon attack it. All three are hit once, with Volante hit a second time, but Torchlight creates a <b>smokescreen</b> to hide the trio. Ambipom jumps out of the smoke and use all of its <b>fury</b> to repeatedly <b>swipe</b> its claws across the Gyarados’s face. Volante has used little energy but her health is down an eighth. Torchlight and Ambipom haven’t used much energy either, their health is only down a sixteenth. The Gyarados is at about half health and energy.<br />

You sit astounded as Gabriel pulls out a shotgun. Deciding to take action, you cry out orders to your Pokémon. Tei hops up onto a small table flying slightly. He extends his wings and shoots off electrical tendrils from the tips. The <b>Thunderwave</b> hits Gabriel’s arms locking up his muscles preventing him from pulling the trigger. The man stands still unable to move. Seldon takes advantage of this by extending her tongue to grab the man’s shotgun from his hands. Alicia takes the gun and disarms it; throwing the bullets to a side, Alicia runs to her mother and gives her a big embrace. Cryssi is visibly shaken but seeing that Gabriel could no longer move and was also unarmed, she recovers and turns to you. “I suppose you deserve an explanation. We- Alicia and I and even Nightfall- are wizards. We came from a land called Elysia. There in the land existed an order of wizards. Eventually the order split between those good and those evil. We were members of the light order, while Gabriel belongs to the dark order. Eventually war broke out in Elysia; a war that spanned centuries, being wizards, we age much more slowly than humans. Eventually Elysia split into Elyra and Aryle, two different worlds. Light and good reside in Elyra while darkness and evil dominate Aryle. I thought our troubles were over, but we soon discovered that I hold the key to releasing the dark order. Gabriel, who had managed to free himself from Aryle, has been hunting me down to free the rest of the dark order,” Cryssi explains to you. Alicia runs into a different room and quickly returns with some rope. She quickly ties up the man so Tei can stop his Thunderwave. <br />
<br />
“What are we supposed to do with him, Mum?” Alicia asks Cryssi.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know,” she admitted, “there is a spell to send him back to Aryle, but there are several ingredients we need. If you, Potato, could help us gather a few things, we could do it.”<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span><br />

You awaken the rest of your team and have all of them pepped and ready to find Orion. You ask Ditto to transform in Xatu again to fly around to look for a policeman. The pink blob complies- sort of. It transforms into a Pidgey which is, of course, much more discreet. The Ditto flies up into the air and out of sight. A few minutes later it returns in sight and lands. The little bird melts back into the Ditto form. A policeman in a navy uniform runs up to you and asks you if it was your Ditto. You quickly explain the whole situation to the man. He nods as your story finishes.<br />
<br />
“I see. So you want help catching this hooligan, right? Well, I’d be happy to help you bring this guy to justice. Well let’s get to searching!” he shouts as he pumps his fist into the air, “My name is Harris, by the way. I’ll need a description of the man,” Harris says. Ditto transforms into a Smeargle and quickly paints a picture of the man. Harris releases the occupant of a Pokéball; a smallish bug with purple fur. “Venonat track down this man!” he says as he shows the gnat the painting. A small blip appears on the Venonat’s eyes and begins to move around. The Venonat begins to run out of the park; the five of you quickly follow through the streets of Salin City. Soon all of you arrive at a warehouse on the outskirts of the city. You and Harris slightly open the door and peer inside. The boy was there inside at a small. A young woman with short red hair is also inside. She’s wearing a black outfit with a large red “R” on her T-shirt and her beret.<br />

Visibly disappointed at the attacks not working, you order Parabola to provide a distraction while you search for some sort of weakness the Phantom Spinda might have. Parabola’s eyes glow blue as it psychically sends the spirit flying with its <b>Confusion</b> attack. Meanwhile you run to the dresser and pull out some dusty old clothes and a small key. Deciding that that could come in handy later, you stuff it in your pocket. You then grab the diary and flip through to a random page. Meanwhile the Spinda stands back up or rather floats back up. It flies at Parabola who tightens up and <b>harden</b>s his skin. Spinda hits the Baltoy, but the Psychic type takes little damage with his harden. After skimming a few pages, you find a page in the diary and begin to read. It says, <br />
<br />
“<i>July 21<br />
Dear Diary,<br />
Today Purple accidentally stepped on Mr. Snugglebear. Spinny freaked out so much that he almost fainted! I guess no one messes with that Spinda’s teddy bear. <br />
<br />
-Polkadot Teishoku</i>”<br />
<br />
You look up from the diary to see the teddy bear sitting on the bed. This must be the teddy bear mentioned in the diary. Parabola fires a <b>Psybeam</b> at the phantom who looks confused for a moment but its Own Tempo allows it to shake the confusion off. The Spinda propels itself forward to punch in a very bizarre fashion. The <b>Dizzy Punch</b> perplexes Parabola, but thankfully, it doesn’t get confused. With the teddy bear now in your clutches, Phantom Spinda pauses and looks at you. Its eyes suddenly become sad and it looks at you with fear for its teddy.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: darkorange"><span style="font-size: 9px">Alina quickly ran toward the dresser, reaching out for the top drawer. She jumped at the huge crash behind her, and jerked her head in the direction of the noise. To her relief, her Baltoy was perfectly fine, having flung the phantom into the wall by using its Confusion attack. Turning her attention back to the dresser, she yanked the top drawer open and tossed aside multiple pieces of clothing, finding nothing particularly useful at the time besides a key buried underneath all of the clothing. <i>Hmm, wonder if this goes anywhere...</i> Alina thought to herself while she quickly scanned the room for a keyhole. <br />
<br />
<i>Nothing...</i> Alina thought again, growing more panicked by the second. She then stuffed the key into her coat pocket. <i>This could still be useful, though.</i><br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Parabola was having issues of its own. The Spinda rose up slowly from the ground in a slight daze, and suddenly flung itself towards the doll Pokemon in fierce rage. Parabola tightened up using Harden, taking minimal damage, but still slightly dazed from the attack. It wobbled back and forth as it spun around slowly, slightly dazed from the Spinda's attack...<br />
<br />
Alina flipped through the diary as quickly as she good, reading only a few words before she turned the page. Just when she was about to give up, her eyes fell on a short little entry:<br />
<br />
<i>“July 21<br />
Dear Diary,<br />
Today Purple accidentally stepped on Mr. Snugglebear. Spinny freaked out so much that he almost fainted! I guess no one messes with that Spinda’s teddy bear.<br />
<br />
-Polkadot Teishoku”</i><br />
<br />
Alina slowly turned her head, mouth hanging open dumbly. She reached out for the teddy bear while the Baltoy regained its composure and fired a psybeam, making the Spinda confused for a split second, until its Own Tempo ability kicked in. The ghost flung itself towards Parabola, pummeling it with a Dizzy Punch until Alina picked up the teddy bear. It stopped and gazed back at Alina with teary eyes, obviously fearing for the bear's safety. Only one word was going through Alina's mind: Hostage.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-STOP ATTACKING, OR THE TEDDY'S SCREWED,&quot; Alina yelled, trying to sound threatening. It was difficult for her to sound vicious when she was thinking &quot;Oh fuck, this thing is going to kill me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Parabola slowly wobbled back to Alina, making an illusion of that cartoon hand pointing at her, then turning into a Turtwig. It tried to hide behind her, until Alina forced it in front of her with her foot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Use a <b>Confusion</b>, <b>Rock Tomb</b>, and <b>Harden</b> but <i>only if it attacks</i>,&quot; she whispered to the Baltoy. Parabola made a groaning sound and began to spin around Alina, keeping an eye on the Spinda.<br />
<br />
Alina looked back up at the phantom in front of her while firmly grasping the teddy bear by its head in her hands. &quot;OKAY, I-I'd like you to open that door so we can safely leave this place, you know. I know where Polkadot is, and I can lead you to her, but you'll NEVER get your teddy bear back unless you do what I asked. Is that a deal?&quot; <br />
<br />
The girl shakily held the teddy bear in front of her as if it was a shield, hoping the Spinda wouldn't attack...</span></span></div>

You watch with a mixture of shock and delight as Slice sheds his Scyther image and evolves into a shiny Scizor. After consulting your Pokédex, you quickly take advantage of this pleasant turn of events with a new set of orders. During the evolution it also seems that Slice has regained all of his health and energy. Surprisingly, you pull Freeze back into the battle. He breathes heavily as he steps forward and breathes and extremely weak <b>Blizzard</b>. Whether this is because you ordered him to do so or if that was all the energy he could muster is uncertain. The ice in the attack melts away and wets four of the Sableye. Freeze stumbles backwards and holds his head as he has become extremely dizzy. The Magbies turn towards each other and nod as they release bright sparks from their <b>hand</b>s to <b>help</b> power up Thunderfuzz’s attack. Thunderfuzz jumps into the middle of the Sableye and discharges the electricity from her body in a giant <b>Spark</b>. The attack does great damage to all of the Sableye, but Thunderfuzz had been standing in the water, too. She accidentally shocked herself for a little damage. Two more Sableye fall down knocked out! Slice then uses the Magbies’ boost with his <b>Razor Wind</b>. He beats his metallic wings sending razor sharp air flying across the cave towards the Sableye. One of the Sableye gets struck right through the heart and falls down with a large puddle of black blood forming around it! </span></span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: red">[FONT=&amp;quot]<span style="font-family: 'Verdana'">One more is added to the death list. <br />
<br />
You look over to the Magmortar to see how she is faring. She <b>ThunderPunch</b>es one of the Sableye attacking her, knocking it out. Only two are still conscious that are facing her. Turning back to your battle, you see Freeze trying to stagger to his feet. It seems a Sableye has just used <b>Knock Off</b> to hit Freeze to the ground. He gets up and fires off a beam of massive energy at the Sableye. The <b>Hyper Beam</b> obliterates the Sableye. Its torso and half of its head are completely gone; the remains of that Sableye fall to the ground while another puddle of black blood-like substance forms around it. Freeze falls over with that; the energy strain is just too much for him. The white Weavile is knocked out! Thunderfuzz jumps forward and uses <b>Flamethrower</b> on a Sableye to which a Magby contributes a <b>Flamethrower</b> of his own. They spit fire out which hits the paralyzed Sableye, knocking it as well. Slice jumps into the air and slams himself down into the ground. Seeing their cue, the Magbies, Magmortar, and Thunderfuzz jump into the air to avoid damage from the <b>earthquake</b>. The ground violently shakes beneath the Sableye, also creating a large crevice that the four remaining Sableye fall into. <b>Level up for Thunderfuzz!</b> <b>Level up for Slice!</b> With all of waves one through four either knocked out or dead, you take a moment to relax. You count the remaining Sableye. With two waves remaining, plus seven searching for the Murkrow, and the two guarding the exit, that’s nineteen. You have already defeated twenty so that makes thirty-nine, but wait, wasn’t there forty Sableye to begin with? Then you see the last Sableye. He is on a rock overlooking the rest of the cave. On his head is a crown of jewels; he must be the king of the Sableye. Standing next to him is a green bird. The King motions to the Xatu who steps forward and squawks loudly. You look up toward the bird, and that is last thing you remember…<br />
<br />
When you come to, you see that you are once again tied up. Next to you, Slice, Thunderfuzz, the Magbies, and the Magmortar have also been tied up. Freeze is still knocked out and is also tied up. Digga’ has been released from her Pokéball somehow and is tied up. The eight of you are deeper into the volcano right in front of the magma. All of the still healthy Sableye are present. The King stands right next to the magma with a large red jewel in his hands. He shouts out and four of the seven Sableye that had left enter with the Murkrow being carried tied to a stick. It seems three of the Sableye have been knocked out on their quest. The Sableye walk forward and toss the Murkrow into the magma. The smell of burnt feathers rises to your nostrils as the Murkow dies a death IN FLAMES! You struggle to free yourself but you discover you’re stuck. The Sableye don’t seem to have gotten any smarter though, you can still reach your Pokéballs from where you are. Mortimer, Arrow, and your Carvahna could be summoned since the Sableye were unaware they even existed. But you realize that your Pokéballs are slightly out of reach, and it’ll cause noise and time to get to them. The Sableye might discover you and your chance of escape could be ruined. Perhaps if you had some sort of distraction, you could get to your Pokéballs.</span> <br />

</span></span><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'"><span style="font-size: 9px">Sorry, didn't think to look. Acting like a n00b is fun for me. Nice Kuno Reference BTW. I think water pokemon levitate out of water right?<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red">Everything was going great, there were only half of them left. Right when he was about to recall Freeze for a long relaxing rest he realised something was missing, one Sableye to be exact. Then he looked up there it was the king of the Sableye, wearing his jewel encrusted crown. He motioned a bird forward, and then, nothing.<br />
<br />
He woke up, deeper in the volcano, the heat was even worse here than it was before, he felt as if he was in an oven, an oven that probably had a timer... He tried to move again, but then he realised he was tied up alongside him were four of his traveling companionns alongside the Magbies and their Magmortar mother. <i>I have my pokeballs in a very reachable zone, The good thing about is is that they don't know about either Arrow, Mortimer or Palladium...</i><br />
<br />
As the king beckoned them forward four Sableye appeared carrying a now tied-up Honchcrow. I told him to stay behind, he would be safer tied up here instead of tied up with Rabid Sableye ready to attack. He didn't want to speak as that might stir the Sableye into attacking him while he was tied down. All he could do was scream as to what he saw next. The Sableye, evil as they may be, sunk to an even lower low, they threw Honchcrow in the lava! &quot;NOOOOOO! YOU BITCHES DIE NOW!!&quot; he suddenly quieted down, formulating a plan in his head. He couldn't just grab his pokeballs as it could cause some unnesesary(I spell Terrible) attention with the noise it would cause, he needed a distraction. <i>Perfect! Digga' is on the other side, if she were to attack the Sableye would rush to her, leaving me alone to get the pokeballs.<br />
<br />
</i> &quot;Hey Digga'!&quot; He paused as he waited for the Trapinch to turn, &quot;You know that <b>Rock Slide</b> Move you learned a while back? I want you to use it!&quot; He looked at Digga' who seemed to nod. &quot;Great, do it when I give you the signal.&quot; He paused as he looked at the pokeball that housed his psychic type. He seemed to just be staring at it but in reality he was relaying the plan to his Beldum, which could receive and send Telepathic messages even through it's pokeball.<br />
<i><br />
Palladium, I know you have only on move but you are a perfect way to escape. In fact you are very important to this plan. You are the only way this plan will work. I am going to release you in a few seconds, and you will cut me and Slice out of our bonds with your </i><b>Take Down</b><i>, making sure that you use the claws on your arm slash rump. Since I can't ttelepathically send out my commands to either Mortimer or Arrow like you can , I need you to relay this imformation to them and do it quickly:<br />
<br />
&quot;BEL-DUMMM.&quot; </i>this was the way Palladium said okay, and as he did a connection was established beetween Tyson and mortimer.<i><br />
<br />
Mortimer, I know that you are a very little pokemon but you have had experience in battles before so you need to be on your toes. I am going to release you from your ball and you will be in a volcano. This is not the time to rejoice as we are being attacked by a group of Sableye. When you come out Biak will be out alongside you. He will peck us out and all help to him is nessesary so I want you to give him cover with some </i><b>ominous wind</b><i>. There is no time for questions so just do as I say as soon as you are released.<br />
<br />
'Shuuu?&quot; </i>This probably confused Mortimer, but he understood that this was dangerous from Tyson's apparent voice tone. <i><br />
<br />
Palladium, can you connect me to Biak?<br />
<br />
&quot;BEL-DUMM&quot; </i>suddenly there was the connection.<i><br />
<br />
Biak, this is your first adventure little buddy, but this is not one of those times when if you get hurt its okay, you are in a life or death situation. Luckily I have told Mortimer to cover you, so only worry about cutting us down. You are important to this because we need to get out. Look you have sharp teeth, when I release you you need to <b>Bite </b></i><i>at the ropes holding </i></span></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: red"><i>Digga'</i></span></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: red"><i>, the Magbies, and the </i></span></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: red"><i>Magmortar</i></span></span></span>[FONT=&amp;quot]<span style="color: red"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'"><span style="font-size: 9px"><i> down so we can attack, Don't waste your time with Freeze, here he is at a very dangerous temperature, he needs to return to his ball.

<br />
&quot;Carvan-ha?&quot; </i>he was confused as to what this was but he seemed to know this was real.<br />
<i><br />
Thanks Palladium, prepare to attack.<br />
</i><br />
&quot;Slice!&quot; he wispered to the bug, who was directly next to him in a tone only he and Slice could hear. &quot;we are going to get help soon, and when you are cut out I want you to help Mortimer, Biak and Palladium cut us out by using <b>False Swipe</b> on the Ropes.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then yelled to everyone, &quot;When you are let out, Attack! All pokemon on my team can use whatever move, We just need to escape this.&quot;<br />
<i><br />
I will recall Freeze when I reach my pokeballs. He needs to escape this heat.</i> &quot;Digga' GO!&quot; and as she began to attack he grabbed his pokeballs. &quot;Come on out Guys!&quot;</span></span> <br />

<span style="color: yellow"><span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Furret</u> – Storm Lake</b><i>Reply in yellow</i><br />
You sit astounded as Gabriel pulls out a shotgun. Deciding to take action, you cry out orders to your Pokémon. Tei hops up onto a small table flying slightly. He extends his wings and shoots off electrical tendrils from the tips. The <b>Thunderwave</b> hits Gabriel’s arms locking up his muscles preventing him from pulling the trigger. The man stands still unable to move. Seldon takes advantage of this by extending her tongue to grab the man’s shotgun from his hands. Alicia takes the gun and disarms it; throwing the bullets to a side, Alicia runs to her mother and gives her a big embrace. Cryssi is visibly shaken but seeing that Gabriel could no longer move and was also unarmed, she recovers and turns to you. “I suppose you deserve an explanation. We- Alicia and I and even Nightfall- are wizards. We came from a land called Elysia. There in the land existed an order of wizards. Eventually the order split between those good and those evil. We were members of the light order, while Gabriel belongs to the dark order. Eventually war broke out in Elysia; a war that spanned centuries, being wizards, we age much more slowly than humans. Eventually Elysia split into Elyra and Aryle, two different worlds. Light and good reside in Elyra while darkness and evil dominate Aryle. I thought our troubles were over, but we soon discovered that I hold the key to releasing the dark order. Gabriel, who had managed to free himself from Aryle, has been hunting me down to free the rest of the dark order,” Cryssi explains to you. Alicia runs into a different room and quickly returns with some rope. She quickly ties up the man so Tei can stop his Thunderwave. <br />
<br />
“What are we supposed to do with him, Mum?” Alicia asks Cryssi.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know,” she admitted, “there is a spell to send him back to Aryle, but there are several ingredients we need. If you, Potato, could help us gather a few things, we could do it.”<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span>

<br />
Potato listened intently to Cryssi’s story. He knew he had seen the Umbreon talk. Yet, he still had trouble believing it. He had assumed it was just something a little more… more <i>normal</i>. The Umbreon’s parents had been espeons, or something to that line of thought. Wizards… that was a bit more… different. They could hurt him; Hurt his pokemon.<br />
<br />
But he swallowed hard, thought. He had helped save the family; They had no reason to hurt him. Besides, Cryssi said that they were the of the light side; They were the good guys. But what if she was lying what if Gabriel was good and they were the enemy? But no; Potato would just have to take their word for it. What else did he have to go on, besides his own crazy thoughts?<br />
<br />
“Um.” Started Potato, awkward as ever. “I guess that would be okay; I don’t really have anything else to do anyway,” He lied, thinking of the serenity of the lakeside. “What do you guys think?” He asked his pokemon. Seldon gave a warm, blissful smile of utter indefrence, before grabbing another carrot from the vegetable trey; Tei shrugged as much as a shoulder-less bird can.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I guess that would be fine, then. What do I- we need to get?” He asked, wondering if he was wandering into a trap. </span></span></div>

You awaken the rest of your team and have all of them pepped and ready to find Orion. You ask Ditto to transform in Xatu again to fly around to look for a policeman. The pink blob complies- sort of. It transforms into a Pidgey which is, of course, much more discreet. The Ditto flies up into the air and out of sight. A few minutes later it returns in sight and lands. The little bird melts back into the Ditto form. A policeman in a navy uniform runs up to you and asks you if it was your Ditto. You quickly explain the whole situation to the man. He nods as your story finishes.<br />
<br />
“I see. So you want help catching this hooligan, right? Well, I’d be happy to help you bring this guy to justice. Well let’s get to searching!” he shouts as he pumps his fist into the air, “My name is Harris, by the way. I’ll need a description of the man,” Harris says. Ditto transforms into a Smeargle and quickly paints a picture of the man. Harris releases the occupant of a Pokéball; a smallish bug with purple fur. “Venonat track down this man!” he says as he shows the gnat the painting. A small blip appears on the Venonat’s eyes and begins to move around. The Venonat begins to run out of the park; the five of you quickly follow through the streets of Salin City. Soon all of you arrive at a warehouse on the outskirts of the city. You and Harris slightly open the door and peer inside. The boy was there inside at a small. A young woman with short red hair is also inside. She’s wearing a black outfit with a large red “R” on her T-shirt and her beret.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: silver"><span style="font-size: 9px"><br />
What’s a small? XD<br />
<br />
So far, everything (well, mostly) had gone according to plan. Upon recieving orders, the Ditto turned into a less-likely-to-be-spotted Pidgey and flew off into the jumble of streets, buldings, and parks that was Salin City. Soon, it returned, along with a policeman in a...Navy uniform? &quot;Sheesh.&quot; Mike muttered. &quot;Make up your mind, guy.&quot; Ditto Transformed back into its regular self, a process that looked rather disturbing. Upon being asked if it was his Ditto or not, Mike explained the whole situation to him. Nodding, the police-sailor dude said energetically, “I see. So you want help catching this hooligan, right? Well, I’d be happy to help you bring this guy to justice. Well let’s get to searching!” Pumping his fist into the air with excitement at the opportunity to catch a criminal, he continued “My name is Harris, by the way. I’ll need a description of the man.” “Hmm…” Mike said. “Maybe Ditto can help you with that somehow.” Turning to the Ditto, he looked at it with a questioning gaze. All smiles, the Ditto transformed into a Smeargle, swiftly painting a portrait of the thief on the ground. Harris sent out a Venonat and ordered it to track down the boy.<br />
<br />
Wondering how a Venonat could find a man just by looking at his picture, Mike, Klaus, and Scorpio followed the duo across Salin City. Eventually, they came to the edge of the city, a rather seedy-looking neighborhood. A large abandoned warehouse stood before them. Opening the door a crack, everyone peered inside. The boy and a red-haired woman in a Team Rocket uniform stood inside. “The warehouse.” Mike said under his breath. “It’s always the warehouse with Team Rocket.” Sending out his 2 other Pokémon, Pear the Bellsprout and Gek the Krabby, he began to dole out orders. “Okay, Klaus, I need you to slip in there. Your objectives are to get information about Orion and where he is through eavesdropping. Above all, stay hidden and find Orion and bring him back if you can. If anyone sees you, <b>Thunderbolt</b> something that looks important to make a distraction and scurry out. We’ll rush in, Gek using <b>Firestream</b> and <b>Ice Beam</b> and Scorpio using <b>Wing Attack</b> and <b>Metal Claw</b> to cause havoc on the warehouse while you and Pear search for Orion.” <i>”{Sure, Commander.}”</i> Klaus said through his connection to Mike’s mind, using the arcane black gem hanging from his neck. <i>”{Got a pen so I can write that down?}”</i> Watching to make sure he didn’t think out loud, he replied <i>”{Ha, ha. Now move out.}”</i> Klaus nodded and slipped into the darkness of the warehouse. Turning toward Harris, he said “Harris, you can do whatever you think would be appropriate for this situation. I just need you to help, and thanks for what you’ve done already.”</span></span></div>

You are slightly depressed by finding out that you have been cursed, but you now have better chances of defeating the Gyarados which lifts your spirits. You immediately set out to your work. You yell out insults to the large water beast that causes it to turn around with anger in its eyes. It roars at you with the wrath of such intensity that the man shudders next to you. Torchlight dashes forward in his sleeker, faster Quilava form. He quickly dashes in and hits the Water Pokémon before it can do anything then spins around and hits it again. Volante flies up with powerful wingbeats with its new form. She flaps her wing with all of her power to send a <b>gust</b> of air into the sea monster’s face. The Gyarados rears backwards and throws itself at Volante, trying to <b>bite</b> her. Volante flies up higher than the sea beast can reach, however. Ambipom runs behind the Gyarados and uses both of its tail hands to <b>tickle</b> the monster. The big blue sea snake writhes with laughter as the purple monkey tickles it.(That was an odd sentence &gt;&gt;) With this distraction, Volante kicks up a cloud of sand into the Gyarados’s eyes. The foreign material causes the beast to be slightly blinded. Volante then <b>Quick Attack</b>es the monster to hit it again. The Gyarados tries a <b>Hyper Beam</b> but its lack of sight causes the beam to go off into the air. The beast uses some of its water from its water gun or some similar attack to wash the sand from its eyes. Now seeing its foes, the Gyarados <b>thrash</b>es the three Pokémon attack it. All three are hit once, with Volante hit a second time, but Torchlight creates a <b>smokescreen</b> to hide the trio. Ambipom jumps out of the smoke and use all of its <b>fury</b> to repeatedly <b>swipe</b> its claws across the Gyarados’s face. Volante has used little energy but her health is down an eighth. Torchlight and Ambipom haven’t used much energy either, their health is only down a sixteenth. The Gyarados is at about half health and energy.<br />

No healing materials, nothing to fight with, all because she thought it was a dream. It brought back somenthing familiar... A man shouting at a woman, the ground quaking, the smell of something burning... &quot;Woman, what did you dream of in the presence of the rocks!?&quot; &quot;I dreamt... of meteorites, hitting the sky... one of them fell... and crushed me. And that's when I woke up.&quot; &quot;...oh my God... No... It happened...&quot; Well, now for a strategy. The group were at their best when the Gyarados was unable to attack them, instead focusing on getting whatever it was out of its eyes. So, a defense-heavy strategy was necessary. &quot;Torchlight, give us three rounds of Smokescreen! Volante, three rounds of Sand Attack. Aipom, three rounds of Fury swipes!

“<i>Dead? DEAD?! I didn’t mean to kill I just wanted to find my Illumise. I love her so. She means the world to me! It’s not for the sex! It’s my commitment to her to show her I love so! We’ll have our delightful babies that she’ll raise in my remembrance! This is the one night of the year that the Volbeats and Illumises mate, I’ll be dead by the next one anyone!</i>” Volbeat shouts back to Rocky. Relief washes over his face as he sees you wake up. “<i>There see he’s not dead!</i>” <br />
<br />
You agree to continue to help Volbeat find his lover which causes his eyes to light up with delight. He turns to Rock and explains the situation better since he can directly communicate with her, “<i>We were in the Spearow territory when the Spearows attacked us. I told Illumise to go back to the Tree while I fought them off. I finally managed to defeat the Spearow and came back but she was no where to be found. I think some of the Pokémon in the forest took her for a meal or something. The Silver Forest is divided into four different territories. The first is the Spearows’ territory, you’ve already been there. Then the spiders where you’ve been as well. Next is the hive where Combees dominate. Beedrill, Kakuna, Weedle, and Vespiquen are also quite common there. Finally is the area where the carnivorous plants live. Other than that the only other place she could even possibly be is up north of the hive where some birds nest. It’s not too likely she’ll be with the birds, but I haven’t looked there yet. Since we’ve already looked through the spiders’ place, we know she’s not there. Which area should we look in?</i>” The three of you make your way to a crossroads by the large tree in the clearing. There are three different ways you can follow; straight will lead you back to the Spearow’s territory, to your left will bring into the Combee hive, and your right holds the Victreebels and Carnvines and other carnivorous plants of the forest. <br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">Okay, Psycho, do me some good here, if you may.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: green">“<i>Jeez you’re dumb,</i>” Rocky said, narrowing her eyes at the volbeat who insisted on shouting out everything he said. His robotic information made the seedot cringe a little bit. The thought of an insect displaying love for something didn’t seem to make as much sense as an insect who wanted to flex his pedipalps for the carnal sake of reproduction.<br />
<br />
Paul on the other hand was confused. All he had heard this whole time was a series of squeaking and buzzing, and he was extremely afraid that Rocky might try something impulsive and violent that would make this forest adventure more hellish than it already was.<br />
<br />
In a way he was right, but the little acorn did her best to think hard and choose a path that wasn’t as likely to get herself or her trainer killed or maimed. She looked up at him, he looked down at her and saw her shaking her head with a rather sad air before she kicked him and nudged him over to the crossroad on the right. She figured that Paul wasn’t stupid enough to fall into the cellulose jaws of a static plant, and that she wasn’t either, since drinking other plants’ nectar wasn’t exactly her idea of a fun time. It did come across to her that going through an area full of enticing plants might actually cause the demise of her newfound idiot beetle friend, but somehow this failed to bother her.<br />
<br />
“<i>Okay, stupid dick,</i>” Rocky squeaked as she followed a worried Paul down the path, “<i>we’re gonna go this way. If you get you’re head caught in a bellsprout I’m not gonna fuckin’ help you out.</i>”</span></span></div>

You follow the path that Rocky points out, and follow it for a few hours. the whole path Volbeat doing things with his hand that looked funny from behind but you couldn't tell exactly what he was doing. &quot;<i>AHHHHH, once I have her tight the fun will begin, and I will never let go!</i>&quot; After a long walk and nightfall you reach a lake surrounded by lights, which you could tell were Illumise and Volbeat, slow dancing the night away. They were all like this, except for one... an Illumise! The very sexual male pokemon flies forward towards her and embraces her tightly. &quot;<i>How I missed you!!</i>&quot; You watch as the loving pokemon spin in circles in the air for what seems like hours. Then you hear a loud hoot from the distance... the forest birds were signaling midnight. That's were everything went freaky. The Illumise began eating the lovestruck Volbeats' heads! The male pokemon are surprised at their counterparts' and don't react at all, they just have their faces munched off by their cannibalistic partners.<br />
<br />
However one does react, the one you'd escorted here! It must not have been in as deep a trance as the others and had fluttered behind you. The partner Illumise rushes after him and stops in front of you. She, along with two other friends of hers who had eaten their partners chased after him, they didn't look happy. You could get out of the way, but you aren't that messed up right? </span></span><br />

You plan out you strategy and your pokemon, and Ambipom, set to work. Torchlight set to work and surrounded the air in a screen of smoke covering itself, Volante and Ambipom. The pokemon take advantage of said cover and begin what is known as a fit of violence. The bird pokemon flew in the air and started flinging sand at the Gyarados. Only that sand was full of rocks, making it a painful Attack. The sea snake pokemon takes all the rocks to the face, it's vision blocked. That is when Ambipom took its opportunity, jumping in the air and furiously swiping the face of the mutated fish. That is the last straw and the mighty opponent falls on it's back fainted, or worse. <b>Level up for Torchlight. Level up for Volante!</b> You rejoice at the thought of winning the battle until someone taps your shoulder. It was the elder who had said you were cursed. &quot;This pokemon brought destruction to our village, and now we will feast on it! You have brought some hope to us, however, back to the matter at hands...&quot;<br />
<br />
You expect him to say something about you being the main guest but are shocked to hear what he has to say. &quot;You are bad luck, and all who obey you are contaminated, the Ambipom is such a Pokemon. Not only is it that but it is also something created by your twisted mind. You should capture it, or release it, far away.&quot; You look at the man who brings more grim news.&quot;However, you will have to do it with your normal pokemon.&quot; He says as your pokemon return to their normal forms, along with Aipom. &quot;Take care of it!&quot; He yells at you loudly as he points at the purple monkey.<br />

</i>The ghost Spinda thinks over what it should do, then it speaks. &quot;FFFFFFIIIIIIINNNNNEEEEEEEE!&quot;<br />
You happily accept victory and access the next room. Where Purple and Polkadot are waiting. <br />
<br />
&quot;What happened back there?&quot; Polkadot asks. You explain the situation to her and her jaw drops! &quot;You didn't see anything alse in that diary did you?&quot; You shake your head and she smiles until she turns around and shrieks! There was a dead man's ghost in the back of the room. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have hunted for you Alina! You are the key to the escape of the ghouls and demons trapped in this house.... and you fell for the trap layed out by those pathetic souls!&quot; he says as he looks at you, then pointing to Purple and Polkadot. You turn around to face the ghostly siblings. They were looking at you before muttering simultaneously &quot;We're sorry... we had to, he has our father, that's why we are tethered to the mortal world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up you two!&quot; The man turns to you before turning into a... Ghastly? &quot;You will not see your father until you give me a human sacrifice... KILL HER!&quot; He orders the siblings, who sorrowfully look at you, turning themselves into Ghastly as well. &quot;We are sorry...&quot; They rush at you, and Parabola prepares for the attack.</span></span><br />

</i>You are worried as to who you could trust. You had doubts as to what they were telling you about themselves being good was true, but you decide to give them the benifit of the doubt. You ask what you need to bring and watch intently as they give you the details.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have just about everything we need, except for one ingredient, and obtaining it will be the hardest thing you might ever have to do. &quot; Nightfall begins.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will have to go to the Thunder Fields, which are about an hour walking distance from here. You will need to find the rarest plant in all of Cascadia, in fact maybe the world: A Ueplasim Tree.&quot; Cryssi continues.<br />
<br />
She then proceeds to showing you a picture of a strange plant, shaped like a pine tree, but taller, in fact you see a little speck at the bottom of the picture, which you then realise is a person! You look closer, it was Alice. Stunned at the size of the tree in comparison you look up and Alice begins to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was when we first arrived here, that tree is what anchors us to this world, if it were to be destroyed we would disappear back to Elysia, where we would die. In that tree lies a fruit, but not just any fruit, a fruit that can send Gabriel back to Aisyle, we need you to recover it.&quot; She looks at you as to make sure you understand. &quot;But it is a dangerous thing to ask of you because the tree grows in an area where there are always thunderstorms. You don't have to go, but if you do I will come to help.&quot; She points to the air causing a light bulb to explode. &quot;What do you say?&quot;</span></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'"><br />

As you come up with your plan your pokemon nod, telling you that they are willing to follow those orders. Klaus enters through the walls and hides in a corner with shadows, and he begins listening. You then feel his thoughts transfering to you. {You better get in here quick, they have Orion deeper in the warehouse, and they are using him as a power source for a 'Secret Project.'} You have little time to react when you hear Klaus knock something over. &quot;Who's there!?&quot; the young man screams at the world. &quot;Show yourse-&quot; he falls sideways in pain as the inpact of Klaus' Thunderbolt knocks him out, paralyzed. The woman reacts and throws out a pokeball, out of which materializes a rocky beast: A Geodude. &quot;This is too important to let them have. EXPLOSION!&quot; The rock pokemon is quick to react and explodes itself, shattering into thousands of little pieces, killing itself in the process. Shrapnill (Sp?) flies in your direction and your life begins to flash in front of your eyes...<br />
<br />
Suddenly a pokemon jumps in front of you. You look up to see a four-armed buff pokemon in front of you with all four arms blocking everything in front of him. &quot;You think that I am not trained?&quot; You look sideways into the face of Harris who is holding a pokeball in his right hand. Your see the warehouse's structure, the bare steel and some machines were still intact, but everything alse was ruined. Your pokemon were okay behind you and Klaus was nowhere to be seen. The Machamp on the other hand, seemed to be in pain. &quot;I have to leave, not only does Machamp need medical attention but she,&quot; He points at the redheaded girl, who is being crushed by a rock, &quot;seems to be in critical condition.&quot; He removes the rock and picks up the girl on his back. &quot;I will come to help later.&quot; You look anxious as he leaves, when you see an imp with jewels for eyes. It is pointing at a hidden tunnel under some rocks. {He's down there.} Klaus found it!<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not going anywhere!&quot; the boy appears behind you, and he's not happy. &quot;You ruined our plans to find it. As a Team Rocket Grunt I always put the mission in front of me.&quot; He tosses a ball in the air. &quot;Houndoom, Front and center!&quot; The hellhound appears in front of him and roars a mighty roar of mightyness. Looks like you need to fight before you will find your beloved Orion.</span></span></span></div>

Slipping through the warehouse's wall in a very awesome way, Klaus balled up in a dark corner, beginning to listen. He frowned and then used telepathy to communicate with Mike. <i>&quot;{You should get in here quick. They say they're using Orion as a power source for some sort of &quot;Secret Project&quot; crapola. Why couldn't they just say what it is already? Oh, and he should be somewhere deeper in the warehouse.}&quot;</i> Mike then heard something fall over, Klaus immediately thinking <i>&quot;{Crap! I knocked over a box!}&quot;</i> Without any time to do anything but sneak in, the motley crew made up of Mike, Harris, Scorpio, and the Ditto burst into the door for a startling sight. The boy, previously having yelled out at the noise Klaus had made, lay on the floor unconscious, struck by a Thunderbolt. The woman had released a Geodude and was apparently in full panic mode. Screeching that it (but what?) was too important for them to have, she commanded the Geodude to use Explosion. Instintcively, Mike ducked as the Geodude shattered into pieces of rock, flying everywhere. Thankfully, Harris released a Machamp at just the right time, blocking anything from hitting the group. Looking at the surroundings, Mike could see that nearly everything had been ripped to shreds by the shrapnel from the Geodude, who was currently in several hundred pieces. Unfortunately, Klaus was nowhere to be seen. Harris informed them that he had to leave to get medical care for the Machamp, in obvious pain, and the red-head, currently unconscious under a rock. Hoisting up the girl from underneath the rock, he walked out, the Machamp following. He said &quot;I'll come back later to help.&quot;, although Mike needed the guy now. A glinting jewel caught Mike's eye, and he looked toward a pile of rocks. &quot;Klaus!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;You aren't dead!&quot; <i>&quot;{Well, of course not, silly.}&quot;</i> Klaus remarked. <i>&quot;{The rocks passed right through me.}&quot;</i> Pointing at a deep passageway in the floor, he added <i>&quot;{Oh, and I found this. You're welcome.}&quot;</i> &quot;Sweet!&quot; Mike exclaimed. &quot;Now we can go get Orion!&quot; A voice suddenly said &quot;You're not going anywhere!&quot; Whipping around, he saw the boy, wearing a frown. Surprised, Mike remarked &quot;You sure regained consciousness quickly.&quot; The boy responded angrily &quot;You ruined our plans to find it. As a Team Rocket Grunt I always put the mission in front of me.&quot; Mike grinned and said &quot;Tough luck, bub, you shouldn't have kidnapped Orion. Crime never pays. Not to mention, 'Put the mission in front of me'? What is this, Zero Wing?&quot; Even angrier now, the boy released a Houndoom, which roared, all fired up to battle. &quot;Now, we begin,&quot; Mike said, releasing his Bellsprout and Krabby, Pear and Gek. &quot;Klaus, <b>Thunderbolt</b> from behind to knock out the boy again, then <b>Thunderbolt</b> the orderless Houndoom. Gek, <b>Surf</b> the Houndoom. Scorpio, <b>Cross Poison</b> it. Pear, <b>x2 Growths</b> then Vine Whip. Ditto, if you would transform into something strong and help us out, I'd appreciate that.&quot; </span></span></div>

You follow the path that Rocky points out, and follow it for a few hours. the whole path Volbeat doing things with his hand that looked funny from behind but you couldn't tell exactly what he was doing. &quot;<i>AHHHHH, once I have her tight the fun will begin, and I will never let go!</i>&quot; After a long walk and nightfall you reach a lake surrounded by lights, which you could tell were Illumise and Volbeat, slow dancing the night away. They were all like this, except for one... an Illumise! The very sexual male pokemon flies forward towards her and embraces her tightly. &quot;<i>How I missed you!!</i>&quot; You watch as the loving pokemon spin in circles in the air for what seems like hours. Then you hear a loud hoot from the distance... the forest birds were signaling midnight. That's were everything went freaky. The Illumise began eating the lovestruck Volbeats' heads! The male pokemon are surprised at their counterparts' and don't react at all, they just have their faces munched off by their cannibalistic partners.<br />
<br />
However one does react, the one you'd escorted here! It must not have been in as deep a trance as the others and had fluttered behind you. The partner Illumise rushes after him and stops in front of you. She, along with two other friends of hers who had eaten their partners chased after him, they didn't look happy. You could get out of the way, but you aren't that messed up right? </span></span>

<br />
<span style="color: green">As the idiot volbeat and his darling illumise danced with each other in the night sky along with all the other fireflies, Paul slumped to the ground as he realized that had he been lied to about any carnivorous monsters in the area, but more importantly had succeeded in helping out the firefly and the search for his cooch-fest.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, Rocky man, isn’t it great?” he asked, picking his seedot up from the ground and cuddling her. “Wow, we finally did it, and now we never gotta do anything like this again.” He began to laugh, and laughed for a while until he heard a sloppy crunching noise. It was a very peculiar noise, and Paul couldn’t help but associating it with salad. As his stomach grumbled, Rocky wriggled away from his arms and looked to see what was going on before running back to her trainer in a panic.<br />
<br />
Evidently the orgy that was scheduled for tonight took upon a slight sadomasochistic theme, as all of the volbeats were getting devoured by their lovelies. Finally realizing what was going on, Paul couldn’t help feeling a bit sick and watched as idiot volbeat friend buzzed past him in a panic to escape the hunger lust of his girlfriend. Somehow this didn’t sit well with Paul either.<br />
<br />
“Waaaait, wait wait wait,” he said, looking the volbeat in the eye, then looking at the illumise, and smiling. “Cooch fly, you’ve been waiting your whole life for this, man, you can’t back down now! See, I know the first time’s always scary, and kinda, well messy, and, uh, you see how it happened with me was…” Paul began to go on a tangent about his first time with a lady, much to Rocky’s (and probably everyone else’s) displeasure, before concluding with, “it was totally worth it, man!” He the snuck behind the volbeat and nudged him closer to his lady. “You’re in love with this gal, man. You just gotta show her you love her, it’s all alright.” He smiled and turned to the illumise and whispered to her, “be easy with him, ma’am, it’s his first time,” before picking up his seedot and grinning, with one thought on his mind.<br />

<div class="bbWrapper"><b>Fishy's Saving Throw! Update the First!</b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px">It's a bloody shame that Psycho's adventure has came to a crushing end IN FLAMES because a certain squirrel was shot dead by the veterinarians in a humanitarian manner, and so it is only natural that I swing in to make my saving throw.<br />
<br />
As for your query, let's just say some do and some don't. Sadly Carvanha is one of the latter.<br />
<span style="color: red"><b>The Lithogic River:</b> Please reply in red.<br />
<br />
<u>Lil' Psycho:</u> With the obvious scenario you are in, you realise exactly what the Sableye are planning to do with you, having witnessed it firsthand with the ex-Murkrow, the furious burning of the carcass still hissing through the cave. With the Sableye distracted by the sight of Murkrow's death, your obscene words fall on deaf ears as you look around and notice Digga', currently tied a smidgeon tight. Whispering your plan to him, he gives a nod that acknowledges it, before you communicate with your Beldum telepathically, sending the plans through the team. As you ready yourself, three of the Sableye, upon a nod from the king, turn to you as you give your orders and start to reach for your pokeballs.<br />
<br />
Digga' may be trussed up, but his large head is still active enough for him to strike the ground at an angle, causing the ground to crack and a few large <b>rock</b>s to <b>slide</b> upwards, the sudden attack taking one Sableye by surprise and causing him to tumble into the magma as he burns up like a candle and half the Sableye turn to the Ant Pit pokemon as you take the distraction to release your Beldum, Palladium, who wastes little time in <b>taking down</b> the ropes binding you, just as the Sableye grab Digga' and are preparing to chuck him into the liquid rock when he glows a sudden white, familiar to you as Slice did before, which is distraction enough as your Beldum releases Slice from his bonds and you back away from the lava stream, before watching with surprise as the stress of the situation causes the Trapinch to start evolving!<br />
<br />
With his back developing into a set of kitelike wings and his large head shrinking to a much more capable volume, the light fades as the Sableye realise they're holding something a good bit bigger as the newly evolved Vibrava gives a jovial buzz and flits over the magma, his frame easily displacing the ropes as he isn't so bulky, pulling an unfortunate Sableye towards it as the weight pulls him down and the sudden feeling of burnination forces the melting Sableye to release Digga' as all hell breaks loose.<br />
<br />
Another flash of light reveals your Shuppet Mortimer, who gets into action by unleashing a rather <b>ominous wind</b> at the Sableye who are currently trying to swarm you, as Slice gives a <b>false swipe</b> that releases Freeze and Thunderfuzz, as you instantly recall the Weavile just as a sharp sensation is felt in your arm as you jerk back, your arm having three long cuts from one Sableye's <b>scratch</b> attack as the king screeches and clambers backwards onto the wall, giving a few hisses in the Sableye tongue that would come out as 'Kill them all!'<br />
<br />
With the chaos ensuing, you release your Carvanha, Biak, only to sigh as it lands in a fishy heap as a Sableye grabs it, only to be released as a sudden blast of <b>dragonbreath</b> strikes the back of the Sableye, conveniently propelling the fish towards Magmortar as he <b>bite</b>s the rope, freeing the fire pokemon who sets to work on freeing her children with assistance from Biak, lifting the pokemon and snipping them free gradually.<br />
<br />
As you look around, you see nine Sableye, plus another eight, in two waves, as well as the king clinging to the walls as the first wave prepares to attack. Slice is the first to strike, as he charges a <b>shadow</b>y <b>ball</b> in his claws before throwing it at the Sableye, the orb bursting and knocking three of the first wave back, none into the lava however as two of the other Sableye counter with a <b>night shade</b> as the black bolts strike Slice in the chest as he grunts, fortunately resisting thanks in part to his steel typing. With the situation getting tense, the freed Magby start to give a <b>helping hand</b> as Magmortar lets loose a <b>flamethrower</b> at the wave, catching one Sableye dead-on and sending it stumbling backwards to the lava, only for it to grip the edge for dear life as it shakily gets back up. Digga' is next on the assault, unleashing another <b>rock slide</b> that scatters the Sableye and knocks the climbing ghost back as the scream indicates his failure to evade cremation.<br />
<br />
Biak can only watch as one Sableye crawls closer, his teeth dripping with black saliva before noticing the <b>shadow</b>below him too late as he is knocked back by the <b>sneak</b>y efforts of Mortimer, while Thunderfuzz adds to the mayhem with a <b>spark</b>, shocking two Sableye near him and paralyzing one of them as the ghosts rally together, preparing to strike back as you swear the king is staring hungrily at your arm.<br />
<br />
Of the first wave, one is paralyzed and one is slightly on the crispier side, while four of the Sableye are unharmed, while your team and the fire pokemon are free, but this is only the beginning of a fight for your life as Slice has taken a bit of a hit, and it seems to be Slice, Thunderfuzz, Palladium, Biak, Mortimer, Magmortar and the Magby against a small army of deranged goblin things intent on reducing you to ash.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span></div>

<br />
</i>The ghost Spinda thinks over what it should do, then it speaks. &quot;FFFFFFIIIIIIINNNNNEEEEEEEE!&quot;<br />
You happily accept victory and access the next room. Where Purple and Polkadot are waiting. <br />
<br />
&quot;What happened back there?&quot; Polkadot asks. You explain the situation to her and her jaw drops! &quot;You didn't see anything alse in that diary did you?&quot; You shake your head and she smiles until she turns around and shrieks! There was a dead man's ghost in the back of the room. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have hunted for you Alina! You are the key to the escape of the ghouls and demons trapped in this house.... and you fell for the trap layed out by those pathetic souls!&quot; he says as he looks at you, then pointing to Purple and Polkadot. You turn around to face the ghostly siblings. They were looking at you before muttering simultaneously &quot;We're sorry... we had to, he has our father, that's why we are tethered to the mortal world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up you two!&quot; The man turns to you before turning into a... Ghastly? &quot;You will not see your father until you give me a human sacrifice... KILL HER!&quot; He orders the siblings, who sorrowfully look at you, turning themselves into Ghastly as well. &quot;We are sorry...&quot; They rush at you, and Parabola prepares for the attack.</span></span>

<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">Why thank you, good sir, for the updates~ <br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorange">Alina stared at the Spinda with wide and fearful eyes, hands shaking with fright as she held the teddy bear tightly in her hands. The Spinda glared back at her, appearing to think things over for a moment, while Parabola spun around Alina, creating illusions of Combuskin clucking and running around in fright. Giving one last worried look at its teddy, the phantom abruptly said in its booming and ghostly voice, &quot;FFFFFIIIIIINNNEEEE!&quot; <br />
<br />
Despite the wave of relief that overcame Alina, she still held that stupid and terrified face, with the teddy bear thrust in front of her as a shield. She stumbled to the door and opened it, with the Spinda, Parabola, and an army of Combuskin illusions following close behind her as she retraced her steps back to the room she had met Polkadot in.<br />
<br />
As Alina entered the room, she was surprised to see Purple in there as well. She gave a confused wave to Purple as she handed the teddy bear back to its true owner.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened back there?&quot; Polkadot asks. Alina gave a brief and exaggerated summary of her fight and how brave and intelligent she was back there. The illusions of the chicken-like Pokemon continued to run around in a frenzy as Alina told her story. Polkadot's jaw dropped as she asked, &quot;You didn't see anything else in that diary did you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, no, I was in a hurry,&quot; answered Alina, trying to look completely innocent. I mean, seriously, how can one blackmail a dead girl? Polkadot smiled in relief, then turned and gave a shriek. Another ghost was in the back of the room, this time in the form of a man. He glared at Alina as he said &quot;I have hunted for you Alina! You are the key to the escape of the ghouls and demons trapped in this house.... and you fell for the trap layed out by those pathetic souls!&quot;<br />
<br />
At this point Alina was more annoyed then scared, and to have the main source of the problem pop up almost made the girl cry tears of joy. No more horrors to go through. Wait, pathetic souls? Alina turned around to face the two siblings, confused as to what he was talking about. &quot;A trap..?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're sorry... we had to, he has our father, that's why we are tethered to the mortal world,&quot; muttered the two siblings. Alina glared back at them, feeling betrayed and stupid for trusting anything in this house. However, if Alina was in the position, she was sure she would do the same thing for her family, friends, or Pokemon...<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up you two!&quot; Alina turned around again to face the real menace, only to find a Gastly in its place. Rather then anger, the young trainer's eyes glowed brightly with want. A Gastly... what a pretty little addition to her team! She was brought back to reality as the Ghastly ordered, &quot;You will not see your father until you give me a human sacrifice... KILL HER!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Human sacrifice?&quot; Alina turned around yet again to face the children, who had also turned themselves into Gastly. &quot;We are sorry...&quot; they said as they rushed at her. The games were over, now, and the illusions of the clucking Combuskin disappeared instantly. Parabola was preparing a Psybeam as Alina instinctively released her Abra, Prestige. &quot;Prestige, <b>Barrier!</b>&quot; Alina ordered before Prestige had a chance to analyze his surroundings. &quot;Parabola, <b>Harden</b>!&quot;<br />
<br />
Parabola quickly change his attack to a Harden, spinning around once to give Alina a &quot;what the hell?&quot; look. Alina ignored the Baltoy and gazed up at the two Gastly before her. &quot;Come on guys,&quot; she began. &quot;I really don't want to do this and neither do you. I can get rid of that other evil spirit, and no harm will be done to any of us... except that guy, of course.&quot; She pointed to the evil Gastly behind her as she said this, then she grumbled to herself as she glared back at the spirit who had plagued this family for so long. &quot;I'll give you 10,000 horrors...&quot;<br />
<br />
Returning her attention back to the siblings, she then said &quot;So please, just leave this to me and Prestige here. It'll be over soon. No human sacrifices needed...&quot;<br />
<br />
Alina glanced down at her two Pokemon and mumbled just loudly enough so they could hear. &quot;If... things don't go well,&quot; she began, rather hesitantly. &quot;Prestige, use <b>Thunder Wave</b> on the Gastly to the left and another <b>Thunder Wave</b> on the Gastly to the right. Parabola, use a <b>Confusion</b> on the Gastly on the left, and a <b>Psybeam</b> to the one on the right.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;What if things do go well, and they cease their attack?&quot;</i> mumbled a childlike voice within Alina's head. Prestige was known to speak using telepathy, making him one of Alina's favorite companions to have as she traveled the world. Well, when he was awake...<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... direct your attacks to that evil Gastly, then. Even though it would be two against one... I say he deserves the overkill. Prestige, change the second Thunder Wave to a <b>Shadow Ball</b>.&quot; she replied. <br />
<br />
Alina truly didn't want to hurt the siblings. Really, they did help her escape certain death... or... was that all part of the plan. She put aside her paranoia, however, and waited for the two sibling's answers. Parabola and Prestige stood ready to execute their attacks, no matter what the result was.</span><br />
<br />
Okay, dude. Like, if this is too confusing just give me a PM and I'll fix/try to explain my little idea, because I know I've done it in a retarded way. :|</span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px">It's a bloody shame that Psycho's adventure has came to a crushing end IN FLAMES because a certain squirrel was shot dead by the veterinarians in a humanitarian manner, and so it is only natural that I swing in to make my saving throw.<br />
<br />
As for your query, let's just say some do and some don't. Sadly Carvanha is one of the latter.<br />
<span style="color: red"><b>The Lithogic River:</b> Please reply in red.<br />
<br />
<u>Lil' Psycho:</u> With the obvious scenario you are in, you realise exactly what the Sableye are planning to do with you, having witnessed it firsthand with the ex-Murkrow, the furious burning of the carcass still hissing through the cave. With the Sableye distracted by the sight of Murkrow's death, your obscene words fall on deaf ears as you look around and notice Digga', currently tied a smidgeon tight. Whispering your plan to him, he gives a nod that acknowledges it, before you communicate with your Beldum telepathically, sending the plans through the team. As you ready yourself, three of the Sableye, upon a nod from the king, turn to you as you give your orders and start to reach for your pokeballs.<br />
<br />
Digga' may be trussed up, but his large head is still active enough for him to strike the ground at an angle, causing the ground to crack and a few large <b>rock</b>s to <b>slide</b> upwards, the sudden attack taking one Sableye by surprise and causing him to tumble into the magma as he burns up like a candle and half the Sableye turn to the Ant Pit pokemon as you take the distraction to release your Beldum, Palladium, who wastes little time in <b>taking down</b> the ropes binding you, just as the Sableye grab Digga' and are preparing to chuck him into the liquid rock when he glows a sudden white, familiar to you as Slice did before, which is distraction enough as your Beldum releases Slice from his bonds and you back away from the lava stream, before watching with surprise as the stress of the situation causes the Trapinch to start evolving!<br />
<br />
With his back developing into a set of kitelike wings and his large head shrinking to a much more capable volume, the light fades as the Sableye realise they're holding something a good bit bigger as the newly evolved Vibrava gives a jovial buzz and flits over the magma, his frame easily displacing the ropes as he isn't so bulky, pulling an unfortunate Sableye towards it as the weight pulls him down and the sudden feeling of burnination forces the melting Sableye to release Digga' as all hell breaks loose.<br />
<br />
Another flash of light reveals your Shuppet Mortimer, who gets into action by unleashing a rather <b>ominous wind</b> at the Sableye who are currently trying to swarm you, as Slice gives a <b>false swipe</b> that releases Freeze and Thunderfuzz, as you instantly recall the Weavile just as a sharp sensation is felt in your arm as you jerk back, your arm having three long cuts from one Sableye's <b>scratch</b> attack as the king screeches and clambers backwards onto the wall, giving a few hisses in the Sableye tongue that would come out as 'Kill them all!'<br />
<br />
With the chaos ensuing, you release your Carvanha, Biak, only to sigh as it lands in a fishy heap as a Sableye grabs it, only to be released as a sudden blast of <b>dragonbreath</b> strikes the back of the Sableye, conveniently propelling the fish towards Magmortar as he <b>bite</b>s the rope, freeing the fire pokemon who sets to work on freeing her children with assistance from Biak, lifting the pokemon and snipping them free gradually.<br />
<br />
As you look around, you see nine Sableye, plus another eight, in two waves, as well as the king clinging to the walls as the first wave prepares to attack. Slice is the first to strike, as he charges a <b>shadow</b>y <b>ball</b> in his claws before throwing it at the Sableye, the orb bursting and knocking three of the first wave back, none into the lava however as two of the other Sableye counter with a <b>night shade</b> as the black bolts strike Slice in the chest as he grunts, fortunately resisting thanks in part to his steel typing. With the situation getting tense, the freed Magby start to give a <b>helping hand</b> as Magmortar lets loose a <b>flamethrower</b> at the wave, catching one Sableye dead-on and sending it stumbling backwards to the lava, only for it to grip the edge for dear life as it shakily gets back up. Digga' is next on the assault, unleashing another <b>rock slide</b> that scatters the Sableye and knocks the climbing ghost back as the scream indicates his failure to evade cremation.<br />
<br />
Biak can only watch as one Sableye crawls closer, his teeth dripping with black saliva before noticing the <b>shadow</b>below him too late as he is knocked back by the <b>sneak</b>y efforts of Mortimer, while Thunderfuzz adds to the mayhem with a <b>spark</b>, shocking two Sableye near him and paralyzing one of them as the ghosts rally together, preparing to strike back as you swear the king is staring hungrily at your arm.<br />
<br />
Of the first wave, one is paralyzed and one is slightly on the crispier side, while four of the Sableye are unharmed, while your team and the fire pokemon are free, but this is only the beginning of a fight for your life as Slice has taken a bit of a hit, and it seems to be Slice, Thunderfuzz, Palladium, Biak, Mortimer, Magmortar and the Magby against a small army of deranged goblin things intent on reducing you to ash.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">Just pointing out Digga's femeninety. <br />
<span style="color: Red">Tyson weighed his options now that he was out he had a little more comprehension of his odds. Right off the bat he could tell that without help his pokemon couldn't get anywhere. He had Palladium, who couldn't hit anything without the help of a foresight, which only Weavile could do. &quot;Shit, I gotta come up with a plan!&quot; He looked at the pokemon currently on the field, Thumderfuzz, Mortimer, Slice, Digga', Palladium and Biak. Biak couldn't do anything without water to help her. The there were the Magbies and Magmortar who he had to make sure he didn't hurt along the way. He had another pokemon and he decided it was as good a time as ever to break him in. He grabbed two pokeballs one that housed his other pokemon and the one that housed Palladium. &quot;Palladium return,&quot; Palladium was shocked but then he realised his uselessness in this battle, &quot;Squirtle, come on out!&quot; He aimed one pokeball at the ground and one at Palladium as red beam changed the two pokeball. Squirtle came out for the first time in his time with Tyson. He didn't even have a nickname yet. &quot;Look guys theres nine of us and 18 of them, they have us outnumbered 2 to1. We have to fight our hardest or pay the price.&quot; They all nodded, &quot;So we will fight until there are none left. TAKE NO PRISONERS!&quot;He yelled, then began with his plan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mortimer, Slice you two start off. You guys <b>both</b> know <b>Ominous Wind </b>so start with that, Push as many as possible into the lava. We need to get rid of as many as possible, taking them out one by one will take too long, and you do not want to be in a volcano too long. Thunderfuzz, Digga' while they push with their wind you will unsteady their footing with your fire attacks, Thunderfuzz's <b>Flamethrower</b> and Digga's <b>Fire Stream</b>.&quot; He looked at the Magbies and Magmortar, &quot;If you guys could please help with your hands or Fire attacks we'd all be thankful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He looked at his water pokemon, a turtle standing comfused as to what he should do and a fish flopping all over the place. &quot; You guys are next, I want you both to try to create A source of water big enough for you to bothSurf </span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Red">in with however much water you can create within yourselves. Then use it to <b>surf</b> at the Sableye in a conjoined attack, <b>Two times each</b>! Avoid the Mag-family at all costs though.&quot; He looked at the fire pokemon, and began &quot;Try to stay out of the way of the water attack, last thing we want are a bunch of injured friends.&quot; He thought up the next part of his plan, as he had four pokemon that could attack next. &quot;Thunderfuzz when they are all wet send a <b>Spark</b> across 'em, but don't step on the water like last time.&quot; He remembered the last attempt made at this, and its miserable failure. &quot;While she does that uneven their footing by sending <b>Stone edge</b> flying all across their ground, Digga'.&quot; They nodded. <br />
<br />
He thought of things that Slice and Mortimer should do, the wind strategy wouldn't be able to be done with the other pokemon trying to attack as they might get sent into the lava themselves, and Slice couldn't use earthquake as there were way too many pokemon on the field, he could injure his own squad or cause the magma to enclose around them. &quot;Slice use <b>Shadow Ball</b>, If you can help him Thunderfuzz, do it, but we can't be using up too much energy at once. Mortimer, try to use an<b> Icy wind</b> in here, in this heat it will all probably melt into water, and if you can create water you will help Squirtle and Biak very much.&quot; he kept them all using two attacks, if this battle drew for too long they might end up in serious trouble with no energy.<br />
<br />
&quot;LET'S GO GUYS!&quot;<br />
<br />
</span>-If there are too many attacks PM me and I will fix it. Thanks Fishy!</span></div>

You plan out you strategy and your pokemon, and Ambipom, set to work. Torchlight set to work and surrounded the air in a screen of smoke covering itself, Volante and Ambipom. The pokemon take advantage of said cover and begin what is known as a fit of violence. The bird pokemon flew in the air and started flinging sand at the Gyarados. Only that sand was full of rocks, making it a painful Attack. The sea snake pokemon takes all the rocks to the face, it's vision blocked. That is when Ambipom took its opportunity, jumping in the air and furiously swiping the face of the mutated fish. That is the last straw and the mighty opponent falls on it's back fainted, or worse. <b>Level up for Torchlight. Level up for Volante!</b> You rejoice at the thought of winning the battle until someone taps your shoulder. It was the elder who had said you were cursed. &quot;This pokemon brought destruction to our village, and now we will feast on it! You have brought some hope to us, however, back to the matter at hands...&quot;<br />
<br />
You expect him to say something about you being the main guest but are shocked to hear what he has to say. &quot;You are bad luck, and all who obey you are contaminated, the Ambipom is such a Pokemon. Not only is it that but it is also something created by your twisted mind. You should capture it, or release it, far away.&quot; You look at the man who brings more grim news.&quot;However, you will have to do it with your normal pokemon.&quot; He says as your pokemon return to their normal forms, along with Aipom. &quot;Take care of it!&quot; He yells at you loudly as he points at the purple monkey.<br />
