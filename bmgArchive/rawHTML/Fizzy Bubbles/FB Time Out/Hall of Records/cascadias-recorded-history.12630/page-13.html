<i>Careful, remember that controlling NPC’s (i.e. the Magbies) is self-updating. It’s not too big of a deal here, but with the personality I had in mind for the Magbies, they would happily help you when you first asked them rather than have to ponder the choice for a while. Like I said it’s not –that- big of a deal right now, just be sure to avoid self-updating in the future. Also Icy Wind is just cold air, it doesn’t have actual ice in it.</i><span style="color: red"><br />
<br />
You ask the Magbies to help you and they immediately agree to <b>help</b>. They light up their <b>hand</b>s and shoot sparks from them to boost your Pokémon’s attacks. Delighted with the help, you give your Pokémon their orders. Slice is still mostly frozen, so he can’t vibrate his wings to produce the <b>Bug Buzz</b>. Freeze inhales a lagre amount of air then blows it back out at the Weavile. As he does so, Slice and the frozen Sableye free themselves from their icy prison. Slice flies over to Freeze’s side as the Weavile releases the <b>Icy Wind</b>. Slice’s blade-arm’s glow white and he shoots crescent blades of wind into the gust of cold air. The cold air of the Icy Wind is nearly immediately warmed up by the heat of the volcano. The Razor Wind attack, however, hits both Sableyes. Right after the attack hits, the paralyzed Sableye begins to move once again. The Sableye shoots beams of <b>Night Shade</b> at your Pokémon. The attack hits Freeze, but Slice swiftly dodges the attack. Freeze charges his fist with <b>Ice</b>-type energy and <b>punch</b>es one of the Sableye. It freezes part of the Sableye, but the ice quickly melts away. The Sableye <b>swipe</b>s with its claws with all of its <b>fury</b>. Its claws rake across Freeze in several places across his body causing blood to ooze from the wounds. Freeze turns back and knocks the Sableye as hard as he can to the ground. The Sableye lies on the ground knocked out. The last Sableye stands back warily after seeing what happened to the other Sableye. With only one Sableye remaining, Freeze has barely any energy left. His health is still about seven eighths, though. Slice has lost barely any health. His energy is at about seven eighths. The last Sableye is only going to take about two more good hits before it is knocked out as well. <br />

Bobcat and Seb give you strange looks as you shed tears for the spiders sake. Seb looks over his shoulder at the bite mark on his back and shoots you a look that seems to say ‘<i>The spiders have hurt someone</i>’. Never the less the two of them spring into action. Bobcat jumps onto the right Spinarak and <b>bite</b>s into it. She runs over to the left Spinarak and <b>scratch</b>es it. The two Spinarak are getting annoyed by the little Meowth. They shoot webs from their mouths. The <b>String Shot</b> ties up Bobcat. She struggles to free herself, but she’s stuck. Seb curls into a ball and begins rolling around, dodging the trees in the forest. He gathers speed and then collides with the Ariados. The large red spider flies through the air before slamming into a tree. Seb keeps <b>rolling out</b> and hits the two Spinaraks. Both spiders are squished by the rolling ball of Slowpoke. As Seb stops his attack, one of the Spinaraks shoots <b>poison</b>-tipped barbs that sting the Slowpoke.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Bobcat looks up at all three spiders from her sticky prison and releases psychic waves from her eyes which lull them to sleep. Sebastien sees the sleeping, large red Ariados and recalls his orders. He forms a small orb of blue icy energy at his mouth and beams fire from it and hit the Ariados. The <b>Ice Beam</b> freezes the spider solid. Bobcat is stuck in a very sticky situation(*shot*) being unable to move around because of the String Shot but has still used very little energy and no health. Seb has used a bit more energy this bringing his overall energy to about seven eighths. His health rests at about three quarters. Neither Spinarak has used much energy. Both them have their health sitting at a fourth and are snoozing soundly which, uninterrupted, they may do for another round or so. The Ariados’s health is about the same, but it has used an eighth of its energy.<br />

You agree to help Polkadot find her Spinda before Purple can push you to the hallway. You return Ignoues to his Pokéball to give him a well deserved rest. You decide that you will go through the middle door. “Okay, I’ll go left then,” Purple said as he and Flutters turn and head to the left door and walk through. You approach the middle door, turn the knob, and walk through. This room is apparently a bedroom. A bed is in one corner, a dresser in another, and a sofa in the middle. You cautiously walk into the middle of the room towards the sofa, where a dusty book sits. You grab it and blow a thick cloud of dust into the air. You open the first page of what appears to be some kind of diary. It reads, <br />
<br />
“<i>March 3 <br />
Dear Diary, <br />
I feel like someone is watching me. Wherever I am it feels like someone is staring at me. I can hear footsteps when I walk outside following me. I see mysterious shadows that vanish behind building whenever I turn a backwards glance. I’m starting to get really scared, but I don’t want to tell Purple. He won’t believe me. He’s been so cold lately. It’s like he’s not even in this world anymore. I don’t know what’s wrong with him. I’m not sure what to do.<br />
<br />
-Polkadot Teishuko</i>” <br />
<br />
Before you can read anything else, you hear the door shut behind you. You spin around to see that some sort of smoky haze lies in front of the door.<br />
<br />
“SUPWISE!” a voice yells as a giant Spinda head appears in your face, scaring you half to death. The giant disembodied Spinda head floats there with two giant disembodied Spinda hands at its control. Where you would expect a giant Spinda torso would be, is a cloud of black smoke. The Phantom Spinda doesn’t seem pleased with your presence in the room and grins angrily and maliciously at you. You stand shocked while Phantom Spinda points one of his disembodied paws towards the door and it vanishes, leaving you with no escape route.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span><br />

You decide to change your strategy to keep Torchlight using defense while Volante will keep attacking. You tell your Pokémon their orders against the large sea monster. Torchlight starts by spewing another <b>screen</b> of <b>smoke</b>. Volante uses this cover to fly forward and slam herself into Gyrados. Aipom also jumps forward and rakes its claws across the Gyrados’s eyes, <b>scratch</b>ing the Water-type. Gyrados angrily <b>thrash</b>es back in retaliation. Torchlight instinctively throws up another <b>Smokescreen</b> to hide them from the Gyrados’s wrath. The large Flying-type breaks its way through ship with its powerful attack. Volante, unaware of the Gyrados’s raging, flies forward to <b>Tackle</b> the beast again, but she is beat down by the Gyrados’s thrash. The Pidgey is slammed down against the deck. With the hole from the Hyper Beam now combined with the destruction from the Thrash, the ship begins to sink at an alarming rate. Torchlight spews one last <b>Smokescreen</b> to hide his teammate while she can recover. Aipom jumps up and <b>scratch</b>es the Gyrados again, trying to distract the monster while Volante can recover. Volante staggers to her feet and flies up and slams into the Gyrados once again. The Gyrados rears back and tries to <b>bite</b> the Pidgey, but he misses and takes the head off of one of the frozen crewmembers with its fangs. You look on disgustedly at the bloody torso left on the deck. The Gyrados grins maliciously and likes its bloody fangs. The Gyrados is down to about half of its health. Volante has taken a heavy blow that took over half of her health. The boat is sinking quite fast. The main deck is currently about three feet above the ocean.<br />

“No, it’s just over there,” Alicia points over to a part of the woods by the lake. She grabs you by the hand and leads over there into the woods. Tei begins to follow before going back and getting Seldon. The five of you travel through the woods for a few moments before coming to a clearing with a house. A lady in about her forty’s is standing on the porch sweeping it off with a broom. You could swear that the lady’s feet were off the ground and that she was just floating in midair.<br />
<br />
“Mum!” Alicia yells out. The lady immediately falls over before standing up again.<br />
<br />
“My word, you surprised me!” she says, “Hello, my name is Chrysanthemum, but you can call me Cryssi. I’m Alicia’s mom.” she greets you. “Alicia, maybe next time you should tell me before you bring a friend over,” Cryssi says through gritted teeth.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, Mum, Potato, here, saved Zoe from drowning, so I thought I should reward him with one of our pearls.” Alicia explains.<br />
<br />
“Come on in, you’ll have to excuse the mess,” Cryssi sighs. <br />
<br />
You and your Pokémon enter the house with Alicia and follow her into the living room. You sit on one of the couches in the center of the room. <br />
<br />
“Just wait here, I’ll be right back with that pearl,” she tells you before disappearing into one of the rooms. A few moments later, Cryssi enters the room with an Umbreon on her tail.<br />
<br />
“Would you like some refreshments?” Cryssi asks you as she sits a platter of vegetables and dips and a glass of lemonade. “So tell me about yourself, Potato.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, anything about you we should know?” another voice asks. You could swear that the Umbreon was the one who just spoke, but that would be crazy, right? Cryssi discreetly kicks the Dark-type while trying not to let you see. Something seems to be going on here that they don’t want you to know about…<br />

“Ha. You call it cheating to tell my Pokémon to attack your little whatever piece of crap you have over there,” the boy says as he points at Klaus. You yell out at Klaus trying to snap him out of confusion. “Ha! You think that that thing can <i>try</i> to hurt a fly? The fly would totally kill him! His mother’s so fat they had to enlarge the doors at the McDonald’s so she could get her order of seventeen Big Macs!” the boy laughs, “Okay, Kadabra, decimate him!” Kadabra forms a blade of Psychic energy and in its arms, but his arms are still paralyzed and nothing happens! Klaus doesn’t seem to respond to the insults and fires a bolt of electric energy wildly. The <b>Thunderbolt</b> flies off randomly into the sky and hits a tree causing it to split and fall. Several pedestrians scream and run from the falling timber. This attracts the attention of many more pedestrians who crowd around the ongoing battle. The boy shifts uneasily as he sees a police officer begin to walk over from the other side of the park to see what’s going on. Kadabra continues his attacks, however. Kadabra uses his psychic <b>kinesis</b> to cloud Klaus’s vision as the ghostie ignites his fist on fire and wildly swings it around. The Klaus manages to hit Kadabra slightly with his <b>Fire Punch</b>. The contact with the Psychic-type reminds Klaus what he’s doing and the Dark-type snaps out of confusion! Kadabra fires another <b>beam</b> of rainbow <b>psy</b>chic energy at Klaus. The Sableye tries to dodge the beam, but with his vision impaired by the Kinesis, he accidentally jumps right into the beam! Fortunately, the multicoloured beam doesn’t confuse Klaus! Klaus has lost about five eighths of his health and three eighths of his energy. The Kadabra has about three eighths of its healt left and has used just under five eighths of its energy.<br />

Kadabra fires another <b>beam</b> of rainbow <b>psy</b>chic energy at Klaus. The Sableye tries to dodge the beam, but with his vision impaired by the Kinesis, he accidentally jumps right into the beam! Fortunately, the multicoloured beam doesn’t confuse Klaus! Klaus has lost about five eighths of his health and three eighths of his energy. The Kadabra has lost about three eighths of its health and just under five eighths of its energy.<br />

OOC: Who's got the advantage in health/energy? Kind confused about that.<br />

Klaus had turned a shade of deep crimson that most interior decorators would kill to get their hands on, and Orion was close to passing out from the tension. Things weren't looking up, with the gap between him and the Kadabra closing up more and more each round. For all Mike knew, Klaus could be the one with the disadvantage now. Not to mention, that police officer was coming up and could break up the battle, ruining his chance to get both a Kadabra and a Ditto. He was going to have to turn this around quickly. &quot;Klaus!&quot; he shouted. &quot;Don't give up now! <b>Fire Punch</b> to his face, <b>Ice Punch</b> to his gut, then a big 'ol <b>Scratch</b> on his eyes to give him a taste of his own medicine!

You agree to help Polkadot find her Spinda before Purple can push you to the hallway. You return Ignoues to his Pokéball to give him a well deserved rest. You decide that you will go through the middle door. “Okay, I’ll go left then,” Purple said as he and Flutters turn and head to the left door and walk through. You approach the middle door, turn the knob, and walk through. This room is apparently a bedroom. A bed is in one corner, a dresser in another, and a sofa in the middle. You cautiously walk into the middle of the room towards the sofa, where a dusty book sits. You grab it and blow a thick cloud of dust into the air. You open the first page of what appears to be some kind of diary. It reads, <br />
<br />
“<i>March 3 <br />
Dear Diary, <br />
I feel like someone is watching me. Wherever I am it feels like someone is staring at me. I can hear footsteps when I walk outside following me. I see mysterious shadows that vanish behind building whenever I turn a backwards glance. I’m starting to get really scared, but I don’t want to tell Purple. He won’t believe me. He’s been so cold lately. It’s like he’s not even in this world anymore. I don’t know what’s wrong with him. I’m not sure what to do.<br />
<br />
-Polkadot Teishuko</i>” <br />
<br />
Before you can read anything else, you hear the door shut behind you. You spin around to see that some sort of smoky haze lies in front of the door.<br />
<br />
“SUPWISE!” a voice yells as a giant Spinda head appears in your face, scaring you half to death. The giant disembodied Spinda head floats there with two giant disembodied Spinda hands at its control. Where you would expect a giant Spinda torso would be, is a cloud of black smoke. The Phantom Spinda doesn’t seem pleased with your presence in the room and grins angrily and maliciously at you. You stand shocked while Phantom Spinda points one of his disembodied paws towards the door and it vanishes, leaving you with no escape route.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">&quot;Alright, I'll go left then,&quot; said Purple. As soon as he left Alina turned the knob and opened the door and went in, only to find a small little room complete with bed, couch, and dresser. On the couch she saw a small book, almost camouflaged into the couch due to the amount of dust on both it and the couch. She picked up the book and plopped down on the couch, causing dust to go everywhere. She read a passage somewhere in the middle of the book dated March 3 while coughing and sneezing. It told of a strange presence wherever she went... that was the evil spirit in this house or something else..? <br />
<br />
&quot;SUPWISE!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alina jumped up and slammed the book shut before she was able to read any more. A Spinda head was grinning in her face, huge and angry. It was supported by two disembodied paws and it had no body. The girl released one of her Pokemon out of a Pokeball and prayed it was her Aron...<br />
<br />
Alas, it was her Baltoy. It spun around while looking curiously at the floating head before them, then made a sound that was similar to what a child would make when sticking out their tongue. In response, the Spinda pointed to the door and made it vanish, crushing any hope of escape.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you've done it, Parabola,&quot; Alina snapped at her Baltoy. Parabola just tilted its head slightly and giggled. But suddenly Alina remembered that she was looking for a Spinda... could this be the one or just another cheap trick done by the evil spirit in this house?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, are you Polkadot's Spinda?&quot; she asked. &quot;She's been looking for you for a while now...&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl doubted that this Spinda was Polkadot's Pokemon. She mumbled just loud enough for her Baltoy to hear, saying, &quot;You got us into this and you're going to get us out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her Baltoy disagreed and made a &quot;Pff&quot; sound, while showing a small illusion of Alina walking into the room and reading the diary.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up! Now, if it attacks I want you to <b>Harden</b>, then use a <b>Psybeam</b>. Use a <b>Rock Tomb</b> afterward...&quot;</span></span></div>

Bobcat and Seb give you strange looks as you shed tears for the spiders sake. Seb looks over his shoulder at the bite mark on his back and shoots you a look that seems to say ‘<i>The spiders have hurt someone</i>’. Never the less the two of them spring into action. Bobcat jumps onto the right Spinarak and <b>bite</b>s into it. She runs over to the left Spinarak and <b>scratch</b>es it. The two Spinarak are getting annoyed by the little Meowth. They shoot webs from their mouths. The <b>String Shot</b> ties up Bobcat. She struggles to free herself, but she’s stuck. Seb curls into a ball and begins rolling around, dodging the trees in the forest. He gathers speed and then collides with the Ariados. The large red spider flies through the air before slamming into a tree. Seb keeps <b>rolling out</b> and hits the two Spinaraks. Both spiders are squished by the rolling ball of Slowpoke. As Seb stops his attack, one of the Spinaraks shoots <b>poison</b>-tipped barbs that sting the Slowpoke.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Bobcat looks up at all three spiders from her sticky prison and releases psychic waves from her eyes which lull them to sleep. Sebastien sees the sleeping, large red Ariados and recalls his orders. He forms a small orb of blue icy energy at his mouth and beams fire from it and hit the Ariados. The <b>Ice Beam</b> freezes the spider solid. Bobcat is stuck in a very sticky situation(*shot*) being unable to move around because of the String Shot but has still used very little energy and no health. Seb has used a bit more energy this bringing his overall energy to about seven eighths. His health rests at about three quarters. Neither Spinarak has used much energy. Both them have their health sitting at a fourth and are snoozing soundly which, uninterrupted, they may do for another round or so. The Ariados’s health is about the same, but it has used an eighth of its energy.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span><br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: green">Paul continued weeping. Even though he completely understood his predicament, the pain shown by the spiders simply made him sad. He slouched and looked at the silvery leaves on the ground before giving out another order two his pokémon.<br />
<br />
“Seb,” he groaned, lifting his head to look at his slowpoke. Sebastien was alright, of course, but began to tear up at the sorry sight of his trainer. “Seb, <b>curse</b> up, man. Get all solid and <b>roll out</b> over the ariados, okay? I don’t wanna watch this anymore.” His attention then turned to his meowth who was stuck in the long goopy strands. “And you, Bobcat, just… just get yourself outta there! You’ve got claws, you can do it, man, just <b>scratch</b> those up and do what you’ve been doing all this time, yeah?”<br />
<br />
What a dire situation this was, that the hippie was giving out orders as a mercy rule instead of a means to save himself. Of course, once the spiders had been subdued the situation would be win-win. The spiders would wake up confused but more or less alright, and Paul could continue on his quest to find that illusive illumise that had been forgotten about for the last few turns.<br />
<br />
“You! Beetle!” Paul snapped at the stationary volbeat that sat silent in the webbing beside him. “What are you doing to help me, man? Here I am telling my buddies to kill some bugs that never hurt anybody, and you’re just sitting here like a little pussy. You were probably right the first time, man, your girl was probably with those birds back there, man, and if you weren’t such a little dick we would’ve been okay and this wouldn’t be happening, man!”<br />
<br />
The thought of this made him cry again, and he started to weep louder when his leg began to cramp up. So it goes.</span></span></span></div>

<i>Careful, remember that controlling NPC’s (i.e. the Magbies) is self-updating. It’s not too big of a deal here, but with the personality I had in mind for the Magbies, they would happily help you when you first asked them rather than have to ponder the choice for a while. Like I said it’s not –that- big of a deal right now, just be sure to avoid self-updating in the future. Also Icy Wind is just cold air, it doesn’t have actual ice in it.</i><span style="color: red"><br />
<br />
You ask the Magbies to help you and they immediately agree to <b>help</b>. They light up their <b>hand</b>s and shoot sparks from them to boost your Pokémon’s attacks. Delighted with the help, you give your Pokémon their orders. Slice is still mostly frozen, so he can’t vibrate his wings to produce the <b>Bug Buzz</b>. Freeze inhales a lagre amount of air then blows it back out at the Weavile. As he does so, Slice and the frozen Sableye free themselves from their icy prison. Slice flies over to Freeze’s side as the Weavile releases the <b>Icy Wind</b>. Slice’s blade-arm’s glow white and he shoots crescent blades of wind into the gust of cold air. The cold air of the Icy Wind is nearly immediately warmed up by the heat of the volcano. The Razor Wind attack, however, hits both Sableyes. Right after the attack hits, the paralyzed Sableye begins to move once again. The Sableye shoots beams of <b>Night Shade</b> at your Pokémon. The attack hits Freeze, but Slice swiftly dodges the attack. Freeze charges his fist with <b>Ice</b>-type energy and <b>punch</b>es one of the Sableye. It freezes part of the Sableye, but the ice quickly melts away. The Sableye <b>swipe</b>s with its claws with all of its <b>fury</b>. Its claws rake across Freeze in several places across his body causing blood to ooze from the wounds. Freeze turns back and knocks the Sableye as hard as he can to the ground. The Sableye lies on the ground knocked out. The last Sableye stands back warily after seeing what happened to the other Sableye. With only one Sableye remaining, Freeze has barely any energy left. His health is still about seven eighths, though. Slice has lost barely any health. His energy is at about seven eighths. The last Sableye is only going to take about two more good hits before it is knocked out as well. <br />

Okay lets try this: Slice, use <b>Shadow Ball,</b> right when its about to hit I want you, Thunderfuzz, to set it on fire with <b>Flamethrower</b>!&quot; Both pokemon gave him a 'wtf' look. &quot;I know, there is no particular reason for it but I want to see what happens.&quot; Then it hit him the heat probably gave more power to fire type moves, and if it didn't the Sableye could get heat. Okay Slice, <b>Razor Wind</b></span></span> <span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Red">will be the only way to go.

You decide to change your strategy to keep Torchlight using defense while Volante will keep attacking. You tell your Pokémon their orders against the large sea monster. Torchlight starts by spewing another <b>screen</b> of <b>smoke</b>. Volante uses this cover to fly forward and slam herself into Gyrados. Aipom also jumps forward and rakes its claws across the Gyrados’s eyes, <b>scratch</b>ing the Water-type. Gyrados angrily <b>thrash</b>es back in retaliation. Torchlight instinctively throws up another <b>Smokescreen</b> to hide them from the Gyrados’s wrath. The large Flying-type breaks its way through ship with its powerful attack. Volante, unaware of the Gyrados’s raging, flies forward to <b>Tackle</b> the beast again, but she is beat down by the Gyrados’s thrash. The Pidgey is slammed down against the deck. With the hole from the Hyper Beam now combined with the destruction from the Thrash, the ship begins to sink at an alarming rate. Torchlight spews one last <b>Smokescreen</b> to hide his teammate while she can recover. Aipom jumps up and <b>scratch</b>es the Gyrados again, trying to distract the monster while Volante can recover. Volante staggers to her feet and flies up and slams into the Gyrados once again. The Gyrados rears back and tries to <b>bite</b> the Pidgey, but he misses and takes the head off of one of the frozen crewmembers with its fangs. You look on disgustedly at the bloody torso left on the deck. The Gyrados grins maliciously and likes its bloody fangs. The Gyrados is down to about half of its health. Volante has taken a heavy blow that took over half of her health. The boat is sinking quite fast. The main deck is currently about three feet above the ocean.<br />

The ship was sinking fast. Mutilated, frozen carcasses littered the wooden wasteland of and blood and ice. The girl was now hyperventilating, on the brink of insanity. She had to clear her thoughts for now. She needed a way off. Was there a lifeboat that somehow survived the wreckage? Was there a large section of wood that had broken off? All she knew was what there was- a giant crazed Gyarados. After seeing what it had done to the ship and its crew, she realized- any one of those people could have been her, and she didn't want one of them to be. Now was the time for action. Trying hard not to stutter, she shouted out her command; &quot;TORCHLIGHT! SMOKESCREEN THREE TIMES! VOLANTE! TACKLE THREE TIMES!&quot;</span></span></div>

Ordial Shrine; Arc_Angel- “Continue to focus on the land shark, Wanta! Use the Spirit Gale or Slicing Air to keep it away!” Ranjona ordered. Her floating friend gave a soft hiss for a reply once again before staring down the Gabite once again. Stacey seems a little confused about these attacks her friend is ordering; she couldn’t say she was familiar with them. But, in any means, it seemed that her Drifblim understood well enough, as it quickly acted, striking down the Gabite mid-<b>Dragon Rush</b> with a burst of what she could only assume to be <b>Ominous Wind</b>. Turning her gaze back to her own ghost, she could see Narcissa shine a <b>Confuse Ray</b> upon the Mightyena. The dog began to stumble about, electricity wildly crackling between his teeth, signifying the failure of his <b>Thunder Fang</b>. Despite Narcissa’s successful incapacitation of her enemy, Wanta’s efforts are not as successful, as Gabite soon leaps in for an <b>Ice Fang</b>, causing Wanta a good bit of pain and freezing part of its right frontal wing. In retaliation, the Drifblim uses something resembling <b>Air Cutter</b> striking down Gabite once again.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Narcissa continues with her attacks, sending a barrage of <b>Sludge Bombs</b> Mightyena’s way. The masses of poison explode in Mightyena’s face, shocking the bumbling canine, and knocking some sense back into him. Still not completely coherent, the pooch charges once again, his gait a bit unstable, as his fangs glow with Dark energy again. Awkwardly, he leaps, attempting to <b>Crunch</b> Narcissa’s hand, but misses, only grazing her with his teeth. She recoils a little from the malicious aura nicking her form, but isn’t all too perturbed by it, as she quickly fires off a <b>Hidden Power (Fighting)</b>, knocking Mightyena on its side. It slowly manages to right itself, but is looking worse for the ware.<br />
<br />
As the fighting dies down a bit, Drusilla’s cackling and frantic flapping begins to pick up… it seems the soilders are nearing. Time is of the essence.<br />

“No, it’s just over there,” Alicia points over to a part of the woods by the lake. She grabs you by the hand and leads over there into the woods. Tei begins to follow before going back and getting Seldon. The five of you travel through the woods for a few moments before coming to a clearing with a house. A lady in about her forty’s is standing on the porch sweeping it off with a broom. You could swear that the lady’s feet were off the ground and that she was just floating in midair.<br />
<br />
“Mum!” Alicia yells out. The lady immediately falls over before standing up again.<br />
<br />
“My word, you surprised me!” she says, “Hello, my name is Chrysanthemum, but you can call me Cryssi. I’m Alicia’s mom.” she greets you. “Alicia, maybe next time you should tell me before you bring a friend over,” Cryssi says through gritted teeth.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, Mum, Potato, here, saved Zoe from drowning, so I thought I should reward him with one of our pearls.” Alicia explains.<br />
<br />
“Come on in, you’ll have to excuse the mess,” Cryssi sighs. <br />
<br />
You and your Pokémon enter the house with Alicia and follow her into the living room. You sit on one of the couches in the center of the room. <br />
<br />
“Just wait here, I’ll be right back with that pearl,” she tells you before disappearing into one of the rooms. A few moments later, Cryssi enters the room with an Umbreon on her tail.<br />
<br />
“Would you like some refreshments?” Cryssi asks you as she sits a platter of vegetables and dips and a glass of lemonade. “So tell me about yourself, Potato.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, anything about you we should know?” another voice asks. You could swear that the Umbreon was the one who just spoke, but that would be crazy, right? Cryssi discreetly kicks the Dark-type while trying not to let you see. Something seems to be going on here that they don’t want you to know about…<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="color: yellow"><span style="font-size: 9px">Potato awkwardly sat down on the couch. Trying to hide his uncomfort from the strange family, he took a sip of the lemonade, and plucked a carrot off the platter and tossed it to Seldon, whose tongue shot out and gulped the vegetable down.<br />
<br />
As the third voice spoke, Potato’s eyes darted around the room. He was so sure that the voice had emanated from the Umbreon. He had heard of pokémon talking before, and earlier it had seemed the woman had been floating. Some magical or psychic influence, perhaps? Potato tried to shrug it off, figuring that so nice people couldn’t do him harm, and they surely would have admitted it if they were going to commit some torturous act upon him. Besides, it was probably just his imagination.<br />
<br />
“Uhm, well. I’m from Johto. I’m the fifth child of nine, and we’re all named after… vegetables.” He turned a faint shade of pink. “My parents are a little weird… “Potato’s voice trailed off as Seldon unrolled her tongue, gingerly picking up another carrot, and bringing in to her eyes, inspecting it, before quickly recalling her tongue. A pleased look spread across the chameleon’s face.<br />
<br />
“Anyway. The other eight all entered the Johto league, but I wanted to be different, so I came to Fizzy Bubbles instead. And as far as I’m concerned, it’s a ton better. You don’t have to worry about gyms and actually being the best at training, and there’s all sorts of stuff they just <i>give</i> to you!”<br />

But, in any means, it seemed that her Drifblim understood well enough, as it quickly acted, striking down the Gabite mid-<b>Dragon Rush</b> with a burst of what she could only assume to be <b>Ominous Wind</b>. Turning her gaze back to her own ghost, she could see Narcissa shine a <b>Confuse Ray</b> upon the Mightyena. The dog began to stumble about, electricity wildly crackling between his teeth, signifying the failure of his <b>Thunder Fang</b>. Despite Narcissa’s successful incapacitation of her enemy, Wanta’s efforts are not as successful, as Gabite soon leaps in for an <b>Ice Fang</b>, causing Wanta a good bit of pain and freezing part of its right frontal wing. In retaliation, the Drifblim uses something resembling <b>Air Cutter</b> striking down Gabite once again.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Narcissa continues with her attacks, sending a barrage of <b>Sludge Bombs</b> Mightyena’s way. The masses of poison explode in Mightyena’s face, shocking the bumbling canine, and knocking some sense back into him. Still not completely coherent, the pooch charges once again, his gait a bit unstable, as his fangs glow with Dark energy again. Awkwardly, he leaps, attempting to <b>Crunch</b> Narcissa’s hand, but misses, only grazing her with his teeth. She recoils a little from the malicious aura nicking her form, but isn’t all too perturbed by it, as she quickly fires off a <b>Hidden Power (Fighting)</b>, knocking Mightyena on its side. It slowly manages to right itself, but is looking worse for the ware.<br />
<br />
As the fighting dies down a bit, Drusilla’s cackling and frantic flapping begins to pick up… it seems the soilders are nearing. Time is of the essence.<br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">Thanx for continuing this adventure again Jeri ^-^<br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorange">It felt like an eternity between attacks. Narcissa had her orders and watched Mightyena carefully, her expression serious and deadly. Though she was enjoying the beginnings of her first battle she could sense danger growing ever closer and was eager to be done with the wretched dog. Ranjona gave her orders to Wanta, a set of riddles it almost seemed causing Stacey to tilt her head in curiosity, her face still hidden beneath her hood. Wanta was quick to act its balloon-like body moving faster than would have been thought possible and struck the Gabite with what appeared to be an Ominous Wind halting its own attack mid flow. <br />
<br />
Smirking she turned to see Cissa concentrating white energy before her before lashing out striking Mightyena causing it to falter and stumble stupidly about. Even Cissa seemed amused by its actions, just like Stacey had said and even more so as it choked on its Thunder Fang. Hearing a cry come from Wanta Stacey peered over to see the Drifblim's wing frozen over its face contorted in pain before it retaliated with harsh blades of air that sliced at Gabite's hard skin. <br />
<br />
Ciss awas having more luck as her Sludge Bomb exploded right in Mighyena's face leaving it covered in the poisonous slime but it retaliated in turn with a Crunch that grazed Cissa's hand making her retract her fist and shake off the tingles of pain. Frowning she powered up an orb before her before it shot forth a beam of marroon energy that smashed right into Mightyena throwing it onto its side. It managed to make it to its feet again yet it was looking battered now.<br />
<br />
Stacey looked up from under her hood, casting her sapphire eyes on the trainers of these beasts and smirked confidently before hearing Dru chant louder than before. <br />
<br />
<i>&quot;The men they come, with thoughts so dark. Murder, bloody murder they bring. The caves echo with their thoughts.&quot;</i> she says getting a little hysterical whilst flapping hastily back and forth.<br />
<br />
Stacey grimaced as she heard Dru's warning, they were fast running out of time. They needed to finish this pathetic threat off now before they ended up next on the King's chopping list. Facing the remains of the town that surounded them Stacey growled, she would like nothing more than to repay these men on behlaf of its villagers and gut them right here right now, but for the time being, she would let Narcissa voice her feelings with her attacks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cissa, we need to finish this now. Time is running out for us and we cannot remain here when the soldiers arrive. As much as I want your first battle to be memorable through enjoyment, I'm certain by causing pain it will still be such.&quot;<br />
<br />
Narcissa nodded not showing much emotion but a hidden glee shone in her eyes before she turned back around. <br />
<br />
&quot;No holding back,<b>Fire Punch</b> Mightyena right in the face. Then blast it with <b>Dark Pulse</b> and finish it off with your <b>Shadowball</b>.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking over her shoulder Stacey addressed Drusilla<br />
<br />
&quot;Dru do not let the soldiers draw any nearer. When they enter the nearest cavern fill it with your <b>Supersonic</b>, makes their ears bleed and their minds melt. If any make it out, <b>Bite</b> them&quot; she said before focusing back on the battle.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Princess will not be denied her fun. The soliders and their murder cannot compare to the blood Princess will spill today&quot;</i></span></span></div>

<i>I, myself, have also had a four on four battle, but I did read in the Serebii FAQ that you’re only allowed to use two Pokémon in battle. Perhaps it’s the updator’s discretion. Anyways I don’t mind if you use four Pokémon in battle but that means less levels will be earned by each of them. Also if you use four could you please only use two attacks per Pokémon. Speaking of levels, I forgot last update that Freeze should have gained a level so <b>Level up for Freeze!</b>.</i><span style="color: red"><br />
<br />
You pull Freeze back from the battle and put Thunderfuzz in instead. Freeze doesn’t look too happy about having to stay back from the battle. He grudgingly falls back while Thunderfuzz steps forward. The Magbies help you out by powering up your Pokémon with their <b>Helping Hand</b>. Slice forms a <b>Shadow Ball</b> and fires it at the sole remaining Sableye. Right before it collides with the ghost, Thunderfuzz creates a burst of flames and fires it at the Shadow Ball. The <b>Flamethrower</b> hit the ball of ghost energy and causes an explosion of energy which sends the Sableye flying into the wall, knocking it out. As this happens, the second wave rushes forward to attack your Pokémon. Slice remembers his orders and fires a blast of <b>razor</b>-sharp <b>wind</b> at all five of the Sableyes. The attack causes all of the Sableyes to be cut up and ooze a black blood-like substance. Thunderfuzz catches the Mug of Fiery Fizzybrew Beer and takes a swig of it. Before anything happens, a Sableye <b>thief</b> runs forward and grabs the Pachirisu’s alcohol. It sniffs it and is utterly repulsed by the smell. It drops it and the bottle rolls around leaving a trail of alcohol. Thunderfuzz then belches a super powerful <b>flamethrower</b> that ignites the spilled beer. The burst of flames burns up two of the Sableye knocking them out. <br />
<br />
A large crash announces the presence of another Pokémon into the battle. A Magmortar has appeared on the scene! The Magmortar takes a look at the Magbies and starts to rush towards them. The third wave runs towards the fire Pokémon and attacks her. The Magbies look excited as they see their mother here to save them. They run forward and both use <b>ember</b> on a single nearby Sableye. The fourth wave seems to be antsy and runs forward to assist the second wave in attacking you. Slice rubs his wings together quickly to create a loud noise. The <b>Bug Buzz</b> visibly causes stress to the Sableyes’ ears. Thunderfuzz then grabs a Sableye and releases a large <b>Spark</b>, paralyzing the Sableye and dealing a good amount of damage to it. The Magbies both attack again. One <b>Fire Punch</b>es a Sableye while the other uses <b>Flare Blitz</b> to knock it out! A Sableye uses <b>Shadow Sneak</b> to go through the shadows and hit Slice. A second fires a bolt of <b>Nightshade</b> at Thunderfuzz and hits her! Another tries to fire a bolt of <b>Night Shade</b> but it accidentally hits a Sableye instead! <br />
<br />
Seven Sableyes are currently attacking you, but one is paralyzed. Five of these have three fourths of their health remaining. One has half of its health gone. The paralyzed one only has a third of its health left. Thunderfuzz has recovered completely while she was resting. Now she has lost an eighth of her energy and a minor amount of health. Slice has used about an eighth of his health and a fourth of his energy. <br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span><br />

You yell at the Volbeat for getting you into this mess instead of blaming the spiders that were trying to eat you. Seb’s places a <b>curse</b> on himself that causes his muscle to ripple and bulge under his coat. He slows down while Ariados <b>Sucker Punch</b>es Sebastien. Seb curls up into a ball and <b>Roll</b>s <b>Out</b> into the largest spider sending it flying. Its head hit s a rock causing it to be knocked out! <b>Level up for Sebastien!</b> Bobcat unsheathes her claws and tears up the webbing she was incased in. She dodges as a Spinarak fires a spray of <b>Poison Sting</b> at her and retaliates by <b>scratch</b>ing its face causing it to fall off of the web. She then turns on the other spider and tears the web around it causing the web to collapse in on it, wrapping it up in the web. <b>Level up for Bobcat!</b> With all three spiders incapacitated, Bobcat uses her claws to free you and the Volbeat from the web. You and the Volbeat quickly run off before the spider trio can wake up. You follow the trail where something was dragged as you were originally. You finally come to a web with a bundle on it at the end of the trail. Bobcat unsheathes her claws once more and frees the Pokmon inside, but it is not Illumise. Instead a terror-filled Paras falls out of the web and looks up with big scared eyes. It quickly scurries off into the underbrush. You’re rather pissed off at the Volbeat now that you see that the Illumise isn’t even here. The four of you return to the clearing by the big tree. The sun is a bit below sunhigh meaning you have about five hours before sundown if you still want to find the Illumise. <br />
<br />

You release one of your Pokémon hoping for Adamantite, but instead Parabola pops out. You chide him when he taunts the Spinda and it crushes your hopes of escape. You ask the Phantom Spinda if he was Polkadot’s Spinda. Suddenly the Spinda’s face appears to be remorseful and its eyes grow teary. Suddenly, as if a dark cloud passed over its face, the angry face appears once more. It flies at Parabola, who quickly <b>harden</b>s its body. This minimizes the damage from the Spinda’s attack. Phantom Spinda reaches out its tongue and <b>lick</b>s Parabola!. Parabola swiftly turns around and fires a multi-coloured <b>Psybeam</b> at the Phantom Spinda. The Spinda rears back in pain then it uses <b>Copycat</b> by firing the multi-coloured beam right back at your Baltoy. Parabola swiftly dodges to one side then it causes all kinds of pebbles and debris that are in the room to fly up and bind around the Phantom Spinda, imprisoning it in a <b>tomb</b> of <b>rock</b>s! You pause for a moment to see what will happen, but all is silent. For a moment you believe that the battle is over just like that, but suddenly the rocks shatter and Phantom Spinda floats there seemingly unscathed. The Phantom Spinda seems to be immune to attacks in its ghost-like state maybe if you could figure something out about the ghostly spotted panda, you could figure out its weakness. You look around the room to see what all could be used in there. The only things in the room are a bed in the corner with a small teddy bear on it, the diary on a coffee table in the middle of the room, and a dresser on one side with a lamp on it.<br />

You begin to panic as the ship sinks lower and lower into the sea. You scream out panicked orders to your Pokémon. Torchlight throws up a <b>Smokescreen</b> to hide Volante and himself. Volante flies forward and slams herself into the large sea monster in a <b>tackle</b>. Aipom jumps from the smoke and <b>scratch</b>es the Gyrados across the face. The blue sea snake <b>thrash</b>es again, this time through the smoke and hits Volante slamming to the deck in a K.O.! With your Pidgey unconscious, you desperately search for something you could cling onto should the boat sink now. The water begins to flood over the deck. Your ankles are suddenly wet with seawater. You still frantically search for anything to cling onto but the ship has no life boats and any kind of driftwood wouldn’t be able to support you. Torchlight, seeing that you’re currently vulnerable, creates another <b>smokescreen</b> to hide you. The Gyrados seeing that you are no longer fighting returns to its snack and chomps down another sailor. The water has completely filled the boat and plunges under the water. You struggle to keep yourself above the water but soon you can’t stay afloat any longer. Your head goes beneath the surface of the sea. You begin to choke on the water as it goes into your lungs soon everything goes black. <br />
<br />
You awaken from your dream to find yourself back at Oneiro Ruins. That was some kind of dream, but you look around to see that Torchlight stands beside you, Volante lies limp on the ground next to you, the Aipom still on your shoulder, and the Gyrados is rampaging towards a small village in the woods! Instinctively, you grab Volante and race through the woods towards the village. The Gyrados smashes through several huts in the village. As you get there, an elderly man with a staff yells at you, “You! You have brought this upon us all! I shall curse you by causing you to be bad luck to yourself and everyone around you!,” he waves his staff around wildly before stopping aghast, “It seems someone has beat me to the punch! You already have a curse placed on you! Well, now it is your responsibility to defeat this Gyrados. To help you I will give your Pokémon a boost,” the man says as he begins to chant in an unfamiliar language and wave his staff around wildly. Torchlight, Volante, and Aipom begin to glow and grow in size. The three have temporarily evolved and are completely rejuvenated! The man points his stick at the Gyrados, “Now go defeat that sea monster!”<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"><br />
<br />
<i>Note: Volante and Torchlight have temporarily evolved to Pidgeotto and Quilava respectively in Cascadia <b>only</b>. They can use all the attacks known by a Level 18 Pokémon of their species. In any other zone or shop, they are still the same Level 4 Pidgey and Level 6 Cyndaquil. You can also command the Ambipom with all of the attacks as a Level 18 Ampipom would.</i></span><br />

“Oh, yes, I’m glad I came to Fizzy Bubbles, as well,” her vision grows distant as if she was recalling some fabulous memories from long ago. Alicia returns to the room then with Zoe on her shoulder. She holds a small white pearl in her hands. Cryssi turns to her and says, “I think you have a fine young man on your hands right here, Al. I approve.” “Oh, Mom,” Alicia replies, “it’s not like that. I just met him at the lake and he saved Zoe.” “Uh-huh. Sure,” Crtssi says with a wink. Suddenly the door is burst down as a man of about his early twenties enters the house. He has white hair despite his young age. The man has a cigarette burning in his mouth and he walks into the house with heavy footsteps because of his steel-toed boots. “Hello, Crystal,” the strange man says as he enters the room. “Take Potato and run!” Cryssi says to Alicia. “Too late, I’ve found you,” the man says. “Not here, Gabriel, not now. My daughter and her boyfriend, of, excuse me, ‘special’ friend, are her,” Cryssi responds. “Too bad, I finally have you right where I want you,” the man pulls out a shotgun and points it at Cryssi. “But, do you have me right where you want me?” the other voice from earlier says. The Umbreon leaps at Gabriel’s face and bites his face. The man grabs the Umbreon and throws it down. He kicks the Umbreon with his steel-toed boot prompting a yelp from the black cat. “Nightfall!” Alicia screams. “Alright. Enough, games. Time’s up, Crystal,” Gabriel says as he cocks the shotgun. <br />

Last update, Klaus was leading in health while Kadabra had higher energy, but it doesn’t really matter this round. =P<span style="color: silver"><br />
<br />
“Okay, Kadabra, let’s wrap this up! Endure the attacks then Zap Cannon!” the boy practically screams at his Pokémon. Meanwhile, you spray Klaus with a potion that helps him recover his health. Klaus immediately springs into action. Klaus charges his fist with <b>fire</b> energy then he <b>punch</b>es the Kadabra’s face. Klaus then immediately charges his fist with <b>ice</b> energy and <b>punch</b>es the Kadabra in its gut. Kadabra manages to <b>endure</b> both attacks and then fires a <b>Zap Cannon</b> at Klaus. It hits Klaus square on, but Klaus shakes off the attack. The Sableye runs forward and <b>scratch</b>es the Kadabra across the face. The Kadabra falls over knocked out! <b>Level up for Klaus!</b> You cheer ecstatically now that you’ve won a Kadabra and a Ditto.<br />
<br />
The boy cries out to his Kadabra, “Recover now!” The Kadabra stands up fully <b>recover</b>ed. “Now Hypnosis!” Kadabra unleashes a psychic wave begins to lull the pedestrians to sleep. One by one everyone nearby begins to fall into a deep sleep. You suddenly become very drowsy. Everything soon goes black…<br />
<br />
As you come to, you find that all of the watchers of your battle are gone save for a few sleeping here and there. You look around to see that three Pokémon are beside you. Klaus lies to your left, Scorpio to your right. But the other Pokémon is not Orion! The Ditto is the last Pokémon! The Ditto suddenly transforms into a Xatu, it then uses its new Psychic powers to show you a vision.<br />
<br />
<i>An old man walks down the street with a cute pink blob on his shoulder. The two merrily stroll down the lane. Suddenly the boy you just battled pulls him into an alleyway. The boy starts punching the old man then grabs the Ditto and runs.</i><br />
<br />
The vision fades away and the Xatu melts away to reveal the Ditto once more. It looks up to you with pleading eyes as if to ask you to reunite it with its rightful owner.<br />

You yell at the Volbeat for getting you into this mess instead of blaming the spiders that were trying to eat you. Seb’s places a <b>curse</b> on himself that causes his muscle to ripple and bulge under his coat. He slows down while Ariados <b>Sucker Punch</b>es Sebastien. Seb curls up into a ball and <b>Roll</b>s <b>Out</b> into the largest spider sending it flying. Its head hit s a rock causing it to be knocked out! <b>Level up for Sebastien!</b> Bobcat unsheathes her claws and tears up the webbing she was incased in. She dodges as a Spinarak fires a spray of <b>Poison Sting</b> at her and retaliates by <b>scratch</b>ing its face causing it to fall off of the web. She then turns on the other spider and tears the web around it causing the web to collapse in on it, wrapping it up in the web. <b>Level up for Bobcat!</b> With all three spiders incapacitated, Bobcat uses her claws to free you and the Volbeat from the web. You and the Volbeat quickly run off before the spider trio can wake up. You follow the trail where something was dragged as you were originally. You finally come to a web with a bundle on it at the end of the trail. Bobcat unsheathes her claws once more and frees the Pokmon inside, but it is not Illumise. Instead a terror-filled Paras falls out of the web and looks up with big scared eyes. It quickly scurries off into the underbrush. You’re rather pissed off at the Volbeat now that you see that the Illumise isn’t even here. The four of you return to the clearing by the big tree. The sun is a bit below sunhigh meaning you have about five hours before sundown if you still want to find the Illumise. <br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: green">Paul returned his pokémon to their PokéBalls and sat down in front of the great tree, and did nothing but pout. He had just had his life in the hands of a group of predatory arthropods, and now he was stuck where he started. Frustrated, he slammed his fists against the mossy ground and began to yell.<br />
<br />
“What was that!? What was that, man!? You led me into a trap, you made Seb and Bobcat risk their lives and you didn’t even help me! You want your cooch, man, well be smart and go get it yourself, for fuck’s sake!” Paul turned his back to the beetle and began to gnaw on his fist in anxiety. The earlier events now had his heart beating in uneven palpitations, and he responded to this by growing dizzy and fainting, like a child throwing a temper tantrum.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Rocky had broken out of her PokéBall and loomed over him, a worried look in her big, black eyes. She felt horrible, not being able to help him when he needed her most, and wanted to kick the volbeat that did this to him right in the pedipalps. <br />
<br />
“<i>You stupid dick, you stupid dick!</i>” She yelled, of course, all Paul could hear was screeching and the odd “See” or “Dot”. “<i>Look at what you did to him! You killed him, you stupid dick! You didn’t do shit, you stupid dick, all you did was think with your dick, and you didn’t even acknowledge him when he spoke to you and now he’s DEAD.</i>” Rocky then began to tint red. She was readying a bide attack, and when she was ready was going to show this firefly who’s boss.<br />
<br />
Little did she know, all of this screeching and humming woke her trainer who twisted around until he was able to face her. Surprised, Rocky unleashed her bide attack and managed to smack Paul right in his cramped leg. He let out a loud cry and picked up his seedot and patted her on the head, even though the pain in his lower calf had exploded to the mass of a thousand suns.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, yeah cool, Rocky man,” he said, slowly rising to an upright state. He looked down upon the volbeat. “Yeah, man. Let’s find your cooch, don’t hate me for yelling, by the way, uh… I was sad.” <br />
<br />
Rocky responded by jumping out of her trainer’s arms and facing the beetle. “<i>What are you going to do, dick?</i>” she squeaked, earning a perplexed look from the disheveled Paul. She waited patiently for an answer.</span></span></div>

You release one of your Pokémon hoping for Adamantite, but instead Parabola pops out. You chide him when he taunts the Spinda and it crushes your hopes of escape. You ask the Phantom Spinda if he was Polkadot’s Spinda. Suddenly the Spinda’s face appears to be remorseful and its eyes grow teary. Suddenly, as if a dark cloud passed over its face, the angry face appears once more. It flies at Parabola, who quickly <b>harden</b>s its body. This minimizes the damage from the Spinda’s attack. Phantom Spinda reaches out its tongue and <b>lick</b>s Parabola!. Parabola swiftly turns around and fires a multi-coloured <b>Psybeam</b> at the Phantom Spinda. The Spinda rears back in pain then it uses <b>Copycat</b> by firing the multi-coloured beam right back at your Baltoy. Parabola swiftly dodges to one side then it causes all kinds of pebbles and debris that are in the room to fly up and bind around the Phantom Spinda, imprisoning it in a <b>tomb</b> of <b>rock</b>s! You pause for a moment to see what will happen, but all is silent. For a moment you believe that the battle is over just like that, but suddenly the rocks shatter and Phantom Spinda floats there seemingly unscathed. The Phantom Spinda seems to be immune to attacks in its ghost-like state maybe if you could figure something out about the ghostly spotted panda, you could figure out its weakness. You look around the room to see what all could be used in there. The only things in the room are a bed in the corner with a small teddy bear on it, the diary on a coffee table in the middle of the room, and a dresser on one side with a lamp on it.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange"><span style="font-size: 9px"><i>It's like it's possessed...</i> Alina thought to herself as she watched the Spinda's face grow solemn for a second, then just as angry as before. It launched itself at her Baltoy who stood ready and hardened himself. Parabola took the hit, but thanks to the harden, minimized the damage. The Spinda then turned around and licked Parabola, who in response fired a Psybeam. Rearing back in pain, the Spinda Copied the move and fired it back at Parabola. The Baltoy swiftly dodged the phantom's Psybeam and imprisoned it in rocks. Alina held her breath, hoping that was enough to stop the Spinda, but alas, it broke free. Floating back up into the air, the Spinda appeared to be unscathed from Parabola's assault; not a single scratch could be found.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay?&quot; Alina asked her Baltoy. Parabola responded by creating a small illusion of two cartoon-like thumbs-up over its head. The girl smiled and turned her attention back to the phantom before them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, nothing you did even damaged it. It looks better than ever,&quot; Alina stated. &quot;If only we knew something about it... like a weakness or whatever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then her Baltoy conjured up images of cake, cookies, and other sweets.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's your weakness,&quot; Alina grumbled. She picked up the diary once more and looked it over, then turned to see a dresser with a lamp on it to one side of the room. Maybe there was something that could help her inside that dresser, or the diary might mention something, such as a weakness...<br />
<br />
&quot;Parabola, I know you can't damage it, but use <b>Confusion</b> anyway,&quot; the girl began. &quot;Use <b>Harden</b> again and <b>Psybeam</b> after that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Even though the Spinda looked as good as a dead Spinda with a disembodied head could look, the attacks would probably be enough of a distraction for Alina to search the dresser and quickly skim the diary for something. Parabola seemed to understand this, as he made another small illusion of a cartoonish hand saluting and began his Confusion attack. She prayed silently for the dresser or diary to hold something of some use against this phantom as she began her search...</span></span></span></div>

With a totally different landscape from the first, Lily Island is the second largest of the archipelago. Completely covered with vegetation, this island was also formed by a volcano. However, erosion has taken this island down to almost flat, and giving many homes to all types of grass and bug Pokemon among others. Inside the dense jungle, which takes up about a half of the island, there is a very small lake. There are two different forests on the island, and you can tell when you've gone from one forest to another. Besides being divided by the Diamond River, some strange force causes them to have completely different climates as well...<br />
<b><span style="color: green">The Silver Forest</span></b> - The forest which takes up a bit more than half of the island, Silver Island is named for the silver veins the leaves are adorned with. A deciduous forest, you'll mainly see flying and bug types here, due to the lack of ground vegetation. There is a rest stop somewhere in the forest, helping trainers on their way.<br />

<br />
<span style="color: green">Zak had always been fascinated by forests and the pokémon and adventures contained within them, so he knew that he would appreciate Lily island thoroughly. He had decided upon his desired location as soon as he had landed up the isle; the silver forest. Not knowing what was coming, Zak decided to keep his pokémon in their pokéballs for the time being, taking in the island on his own for a while.<br />
<br />
As he walked, he discovered a sign post pointing towards the area he wanted to arrive in and began to follow it towards the forest, wondering what he would find there and what pokémon he would actually find native to the area, since he had never visited the place nor read about the place anywhere.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks beautiful...&quot; Zak remarked to himself, taking in the surroundings in awe, though he had visited many different places, he found each new place as amazing as the last and found Lily island no different. With a content smile on his face, he continued towards the silver forest...</span></div>

</span> <div style="text-align: center"><div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><span style="color: #ff9900"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'">~Ruin Island~</span></span></u></b></span>&#8203;</div></div> <span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #ff9900"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'">Ordial Shrine; Arc_Angel- “We’re almost done, Wanta!” Ranjona encouraged, “Finish with two Slicing Airs and a Spirit Bomb!” </span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #ff9900"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'">Wanta understood his archic orders, quickly jumping into action. Before Gabite could react, Wanta slammed him with another <b>Air Cutter</b>, smacking the dragon into the ground. He quickly repeated his action, the air slicing into its soft skin. Meanwhile, Narcissa began to act as well. Her fist flared up in a blaze of <b>Fire</b> and before the Migthyena could even move, she gave him a hard <b>Punch</b> in the snout. The dog barked unhappily, skidding backwards. Immediately, she followed up with a <b>Dark Pulse</b>. The wave of evil energy pounded the wolf backwards, and it collapsed on the ground.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #ff9900"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'">Now, both ghosts began charging up orbs of ethereal energy. At the same time, Wanta and Narcissa launched their <b>Shadow Ball</b>s. The resulting explosion blew both Pokémon back along with the soilders, throwing them amongst the rubble. Stacey gave a short cheer, congratulating her Haunter. However, the victory party was short-lived, as Drusilla soon begin to stir.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #ff9900"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'">“BLOOD!~” she screeched.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #ff9900"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'">The tiny bat suddenly let out an awful high-picthed noise. The soilders who had just passed through the stone began to collapse in heaps in the mouth of the cave. A few more charged through, and Drusilla assaulted them, gnawing at their neck and drawing blood.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #ff9900"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'">“SO DELICIOUS!~” she cried, licking at the wounds.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #ff9900"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'">The soilders continued to writhe and flail as Drusilla bit at them again and again, gorging herself on the slick, red liquid.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #ff9900"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'">“We must get to the shrine! Call off your Zubat and follow me!” Ranjona ordered, motioning towards the bushes.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #ff9900"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'">Calling Drusilla, Stacey followed Ranjona and Wanta with Narcissa right behind. Grudgingly, the bloodthirsty bat pulled away from her victim, leaving a heap of bloody soilders in her wake.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #ff9900"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'">“We must either go through the Forest Path or down the Espiritu River. We may see soilders on the path, but we’ll also run into dangerous Pokémon on the river.” Ranjona explained.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #ff9900"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'">What will you do?</span></span></span><br />

</blockquote>[Thanks for the welcome Jeri, I look forward to being updated by you ;D]<br />
<br />
<span style="color: green">Startled by the encounter with the pair of angry Scythers so early, Zak pondered over which pokémon to bring out for this kind of situation. The only pokémon he had available were quite low levels and had already taken damage recently, but he had no other choice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on out Luxio, Slowking!&quot; Zak called out as he grabbed the two pokéballs from the left side of his belt. In a large flash, both the spark and royal pokémon appeared before him and as they did so, Zak swung his backpack round to his front and began to rummage amongst the contents.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh, here we are, a potion for each of you. Let me apply these and you pair should be raring to go.&quot; Zak smiled sympathetically at the two creatures before him before applying the potions to each of them in turn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, let's get going, these two Scythers have been ganging up on that little Wurmple, let's give 'em a taste of their own medicine!&quot; Zak cried, pointing towards the two large bug pokémon before them who seemed to be eager to battle themselves, &quot;Luxio, use <b>charge</b> and follow it up with a thunderbolt. As for you Slowking, let's try a <b>flamethrower</b> attack, try and get both the Scythers in one go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zak eyed up the little Wurmple, as soon as the battle was under way, he was going to attempt to get the little critter out of the open and to somewhere safe.</span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: yellow"><span style="font-size: 9px">Tyrant and Combusken began scanning the Power Plant for Pokemon. &quot;I guess they're all sleeping?&quot; Tyrant said, trying to reassure Phoenix. Still walking and looking to the sides of them, Tyrant suddenly ran into what felt like a body and knocked it over. &quot;Oh, I'm sorry!&quot; Tyrant said alarmingly. He went over to where the scientist's glasses fell and retrieved the pair for him. &quot;There you go, again, sorry about that, I should probably look where I'm going.&quot; Tyrant said.<br />
<br />
The scientist explained to him the problem with the generators and asked whether Tyrant would help or not. &quot;Well, sure! Me and and my pal, Phoenix here, wanted to look for some action, we might as well take our opportunity.&quot; Tyrant responded. But then, Tyrant realized that Phoenix never got a word in it. &quot;Well Phoenix, you want to help the scientist defeat the Magnemites?&quot; Tyrant asked. Phoenix bared his claws and chirped loudly, already excited to have a possible battle. &quot;I'll take that as a yes then,&quot; Tyrant replied with a smile, &quot;Now, Dr. Jules, just tell us where to go, and we'll take the case!&quot;</span></span></div>

Last update, Klaus was leading in health while Kadabra had higher energy, but it doesn’t really matter this round. =P<span style="color: silver"><br />
<br />
“Okay, Kadabra, let’s wrap this up! Endure the attacks then Zap Cannon!” the boy practically screams at his Pokémon. Meanwhile, you spray Klaus with a potion that helps him recover his health. Klaus immediately springs into action. Klaus charges his fist with <b>fire</b> energy then he <b>punch</b>es the Kadabra’s face. Klaus then immediately charges his fist with <b>ice</b> energy and <b>punch</b>es the Kadabra in its gut. Kadabra manages to <b>endure</b> both attacks and then fires a <b>Zap Cannon</b> at Klaus. It hits Klaus square on, but Klaus shakes off the attack. The Sableye runs forward and <b>scratch</b>es the Kadabra across the face. The Kadabra falls over knocked out! <b>Level up for Klaus!</b> You cheer ecstatically now that you’ve won a Kadabra and a Ditto.<br />
<br />
The boy cries out to his Kadabra, “Recover now!” The Kadabra stands up fully <b>recover</b>ed. “Now Hypnosis!” Kadabra unleashes a psychic wave begins to lull the pedestrians to sleep. One by one everyone nearby begins to fall into a deep sleep. You suddenly become very drowsy. Everything soon goes black…<br />
<br />
As you come to, you find that all of the watchers of your battle are gone save for a few sleeping here and there. You look around to see that three Pokémon are beside you. Klaus lies to your left, Scorpio to your right. But the other Pokémon is not Orion! The Ditto is the last Pokémon! The Ditto suddenly transforms into a Xatu, it then uses its new Psychic powers to show you a vision.<br />
<br />
<i>An old man walks down the street with a cute pink blob on his shoulder. The two merrily stroll down the lane. Suddenly the boy you just battled pulls him into an alleyway. The boy starts punching the old man then grabs the Ditto and runs.</i><br />
<br />
The vision fades away and the Xatu melts away to reveal the Ditto once more. It looks up to you with pleading eyes as if to ask you to reunite it with its rightful owner.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span>

<br />
What <i>was</i> that boy up to? He knew that the Kadabra couldn't Endure all of the attacks, so why the order? All thoughts of the boy's incompetent strategy vanished as he saw Klaus' fist practically fly into the Kadabra, a blur of red and white. Orion held his breath, anxious to see if Klaus would pull through, and Scorpio stared wide-eyed at the scene. Out of nowhere, the Kadabra fired a Zap Cannon right into Klaus' face, and Mike winced. It was a good thing he had administered that potion, or Klaus would be even deader meat than he was already. Shaking it off, Klaus ran forward and scratched the Kadabra a good one across the eyes, finally felling it. &quot;Yes!&quot; Mike shouted. &quot;We won! We won! Wahoo!&quot;<br />
<br />
Screeching at his Kadabra, the boy said, &quot;Recover now!&quot; Miraculously, the Kadabra staggered up, gaining a second wind. All Mike and Klaus could do was ogle at the pair while the boy commanded Kadabra to use Hypnosis. A soothing psychic wave was released, and all Mike could see were the pedestrians dropping like flies as soft edges of black began to creep in around his sight...<br />
<br />
Mike came to, sharply propping his head up against the ground. <i>Why, that nasty little sonofa...</i> Mike thought. <i>No, no time for that now, Mike.</i>, continuing in his head. <i>First, let's see what happened while I was out cold.</i> Getting up onto his feet, he saw that most of the pedestrians were gone, except for a few still sprawled out on the ground in sleep. Klaus and Scorpio were lying beside his feet. He gently roused them, rubbing their eyes as they woke up. Scorpio had a &quot;Huh?&quot; look on his face, rather confused about the whole matter, while Klaus was in full revenge mode, not too happy at being a victim of a cheap trick like that. Of course, Orion wasn't there, probably in the hands of that dirty theif. &quot;C'mon, ya sleepyheads, rise and shine. Orion's probably in a pretty uncomfortable situation right now, and we've got to go rescue him.&quot;, Mike urgently said to them.<br />
<br />
Klaus cracked his knuckles, ready for some serious butt-kicking, while Scorpio saluted, ready to do anything for Mike. They all turned their heads to the battleground to see...<i>that the boy had left the Ditto behind?!</i> &quot;But...But...why would he leave such a rare Pokemon behind?&quot;, Mike said, staring in awe at the Ditto. Unexpectedly, the Ditto used its signature technique, Transforming into a Xatu. Using its newfound psychic powers, it broadcasted a vision into their minds.<br />
<br />
Mike saw an old man strolling happily down the street with the Ditto on his shoulder. Both he and the Ditto seemed happy until suddenly, the boy Mike had just beaten pulled them both into a dark alley, mugging the old man and taking the Ditto, running away with his ill-earned prize. The vision ended, and the Xatto turned back into a Ditto once more. It looked up at them with sad eyes, and Mike inferred that it wanted to be returned to its original owner. &quot;Alright then.&quot;, Mike said after pondering it over. &quot;We'll do it.&quot; Klaus and Scorpio looked up at him as if he was crazy. &quot;You guys,&quot; Mike firmly said to them. &quot;You know Orion's sense of justice. He would do the exact same thing if he were here right now.&quot; The two Pokemon looked at each other and nodded in agreement. Turning his attention back to the Ditto, he spoke to it, &quot;I do, however have one condition. We're going to have to go and get Orion, my Magnemite, back from that nasty man, and maybe get his Kadabra too. No sense in returning only one Pokemon to its owner, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike paused for a second before relaying his plans to the Ditto. &quot;If we're gonna get this done, I'll need your help, little Ditto dude. First, I'm going to need you to Transform into a Xatu again, so you can go fly around and bring back a policeman to help us. Don't get into any trouble on the way, though. After you've done that, I need you to use those Xatu psychic powers of yours to, uh, 'reach out' for Orion and show the policeman and all of us where Orion is. Then, we can go rescue Orion, arrest the boy, return you to your rightful owner, and everyone's happy. Questions? No? Well then, boys...&quot; Mike smiled and rubbed his hands together. &quot;Let's get this train wreck a'rollin!&quot;</span></span></div>

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #ff9900"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'">Wanta understood his archic orders, quickly jumping into action. Before Gabite could react, Wanta slammed him with another <b>Air Cutter</b>, smacking the dragon into the ground. He quickly repeated his action, the air slicing into its soft skin. Meanwhile, Narcissa began to act as well. Her fist flared up in a blaze of <b>Fire</b> and before the Migthyena could even move, she gave him a hard <b>Punch</b> in the snout. The dog barked unhappily, skidding backwards. Immediately, she followed up with a <b>Dark Pulse</b>. The wave of evil energy pounded the wolf backwards, and it collapsed on the ground.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #ff9900"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'">Now, both ghosts began charging up orbs of ethereal energy. At the same time, Wanta and Narcissa launched their <b>Shadow Ball</b>s. The resulting explosion blew both Pokémon back along with the soilders, throwing them amongst the rubble. Stacey gave a short cheer, congratulating her Haunter. However, the victory party was short-lived, as Drusilla soon begin to stir.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #ff9900"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'">“BLOOD!~” she screeched.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #ff9900"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'">The tiny bat suddenly let out an awful high-picthed noise. The soilders who had just passed through the stone began to collapse in heaps in the mouth of the cave. A few more charged through, and Drusilla assaulted them, gnawing at their neck and drawing blood.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #ff9900"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'">“SO DELICIOUS!~” she cried, licking at the wounds.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #ff9900"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'">The soilders continued to writhe and flail as Drusilla bit at them again and again, gorging herself on the slick, red liquid.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #ff9900"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'">“We must get to the shrine! Call off your Zubat and follow me!” Ranjona ordered, motioning towards the bushes.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #ff9900"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'">Calling Drusilla, Stacey followed Ranjona and Wanta with Narcissa right behind. Grudgingly, the bloodthirsty bat pulled away from her victim, leaving a heap of bloody soilders in her wake.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #ff9900"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'">“We must either go through the Forest Path or down the Espiritu River. We may see soilders on the path, but we’ll also run into dangerous Pokémon on the river.” Ranjona explained.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #ff9900"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'">What will you do?</span></span></span>

</div>
</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Ranjona and Wanta also seemed to sense the urgency of the situation and was quick to give her orders to Wanta. Again cryptic orders were given but Stacey had a guess at what she was asking. The Drifblim quickly moved into action waving a 'fin' as a blade of air sliced through the air cutting into the Gible pushing it back. Not allowing it to recover Wanta followed up with another Air Cutter slicing into its soft under belly. Stacey grinned at its success and turned back to see Narcissa begin her own assault. Pulling her ghastly hand back it erupted in violent flames before she threw a harsh puch striking Mightyena right in the snout making it whine in pain. Oh but the pain didn't ened there and Stacey's grin widened as Cissa charged a ball of dark energy between her hands a small smirk on her face as she let loose the energy that crashed right into the dark doggie throwing it back in a heap on the ground. Both Drifblim and Haunter, ready to finish off their opponants drew on their ghostly energies and with a nod fired duel Shadow Balls that exploded into their opponants throwing them into their trainers, all four landing in the rubble of their destruction.<br />
<br />
Stacey congratulated Narcissa on her victory but heard Drusilla fire up behind her and turned to see what had her so excited. She screamed of blood and let loose her Supersonic crippling the soldiers that had reached them. Had she been given permission or not Dru dove right in for the first throat and dig her fangs right in drinking deep the warm heady liquid. Stacey found it an oddly enchanting sight and was less disturbed than she thought she'd be. Dru shrieked in delight and caught the next unknowing soldier drinking of their life essence. The soldiers kept coming and Stacey doubted that Dru could take them all down and Ranjona seemed to agree and commanded that Stacey called back her Zubat in order to move on to the shrine. Stacey returned Narcissa to her Ghost Ball and turned to face the cave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dru enough, we must leave&quot; Stacey commanded but Drusilla went for yet another poor soldier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Princess stop now. Or Mummy'll be very cross!&quot; she yelled and Dru looked up from her meal pouting but licked the last few drops of heaven from her lips and flew out of the cave up to her trainer absolutely buzzing.<br />
<br />
Catching up to Ranjona she suggested the two possible options available towards their goal. The Forest Path which may have soldiers patroling its length or the Espiritu River which was filled with dangerous Pokemon. It didn't take long for Stacey to decide what she thought was the best option.<br />
<br />
&quot;<b>Espiritu River</b>.&quot; she said matter of factly. &quot;Dangerous or not wild Pokemon would be safer than more soldiers. My team is strong and we can take on any manner of dangerous foe's if we should encounter them.&quot;</span></span></div>

“Oh, yes, I’m glad I came to Fizzy Bubbles, as well,” her vision grows distant as if she was recalling some fabulous memories from long ago. Alicia returns to the room then with Zoe on her shoulder. She holds a small white pearl in her hands. Cryssi turns to her and says, “I think you have a fine young man on your hands right here, Al. I approve.” “Oh, Mom,” Alicia replies, “it’s not like that. I just met him at the lake and he saved Zoe.” “Uh-huh. Sure,” Crtssi says with a wink. Suddenly the door is burst down as a man of about his early twenties enters the house. He has white hair despite his young age. The man has a cigarette burning in his mouth and he walks into the house with heavy footsteps because of his steel-toed boots. “Hello, Crystal,” the strange man says as he enters the room. “Take Potato and run!” Cryssi says to Alicia. “Too late, I’ve found you,” the man says. “Not here, Gabriel, not now. My daughter and her boyfriend, of, excuse me, ‘special’ friend, are her,” Cryssi responds. “Too bad, I finally have you right where I want you,” the man pulls out a shotgun and points it at Cryssi. “But, do you have me right where you want me?” the other voice from earlier says. The Umbreon leaps at Gabriel’s face and bites his face. The man grabs the Umbreon and throws it down. He kicks the Umbreon with his steel-toed boot prompting a yelp from the black cat. “Nightfall!” Alicia screams. “Alright. Enough, games. Time’s up, Crystal,” Gabriel says as he cocks the shotgun. <br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span><br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: yellow">Potato looked up in shock at the young man with the shotgun. Then the Umbreon- Nightall, apparently- spoke very clearly for the first time. Potato had been right! The cat could talk! But no mind that- this was serious. There was no way he could compromise Cyrssi’s safety for his own. It just wasn’t right. Besides, Gabriel wasn’t paying any mind to him anyway. But what could he do? He had no idea.<br />
<br />
Then it hit him- how he had rescued Zoe from the lake. Seldon had used her tongue to save the Pichu. Maybe she could do it again? And Tei was there too.... He knew thunderwave! That was perfect! Potato quickly sank to his knees, and in a whisper just soft enough for his pokemon to hear him, gave his orders.<br />
<br />
“Tei,” He began, “I need you to use <b>Thunderwave</b> on Gabriel- stop him dead in his tracks. And Seldon. You need to do an old trick again- just like how we rescued Zoe, we’re going to rescue Cyrissi. Use your tongue and rip that shotgun right out of his hands! Try to do it as fast as possible, and without him pulling the trigger. We don’t want anyone hurt. Oh. And Seldon, if that doesn’t work, and he tries to shoot you or anybody else, I want you to get wherever he’s aiming and cover you and everybody there up with a <b>magic coat</b>.” Potato added. The pokemon both nodded, understanding their orders.</span></span></div>
