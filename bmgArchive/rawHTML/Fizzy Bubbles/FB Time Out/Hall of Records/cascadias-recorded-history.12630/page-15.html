</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">Red coughed a bit, his lungs felt like they were going to expload. His eye's were burning, dryer then they've ever been in his life, as he lay sprawled out in the sand. The fresh, sea air consumed his lungs. A cool spray gently land on his face. He must've passed out. What had happened? Red sprung to his feet, noticing the bright shine of the surrounding beach. It must've been mid-day by the looks of the sun. There were beach umbrella's up in the distance, and the chatter of passing Wingul &amp; Pelliper up high. <br />
<br />
Tortuga, his tiny turtle, lay unconsience next to him. Red walked over, scooping him up in his arms. The last he could remember; He and Tuga were going up a Pidgeot, now they were in, what looks to be, a tropical paradise. His pullover hoody was missing, his arm(which was injured early) looked as good as new. Something happened, but hey, why not take it as a blessing. He wandered off toward a path, which read &quot;Pearl Lake&quot; on a conviently placed sign. </span></div>

Furrett you can check my last post for yours, I'm trying to finish all your adventures ASAP so I can start anew. Don't take it personally, I just want to start my own adventures, not ones set by RS.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u><span style="color: green">Raunchy Fad</span></u></b><b><span style="color: green"> – Silver Forest</span></b><i><span style="color: green">Reply in green</span></i><br />
<span style="color: green">You nudge the Volbeat towards the hungry looking Illumise partner and it moves, not knowing what to do. Right when the hungry partner looks ready to bite Volbeat begins to dance a dance that <b>attract</b>s all the Illumise, who calm down and begin to circle around him their hunger for mates reaching their centers. Maybe that's what the Illumise planned, to get rid off all the weak Males and mate with the strongest, to have the best chance of survival. Natural selection at its best. You look around and realise there are no Volbeats other than this one left and begin to hear Rocky’s squeaks. &quot;<i>There are about 30 Illumise and one Volbeat. I do not want to see what happens next. Let's go Paul.</i>&quot; All you see is her walking away and begin to follow, as to make sure she is safe. She leads well for about fifteen minutes staying about ten feet ahead of you she leads you back the way you came she enters a bush, when you hear a squeal and see her disappearance.<br />
<br />
You see a carnivorous plant holding Rocky with its roots up to its face. The plant is green. And has a head the shape of a Venus flytrap, a Carnivine! “Carnivine!” It picks up Rocky and slowly brings it up to its mouth as if to taunt you. Better do something or you will end up with a dead starter pokemon. </span></span></span><br />

</span></span><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DeepSkyBlue"><u><b>SilverWind</b></u> – <b>Pearl Lake</b><i>Reply in skyblue(?idk)</i></span></span></span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Verdana'"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DeepSkyBlue"><br />
You wake up in an unfamiliar island, mysteriously. You had been in a fight at the cloud garden, but you kept going anyway into the pearl lake, a place that would turn this mystery even more mysterious. After about an hour of walking you reach a giant twinkling lake in which lie some sleeping Lotad and a menagerie of other water types. You look around and take in your beautiful surroundings, while Tortuga takes the time to jump in the lake and splashes around happily. You look at your Pokémon swim around happily and begin to smile. Deciding to play around you pick up a handful of rocks and begin to throw them at Tortuga, who either dodges them or knocks them down with water. Little did you know that the rocks would cause you pain in the rear posterior later on. Unbenounced to you, the rocks which were sinking now were all hitting the same area. Unfortunately that area was right on top of a sleeping young Seel. The Pokémon feels the rocks which were only mildly tapping it and swims up, to see why this would be happening. <br />
<br />
When you see the seal Pokémon come to the surface and stop throwing rocks. It looks at you and turns toward your Squirtle. It cocks its head back and aims at Tortuga. It seems to attack, but it just shoots Water like a professional Sports player. Tortuga sees this and learns one thing: TIME TO PLAY! They both begin splashing at each other and you watch in joy as they play together for a while until their splashing sends something towards the shore. That is when chaos breaks loose. The splashed water hits a sleeping Golduck, which up and looks at the two water Pokémon. It swims up at the Pokémon and shoots water at the Seel, but more like Gun. The shot smacks the poor baby seal in the face. The bully Gulduck begins to laugh at the two baby Pokémon and begins<br />
to taunt (not in the move sort of way) your Turtle Pokémon, who seems angry. <br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span></span> <br />

</i></span></span><span style="color: darkorange">You ponder wether the young monkey pokemon would like to come with you and decide to throw a ball at it. The ball hits him and he is trapped by a beam of red light pulling it in. The ball shakes twice before the pokemon pops out of it in a second red light, you ponder if you should fight it when it picks up the ball with its tail arm. It looks at it and begins to smile as if in deep in thought. You think that it will throw the pokeball at back you in rejection, but are surprised to see it throw it in the air and touching it and getting caught again this time for real. <b>Congratulations, you have captured a level 7 Male Aipom! </b><br />
<br />
You see the elder walk towards you, and begin expecting grim news, but he seems happy. &quot;You have saved us from the scourge of the Gyarados and the Threat of a curse.&quot; His face turns pecimistic and serious &quot;Thank you, Now get the hell out. We don't want a curse.&quot; You begin to walk away, thinking about the elderly man's words.<br />
<br />
</span>--Not sure what happens next, you could go to a different area or drop out of the zone, I've never done an adventure in FB.</span></span><br />

<b><u><span style="color: darkorange">Artificial Dragon</span></u></b><b><span style="color: darkorange"> – Elegy Fields</span></b><i><span style="color: darkorange">Reply in darkorange<br />
<br />
</span></i><span style="color: darkorange">Your Pokemon set to work on your orders and Prestige creates a<b> Barrier</b> to separate you from the sibling Ghastly and he manages to create a very powerful one too! He closes his eyes and focuses on it, to make sure it will last long. <i>&quot;I can't keep this up... without my concentration, I can't fight. It will break.&quot; </i>He mentally informs you. Purple and Polkadot try ramming the energy wall several times but can't seem to break it. Just like you planned!(I think) you and Parabola turn your attention to the evil apparition. He does not seem very happy about what you had just done.<br />
<br />
It glares at you with its evil-filled eyes and speaks. &quot;I hunger for your Blooooooood!&quot; It licks its lips. <i>&quot;You are the first person who has come to this house in one thousand years! When I kill you I will drain you of blood and use your body as a sacrifice to destroy the world with 10,000 horrors.&quot;</i> It then proceeds to Begin chanting in a long forgotten language, one that seems like a <b>Curse</b>, that ends in himself and you having a pin of dark energy stab through you. Not a fatal blow, but enough for you to feel deep pain, that is shared by the Ghastly. <i>&quot;Try to release a pokemon now, and It will die, You will as well. Those pathetic souls will nev-&quot; </i>That is the last you hear of him as Parabola shoots a multicolored beam of Psychic energy to<b> confuse </b>the Ghastly, which hits it right between the eyes, managing to actually confuse it. Bad move man. The confused Ghastly begins to sing a <b>song</b>, &quot;...you will all <b>perish</b>! And I will really relish!&quot; The song leaves a wicked feel in the air and you know you have no time to spare. While you plan your next moves Parabola takes advantage of the ghost pokemon's confusion and shoots it with a more attack oriented <b>Psy</b>chic <b>Beam</b>. The Ghastly snaps out of it, its health took a big hit when it cursed you and it knew that time was ticking, it had to defeat your pokemon soon or it would be waving byebye. You have to rely on Parabola to make this escape, as Prestige has to keep the other two ghosts at bay. This is gonna be a hell of a fight.</span></span></span><br />

</span><b><u><span style="color: yellow">Tyranidos</span></u></b><b><span style="color: yellow"> – Eletron Plant</span></b><i><span style="color: yellow">Reply in yellow</span></i><br />
<span style="color: yellow"><br />
Both of you rejoice at the thought of fighting the two Magnemite and quickly order your Conbusken to attack. The Magnemite attack and an unepic battle ensues. The Magnemite get close and Phoenix Jumps, sets one on Fire with embers and kicks the other one twice. Double KO.(You won't level up yet.) You see the weakling Magnemites on the ground and wonder why they had hardly any power. Maybe they hadn't eaten much energy yet. You keep walking deeper into the plant, where the electricity is so strong you can feel the static picking up your hair. You pass a few rooms with closed doors, from which you hear strong electrical charges. </span><span style="color: yellow">Luckily those doors where closed... most of them. You pass one door that is open and see a Magneton, and a Bronzor. Stuck together! They seem to be stuck because of Magneton's magnetism. No matter, they seem to be in pain, and you could probably find a way to separate them...</span></span></span><br />

<b><u>Lemon~Lime </u>– Salin City</b>Reply in<i> silver<br />
<br />
</i></span></span><span style="color: silver">Thinking of the guy as an idiot you begin to yell at him. He releases a Houndoom and you give orders to all Pokémon you have currently, but you yell vain... The Ditto jumps into the air right above the Houndoom and <b>Transforms</b>! Into a Golem no less. As you can imagine, the force of a giant rock falling on a Pokémon is very devastating, and not only is the Houndoom KO'd but it seems dead, or worse, if that’s possible. As Ditto gets off of the hellhound Pokémon the trainer falls to his knees and begins to weep over his beloved Pokémon &quot;What did.... I....... do.... wrong?&quot; He begins to yell at the world &quot;WHY?! FIRST MY FATHER, THEN THE REST, NOW YOU?! WHY DOES THE WORLD HATE ME!?&quot; That's the last you hear, before you head off into the tunnel, hearing the boy's screams of anger and sorrow. The Ditto seems to have had second thoughts about that last move thinking it over it begins to cry to itself, as it had just killed another. <br />
<br />
You keep going underground until you reach a giant mechanical room with lots of machines. There is nobody there and in the middle of the room is a machine with a glass container on it, holding a very familiar magnetized face, Orion! Alongside it there were two other Magnemites. All three look at you to find an escape, and you see a big red button labelled 'RELEASE'. It seems like there was an idiot here who couldn't exactly use codes difficult enough to deter vandals. As you press the button a siren goes off and the wall adjacent to you spins to reveal a robot. A giant battle robot with a siren on its head and six robotic arms. Each arm equipped with LAZERZ. It looks at you and a robotic voice mutters &quot;Target Identified.&quot; You realise that it is aiming for you, and it means business. You have all of your Pokémon with you along with the Ditto and Two other Magnemite. This is going to be a difficult and you will need the help of all of the Pokémon to defeat it, before it kills you all IN FLAMES!<br />
<br />
</span>--Go ahead use as many Pokémon as you want, though keep them at two attacks each. You can also control the other Three Pokémon as if they were all level 10.</span></span></div>

Furrett you can check my last post for yours, I'm trying to finish all your adventures ASAP so I can start anew. Don't take it personally, I just want to start my own adventures, not ones set by RS.<br />

<b><u><span style="color: green">Raunchy Fad</span></u></b><b><span style="color: green"> – Silver Forest</span></b><i><span style="color: green">Reply in green</span></i><br />
<span style="color: green">You nudge the Volbeat towards the hungry looking Illumise partner and it moves, not knowing what to do. Right when the hungry partner looks ready to bite Volbeat begins to dance a dance that <b>attract</b>s all the Illumise, who calm down and begin to circle around him their hunger for mates reaching their centers. Maybe that's what the Illumise planned, to get rid off all the weak Males and mate with the strongest, to have the best chance of survival. Natural selection at its best. You look around and realise there are no Volbeats other than this one left and begin to hear Rocky’s squeaks. &quot;<i>There are about 30 Illumise and one Volbeat. I do not want to see what happens next. Let's go Paul.</i>&quot; All you see is her walking away and begin to follow, as to make sure she is safe. She leads well for about fifteen minutes staying about ten feet ahead of you she leads you back the way you came she enters a bush, when you hear a squeal and see her disappearance.<br />
<br />
You see a carnivorous plant holding Rocky with its roots up to its face. The plant is green. And has a head the shape of a Venus flytrap, a Carnivine! “Carnivine!” It picks up Rocky and slowly brings it up to its mouth as if to taunt you. Better do something or you will end up with a dead starter pokemon. </span></span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><b>Rocky is not your character.</b> <br />
In the same way that I am not allowed to self-update by controlling the actions of your characters or the environments that my characters are in, I expect that you would leave the updating of my own characters' thoughts and actions to myself, the updatee.<br />
Thanks, man.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: green">“<i>Oh, hi there,</i>” Rocky squeaked as she was lifted from the ground to make eye contact with the predatory pokémon that had her in its grasp. “<i>I just came from a fly-orgy. You eat flies, don’t you?</i>” Her tone was calm, and though she hung in the cellulose tentacles of the carnivorous plant, she seemed rather undaunted by the situation. “<i>There’s no meat on me, you know. I’m all carbs an' starch, just like you, shithead. Haven’t you ever seen a seedot before, dumbass? You don’t go picking acorns off the ground on your normal summer eve, do you?</i>”<br />
<br />
Though Paul didn’t understand what Rocky was saying, her point still managed to be absolutely legit. Here she was dangling in the grasp of a <b>carnivorous</b> plant that had somehow gotten confused and picked up something completely herbivorous, if you will. Paul didn’t quite understand, however, and kept his distance from the pokémon. Though Rocky stayed calm, there was lanky meat hanging off of her trainer’s bones.<br />
<br />
“Not cool,” Paul muttered as he saw the carnivine emerge from the bushes. “Hey, man,” he said timidly, “could you put my little buddy down? I’ve had a rough night, spiders, you know, and… hey, do you like to eat flies?” He twirled his hair and stroked his beard. He then of the courage to slowly approach the carnivine and wrap his hands around Rocky in attempt to pry her loose. He sighed sadly, and slurred to himself, “I need a doob.”</span></span></div>

</span></i><span style="color: darkorange">Your Pokemon set to work on your orders and Prestige creates a<b> Barrier</b> to separate you from the sibling Ghastly and he manages to create a very powerful one too! He closes his eyes and focuses on it, to make sure it will last long. <i>&quot;I can't keep this up... without my concentration, I can't fight. It will break.&quot; </i>He mentally informs you. Purple and Polkadot try ramming the energy wall several times but can't seem to break it. Just like you planned!(I think) you and Parabola turn your attention to the evil apparition. He does not seem very happy about what you had just done.<br />

It glares at you with its evil-filled eyes and speaks. &quot;I hunger for your Blooooooood!&quot; It licks its lips. <i>&quot;You are the first person who has come to this house in one thousand years!

Bad move man. The confused Ghastly begins to sing a <b>song</b>, &quot;...you will all <b>perish</b>! And I will really relish!&quot; The song leaves a wicked feel in the air and you know you have no time to spare. While you plan your next moves Parabola takes advantage of the ghost pokemon's confusion and shoots it with a more attack oriented <b>Psy</b>chic <b>Beam</b>. The Ghastly snaps out of it, its health took a big hit when it cursed you and it knew that time was ticking, it had to defeat your pokemon soon or it would be waving byebye. You have to rely on Parabola to make this escape, as Prestige has to keep the other two ghosts at bay. This is gonna be a hell of a fight.[/FONT]</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">Yeah, got a bit confused with this, but I think I got it right.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorange"><i>Hmm, so they won't leave him be..</i> Alina thought as she watched Prestige's Barrier be continuously pummeled by the Gastly. At least their efforts were in vain, for the Barrier was far to strong to be broken that easily. The trainer played with her short-cut hair and said out loud to Prestige, &quot;How insulting, being ignored like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;It's not a risk worth taking, really,&quot;</i> Prestige answered. <i>&quot;It keeps their father safe if they continue attacking, and I'm fine with that. I can't keep this up, though... without my concentration, I can't fight. The Barrier will break. Hurry up.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the evil Gastly glared at Alina with pure hatred, not happy about what she'd done. &quot;I hunger for your Blooooooood!&quot; it cries. Alina turned to face the Gastly and chuckled a bit. Despite feeling slightly nervous about losing her life, she was pretty tired of this place. Her weariness outweighed her fear by a great margin. <br />
<br />
&quot;You are the first person who has come to this house in one thousand years!&quot; the Gastly continued. &quot;When I kill you I will drain you of blood and use your body as a sacrifice to destroy the world with 10,000 horrors.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, so I've heard,&quot; Alina mumbled, growing more weary and annoyed by the second. It was kind of humorous, when you think about it... a Gastly trying to destroy the world. Not Giratina, not Dusknoir, but a Gastly. She smiled to herself at the thought as the Gastly began chanting a strange language. It sounded like nothing but gibberish to Alina, until she felt a sharp pain stab through her like a knife. She fell to her knees in shock and pain, not quite knowing what had just happened, and checked her stomach to make sure that she was indeed alright despite the way she felt, and found nothing. It wasn't a fatal wound, thank god, even though it sure as hell felt like it. Alina finally realized that this was a curse, and it would be a long and painful battle for both her and the Gastly if this went on for much longer. The Gastly laughed evily and said, &quot;Try to release a pokemon now, and It will die, You will as well. Those pathetic souls will nev-&quot;<br />
<br />
A colorful beam of light was shot seemingly out of nowhere directly at the Gastly, interrupting the spirit's speech and hitting it between the eyes. It appeared to be in a daze as Parabola spun around Alina to face the spector. <i>&quot;We're fucked&quot;</i> Alina and Prestige thought in unison. Parabola was definitely not her first choice, especially in a life and death situation, as he was sarcastic and ADD, but she couldn't call him back now. Despite its confusion, the Gastly managed to sing a Perish Song, condemning both Pokemon to their demise if one of them didn't fall before the the clock ran out. Parabola appeared not to care. In fact, he seemed to be enjoying himself. He spun around gleefully and fired a Psybeam, taking advantage of the Gastly's state of confusion. However, this attack must have caused the Gastly to snap out of its confusion, since the orb's face returned from its dazed look back to the familiar evil smile and hate filled eyes.<br />
<br />
Alina knew they didn't have much time. Judging by the amount of pain she felt from the Gastly's curse, she knew that the Gastly had to be suffering the same amount of damage. Psychic moves were super effective, so she knew that the Gastly was adding another great amount of damage, but time was running thin. Parabola giggled to himself, obviously enjoying this near-death experience. Alina and Prestige were definitely not feeling the same way, sorry to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, hurry up,&quot; Alina began, wincing in pain. &quot;If you lose I'll kill you.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;You're horrible,&quot;</i> said Prestige quietly, concentrating on the Barrier and putting all his efforts into keeping the siblings off of Alina and Parabola.<br />
<br />
Alina ignored this remark and continued with her orders, &quot;Finish this fast, we won't last long if you don't give it your all. <b>Rock Tomb</b> the Gastly first, maybe that will slow it down. Then, give it two <b>Psybeams</b>.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alina wasn't totally sure if the Rock Tomb would even help matters, but if there was anything that might slow down the Gastly even slightly, she'd have to take it. At least the Psybeams would prove to be effective. Parabola hummed to himself and spun from side to side, round and round, like a dizzy and bored child. <i>Totally screwed...</i> Alina thought, watching the Baltoy spin off like a drunk to prepare his first move.</span></span></div>

<br />
</i></span></span><span style="color: silver">Thinking of the guy as an idiot you begin to yell at him. He releases a Houndoom and you give orders to all Pokémon you have currently, but you yell vain... The Ditto jumps into the air right above the Houndoom and <b>Transforms</b>! Into a Golem no less. As you can imagine, the force of a giant rock falling on a Pokémon is very devastating, and not only is the Houndoom KO'd but it seems dead, or worse, if that’s possible. As Ditto gets off of the hellhound Pokémon the trainer falls to his knees and begins to weep over his beloved Pokémon &quot;What did.... I....... do.... wrong?&quot; He begins to yell at the world &quot;WHY?! FIRST MY FATHER, THEN THE REST, NOW YOU?! WHY DOES THE WORLD HATE ME!?&quot; That's the last you hear, before you head off into the tunnel, hearing the boy's screams of anger and sorrow. The Ditto seems to have had second thoughts about that last move thinking it over it begins to cry to itself, as it had just killed another. <br />
<br />
You keep going underground until you reach a giant mechanical room with lots of machines. There is nobody there and in the middle of the room is a machine with a glass container on it, holding a very familiar magnetized face, Orion! Alongside it there were two other Magnemites. All three look at you to find an escape, and you see a big red button labelled 'RELEASE'. It seems like there was an idiot here who couldn't exactly use codes difficult enough to deter vandals. As you press the button a siren goes off and the wall adjacent to you spins to reveal a robot. A giant battle robot with a siren on its head and six robotic arms. Each arm equipped with LAZERZ. It looks at you and a robotic voice mutters &quot;Target Identified.&quot; You realise that it is aiming for you, and it means business. You have all of your Pokémon with you along with the Ditto and Two other Magnemite. This is going to be a difficult and you will need the help of all of the Pokémon to defeat it, before it kills you all IN FLAMES!<br />
<br />
</span>--Go ahead use as many Pokémon as you want, though keep them at two attacks each. You can also control the other Three Pokémon as if they were all level 10.</span></span>

<br />
<span style="color: silver">Apparently, Mike had blurted out orders to no use, seeing as the Dito made a flying leap into the air (somehow managing to do this without legs) and transformed into a Golem in midair. Its timing was just right, as its weight, now 75 times normal, made it drop like...a rock, crushing the Houndoom. To the horror of all in the area, the Houndoom appeared to have actually <i>died</i> from the weight. &quot;Ohhhhhhh, snap.&quot; Mike said, being the first to break the silence. Ditto melted back into its regular pink blobbish form, very unsettled at what it had done. &quot;What did.... I....... do.... wrong?&quot; said the boy, sobbing over his deceased Pokemon. &quot;Uh, a life of crime? Stealing other people's Pokemon?&quot; Mike said incredulously. How could he not realize where he had gone wrong? Getting up and now yelling, the boy cried out &quot;WHY?! FIRST MY FATHER, THEN THE REST, NOW YOU?! WHY DOES THE WORLD HATE ME!?&quot; Hurrying down the tunnel while the boy angsted out, the Ditto began to cry a little at the thought of its having killed another Pokemon. &quot;It's ok,&quot; Mike said soothingly. &quot;I know you didn't mean it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally, the tunnel ended at a large room. Complicated machines of seemingly every kind populated the room, with glowing lights and soft beeps coming from many of them. In the center of the room, a machine with a large glass container held three Magnemite. Right in the middle, there was Orion! Albeit the fact that he was looking rather gloomy, he seemed to be in perfect condition. Upon seeing Mike, he shouted a cheerful &quot;Mag!&quot;, and surely would have cried with joy if he had actually had tear ducts. The other two looked hopefully at Mike with puppy-dog eyes, wanting out from the glass prison too. <i>&quot;{Augh!}&quot;</i> Klaus thought to Mike. <i>&quot;{Enough with all the love and joy and happy reunions! It's like an episode of </i>The Care Bear Show<i>, WHICH I DO NOT WATCH, for Pete's sake! Can't we just give something a beating already? Like, I dunno, a giant robot or </i>something<i>.}&quot;</i> &quot;Oh, be quiet, you,&quot; said Mike as he pushed the release button on the machine, gathering some odd looks from his team members. The three Magnemite were released, Mike shared a quick embrace with Orion, everybody cheered, and all was right with the world for about three seconds. Then, the alarm sounded.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's happening?!&quot; Mike yelled over the incessant noise. An nearby wall spun around to reveal...a giant robot. Mike stared with a &quot;what&quot; expression at the black gem hanging from Klaus' neck. <i>&quot;{Whatever you might think,}&quot;</i> Klaus thought sheepishly, <i>&quot;{I did not have anything to do with that.}&quot;</i> The robot appeared to be built for combat, with a siren flashing on its head and six arms equipped with what appeared to be...laser-firing guns. Fantastic. A single red light appeared on the robot's exterior. Moving about for no apparent reason, finally it settled directly in front of Mike. A chilling robotic voice said &quot;Target Acquired.&quot; Mike gulped. &quot;O-okay, everyone!&quot; Mike yelled, stammering out of fear that the machine would blast him to pieces before he could do anything. &quot;We're all gonna have to work together to take this thing down. Ditto, I need you to <b>Transform</b> into something like a Wobbufett and use <b>Mirror Coat</b> to reflect anything the machine throws at me. You two Magnemites and Orion! I need all of you to shock the machine with <b>x2 Thunderhocks</b>, try to damage its internal systems. Pear, <b>x2 Growths</b> to give yourself some power. Gek, <b>Brain Freeze</b> to wreak havoc on its internal wiring, then use <b>Strength</b> to take off one of its arms if you can. Scorpio, <b>x2 Wing Attacks</b> to take off two more of its arms. Klaus, <b>Thunderbolt</b> along with the Magnemite, then phase inside using your ghostly Sableye powers or whatever and <b>Fire Punch</b> to get a fire started in its insides. Then get the heck outta there.&quot; The Pokemon all took battle stances while Mike trembled, hoping they could take it down before he was cremated free of charge. </span></span></div>

Both of you rejoice at the thought of fighting the two Magnemite and quickly order your Conbusken to attack. The Magnemite attack and an unepic battle ensues. The Magnemite get close and Phoenix Jumps, sets one on Fire with embers and kicks the other one twice. Double KO.(You won't level up yet.) You see the weakling Magnemites on the ground and wonder why they had hardly any power. Maybe they hadn't eaten much energy yet. You keep walking deeper into the plant, where the electricity is so strong you can feel the static picking up your hair. You pass a few rooms with closed doors, from which you hear strong electrical charges. </span><span style="color: yellow">Luckily those doors where closed... most of them. You pass one door that is open and see a Magneton, and a Bronzor. Stuck together! They seem to be stuck because of Magneton's magnetism. No matter, they seem to be in pain, and you could probably find a way to separate them...</span></span></span>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: yellow">Tyrant and Phoenix are happy that there is finally some action. One of the Magnemites gets close to Phoenix, who just uses an <b>Ember</b>. The Magnemite falls to the ground and the next follows up behind the previous one. Phoenix makes quick work of this one as well, using a <b>Double Kick</b>, slamming his feet onto the floating mass of metal, causing it to lose consciousness as well. &quot;Wow, that...was not really much of a thrill.&quot; Tyrant said, confused. &quot;I suppose that those Magnemite were weakened somehow. One thing leads to another, I guess, so we should investigate!&quot; Tyrant said, making up his mind as he talked. Phoenix chirped in agreement, happy to do something else other than fighting weak Magnemite.<br />
<br />
As the duo walk on, Tyrant feels the hair on his head rise a bit, as well as the hair on the rest of his body. Phoenix, even though he doesn't have hair, feels the strong magnetic forces on him as well. Tyrant sees a room and walks towards it, feeling the forces stronger and stronger. He peers into the open door and sees a strange...thing. &quot;WOAH!&quot; Tyrant says, but then realizes that it's just a Magneton and Bronzor stuck together. &quot;Huh, that Magneton has some strong attraction force. Now how would we pull these two apart?&quot; Tyrant asks. &quot;I've got it! I'll pull on the Bronzor, while you pull on the Magneton, got it?&quot; Tyrant asked Phoenix. The Combusken nodded and went over to the three-headed metal beast. Tyrant reached over and grabbed the Bronzor as Phoenix put his hands around the Magneton. &quot;Ready? Pull on three.&quot; Tyrant said, &quot;One...two...three!&quot; Tyrant yelled and immediately began to pull.</span></span></div>

Woo, my first update. I hope you'll enjoy the adventure I have planned for you ^_^. For now, I'm just transitioning Jeri's plot to mine, so this is a bit plotless, but better things are to come.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange"><b><i><u>Ruin Island</u><br />

<br />
The joyful time that you had at the Ambersap Cascades was interrupted by a bubbling in the water. You look over to where the sound comes from and see that the water begins to move about violently—something was obviously coming up. However, you did not expect a giant Gyarados, angry at, well, everything. Ranjona recalled her Drifblim and placed her necklace into the sea, which immediately began to glow. Suddenly, an Omastar appears where the necklace once was, and Ranjona captures it with a Pokeball. You look back at Drusilla, who was still having withdrawals and decide that you would match Ranjona’s ancient creature with your own, sending out Wraith, your Kabuto. &quot;Gyarados is our target, Omastar is our ally,&quot; you tell Wraith, he nods to your information. &quot;As Omastar attacks use your Rock Polish to boost your speed. Wait for Omastar to finish its attacks then use your Screech and strike Gyarados with Stone Edge.&quot; You say, giving the commands to battle the serpent.<br />
<br />
Omastar starts the battle by using its finesse at handling rocks, throwing them at the Gyarados, which certainly enraged the beast. Omastar continues by launching spikes at the beast, which slam and poke into the skin of the serpent to cause some damage as well. While this is happening, Wraith takes advantage of the distracted beast and grinds himself against the shore of the river, using a <b>Rock Polish</b> to great enhance his speed. Next, while you and Ranjona cover your ears, Wraith <b>screech</b>es at the top of his lungs, messing up Gyaraodos’ thoughts. The angry, but confused, serpent swings his <b>tail</b> with an <b>aqua</b> shine around, hitting Omastar but barely missing Wraith. Omastar gets slapped away, but swims back for the fight. Wraith then slams into the ground, making <b>stone</b>s with pointy <b>edge</b>s, and hurls them at Gyarados, causing it to thrash about in pain. The blue snake isn’t finished, however. His <b>fang</b>s light up blue, covered in <b>ice</b> and he chomps down onto Wraith, causing some damage to the little creature.<br />
<br />
“Great job, Wraith!” you yell, happy that the first round ended up going pretty smoothly, but a bit horrified that the Gyarados nearly ate your Kabuto. “That’s some Kabuto you got there,” Ranjona added, “But I’ve got tricks up my sleeve as well. Omastar, fire off another <b>Spike Cannon</b>, then <b>Mud Shot</b>!” Ranjona yelled. You thought about the orders in your head, and then started yelling them to Wraith. However, you hear loud voices from a short distance behind you, a couple of kilometers to be exact. “Oh no,” Ranjona said, “The soldiers are catching up, we have to wrap this up quick. We may even have to abandon this battle.” “But we can’t just lea—“ you start, but Ranjona interrupts. “Our lives our at stake hear, remember that Stacey.” She urges. With the angry Gyarados about to gobble up Wraith, you have a choice to make.</span></span></div>

Woo, my first update. I hope you'll enjoy the adventure I have planned for you ^_^. For now, I'm just transitioning Jeri's plot to mine, so this is a bit plotless, but better things are to come.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange"><b><i><u>Ruin Island</u><br />
Arc_Angel:</i></b><i> Reply in DarkOrange</i><br />
<br />
The joyful time that you had at the Ambersap Cascades was interrupted by a bubbling in the water. You look over to where the sound comes from and see that the water begins to move about violently—something was obviously coming up. However, you did not expect a giant Gyarados, angry at, well, everything. Ranjona recalled her Drifblim and placed her necklace into the sea, which immediately began to glow. Suddenly, an Omastar appears where the necklace once was, and Ranjona captures it with a Pokeball. You look back at Drusilla, who was still having withdrawals and decide that you would match Ranjona’s ancient creature with your own, sending out Wraith, your Kabuto. &quot;Gyarados is our target, Omastar is our ally,&quot; you tell Wraith, he nods to your information. &quot;As Omastar attacks use your Rock Polish to boost your speed. Wait for Omastar to finish its attacks then use your Screech and strike Gyarados with Stone Edge.&quot; You say, giving the commands to battle the serpent.<br />
<br />
Omastar starts the battle by using its finesse at handling rocks, throwing them at the Gyarados, which certainly enraged the beast. Omastar continues by launching spikes at the beast, which slam and poke into the skin of the serpent to cause some damage as well. While this is happening, Wraith takes advantage of the distracted beast and grinds himself against the shore of the river, using a <b>Rock Polish</b> to great enhance his speed. Next, while you and Ranjona cover your ears, Wraith <b>screech</b>es at the top of his lungs, messing up Gyaraodos’ thoughts. The angry, but confused, serpent swings his <b>tail</b> with an <b>aqua</b> shine around, hitting Omastar but barely missing Wraith. Omastar gets slapped away, but swims back for the fight. Wraith then slams into the ground, making <b>stone</b>s with pointy <b>edge</b>s, and hurls them at Gyarados, causing it to thrash about in pain. The blue snake isn’t finished, however. His <b>fang</b>s light up blue, covered in <b>ice</b> and he chomps down onto Wraith, causing some damage to the little creature.<br />
<br />
“Great job, Wraith!” you yell, happy that the first round ended up going pretty smoothly, but a bit horrified that the Gyarados nearly ate your Kabuto. “That’s some Kabuto you got there,” Ranjona added, “But I’ve got tricks up my sleeve as well. Omastar, fire off another <b>Spike Cannon</b>, then <b>Mud Shot</b>!” Ranjona yelled. You thought about the orders in your head, and then started yelling them to Wraith. However, you hear loud voices from a short distance behind you, a couple of kilometers to be exact. “Oh no,” Ranjona said, “The soldiers are catching up, we have to wrap this up quick. We may even have to abandon this battle.” “But we can’t just lea—“ you start, but Ranjona interrupts. “Our lives our at stake hear, remember that Stacey.” She urges. With the angry Gyarados about to gobble up Wraith, you have a choice to make.</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">Thank you for updating me Ty and for continuing the adventure. I'm sure whatever you've got planned is gonna be fun ^-^<br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorange">Once the initial mistake was cleared up Wraith turned his focus from the other fossil Pokemon to the much larger dragon. Gyarados was not in a good mood, though Stacey thought, she had never seen one with a fair temperament. The water beast had made itself known in grand fashion and she doubted they would pass without risking serious injury. Wraith bubbled the water infront of him eying the much larger foe with savage eyes, his instincts to defead his family or in this case his mistress and since he was the one invading Gyarados' territory he knew he was going to get a brutal fight.<br />
<br />
Omastar had its orders and began lobbing large rocks at the dragon each one making it bellow with pain, this creature had great strengthin its tentacles as the rocks got significantly larger by the end. Omastar isn't finished there as the spikes on its body shine before shooting off like cannons smashing into their target, some lodging themselves between its scales. Meanwhile Wraith had begun to smooth over his skin polishing it in the process making him more streamline and therefore boosting his speed. Wit Omastar finished Wraith Screeched with his little lungs for all he was worth, Stacey wincing even with her hands over her ears. It had the desire effect as Gyarados wwhom with no hands was unable to defend itself and cries out in pain swinging its tail laces with water energy that smashed into the water, unfortunately knocking Omastar in its frenzied attack. Stacey looked appologetically over to Ranjona before looking to her own Pokemon finding him finishing his last attack, the pointy boulders crashing into Gyarados knocking it back. Gyarados furious with the attack on its own turf dove at Wraith, the tiny Kabuto's eyes widenen in shock as it bit down on his shell with icy energy making him squeal and wriggle finally freeing himself from its jaws. Wraith swam back to Stacey not really hurt but freaked out by nearly being swallowed whole. <br />
<br />
Stacey encouraged him on his success and was silently thankful she had not had to cut out her Kabuto from Gyarados' stomach. Ranjona praised Stacey on her rare Pokemon and Stacey hid a small smile under her black hood, she was certainly proud of her own. Ranjona gave her instructions to her partner but suddenly spun around with a panicked look on her face as loud shouts permeate the forest surounding them. Ranjona was so desparate not to get caught that she expressed a need to hurry this battle along, suggesting that they may even have to abandon it. <br />
<br />
<i>'Well thats all well and good'</i> Stacey thought, <i>'but if we don't cripple Gyarados enough there's a good chance we won't get past it,</i>. Wraith was waiting patiently for orders whilst Dru flew to rest behind Stacey having worked off the bloodlust.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then. We need to get this battle moving fast. Wraith <b>Confuse Ray</b> and then strike with <b>Skull Bash</b> and <b>Dragon Claw</b>&quot; she said hoping with Gyarados confused if the need to pass it occurred they could do so with minimal risk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dru, if any of those soldiers break through the forest and get close to us fire your own <b>Confuse Rays</b> and use <b>Secret Power</b>,&quot; Stacey ordered hoping it would disorientate them enough to let them escape.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-family: 'Verdana'"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DeepSkyBlue"><br />
You wake up in an unfamiliar island, mysteriously. You had been in a fight at the cloud garden, but you kept going anyway into the pearl lake, a place that would turn this mystery even more mysterious. After about an hour of walking you reach a giant twinkling lake in which lie some sleeping Lotad and a menagerie of other water types. You look around and take in your beautiful surroundings, while Tortuga takes the time to jump in the lake and splashes around happily. You look at your Pokémon swim around happily and begin to smile. Deciding to play around you pick up a handful of rocks and begin to throw them at Tortuga, who either dodges them or knocks them down with water. Little did you know that the rocks would cause you pain in the rear posterior later on. Unbenounced to you, the rocks which were sinking now were all hitting the same area. Unfortunately that area was right on top of a sleeping young Seel. The Pokémon feels the rocks which were only mildly tapping it and swims up, to see why this would be happening. <br />
<br />
When you see the seal Pokémon come to the surface and stop throwing rocks. It looks at you and turns toward your Squirtle. It cocks its head back and aims at Tortuga. It seems to attack, but it just shoots Water like a professional Sports player. Tortuga sees this and learns one thing: TIME TO PLAY! They both begin splashing at each other and you watch in joy as they play together for a while until their splashing sends something towards the shore. That is when chaos breaks loose. The splashed water hits a sleeping Golduck, which up and looks at the two water Pokémon. It swims up at the Pokémon and shoots water at the Seel, but more like Gun. The shot smacks the poor baby seal in the face. The bully Gulduck begins to laugh at the two baby Pokémon and begins<br />
to taunt (not in the move sort of way) your Turtle Pokémon, who seems angry. <br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: skyblue"><span style="font-size: 9px">Red laughed as his Squirtle was enojying himself in paradise, with his new found friend Seel. Splishing and splashing without a care in the world, today was perfect for a swim. And if those rumors about Clamperl inhabiting this lake, make collecting a few pearls during his visit. In the midst of all the horse play, one of the water pogies must've shot a water in the wrong direction. For a rather disturbed Golduck slowly swam his way toward the pair. Before either Seel or Tortuga could offer an apology, it fires off a blast of water, striking Seel dead on in the face. Tortuga turned toward Seel in shock. Golduck broke out in a laugh, causing the tiny turtle to send a piercing glare (not the move :&lt;) in his direction.<br />
<br />
Why do all the pokemon he had to run into be the violent, relentless pokemon? Why couldn't he run into a field of happy Jigglypuff, or bounce on a jolly Snorlax? Red sighed. Perhaps this time it won't turn into a complete disaster. Most bullies often back down once a group starts an uproar. And the weather was great for the whole team. Red took four pokeballs from his utility belt. With a press of the a button he released a Ledyba, Vigoroth, Magby, and Abra.<br />
<br />
Ledah quickly took to the sky, as Pathos teleported into the arms of his trainer. Shelby on the other hand, ran toward the waters edge, wading her little toes in the lake. Bubbles however couldn't help but notice the golduck taunting his fellow teammate. His anger grew, &quot;Hold on for now Bubbles, we don't want to do anything to hasty..&quot; he whispered to his overactive ape, &quot;.. though you might have yourself a battle today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Red called for Tortuga to come back to shore, with Seel in hand, of course. This situiation will be easier to handle. Tortuga whined alittle, disappointed that he couldn't settle this problem on his own. Today wasn't the day for battling, red thought..</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange"><b><i><u>Ruin Island</u><br />
Somewhere in the forest, Arc_Angel: Reply in DarkOrange</i></b><br />
<br />
Glad things went well in Round One, you congratulate Wraith on a job well done. However, you become frightened by the noises behind you in the forest. Luckily, Drusilla is there to help as you tell her to shine a <b>Confuse Ray</b> into the soldiers’ eyes, as well as striking them with a <b>Secret Power</b>. Drusilla screeched softly as an “ok” and went to the nearest tree. She hung upside down on it, keeping her ears and nose peeled for the soldiers.<br />
<br />
Going back to the Gyarados, Wraith, with his new found speed, quickly shined his own <b>Confuse Ray</b> in Gyarados’ eyes, giving him severe confusion. Omastar shot off some <b>spike</b>s from its body like a <b>cannon</b>, striking Gyarados for a solid hit as well as getting rid of some of the confusion. Wraith follows it up with a <b>Skull Bash</b>, smashing his little body against Gyarados’ face doing great damage and knocking out the last bit of confusion the serpent had left in his mind. Omastar uses a <b>Mud Shot</b> attack to fire a beam of the dirt around the shore at Gyarados, leaving him blind for the round. Wraith channels his <b>dragon</b>ic powers into his <b>claws</b> and rakes them across the serpent, piling on the damage.<br />
<br />
At this point, Gyarados is too hurt to battle, but is not KO’d yet. The snake cannot really see well thanks to the Mud Shot, and another attack or two will likely finish it off. You shout out some more encouraging words to Wraith, as he did most of the damage this time around.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, you hear a loud “THUD!” right next to you. You move your head to where Ranjona was standing, but now see here flat on the ground with a dart sticking out of her leg. Drusilla leaps out from the tree and shines a <b>Confuse Ray</b> into a bush, successfully confusing the soldier hiding in it. You rush over to Ranjona and lift her up onto your shoulders, surprised at how light she is. Then, recalling Wraith, you run to the right of you, not knowing where you’re headed, but knowing you’ll be away from the soldiers. You jump into the forest and start running as fast as you can, the weight of Ranjona slowing you down a bit. Drusilla flies in front of you, using combinations of Confuse Ray and <b>Secret Power</b> to knock away soldiers as you run through the trees. However, the Zubat missed one as you feel sudden, sharp pain in your leg, seeing a dart penetrating your skin. Then another on your arm, which makes you drop Ranjona. You slow to a stop and fall on your knees, then the rest of your body catches up. The last thing you see is Drusilla, flying above your head as you fall asleep.<br />
<br />
<br />
You wake up on a chair. You look in front of you to see metal bars, it appears as though you’ve been thrown into prison. You see a guard outside, smiling and staring at you, with the key to your freedom hanging from his pocket. You feel for your Pokeballs, and find that they were taken away. “Well, well, look who’s awake? Did you have a nice nap?” the guard sneered. You look at the table next to him and see your Pokeballs there. “Where am I?” you demand, “And where is Ranjona?” “You’re in our base, and since you’ve been a nuisance this whole damn time, we locked you up so you could do no harm. As for you friend—let’s just say you’re doing better than she is.” He said as he left.<br />
<br />
What will you do?<br />
<br />
<b><i>Amor Temple, Khom?s: Reply in DarkOrange</i></b><br />
<br />
After running away from your involuntary misbehavior, you set your sights upon the Amor Temple. You stop for a moment to think of a good name for your new Aipom. You decide on the name “Grinder” and continue your way into the temple, hoping to unravel your past as well as having a good old-fashioned adventure.<br />
<br />
At first glance, the place is dark. You send out your Cyndaquil, Torchlight, in hopes of seeing a bit better. “Alright Torchlight, flare up on your back so then we can see whatever is in here.” You tell him. The fire echidna nods as his back erupts in flames, allowing you to see clearly inside the temple. Zubats fly around every now and then, surprised by the sudden light created by Torchlight. You shielded your head with your arms as these Zubats flew around. “Hmm, this place is a bit boring.” You say, as you do not see or hear anything special.<br />
<br />
However, you spoke too soon as you see a body of a man with long gray hair. Even from your distance away, you can see that he is very thin and gets hardly enough to eat. A bit hesitant, you walk to the man, who whispers under his breath. “What?” you ask him. He lunges and pulls your head close to his, your ear right next to his mouth. “Help me.” He whispers harshly as he lets you go. You jump back a bit, frightened by the insane man, but feel a bit sympathetic that he’s been stuck here for who knows how long. “H-How can I help you?” you ask. “Get me out of this place. I feed off of the plants that grow in here, and they taste horrible! Just please, get me out of here! This places scares the shit out of me as the Dark and Psychic type Pokemon move about secretly, but I can hear them. They’re driving me insane...LOOK THERE’S ONE RIGHT NEXT TO YOU!” he starts yelling. You panic and look to either side, but see nothing. “Are you sure there was one next to me?” you ask, a bit puzzled. “Are you blind?! It’s still there, WATCH OUT!” he says, jumping and pulling you away. You wiggle out of his grasp. “Look, man, you’re crazy. And why can’t you get out of here, the entrance is right there.” You say, pointing to the light. “No, the Pokemon won’t let me leave, I have to go through this entire temple, they tell me. I’ve been stuck here for years and can never find a way out,” he says sadly, “Please help me find a way out.”<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: silver"><b><i><u>Brine Island</u><br />
Salin City, Lemon~Lime: Reply in Silver</i></b><br />
<br />
Excited as you see Orion finally, you release your Magnemite along with the other two imprisoned in the plastic walls. However, immediately afterwards, an alarm sounds and a red light goes off. A wall opens up to reveal a giant robot, with a red light blaring as well. “Target identified.” It says, aiming its lasers right at you and the Pokemon. You decide it’s time to make this a party and release all of your Pokemon in your party to destroy the robot as quickly as possible. &quot;We're all gonna have to work together to take this thing down. Ditto, I need you to Transform into something like a Wobbufett and use Mirror Coat to reflect anything the machine throws at me. You two Magnemites and Orion! I need all of you to shock the machine with x2 Thunderhocks, try to damage its internal systems. Pear, x2 Growths to give yourself some power. Gek, Brain Freeze to wreak havoc on its internal wiring, then use Strength to take off one of its arms if you can. Scorpio, x2 Wing Attacks to take off two more of its arms. Klaus, Thunderbolt along with the Magnemite, then phase inside using your ghostly Sableye powers or whatever and Fire Punch to get a fire started in its insides. Then get the heck outta there.&quot; You say, giving a speech of orders.<br />
<br />
The Pokemon spring into action as Ditto transforms into a Wobbuffet and uses <b>Mirror Coat</b> to make the lasers bounce off and strike the robot instead, making a hole in his frame. The three Magnemites all fire a couple of <b>Thundershock</b>s at the robot with Klaus firing a larger <b>Thunderbolt</b>, which immediately made the robot short circuit a bit as well as frying his internal wiring. Pear the Bellsprout uses <b>Growth</b> twice, powering up if needed later on. However, that doesn’t seem to be the case as Gek the Krabby fires a thing beam of ice, using the custom move <b>Brain Freeze</b>. The beam enters through a the aforementioned hole in his frame and hits the wiring to make it shut down. All the while, Scorpio slams each laser off of the robot with a pair of <b>Wing Attack</b>s. Klaus wraps things up by slamming his fist into the laser made hole, <b>punch</b>ing the inside of the robot to start a <b>fire</b> in his wiring. <b>Level up for Orion, Gek, Scorpio and Klaus</b>.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, alright!” you yell, but quickly recall all of your Pokemon. With the other Magnemite and Ditto following you out of the lab as the robot explodes and makes a big fire. You rush back out of the tunnel and back outside into the city where you see the angsty kid from before. However, he seems to have fallen asleep alongside the dead Houndoom. You don’t bother waking him up and move along through the city. You suddenly hear a cry for help. “Help, he’s stolen my Pokemon!” you hear, then see a man in a mask running past you, then a woman running after him.<br />
<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px">Here is the third wave, any questions about Cascadia PM me or Tyranidos.</span><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DeepSkyBlue"><u><b><br />

Relising that bullies normally leave if there is an uproar you call the two water pokemon back to the shore and release </span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DeepSkyBlue">the rest of your pokemon, and your tactics work, making the Golduck run away to another part of the lake. Tortuga seems happy that he can resume playing but the Seel notices something rippling in the water. Sure enough, a wave appears to have formed and in the distance you see it getting closer, and who is Riding it? Non other than your unfriendly neighboorhood <s>Spiderman</s> Golduck... with help. Alongside him on the left rides a certain Blue Cricodilian, otherwise known as a Feraligatr, on the right comes a white marine mammal, a <i>Dewgong</i>.<br />
<br />
The wave hits the shore as the three pokemon stop 15 feet away and look at you. Seel seems to know the Dewgong as it hides behind you. It begins to whimper when it sees the Dewgong looking at it, perhaps they know each other? The water pokemon look at your pokemon and begin to laugh, as if they were any better! You should show them what bullying little pokemon can do to someone. Or you could walk away, but you'd be leaving the Seel defenceless. The Feraligatr looks at Bubbles and scoffs, angering it. Bubbles seems to want to battle, alongside Tortuga, but Seel seems like it wants to hide in a hole.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span><br />

For a few seconds you both can't budge them but finally you manage to pull them apart for a few inches, only for them to get stuck together again with the magnetism. After several attempts you begin to think you're never going to manage it when you separate them. The force of being pulled apart sends you tumbling back towards the wall, the Bronzor manages to not get hit as it lands on you. Phoenix on the other hand isn't so lucky as he lands on the Magneton. They are both magnetically attracting to each other again so the Magneton floats off before it can get attached again. The little mirror pokemon looks at you and begins to send a message to you, <i>&quot;I was stuck to that thing for a while, thanks. Could I come with you? I just need to find an escape, and with you I probably will. Plus I know where the Generator is, I could lead you to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
</i>Before you can answer to that a duet of two Magnetons comes into the room, probably attracted by the noise of the earlier struggle. They all look at you and decide they want to give you a run for your money, and you can feel the electricity all around you.<br />
What will you do?<br />

<br />
The whole time this conversation happens all you understand are the words Carnivine, carnivine and carnivine. The Carnivine realised this and begins to do the most ridiculous came of charades ever. First it points in your direction <i>&quot;Youuuu.&quot;</i> It begins to swing its arms as if there was a net in them,<i> &quot;Help catch flyes.</i>&quot; It then begins to make buzzing noises, then proceeds to look at you with.... <b><i>Puppy dog eyes</i></b>.

As you finish your orders Ghastly looks at Parabola and begins to speak of its apparent super-strength. &quot;You are DOOMED! You have a Psychic type pokemon attack ME!? First of all his attacks won't damage me at all. There is no way you can live, I am--&quot; Again you see Parabola hit it with a beam of Psychic energy. Boy was that thing getting annoying and it seemed to be distracted. You see the ceiling becoming cracked in many places and that chips of if start falling down, followed by bigger pieces that begin pelting the Ghastly like rocks sliding, but with heavy ceiling instead. You hear Parabola Yelp in triumph at this from a few feet by you.<br />
<br />
The Ghastly realises what is happening too late and gets covered up in the ceiling stones. It manages to escape using its ghostly abilities. However, to do that it needed to leave itself vulmerable, getting hit by Parabola's Psychic beam again. The Ghastly smiles at the fact that you had used three moves, as the perish song would take effect soon. It also seems to be glad, as it only had a quarter of its health left, you feel pain as the Curse also begins to take effect as well. &quot;You are worthless,&quot; as he says that you see Prestige's barrier break, and the sibling Ghastly ram forward but not toward you... towards the Ghastly! Shocked to see itself deing betrayed it does nothing as the Siblings use a sort of techniche to use Fire Punch on it. They both Keep this up, repeatedly saying &quot;Where is our father!?&quot; It feels the pain and falls to the ground but not before it can send you a semi-Hypnotic message. You are in a dark room with strange purple markings in it alogside a bloodstained wall, the siblings are next to you in their human forms, and Polkadot speaks as you look forward &quot;So this is where he is.&quot; You look at the room again and it ends. You wake up to see a Leveled up Parabola, Prestige, a fainted Ghastly and two sad-looking siblings,in their human form, who have no idea where their father might be. You should sort this mess out.</span></span></div>

Another pull and Rocky was free from the grip of the famished carnivine, leaving Paul to hold his pokémon tightly in his arms and look deep into the small, beady black eyes of the fly trap that stood before him. While he studied the plant, what with its large, thorny jaws and colourful tendrils that served as legs, he realized that he had never before felt so afraid. Evidently the plants had done a poor job of trying o be cute, what with their rather bug-like appearance and gnashing teeth. When the smaller carnivine emerged from the underbrush, Paul jumped backwards and let out a yelp. He brought Rocky up to his face and used her to shield his view of the flytraps, and sighed in relief when his view was obstructed of the monsters that stood before him.<br />
<br />
However, while shielding her trainer, the seedot’s eyes widened as she studied the gaze of both the adult carnivine and its child. For a split second her heart split in two, and she reacted by turning around, slapping her trainer in the face (“Whoa-no!” he cried), falling to the ground, and beckoning for the flytraps to follow her back to the glowing mass of horny illumise.<br />
<br />
“<i>Just one thing,</i>” she yipped, motioning to Paul. “<i>You leave Stupid alone or I’ll rock smash ya.</i>”<br />
<br />
Paul rubbed his throbbing cheek and began to follow his seedot and constantly looked behind his shoulder in fear of the carnivine clan behind him. He began to itch and whimper nervously and stoop around his foot-and-a-half-tall pokémon in hope that the giant plants wouldn’t try anything nasty. </span></span></div>

Excited as you see Orion finally, you release your Magnemite along with the other two imprisoned in the plastic walls. However, immediately afterwards, an alarm sounds and a red light goes off. A wall opens up to reveal a giant robot, with a red light blaring as well. “Target identified.” It says, aiming its lasers right at you and the Pokemon. You decide it’s time to make this a party and release all of your Pokemon in your party to destroy the robot as quickly as possible. &quot;We're all gonna have to work together to take this thing down. Ditto, I need you to Transform into something like a Wobbufett and use Mirror Coat to reflect anything the machine throws at me. You two Magnemites and Orion! I need all of you to shock the machine with x2 Thunderhocks, try to damage its internal systems. Pear, x2 Growths to give yourself some power. Gek, Brain Freeze to wreak havoc on its internal wiring, then use Strength to take off one of its arms if you can. Scorpio, x2 Wing Attacks to take off two more of its arms. Klaus, Thunderbolt along with the Magnemite, then phase inside using your ghostly Sableye powers or whatever and Fire Punch to get a fire started in its insides. Then get the heck outta there.&quot; You say, giving a speech of orders.<br />
<br />
The Pokemon spring into action as Ditto transforms into a Wobbuffet and uses <b>Mirror Coat</b> to make the lasers bounce off and strike the robot instead, making a hole in his frame. The three Magnemites all fire a couple of <b>Thundershock</b>s at the robot with Klaus firing a larger <b>Thunderbolt</b>, which immediately made the robot short circuit a bit as well as frying his internal wiring. Pear the Bellsprout uses <b>Growth</b> twice, powering up if needed later on. However, that doesn’t seem to be the case as Gek the Krabby fires a thing beam of ice, using the custom move <b>Brain Freeze</b>. The beam enters through a the aforementioned hole in his frame and hits the wiring to make it shut down. All the while, Scorpio slams each laser off of the robot with a pair of <b>Wing Attack</b>s. Klaus wraps things up by slamming his fist into the laser made hole, <b>punch</b>ing the inside of the robot to start a <b>fire</b> in his wiring. <b>Level up for Orion, Gek, Scorpio and Klaus</b>.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, alright!” you yell, but quickly recall all of your Pokemon. With the other Magnemite and Ditto following you out of the lab as the robot explodes and makes a big fire. You rush back out of the tunnel and back outside into the city where you see the angsty kid from before. However, he seems to have fallen asleep alongside the dead Houndoom. You don’t bother waking him up and move along through the city. You suddenly hear a cry for help. “Help, he’s stolen my Pokemon!” you hear, then see a man in a mask running past you, then a woman running after him.<br />
<br />
What will you do now?</span></span>

The robot turned out to be no match for nine Pokemon. All it could do was sit and watch as it suffered through both an elemental barrage and its own lasers being reflected at it. Finally, the robot just gave up and exploded. &quot;Hooray!&quot; Mike shouted. &quot;Now get back inside your Pokeballs before we all burn.&quot; Recalling all his Pokemon (except for the Magnemites and Ditto, who couldn't be), Mike rushed away from the large fire the robot had started inside the warehouse. By now, everything was either in ruins, shredded by rocks from the Geodude's Explosion, or dying a flaming death IN FLAMES. &quot;Good riddance.&quot; Mike muttered as he made it out of the warehouse's front door. &quot;I'm glad we don't have to go back to that crazy place.&quot; Stopping to catch his breath outside, he saw the kid once more. Apparently, all the angsting had tired him out and he slept on the ground beside the dead Houndoom in a rather touching scene. Mike turned to the three Pokemon behind him and said &quot;Don't have any hard feelings. He seems good on the inside, and he's just lost a friend.&quot; Incredulously, no one in the area seemed to notice the catastrophe that was taking place. &quot;Hey!&quot; Mike shouted, waving his hands in the air. &quot;Somebody call 911! There's a boy whose Houndoom has been killed and a Warehouse on fire!&quot; Motioning for the Pokemon to follow him, he ran out of the area into the city, not wanting to be there when the police showed up. &quot;I wonder where Harris is now,&quot; he muttered. Turning back to Ditto, he said, &quot;Now we can finally get you back to your owner.&quot; Suddenly a cry for help rang out. &quot;Help, he's stolen my Pokemon!&quot; Mike sighed. &quot;Or not. Well, we'll get you back right after this.&quot; A masked man ran in front, of him, soon followed by an absolutely distraught woman. &quot;Time to come out!&quot; Mike said, releasing Pear and Gek. All of them ran after the masked man and the lady. &quot;Stop, fiend!&quot; Mike yelled for dramatic effect. &quot;Pear! <b>Sleep Powder</b> the masked man's face before he can do anything! Gek! You <b>Ice Beam</b> him to the ground! You two Magnemite go over there to help if anything nasty gets underway! If not, just go back to where you were before you were kidnapped! You're free now!&quot; With the Ditto following him, Mike yelled to the lady &quot;Calm down! My Pokemon are on him! What happened?&quot; </span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange"><b><i><u>Ruin Island</u><br />
Somewhere in the forest, Arc_Angel: Reply in DarkOrange</i></b><br />
<br />
Glad things went well in Round One, you congratulate Wraith on a job well done. However, you become frightened by the noises behind you in the forest. Luckily, Drusilla is there to help as you tell her to shine a <b>Confuse Ray</b> into the soldiers’ eyes, as well as striking them with a <b>Secret Power</b>. Drusilla screeched softly as an “ok” and went to the nearest tree. She hung upside down on it, keeping her ears and nose peeled for the soldiers.<br />
<br />
Going back to the Gyarados, Wraith, with his new found speed, quickly shined his own <b>Confuse Ray</b> in Gyarados’ eyes, giving him severe confusion. Omastar shot off some <b>spike</b>s from its body like a <b>cannon</b>, striking Gyarados for a solid hit as well as getting rid of some of the confusion. Wraith follows it up with a <b>Skull Bash</b>, smashing his little body against Gyarados’ face doing great damage and knocking out the last bit of confusion the serpent had left in his mind. Omastar uses a <b>Mud Shot</b> attack to fire a beam of the dirt around the shore at Gyarados, leaving him blind for the round. Wraith channels his <b>dragon</b>ic powers into his <b>claws</b> and rakes them across the serpent, piling on the damage.<br />
<br />
At this point, Gyarados is too hurt to battle, but is not KO’d yet. The snake cannot really see well thanks to the Mud Shot, and another attack or two will likely finish it off. You shout out some more encouraging words to Wraith, as he did most of the damage this time around.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, you hear a loud “THUD!” right next to you. You move your head to where Ranjona was standing, but now see here flat on the ground with a dart sticking out of her leg. Drusilla leaps out from the tree and shines a <b>Confuse Ray</b> into a bush, successfully confusing the soldier hiding in it. You rush over to Ranjona and lift her up onto your shoulders, surprised at how light she is. Then, recalling Wraith, you run to the right of you, not knowing where you’re headed, but knowing you’ll be away from the soldiers. You jump into the forest and start running as fast as you can, the weight of Ranjona slowing you down a bit. Drusilla flies in front of you, using combinations of Confuse Ray and <b>Secret Power</b> to knock away soldiers as you run through the trees. However, the Zubat missed one as you feel sudden, sharp pain in your leg, seeing a dart penetrating your skin. Then another on your arm, which makes you drop Ranjona. You slow to a stop and fall on your knees, then the rest of your body catches up. The last thing you see is Drusilla, flying above your head as you fall asleep.<br />
<br />
<br />
You wake up on a chair. You look in front of you to see metal bars, it appears as though you’ve been thrown into prison. You see a guard outside, smiling and staring at you, with the key to your freedom hanging from his pocket. You feel for your Pokeballs, and find that they were taken away. “Well, well, look who’s awake? Did you have a nice nap?” the guard sneered. You look at the table next to him and see your Pokeballs there. “Where am I?” you demand, “And where is Ranjona?” “You’re in our base, and since you’ve been a nuisance this whole damn time, we locked you up so you could do no harm. As for you friend—let’s just say you’re doing better than she is.” He said as he left.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Drusilla, now more lucid as her blood rush fades flits back and forth on guard for the soldiers once more ready too attack should they dare tread near. Stacey rationalising that the Gyarados needed to at least be incapacitated before they considered moving on gave Wraith his orders the little fossil gurgling in the water happy to get another pieces of this dragon. Dru had flown over to a large tree and hung from it steathily, her wings wrapped around her like the little vampire bat she was and Stacey smiled, she had not doubt that she would ward off any threats. <br />
<br />
Wraith fired a beam of bright white lght getting Gyarados head on its face contorting in confusion suddenly forgetting what it was doing. Omastar moved into action too and shot off more rock-like spikes each booming like a cannon as they struck the serpent bringing a little clarity back into its eyes as well as pain. Not to be out matched Wraiths red eyes glowed with glee as he sped off towards the Gyarados his streamlines body making his passage through the water a breeze and lauched himself up crashing into the sea dragon with his skull throwing its head back. Gyarados whipped back round snarling in absolute fury at the much smaller Pokemon but that is cut off as a wave of mud s thrown from the shore catching it right in its eyes leaving its vision severely reduced. Whilst still in close range Wraith's little claws glowed with a brilliant blue hue and he leapt up raking them all down the draogns hide leaving small welts in thier wake. <br />
<br />
Gyarads falls to the lake causing a small wave in his descent and looks too injured to continue but is still conscious. Wraith looked over to his mistress as she smiled at him encouraging him for the job well done. This would be a good point to pull out and get moving. Suddenly she heard a thud and turned to see Ranjona land next to her on the ground out for the count.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot; she whispered as she notices the dark sticking out of her leg. Her eyes widened and she called for Dru who ripped off the tree searching for the threat ready to drink from more throats if her mistress allowed. Spotting the first few soldiers to erput from the tree line she fired a beam of white light similar to Wraiths earlier confusing them and watching with glee as they bumped into each other and the surrounding woodland. Stacey quickly returned Wraith to his Pokeall and hurried over to Ranjona and picked uper up placing her over shoulder grunting at the effort required and began to drag her away from danger. She knew that Dru would follow her once she had dealth with the threat and began running as fast as she could into the forest, her movements greatly hampered by the extra weight she was carrying. <br />
<br />
Having disposed of the first wqave Dru quickly flew up and ahead of Stacey keeping pace and uses her Secret Power that oozes from the ground to strike the next few soliders that bore down on them. Wicning Stacey stumbled as she felt a sharp prick in her leg and looked down to see a dart lodge there in the exposed flesh. Pushing forward she tried to ward of the hazy feeling over coming her when another dart struck her in her shoulder through the silver material of her short jacket making her drop Ranjona. She stumbles forward almost comically falling to her knees as an overwhelming urge to sleep overcomes her. She looks up to see Dru flying over head mumbling worriedly to herself that 'Mummy was falling, Mummy was fallin', Stacey managed to mumble &quot;Go Princess now, go&quot; urging her to flee before she collapsed to the ground. <br />
<br />
Groaning as she woke from her unatural slumber Stacey opened her dark blue eyes taking in her blurry new environment. She was propped up on a chair in what looked like a dingy little cell. How had she managed to stay sleeping on the chair without falling off? she wonderd absentmindedly. As her vision returns to her she see a guard behind the bars smirking at her cockily. She felt her hood pulled back and reached for it pulling it over her face once more, though they had seen her face she prefered it this way, it was her defence mechanism and the stark skull on the front gave her a more terrifying appearance, though she doubted it would help in this situation. Running hand along her belt she realised that her Pokeballs had been removed from her possession, well she wouldn't expect any less of the guards unless they were really stupid. Lookign around the room she couldn't see Ranjona, had they locked her away in another cell?<br />
<br />
“Well, well, look who’s awake? Did you have a nice nap?” the guard sneered and Stacey rolled her eyes unsee beneath her hood.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've had better&quot; she muttered crossing her legs on the chair waiting for more similar comments to be thrown. She peered outide and the guard looking for Ranjona and the guards smirk widened.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm definately not coming back to this hotel, such shoddy service,&quot; she said snorting sarcastically. She couldn't help it when she felt nervous or fear she tended to act this way. The guard was happy to oblidge her with her location, 'in their base' hmmm and he gleefully rubbed in the afact that Ranjona was suffering which brought on a low growl from the ghost trainer. The guard then left her with her thoughts. <br />
<br />
Stacey got up off the chair and paced around her small prison kicking the bars as she passed testing their integrity; they seemed sound unfortunately. Sitting back down on the chair she sighed feeling guilty for having got them into this situation, if only she had heeded Ranjona's warnings and tried to make it past the Gyarados they may not be in this situation. <br />
<br />
Stacey's eyes widened with hope, Dru! She had been flying before she was downed, maybe she had gotten away. If so then she would coming searching for her Mummy ... or not. Maybe she founda haord of Pokemon to feed off, that would be a more realistic situation. Sighing again Stacey pushed off the chair resisting the urge to kick it into the cell bars and paced again. How the hell would she get out of this and get Ranjona away from harm?<br />
<br />
Stacey crossed her arms against her chest and leant back against the bars. If the guards were all male there was the old luring them with her wiley feminine charms trick though it would make her feel sick. Or maybe she could lure one close enough to grab him and get the keys. Stretching out against the bars she placed her arms above her head her long legs covered in only her thigh high shorts, striped black and silver stockings and black leather boots revealing enough flesh to entice any man. She grimaced, she was not good at this but it was worth a try.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do your <i>guests</i> not get drinks around here, I could use some water I'm feeling so hot.&quot; she said wincing at every disgusting word. As soon as a guard showed up getting close enough she would grab him slamm him against the bars until he was unconscious or she got bored, grab the keys and escape ... though know her luck she'd get female guard.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DarkOrange">Judging by Parabola state of mind you consider yourself lost and order Parabola's next moves. As you finish your orders Ghastly looks at Parabola and begins to speak of its apparent super-strength. &quot;You are DOOMED! You have a Psychic type pokemon attack ME!? First of all his attacks won't damage me at all. There is no way you can live, I am--&quot; Again you see Parabola hit it with a beam of Psychic energy.

The Ghastly realises what is happening too late and gets covered up in the ceiling stones. It manages to escape using its ghostly abilities. However, to do that it needed to leave itself vulmerable, getting hit by Parabola's Psychic beam again. The Ghastly smiles at the fact that you had used three moves, as the perish song would take effect soon. It also seems to be glad, as it only had a quarter of its health left, you feel pain as the Curse also begins to take effect as well. &quot;You are worthless,&quot; as he says that you see Prestige's barrier break, and the sibling Ghastly ram forward but not toward you... towards the Ghastly! Shocked to see itself deing betrayed it does nothing as the Siblings use a sort of techniche to use Fire Punch on it. They both Keep this up, repeatedly saying &quot;Where is our father!?&quot; It feels the pain and falls to the ground but not before it can send you a semi-Hypnotic message.

</blockquote><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DeepSkyBlue"><u><b><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DarkOrange">The Gastly began to provoke Alina and Parabola, bragging about its amazing strength, such as saying things like &quot;You are doomed! You have a Psychic type Pokemon attack ME? First of all his attacks won't damage me at all--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, they will,&quot; Alina mumbled, scratching her chin. &quot;Last time I checked your typing is indeed weak to Psychic attacks...&quot;<br />
<br />
It appeared that the Gastly was paying no mind to the trainer, and continued with his ramblings until Parabola shot yet another colorful beam of energy straight at the Gastly. <i>&quot;He's pretty annoying, Miss 'Lina&quot;</i> said Parabola, rarely saying anything besides portraying what he was thinking through illusions. But, Alina couldn't help but smile at Parabola's seemingly calm and cheerful disposition, despite the pain in her gut. That smile, however, immediately disappeared when she saw that the ceiling was cracking, and looked as if it was to collapse any minute. Huge pieces of the ceiling fell to the ground on top of the Gastly, in the form of an improvised rock slide. Parabola gave a cheer of triumph. His life was complete: he had totally pissed off another Pokemon via cheap tricks and cleverness.<br />
<br />
The Gastly escaped from its rocky tomb with the help of its ghostly state, but it left itself vulnerable to other attacks. Parabola saw this as a perfect opprotunity to complete his orders and shot yet another Psychic beam. The Baltoy spun around, humming to himself rather cheerily, even though he knew his time was up. The Gastly had realized this as well, and smiled, saying &quot;You truly are worthless...&quot;<br />
<br />
At that moment Prestige's Barrier broke, allowing the other two Gastly to pass through. &quot;Shit,&quot; cursed Alina and Prestige, but the two siblings didn't attack them. Instead, they glided forward, straight for the evil spector that had imprisoned them for so long. The evil Gastly appeared to be shocked at this sudden betrayal, apparently not seeing this coming at all. It couldn't defend itself due to the shock as the siblings pummeled the Gastly, crying out &quot;Where is our father?! Where is our father?!&quot; <br />
<br />
The Gastly fell to the ground, but had just enough energy to send Alina a message: A dark room, with strange purple markings on it, a bloodstained wall... This... is where he is? The vision had ended at that moment and Alina woke to find Parabola spinning about the room gleefully, obviously celebrating his victory. Prestige hovered over Alina, prodding her with his hand to see if she was alright... apparently she had fainted, or something, since she was curled up on the ground in a ball. <i>&quot;I'd thought the curse had got to you, or something,&quot;</i> Prestige said as he gave a sigh of relief. Alina said nothing and sat up, rubbing her stomach. The pain was gone, and the Gastly was finally defeated after its long reign of terror. It wasn't a happy ending for everybody, however, as the two siblings stood a few feet away from Alina in human form, looking solemn and hopeless.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, cheer up,&quot; Alina began as she attempted to stand. She felt dizzy and stumbled slightly, but managed to stand none the less. &quot;I... I think I know where he is. We need to find a room... with these weird purple markings and stuff. And there's blood on the wall. Yeah. We'll go look for that room in a minute, but first thing's first.&quot; <br />
<br />
Alina shuffled through the bag at her side, pushing aside berries, plushes, TMs, and multiple other doo-dads until she found what she was looking for. She pulled out a rather strange looking Pokeball called a Ghost Ball, which seemed to have a sort of blue mist surrounding it. Throwing the <a href="http://forums.upnetwork.net/showpost.php?p=48650&amp;postcount=1904" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.upnetwork.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D48650%26postcount%3D1904&amp;hash=eaaf19e5a5c52e0affad1989111c1bfb" rel="nofollow noopener">Ghost Ball</a> at the Gastly, it promptly popped open and sucked the Ghost Pokemon inside, attempting to capture the Pokemon once and for all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, after I capture this dude we can move on...&quot; smiled Alina, waving at Polkadot and Purple. Prestige gave her a &quot;wtf?&quot; look and said <i>&quot;Why would you want that satanic creature?&quot;</i><br />
<br />
&quot;It's a Gastly,&quot; Alina answered, a blank look upon her face. Prestige continued to stare and replied, <i>&quot;It's evil. It will kill you in your sleep.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Psh, naaah, it's just confused. It's not <i>really</i> evil, you know,&quot; Alina shrugged, totally convinced that her and the Gastly would get along perfectly fine. Prestige seemed to grow slightly pale at her lack of common sense, although Parabola appeared to be perfectly fine with the idea of having a homicidal Pokemon coming along on their adventures. In fact, he seemed rather excited. Alina returned Parabola to his own Pokeball as she stood by and watched the Ghost Ball twitch back and forth, awaiting the capture of another team member...</span></span></b></u></span></span></span></div>

<b><i>Amor Temple, Khom?s: Reply in DarkOrange</i></b><br />
<br />
After running away from your involuntary misbehavior, you set your sights upon the Amor Temple. You stop for a moment to think of a good name for your new Aipom. You decide on the name “Grinder” and continue your way into the temple, hoping to unravel your past as well as having a good old-fashioned adventure.<br />
<br />
At first glance, the place is dark. You send out your Cyndaquil, Torchlight, in hopes of seeing a bit better. “Alright Torchlight, flare up on your back so then we can see whatever is in here.” You tell him. The fire echidna nods as his back erupts in flames, allowing you to see clearly inside the temple. Zubats fly around every now and then, surprised by the sudden light created by Torchlight. You shielded your head with your arms as these Zubats flew around. “Hmm, this place is a bit boring.” You say, as you do not see or hear anything special.<br />
<br />
However, you spoke too soon as you see a body of a man with long gray hair. Even from your distance away, you can see that he is very thin and gets hardly enough to eat. A bit hesitant, you walk to the man, who whispers under his breath. “What?” you ask him. He lunges and pulls your head close to his, your ear right next to his mouth. “Help me.” He whispers harshly as he lets you go. You jump back a bit, frightened by the insane man, but feel a bit sympathetic that he’s been stuck here for who knows how long. “H-How can I help you?” you ask. “Get me out of this place. I feed off of the plants that grow in here, and they taste horrible! Just please, get me out of here! This places scares the shit out of me as the Dark and Psychic type Pokemon move about secretly, but I can hear them. They’re driving me insane...LOOK THERE’S ONE RIGHT NEXT TO YOU!” he starts yelling. You panic and look to either side, but see nothing. “Are you sure there was one next to me?” you ask, a bit puzzled. “Are you blind?! It’s still there, WATCH OUT!” he says, jumping and pulling you away. You wiggle out of his grasp. “Look, man, you’re crazy. And why can’t you get out of here, the entrance is right there.” You say, pointing to the light. “No, the Pokemon won’t let me leave, I have to go through this entire temple, they tell me. I’ve been stuck here for years and can never find a way out,” he says sadly, “Please help me find a way out.”<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">The girl looked back on how he had just treated this starving man. He is being tormented by pokémon. He survives off aging plants. She had been in situations that were all too familiar to his suffering. Why did she just call him crazy? This situation was clearly beyond his control, but probably not hers. She decided she was willing to help out. &quot;Look, I'm sorry how I reacted earlier. I'm just not, you know... me.&quot; She sighed. &quot;Look, I just saved the Oniero ruins. And how do they repay me? They chase me out.&quot; She paused. &quot;Let me get to the point. I'll help out, okay?&quot;</span></span></div>

<br />
</i></span></span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DeepSkyBlue"> You are annoyed by the fact that you normally only get attacked by vicious, angry pokemon and not happy non-violent ones. Relising that bullies normally leave if there is an uproar you call the two water pokemon back to the shore and release </span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DeepSkyBlue">the rest of your pokemon, and your tactics work, making the Golduck run away to another part of the lake. Tortuga seems happy that he can resume playing but the Seel notices something rippling in the water. Sure enough, a wave appears to have formed and in the distance you see it getting closer, and who is Riding it? Non other than your unfriendly neighboorhood <s>Spiderman</s> Golduck... with help. Alongside him on the left rides a certain Blue Cricodilian, otherwise known as a Feraligatr, on the right comes a white marine mammal, a <i>Dewgong</i>.<br />
<br />
The wave hits the shore as the three pokemon stop 15 feet away and look at you. Seel seems to know the Dewgong as it hides behind you. It begins to whimper when it sees the Dewgong looking at it, perhaps they know each other? The water pokemon look at your pokemon and begin to laugh, as if they were any better! You should show them what bullying little pokemon can do to someone. Or you could walk away, but you'd be leaving the Seel defenceless. The Feraligatr looks at Bubbles and scoffs, angering it. Bubbles seems to want to battle, alongside Tortuga, but Seel seems like it wants to hide in a hole.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DeepSkyBlue">after all that trouble to make a small group look big, it ends in a big group looking bigger. or something like that. &quot;gosh darn it..&quot; red muttered, the golduck from earlier stood along side his newly formed team, mocking the group. feraligatr looks mighty fierce, and dewgong isn't so tiny either. bubbles could hold his own with feraligatr, he thought. Bubbles stood next to him, he breathing uncontrolable, foam forming around his mouth. tortuga on the other hand was acting as heroic as ever, not fazed much by the size of the opposing side. red worried about his never ending attempts to save something, which often got him into trouble more than anything.<br />
<br />
pathos, who was curdled in Red's arms, teleported along side 'tuga, cackling loudly as the dewgong attempts to get a looksee at the seel. his small frame and loving appearance, he didn't look like much of a challenge. but before his eyes, Pathos was covered in a white aura, overtaking his entire body. his form growing rabidly, molding itself into an entirely different pokemon. kadabra, rather than using a twisted spoon as it's usual holding item, pathos held a ruby pendant wrapped around his wrist. everytime he uses any type of energy attack, it glows an eery red, though it supposidly increases the attraction of the oppisite gender. Red looked on, overwhelmed wit hsshokc at what just transpired, &quot;Whoa then monkey ares in the barbian fck munckey!&quot;<br />
<br />
now that things seemed to even out abit more, it felt apropriate to order attacks. that seel needed protecting, and seeing as there as anyone else to do it, red felt it best to go ahead and tr tyo do the right thing. &quot;Pathos, use your <b>fatal attraction</b> to find the female in this group. That'll be your target. Afterwards, <b>Attract</b>ing it further might help also.&quot;...<br />
Pathos listened intently, he also had something of his own in mind. after the final attractrion, a <b>sweet kiss</b> would be nice. <br />
Bubbles was roaring to go, his claws quivering with excitment. &quot;alright Bubbz, <b>focus</b> your <b>energy</b> for now. Then put that energy into a massive <b>faint attack</b> into the golduck, only hinting that it was the only male of group as of now, ending an a painful, skin tearing <b>crush claw</b>.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright 'tuga, let out a dusky <b>Haze</b>, leave this battlefield hard to see, then leave an <b>aqua ring </b>to collect health later on..&quot;</span></span></div>

</i></span></span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DeepSkyBlue">As you gave your orders to your Abra takes the form of another pokemon, its evolution, Kadabra. After you give your pokemon their orders they set to work. On the other hand, your opponents prepare for their own attacks. Pathos begins it by searching the three enemy pokemon to attract and finds out that only one pokemon is a female... The Feraligatr! It looks at the Abra who dances around in a distracting manner, then as they lock eyes, the Feraligatr, being struck by the apparent beauty of the Kadabra, doesn't realise a black ray entering it's eyes and lulling it to sleep. Pathos realises the redundancy of trying to attract a sleeping pokemon and <b>kisses </b>her <b>sweet</b>ly on the cheek, as she yawns one more time as she dreams of her boyfriend, and her<b> Fatal Attraction</b>.<br />
<br />
Somewhere alse on the area Bubbles begins to focus his energy. Or at least he tries, but is stopped by the Golduck using an <b>aqua jet </b>to stop his energy from focusing. However, as the Golduck had gotten close enough for the<b> Faint Attack</b> to hit and knock the Golduck ten feet into the air! As the duck pokemon came down Bubbles catches it and<b> Crushes</b> its left arm with its <b>Claw</b>. The Golduck feels the pain of the attack and doubles over, falling into the water in the process. This leaves the Dewgong. Boy is that important.<br />
<br />
As Tortuga begins to create a<b> haze </b>around itself, the Seel, and the Dewgong it is stopped from happening with a dose of <b>icy wind</b>, courtesy of the Dewgong. However as it begins to make the wind more powerful to attack it is countered by the Seel who angrily counters with its own<b> Icy wind</b>, that not only matches the power of the Older seal pokemon, but outmatches it! As It does that Tortuga Makes a <b>ring </b>of <b>water </b>around itself to heal itself later. The Seel looks back at Tortuga and you and it shows in it's eyes, It wants Tortuga's help to defeat the scarier looking seal. You might as well, considering that the Feraligatr is sleeping and The Golduck is distracted by the pain in its arm. Bubbles looks a bit ruffed up, but not in the way that it could break down any time soon.<br />

Arguing about the capture with Prestige you throw the special Ghost Ball. You watch the Ghost Ball shake in place. It shakes once, your heart beating slowly and stronger. It shakes again, and you look at it anxiously. It shakes a third time and you gladly sigh. <b>Congratulations! You have caught a level 7 Male Ghastly! </b>As you pick up the purple ball you hear a voice from the inside of it. <i>&quot;I will destroy you when I have the chance.&quot;</i> Tou think about this message for a little, before Purple and Polkadot come to you. &quot;Do you mind describing the place you witnessed in your vision again?&quot; You hear both of them say in unison. As you go into detail they think of any matching places they might know of. &quot;The sidehouse basement, I cannot believe we didn't think of that place as the area that held our father. The place where the Ghastly originally came from and,&quot; Polkadot begins, &quot;the place where we were murdered. How stupid could we be?!&quot; Purple finishes.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Alina, we can take it from here. You were great help. You got rid of the scourge that had plagued us for decades...&quot;Purple begins. &quot;...We can go back and free our father without the terrible curse to stop us.&quot; Polkadot continues &quot;Now we can finally rest in peace, with our father.&quot; They look at you with eyes full of gratitude. &quot;You can leave now, if you open that door you entered this room through you will find yourself outside. We used the last of our ghost power to make that exit, and now we can't turn into Ghastly.&quot; They look at you before dissapearing, headed to save their long-lost relative. <br />

</span><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Green">As Rocky leads the Carnivorous Plant pokemon towards the breeding ground you follow it wearily. In one day you had fought off Spiders, Lead a fly to an orgie and were now following a plant towards its food. As you reach the grounds with the Pokemon ahead you watch the scene in horror. The Plant pokemon calls out and out of the ground uproot many more Carnivine, most about the size of the father, but some about the size of a pin. They begin attacking, and as they do so the single Volbeat and his harem of Illumise are surprised and don't fight back. The Carnivine begin eating the bugs in many grotesque ways from bloodily decapitating them to drinking their blood as it came out of their arm sockets. As you see the battle reaching to a close a different Carnivine begins to dash at you and leaps...<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>STOPPPPPPPPPP!</i>&quot; the father Carnivine calls out, &quot;<i>We made a deal, leave the tasty human alone</i>.&quot;<br />
As the plant pokemon leaps away you see that there are only three Illumise left, along with their lone male counterpart. &quot;<i>Leave. Now!</i>&quot; You ponder why the bugs argue with the plants and Rocky begins to hear &quot;<i>We need a food source. Go, Mate, We'll wait for your descendants</i>.&quot; You see the plans smile widen to a horrible degree. The Bugs leave, the Volbeat saddened by the loss of his many mates.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Three shall have to do...</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
Having eaten every possible scrap of flesh from the area the Carnivine disperse, except for the father and young one that had been with you from the start. &quot;<i>You didn't eat anything</i>?!&quot; The Pokemon looks at you and walks, alongside it the young pokemon. &quot;<i>Look, I need a favor, convince your master to fees my son please? If you do I will give you this Stone thingy I found.&quot; </i>He says to Rocky. You look at its hands and see a leaf stone init.<br />

Just to point out, after generation 2 psychic types became weak to ghosts. It doesn't really matter now but I needed to say it.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"><br />
</span> <span style="font-family: 'Verdana'"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange"><br />
Arguing about the capture with Prestige you throw the special Ghost Ball. You watch the Ghost Ball shake in place. It shakes once, your heart beating slowly and stronger. It shakes again, and you look at it anxiously. It shakes a third time and you gladly sigh. <b>Congratulations! You have caught a level 7 Male Ghastly! </b>As you pick up the purple ball you hear a voice from the inside of it. <i>&quot;I will destroy you when I have the chance.&quot;</i> Tou think about this message for a little, before Purple and Polkadot come to you. &quot;Do you mind describing the place you witnessed in your vision again?&quot; You hear both of them say in unison. As you go into detail they think of any matching places they might know of. &quot;The sidehouse basement, I cannot believe we didn't think of that place as the area that held our father. The place where the Ghastly originally came from and,&quot; Polkadot begins, &quot;the place where we were murdered. How stupid could we be?!&quot; Purple finishes.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Alina, we can take it from here. You were great help. You got rid of the scourge that had plagued us for decades...&quot;Purple begins. &quot;...We can go back and free our father without the terrible curse to stop us.&quot; Polkadot continues &quot;Now we can finally rest in peace, with our father.&quot; They look at you with eyes full of gratitude. &quot;You can leave now, if you open that door you entered this room through you will find yourself outside. We used the last of our ghost power to make that exit, and now we can't turn into Ghastly.&quot; They look at you before dissapearing, headed to save their long-lost relative. <br />
<br />
</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"><i><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'">Note: Upon replying to this update you can head out of Cascadia with your pokemon in tow.

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">Yes, yes, I know that psychics are weak to ghosts. But Gastly in particular, being part poison, is weak to psychic moves, so they're not <i>ineffective</i>. You can check this on Serebii or Bulbapedia. ;o<br />
<br />
And just so I don't sound too snobbish and ungrateful, I do thank you for the Gastly! Such a pretty little Poke~ You have no idea of the squeeling that went on for that text based Gastly. :|</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorange"><span style="font-size: 9px">And so Alina happily picked up the Ghost Ball, ignoring the whisper of <i>&quot;I will destroy you when I have the chance.&quot;</i> She pocketed her new Pokemon rather gleefully as Prestige let out a loud curse and brought his claws together to appear as if he was praying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you mind describing the place you witnessed in your vision again?&quot; said both of the siblings together as they approached Alina. Alina repeated her vision, describing the walls, especially the blood stained one, and so on. &quot;The sidehouse basement, I cannot believe we didn't think of that place as the area that held our father,&quot; Polkadot began. &quot;The place where the Ghastly originally came from and...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;The place where we were murdered. How stupid could we be?!&quot; Purple finishes. &quot;Thank you, Alina, we can take it from here. You were a great help. You got rid of the scourge that had plagued us for decades... <br />
<br />
&quot;We can now go back and free our father without the terrible curse to stop us,&quot; continued Polkadot, her and her brother's eyes full of gratitude. &quot;You can leave now, if you open that door you entered this room through you will find yourself outside. We used the last of our ghost power to make that exit, and now we can't turn into Ghastly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Alina could say good luck, they had already disappeared, leaving Prestige and the young trainer alone in the room. Behind her, the door was open, and she could see the gloomy and ancient graveyard through it. Alina sighed, and looked back at the room one last time, and ran out the room to get as far away from the Elegy Fields as possible.<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
After sitting on the far corner of the island for days, Prestige and Alina looked worse than hobos. Too scared to sleep on this god forsaken island, they had curled up together on the edge of the beach, waiting for signs of the boat that had taken to them to this horrid place. On the third day of surviving on scavenged food and the lack of sleep, they finally found the boat. Screaming with pure joy and looking totally insane, they ran to the dock, pushing aside other trainers that were heading off the ship and cackling insanely. Finally, they were away from that horrid island...</span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"><br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
<span style="color: purple">After cleaning up and finally eating a decent meal, Alina and Prestige went up to the deck to gaze out at the sea. The chain of islands were off to the distance, and again, Alina found herself whimming for another adventure, sure not on Ruin Island.<br />
<br />
&quot;Glacier Island, that looks like quite a beautiful place,&quot; Alina murmured, still staring out in the direction of the islands.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Ugh, you know how much I hate the cold. Besides, it's not a real island, it's just an iceberg. A really big one.&quot;</i> said Prestige, trying to find something to climb on so he could see the islands with his own eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we're not going to Crater Island, I don't really care for water types. Hmm...&quot; says the trainer as she continues to ponder. &quot;Venom Island seems kind of cool. You hate cities or populated areas, so Brine Island is out of the question.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;You avoid all the pleasant places and go for the horrifying ones,&quot; pointed out Prestige. &quot;You're a sick girl, what's wrong with you?&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Ignoring this comment, Alina decided, &quot;Yes, I think we will go to Bane Forest. I'm curious.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;It's a dead forest!&quot;</i> cried Prestige, finally finding a crate to climb on. <i>&quot;What's interesting about that?&quot;</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Well, rumors mostly,&quot; Alina began as she watched Prestige struggle to climb on the crate. &quot;You know, of something hidden in those dead trees. Of course, I don't intend to go chopping down every tree, you know. But mostly, rare Pokemon live there. We could find something interesting at the very least.&quot;<br />
<br />
Prestige had finally scrambled onto the crate, panting as he said <i>&quot;That's insane, the place is still poisonous. You're truely an idiot.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, don't be such a killjoy,&quot; she said, picking up her Abra and holding him in he arms as she requested to be dropped off on Venom Island. Prestige struggled, trying to get out of her arms, but instead found it easier to teleport out of her arms and into the bag at her side. <i>&quot;Wake me up when it's over.&quot;</i> he said as the ship approached <b>Bane Forest, Venom Island</b>.</span></span></div>
