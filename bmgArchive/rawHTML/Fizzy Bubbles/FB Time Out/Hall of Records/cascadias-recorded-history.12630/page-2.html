The island was covered by a huge forest that was divided by the Diamond River so there are now two forests: the Silver one and the Red one. The only difference of the forests was the level of the wild Pokémon. Saturn wasn´t sure what kind of Pokémon inhabited the Red Forest so he decided to go to the Silver Forest because he heard that bug Pokémon lived there.

</blockquote>OOC: Congratulations on being the ZO of the newest zone in BMG!<br />
<br />
<span style="color: Green"><span style="font-size: 9px">It was just another day on <b>Lily Island</b>, in the <b>Silver Forest</b>. For a week, Soruta and her 'tour guide', Saito, although not much of a tour guide at all, had been crawling through the forest for anything but the usual. This day would probably turn out to be like any other day, with the same 24 hour routine. Wake up in the morning, release all of the Pokemon to have breakfast out of whatever that was edible and not a Pokemon at the same time, return everyone but either Saito or Meiru, travel around some more... Then there came Lunchtime... I'm sure you get where this is going right now, huh?<br />
<br />
Rewind to one week ago, upon arrival on the Lily Island. When Soruta had first arrived on this island by riding on Faltzer over a ridiculously long distance over a sea of water (and thus leaving Faltzer exausted and out of any battles for the first three days on the island, not that there were any battles with the native Pokemon during that time), the entire island was pristine, and the air was fresh. The prospect of abnormal silver leaves growing all over the forest was an exciting prospect, but as time went on without incident, she (and all of her Pokemon) began growing tired and fustrated with the daily scenery.<br />
<br />
Mabye it's because Soruta keeps making left-hand turns, and never wants to turn right into the heart of the forest. &quot;Is there something here? Or there? Which way should we go to find something besides the ordinary?&quot; she would often ask throughout the day. If Saito happened to be out at that time, he would just shrug his shoulders. If Meiru was out instead of Saito, she'd tilt her head in confusion, too young to ponder about what her trainer is thinking about. All of the other Pokemon would give the same response if she happened to be asking this question during a meal, which usually involved thinking that she was going to be the death of them all if this kept going on.<br />
<br />
Fast forward back to the present time. Soruta was traveling through the forest once more, with Saito just moping behind her, waiting for the total boredom to end. And yet Soruta had to say something before the day started that Saito could remember... To an extent.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;But if we go someplace else in the forest, whatever might be in the forest might show up at where we all were searching this past week while we all are gone searching someplace else, just like a Whack-a-Mole game. If you just hold a mallet over one hole and don't find anything, and switch over to another hole just to find that the mole just went to the previous target hole... That's not much of a good thing, is it?&quot;</i><br />
<br />
But even then, most of the other Pokemon couldn't understand what she meant by that. The only Pokemon that did play Whack-a-Mole was Saito during his time in the Cloud Garden, fighting against several Diglett and a ravenous Dugtrio. But Whack-a-Mole is supposed to be fun, not life-threatening like it was back then.<br />
<br />
All Saito could do was sigh and continue following his trainer, for there would be no point in going somplace else without Soruta around. Her reasoning must be in another dimension now, as all of the other Pokemon might have put it by now. And yet, from behind both Soruta and Saito, you could see them dissapearing into their normal routines, hoping for something out of the ordinary. Going towards that same clump of trees with the same silver colored leaves, they are.<br />
<br />

Ebony Beach - Surrounding the island, black volcanic beaches stretch along the shoreline. Actually volcanic ash, this is rather hard on the feet for those who choose to go barefoot. Chances are you won't find much stuff in the water, with the volcanic rocks releasing chemicals into the water that leave living conditions less than favorable for most Pokemon.

</blockquote>Zero walked along the shorline of the soft black sand beach with his faithful Wooper companion, Flip. &quot;Now don't be playing in that water. The water is supposed to have volcanic chemicals and other icky stuff in it so you probably don't want to be swimming around it it,&quot; Zero told Flip before the Mud Fish Pokemon got any ideas about taking a dip in the volcanic water. For a few more minutes, Zero and his Wooper continued to walk. &quot;Eh, lets take a break,&quot; Zero suggested sitting down in the warm beach sand. He began sifiting sand through his fingers while his Wooper sat down by the increasing pile of sand contaminated by the skin cells of Zero's fingers.</span><br />

<b><span style="color: green">The Red Forest</span></b> - Quite possibly the most dangerous of all of the areas in Cascadia, the Red Forest is named after the amount of deaths of the first adventurers to this area. Many ruthless and savage Pokemon live in this dense rainforest, so I'd advise that only the strong continue on. There's no telling what types of Pokemon you may find here. Most people don't come back. It is said that a small freshwater lake is somewhere in this forest as well.

</blockquote><span style="color: green"> Catherine looked down the path to the Red Forest not sure why she wanted to adventure there. When she first thought of going there she never exepted to be going there but the place never left her mind. She liked the idea of strong pokemon and an adventure but she was a bit woried about the dangers she would face. Knowing that it would be best to have a pokemon out just in case something happened. Knowing that a strong pokemon would be best Catherine took the pokeball of her Shelgon off her belt. She pressed the button on it and Angel appeared in front of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am going to the Red Forest and since it is a dangerous area I need a strong pokem...,&quot; Catherine was cut off when Angel ran behind her shaking with fear.<br />
<br />
Catherine let out a sigh. Her Shelgon was so out of character of the usual ones. She was shy, quiet and a scardy cat. A nice, strong pokemon but did not seem like the best pokemon for this type of adventure. Catherine knew it would be best to switch her pokemon but she wanted to make Angel a little more bold and adventerous for the future.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on girl, I know you have more nerves then that. It might be a scary place but your strong and I do have other pokemon that can help us. I know you can go through this you just have to try,&quot; Catherine told her pokemon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shel?&quot; Angel said still not sure of herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you will do fine let's just try. If it is too hard for you then I will return you to your pokeball. Alright?&quot; Catherine said in a calm tone.<br />
<br />
Angel smiled a bit and noded. Although she was scared she was going to try to enjoy herself. Catheirne then started walking down the path to the Red Forest with Angel right behind her.</span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: green">&quot;Ah, land,&quot; the first thing on Centin's mind when this nature loving trainer steps out of the vessel, and onto the grounds of one of the only two known forests in Lily Island, The Silver Forest. &quot;Go, Skarsvalg,&quot; and out comes a male barboach from its pokeball. &quot;Ach, ach..Ach, ach,&quot; soon, it climbed up to its trainer's left elbow, and clings on it. His trainer was amazed at his performance and thus replied, &quot;Heh, looks like you've learnt something from your friends, eh? Yup, clinging on is exactly what we all do.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Centin walked along the path to The Silver Road, some flying pokemon were flying while soaring through the sky, and some bug pokemon were crawling back into their burrows and denatured logs. Exactly what this place was pictured in his mind, is for real. Yes, it is the home of flying and bug pokemon, where one can be sure of life for one day, and you might not know what's going to happen on the next. Sort of thinking philosophically about that matter, Centin then remembered something important, so he told his barboach, &quot;Clinging on is actually helpful. Once I do not feel your cling anymore, it is obvious that you have gone somewhere else. I got to hand it to you once again because you are learning our pokemon-companion tradition at an excellent rate, Skarsvalg.&quot; Continuing their journey, it seems that Centin did not mention anything about finding a 'new' companion like he would normally, perhaps he had already forgotten about it, or probably because he knew that bearing stress upon his new pokemon might not seem such a good idea anylonger.</span></div>

<br />
<span style="color: red"><b>Octazooka:</b> Getting off of the ferry and walking onto the port, you quickly spot your destination, the Ebony Beach which encirlces the island. Walking along with your Wooper, you warn your Wooper not to go into the water, due to the volcanic properties of the water that kills any sort of life that is in it for too long. However, as you sit down to rest, right in front of you a mound of sand begins to push its way up out of the beach. It becomes larger and larger before it is about the size of your head. Wondering what the source of this is, you don't have to think about it long, as a Trapinch pushes its way out of the sand, and looks at you for a few seconds, before tilting its head. &quot;Tra?&quot; it says, not looking hostile. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: green">quilava plush:</span></b><span style="color: green"> Deciding to head off toward the Silver Forest, you look up in amazement of the leaves which give off a sort of glow, probably from the silver outlines to which the forest owes its name. Seeing little to no ground life at all, you are amazed by the sharp contrast-the treetops above are full of life, birds, bugs, a good quarter of everything under the rainbow. However, you hear something a distance away. It sounds like...machinery...<br />
<br />
Walking closer to the source of the noise, you gasp as you see what's happening. A large, cranelike machine, only sideways, with a large, rotating saw on the end, chops down trees in a single swipe, and the trees are then picked up by a large number of psychic Pokemon, mostly Hypno and Grumpic, telepathically, and thrown into another large machine, out of which comes a heaping pile of sawdust, and a pile of small sticks, which are carried along a conveyor belt into a box...which upon further inspection, it reads &quot;TOOTHPICKS - MADE WITH GENUINE SILVER FOREST TREES&quot;<br />
<br />
A woman's voice then says, &quot;If we would have just caught Celebii first, we'd be done by now.&quot; You look around, still ducking behind the trees, and see a small wooden building, which a man walks out of, followed by a woman. &quot;Shut up woman, is all you do complain about speed? We only have to clear about an acre more of land, and we'll be done. Shouldn't take more than a few hours. And I bet we could catch a few more scurrying baby Pokemon, and raise them to serve only us! And be experimental, of course.&quot; The woman shakes her head, and sighs before mumbling something under her breath.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: green"><b>Torky Stu &amp; Joe:</b> Both of you getting off at the dock on the Diamond River, the separator of the docile Silver Forest and the hostile Red Forest. However, rather than going to the Silver Forest, you head off in search of danger, to the Red Forest. As soon as you and your Pokemon enter the forest, you notice the steamy, humid, and hot atmosphere of the place and the wild array of Pokemon which it could support. However, you don't seem to notice any of these Pokemon, all you hear are calls of Pokemon deep within the forest. Wondering where all of the Pokemon are, Joe turns around to ask Stu what he thinks. However, much to his surprise, a rather large Arbok is wrapped around a blue faced Stu, preventing him from moving and just barely allowing him to breathe. It would appear as though unless Joe acts fast, then Stu is in a bit of trouble, and on the Arbok's lunch menu...</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: green"><b>Dark Fire:</b> Wading through the Diamond River, you soon reach the other side, the Red Forest. The atmosphere and flora both match that of a rainforest, hot and humid. Walking into the forest, you hear the calls of wild Pokemon deep in the forest as you walk along with your Vulpix. However, it doesn't appear as though there are many Pokemon where you are, as you continue walking through the forest. After a bit of walking, however, you find that you haven't found a single Pokemon, nor anything that would be remotely interesting. However, as you stop to rest, there is a rustling in the leaves above. You look up, and see a pair of red eyes looking down at you, right back. You take a few steps back as a rather large Beedrill begins to fly out of the leaves, down at you, looking rather mad.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: green"><b>Dark Scizor:</b> Stepping off of the ferry onto the dock of Lily Island, you decide against heading to the Red Forest, instead heading toward the Silver Forest. The moment you step into the forest you realize just how populated the forest is, as the entire forest is filled with squawks and other Pokemon calls. You also see the leaves above, which have a slight silver tint to them, as well as the brush, are all full of life, rustling around often as Pokemon move through them. Not actually getting a good glance of a Pokemon, you simply continue along in your journey, before you hear the sounds of a call for help, from a human voice. You quickly pick up your pace and run toward the screaming, and find the source. A kid, roughly 13, is wrapped up in a white silk cacoon, probably from a Pokemon's string shot. The kid says, &quot;Finally! Um...could you help me out a little?&quot;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: green"><b>Alilatias:</b> Trekking through Silver Forest, you see a multitude of Pokemon going about their daily business, just ignoring you as they go along. Continuing to walk through, you soon find an area of the forest which you haven't seen before, one tree towering over the entire area around it, at least twice as all as the other trees in the area. Examining the large tree more closely, you see a multitude of birds flying in and out of its branches. However, everything suddenly goes quiet, all of the squawking of the birds vanishing instantly. Wondering why, you don't have to for too long, as a pair of older looking gray Swellow swoop down on you, looking ready to attack you, as they consider you a threat. <br />
<br />
What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: green"><b>Latias10:</b> Heading off of the ferry and onto the port of the Red Forest side of the Diamond River, you and your Shelgon decide to head off toward the dangerous forest, the latter reluctantly. Nonetheless, you begin to trek into the forest. Steamy, humid, and hot, you find that the rainforest of the Red Forest could be the home to a variety of Pokemon, from birds to bugs to poison types to pretty much anything else under the rainbow, except for ice types, that is. Also, you realize something after you get a good way in to the forest - you haven't seen, or heard, a single Pokemon. Nor any other trace of life, save for the dense vegetation rising up from the forest floor. After a bit, though, as you move to take another step, you find your foot stuck. Looking down, you see a vine is wrapped around it. You pull and pull, but it seems as though the harder you pull, the tighter the vine becomes. Deciding to trace the vine to its source, you see that it leads into the dense brush, the only thing visible is a large, red plant rising above the other plants. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: green"><b>Centin: </b>Beginning your journey in the lush Silver Forest, you gasp in amazement of the beauty of the area. From the silver lined leaves to the amazing abundance of wildlife, you find yourself in a state of amazement. However, as you continue your journey on, it seems as though the silver leaves are beginning to slightly lose their color, and wildlife becomes more and more scarce. After a while, you hear the sound of rushing water. Realizing that it's impossible that you got to the Diamond River already, you push your way through some brush and find yourself at a lake, the water extremely murky, with a slight blackish purple tinge. Looking around, you find a pipe sending the purple and black contaminants into the lake, and eventually realize that this is what's causing the Pokemon to move away from this area in the forest, instead retreating to the edges of the forest.<br />
<br />
What will you do? Follow the pipe to the source, perhaps?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: deepskyblue"><b>thed3:</b> Deciding to head off in the direction of Dew Island, you scan the seas for whatever would happen to be around as you ride the ferry. You soon spot the blown out volcano, and wonder for a few moments how you'd reach the top of the clifflike sided mountain, but quickly see an elevator near the dock. After departing the ship, you head to the elevator. It springs to life immediately after you walk in, the door shutting as the elevator spins around, so you are now facing solid rock. After a few moments, you reach the top. Looking at the lake, you are amazed by the sparkling lake that is bustling with life, Wingull perched on the shore, a group of Squirtle training by sending Water Guns into the air and dodging them as they fell, and most noticible a Wailord breaching at the center of the lake. However, scanning the area more, your eyes rest on what the area is named for.<br />
<br />
At the bottom of the lake, you see literally thousands of small, purple Clamperl shells spread about. You wonder how many of them hold pearls, but your thinking is cut off suddenly by a scream. You turn to see the source of the scream, and see a Totodile you didn't see before, isolated from the rest of the Pokemon, rolling around in apparently immense, unimaginable pain. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorange"><b>Timeless River:</b> Walking into the Elegy Fields, even in the daytime, you can feel something wrong, as does your pink Wooper. These feelings quickly intensify as you walk further into the graveyard, the tombstones scattered in no real pattern throughout the area. Oh, and the green aura doesn't really help things all that much at all. Walking through, you soon find a tombstone different from the others. While most of the others are gray and worn away into just smoothed rocks that jet from the ground, this one is a large stone monument, rising around four feet from the ground, and a deep red color. You step up to it to investigate it further, and find that some sort of a message is written on it, but you soon find yourself squinting to see as your area suddenly gets darker and darker. You look up into the sky, and see that the sun is out and there isn't a cloud in the sky, but around you, black as dark as night is wrapping around the tombstones, and a bit more importantly, you. The dark aura quickly reaches your eye level, and you find yourself and your Wooper panicing, as you can't see anything, where you're at, where you're going, what time it is, if your shoelace is untied, you know, all of the life altering facts you need to know.<br />
<br />
However, you are soon paralyzed with fear, as right in front of your head, a pair of deep red eyes break through the darkness, and stare straight at you. Your eyes grow wide as the eyes come closer, and closer, and closer, before they are about 3 feet away from your face. Then they disappear. <br />
<br />
A bit relieved, you sigh. &quot;Boo.&quot; a calm voice from behind you says. You shriek out in surprise as the black aura quickly begins to fade away, quickly retreating to a point close to where the voice came from. Still scared out of your wits, you feel a bit embarrassed as the shadows all join to form a Haunter, who gives you a large smile before it turns itself upside down, finding your terror the funniest thing in the world. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorange"><b>Jon Jen:</b> Heading off to Ruin Island, in search of adventure, and whatever else you may search for. Walking off onto the dock, the eerie green glow of the island deters you for just a moment, before you take a deep breath and start off toward the Amor Temple. After only a very short walk, you reach your destination. Looking up at the broken apart temple, something catches your eye, looking to your right to see a huge Seviper slithering into the temple through a large hole in the side. Taking the main entrance through the front, the first room, a lobby of sorts, is dimly lit by the cracks in the walls. This light is enough for you to see your options-there's a tunnel to the left, a tunnel to the right, and a tunnel straight ahead. A dim light is coming from the one on the right, a cold breeze from the left, and the center one doesn't have anything really special about it. Which one will you choose?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorange"><b>Ichimaru:</b> Getting off of the boat, you breathe in the salty air of the seashore as you walk up onto Ruin Island. The eerie green glow on the ground deters you only a small bit as you head off toward Elegy Fields, the graveyard of the first inhabitants of the area. Walking along, you closely watch your surroundings, but all you see are rocks, just rocks jetting from the ground marking the places where the dead rest. Continuing on, you hear something, like a muffled scratching sound of some sort...you look around, but don't see anything. Shivers go down your spine as you continue on, but you hear the sound again a bit down. Looking around again, you suddenly find it hard to breathe. In a very close grave, a rotten, yellow hand is clawing its way up to the surface. Expecting that something would be accompanying the hand as it pulls itself out of the grave, you are stunned to find that after the elbow, the arm suddenly cuts off, leaving a forearm lingering in midair a few feet in front of you. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorange"><b>Bloody Banette:</b> Walking off of the ferry onto the dock of Ruin Island, the eerie green glow of the ground deters you for only a moment as you head off to your journey to the Amor Temple. After a relatively short journey, you reach the temple. Made of gray stone, you take a deep breath before you walk into the temple. Finding yourself in a large room, you assume that you are in the main antechamber of the temple, your guess further supported by the smaller tunnels that branch out of the room. Finding yourself in sort of a dilemma, you find that there are three tunnels that branch out from your current room, from one, it seems as though water is flowing out at a steady pace, one with a light that looks like fire somewhere inside, and the third, an ordinary tunnel with nothing special about it.<br />
<br />
Which will you choose?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: yellow"><b>Serial Arsonist:</b> Heading off onto Ion Island, you step out onto the dock and release your Bulbsaur, before deciding to go to Storm Lake. The crescent shaped lake literally has electricity sparking through the water, causing it to glow slightly yellow. However, you also see what the lake is famous for, as a Electabuzz relaxes in the shallow water, and a few Chinchou and a Lanturn swim underwater. Scanning the remainder of the lake, you are suddenly caught off guard as you hear breathing behind you. You whip around, and see an Electabuzz standing there. You glance over to where you saw the Electabuzz before to make sure it's not the same one, which it isn't, and turn your attention back to the Electabuzz, who looks rather angry, with bloodshot eyes, ready to attack you. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: darkorchid">John's Knight:</span></b><span style="color: darkorchid"> Deciding to take a different path, you head off toward Venom Island, home to many different types of poison Pokemon. As you come close to the shore, your eyes bulge as you see the water, which abruptly changes from a sparkling blue to a putrid purplish color. You can't see anything in the water at all, and are suprised as one of the crew members exclaim that a new hull will be needed for the boat after travelling in such acidic water, and looking over the side, you can see that that may be necessary, and the metal boat seems to have been a very different color before...<br />
<br />
Walking up onto the shore, you immediately head in the direction of the Bane Forest, a wasteland of dead trees turned white by the acidic chemicals of the ground. Getting to the forest rather quickly, a light fog begins to roll into the area. Viligantly examining the area around you while you continue on, you are surprised to see that there are no signs of life...at all. While the area could contribute to the factor, you think that something has to live here. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, you hear breathing behind you. Turning around quickly, you see an Ursaring, eyes bloodshot, its claws almost double the normal size of the species. The large bear's mouth turns into an evil grin as it roars triumphantly, definitely ready to attack.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorchid"><b>Shinjara &amp; Sasuke:</b> Deciding to head out to Venom Island, you both turn to the Skull Tunnel, a large white rock jetting from the ground, looking eerily like a skull, the eyes and nose being slight indents in the huge rock. Squeezing in the small gap where the mouth would be in a skull, you find yourselves in a very dark cavern, the only light coming from the small gap from which you just came. Thinking quickly, Sasuke releases his Shiftry. Both of you cover your eyes as Shiftry begins to glow white, a blinding Flash being released through the cavern, lighting it up. Opening your eyes, you find the cavern unnaturally bright. Nonetheless, you find that the ceiling of the cavern is high enough that you can walk freely, the caverns themselves in somewhat of a circular shape. <br />
<br />
Beginning to walk through, you quickly find a room which you assume is the main antechamber, the ceiling 3 times as high as the normal path. Other caverns jet away from the cavern, totalling 10 in all. The very center one is the only one that is any different from the others, bathed in a bright blue light. However, as you look up, you see about 30 of the Zubat line resting peacefully on the ceiling. They don't seem to have noticed you, but it might not be a good idea to let them. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorchid"><b>Lonely Wanderer:</b> Heading off of the ferry onto the dock onto Venom Island, you and your Beautifly begin to walk toward the Skull Tunnel. The walk isn't very long, and you soon find yourself at the large white rock that jets from the ground, several indents in the rock causing it to look remarkably like a skull. You slip underneath where the mouth would be, and your Beautifly follows, its wings beginning to glow a bright white as the area is illuminated enough to see. You walk inside, and find yourself in the tunnel, easily high enough to stand up in, with circular tunnels. Walking through your current tunnel, you soon find yourself in a rather high topped area, with a series of 10 tunnels branching off from the circular room. Nothing really makes them different from each other except the very center one, which is bathed in orange light.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: silver"><b>P/Arts:</b> Heading off toward the Salin City gym, in an attempt to earn a badge to prove your strength, it doesn't take you long to locate it. Only a short walk away from the port, you soon find yourself at a massive building, roughly two stories high and seemingly stretching on for about 300 yards, with a large symbol at the top, a half moon like symbol. You know it's the gym, though, because of the large sign beside it reading &quot;GYM.&quot;<br />
<br />
Walking in, you find yourself in a massive lobby, many people hanging around the area. You walk up to the counter, stating that you wish to challenge the gym. The attendant nods, and pulls a small, silver box off of a pile in the corner of the desk. She opens the desk and pulls out a small, very thin TV like device, with a stylus attached to the side. She takes the stylus and taps the screen, and nods to you. &quot;Good luck, if you have any questions, please let me know.&quot; <br />
<br />
You look down at the screen, and notice that it has gone from blank, to a colorful screen, broken into eight equal sections horizontally, each one only about a half inch thick, but as long as the screen. Examining each closer, you find that on the first one, a picture of a man with a headband rests on a reddish orange background, with the letters RCK FRE GND beside it, possibly designating types? At the very end of the section, there is the number 1, without any other designation. The next one is a woman with long, brown hair on a green background . GRS BUG FLY are the letters near this one, and at the end of this section is the number 2. Next, on a light blue backdrop is a young man, with a snow hat and goggles. ICE are the only letters near this one, and the number near it is 2 as well. Fourth is a blonde haired man on a blue background. WTR are the only letters near this one, but this one has a number of 6. Fifth, a woman with black hair sits on a light brown background, with the letters PSY DRK GST near it. This number is 0. Sixth, on a yellow background is a woman, with blonde hair. ELC is the only lettering, and it has the number 2. Seventh is a woman with purple hair, on a dark purple background. PSN is the lettering of this one, while the number is also 0. And lastly, a man with brown hair rests on a gray background. Letter designation is NML FTG STL and there is no number for this one, rather a red X.<br />
<br />
The woman sees your expression, and offers help. In a calm tone, she begins. &quot;The letters, such as RCK, represent type of the gym. The number at the end is how many people are currently on that Gym Leader's queue. Two Gym Leaders always seem to have zero on theirs, for some reason...I don't know. Anyway, if you'd like to challenge one, just tap their name and fill out the form that appears to the very best of your ability, and you'll be good to go, unless you have any other questions?&quot;<br />
<br />
Making your choice of the gym you will challenge, suddenly the screen changes to a form.<br />

<span style="color: silver"><b>lilbluecorsola:</b> Walking off of the ferry onto the dock you look in amazement of the large coral formations that jet out from the island. Many people and their Pokemon float along with the waves, a few diving underwater to investigate the Pokemon life. Looking up onto the shore, you notice a sign that says &quot;Scuba Gear - Necessary for Under Water Battles!&quot; Continuing to look around, you see a Pokemon Center, on top of which a Wingull is perched, keeping a lookout for possible danger. Upon closer inspection, you see another Wingull, and only assume that they have a nest on top of the Pokemon Center. However, behind you, you hear a scream. Looking around, you see that a school of Tentacool moving into the area. All of the people and their Pokemon rush to get out of the water, leaving you standing there, quite bewildered, before you notice that the water is starting to become murkier and murkier, eventually to the point that you cannot see anything in the water. A few moments later, a man taps your shoulder, saying urgently, &quot;We need to get out of here as soon as we can. Come, I'm sure I can find a book in the Pokemon Center that can explain what is happening a lot better than I can.&quot;<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: teal"><b>Faiyaa: </b> Deciding to head off to the shipwreck of the SS Leviathan, you scan the area, just in case of a swimming axe murderer about. Seeing no such thread, you continue on toward the mast of the huge ship, which itself stretches almost 10 feet into the air, which is almost nothing compared to the rest of the ship. Wondering to yourself what could have possibly caused such a large ship to sink, you and your Mantine circle around the mast for a few moments, seeing the rot of the wood because of the ocean currents and hoping that it's safe enough for adventure. While pondering this over, you hear something behind you, sounding like laughter...<i>pirate</i> laughter. You quickly turn around, but see nothing there...However, as you turn back around to investigate the shipwreck, everything suddenly goes black.<br />
<br />
You groggily open your eyes, and find yourself in a wooden room, your arms chained to the wall. It would appear as though you were in a ship, and you quickly, and rightly assume that you are inside the shipwreck. You search the area for your Mantine, and see a few chairs and a desk, but not a door. Resting on top of the desk is a strange ball. You assume that it's a Pokeball, and upon further inspection from your distance, you see a skull with crossbones at the point where the recall button is on a normal Pokeball. Suddenly, you feel chills run down your spine. You look around the room and see an eerie green fog filling the room. You hear the same laughter as before, as a a green arm comes out of the wall. Rather freaked, another arm and a pair of legs follow, attacked to a man. A pirate. A ghost pirate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arr!&quot; he says, in a ghastly tone, &quot;matey, ye be after me treasure, are ye? Now, ye shall walk the plank!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Walk the plank, squawk, walk the plank!&quot; On the man's shoulder, a small bird appears out of thin air. Its head is black, its beak is pink, and its wings are a bright blue and yellow. A white ruffle is around its next, but it is also surrounded in a green aura like the man. Smirking, the pirate snaps his fingers, and the chains binding you disappear. &quot;Arr, if ye can somehow escape from me ship by tomorrow, your life will be spared. If not, hope ye don't mind being ripped apart by Sharpedo!&quot; The pirate continues laughing as he walks out of the room, the bird repeating &quot;Sharpedo, Sharpedo, squawk, ripped apart by Sharpedo!&quot; as it disappears through the wall.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: teal"><b>Kiera &amp; Skrutsi:</b> Both of you arriving at the shipwreck at the same time, you look at the huge wooden ship, the mast the only thing rising out of the water. Looking down into the water, you see a large hole in the side of the ship, through which many, many Pokemon swim in and out in schools. Just in the few minutes which you watch, a school of Magikarp enter the ship, a very large Mantine exits, as well as a HUGE Gyarados, which seems to be at least 50 feet long. It swims around a bit before it gazes to the surface, and sees the shadow of Swampert. Gyarados's eyes narrow, and you notice that they are a very deep red, the color of blood, with no pupils. Without warning, it rockets up to the surface. As it breaks the surface, large waves erupt from the point, sending Jeff and Swampert back a few yards. The Gyarados continues to glare, before it opens its mouth wide, a ball of golden energy beginning to form...What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: teal">Waterlight:</span></b><span style="color: teal"> Deciding to head away from the majority of the group, you ride atop your Milotic in the direction of Ruin Island, specifically, past Ruin Island, to Deprimo Trench. You gaze around the area, admiring the various water Pokemon which make this their home, from a flock of soaring Wingull, to a school of Magikarp which swim underneath you and Milotic, to a group of Seel which playfully swim beside you and Milotic. However, as you look around the area, Milotic suddenly stops moving. You lean over to see what the problem is, and it doesn't take you long at all to notice that Milotic is covered in a strange magenta aura, one usually associated with psychic types. <br />
<br />
Searching for the source of the problem, it doesn't take very long. In front of you, a large swell begins to form, at the very top, a pink Pokemon with a Shellder attached to its head, a Slowking. However, it is glaring at you with a look of pure and utter disgust, as it speaks to you. Or at least you would think so, but its mouth doesn't move, so you assume telepathy. &quot;How dare you enter my royal sea without proper invitation? Child, do you know no manners?&quot; The Slowking then closes its eyes, and behind you, a large splash occurs as a Gyarados is psychically pulled out of the water. &quot;Serpent, destroy this insolent child.&quot; The Gyarados roars, as it begins to concentrate its power into its mouth in the form of a ball, a Hyper Beam attack. What will you do?</span></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: DarkOrange">Jon trotted with a grin through the seemingly empty surroundings of the Amor Temple. He was quite happy indeed, as he soaked in the whole experience; Jon enjoyed to travel, so he was quite thrilled that he would be off on an adventure his pokemon hadn't already torn down. The temple seemed to resonate with a presence, one that excited Jon greatly. Jon enjoyed things that he didn't understand, at least at first glance, it allowed him the opportunity to observe and analyze a truly unknown subject. Jon noticed a Seviper out of the corner of his eye as he began to draw closer to the entrance to the temple. &quot;A Seviper? See, its a good thing I haven't sent out Trick then, isn't it?&quot; Jon cheered to himself, a compliment in a way, commending his good judgment for not letting his pokemon weigh him down. Although, subconsciously, Jon knew full well that, sooner or later, he'd get into trouble and need his pokemon to bail him out. But, this wasn't on Jon's mind now, he was more interested in the ruins he was absorbed in, and quickly being engulfed by, as he entered the Amor Temple.<br />
<br />
As he entered, he took note of the beauty of the temple, despite its obvious wear and tear brought on by age. The temple's walls were riddled with cracks, somewhat bathing the inside with a sort of transient light that lit patches of the crumbling structure. Jon found himself at the face of three different rounds, two to either side, and one straight ahead. Being the over analytical person he is, he slowly came to a stop as he thought over his options.<br />
<br />
&quot;It feels cold that way...&quot; Jon observed, referring to the passage off to his left. &quot;And there's a light to my right...&quot; he added. &quot;Nothing really special about the passage in front of me.&quot; Jon finished. &quot;With these observations and common sense applied, I can make a sound decision!&quot; he cheered, overjoyed that he could be making such an intelligent decision already, not even faintly realizing his foolishness in going to such lengths to pick a path to travel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, logic tells us that the best way out of the maze is to hold the right wall, but that doesn't really apply to our current situation. Unless I get lost, of course.&quot; Jon announced. &quot;Plus, I myself would naturally want to take the path in front of me, straightforward is usually the quickest way to get something to happen either way, and I could make further observations from there.&quot; Jon spoke. &quot;But, because these two stick out in my mind, it makes me question whether the path to my left is the real answer...&quot; Jon added, only confusing himself from the issue.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know, perhaps I should look through my things to see if I have anything that might make an impact...&quot; Jon spoke as he set his pack down in front of him, shuffling around in it for something that might help him decide. At that time, he knocked a pokeball from his bag, which fell to the ground softly, though it began to roll towards the hall on Jon's right. Jon followed after it where it stopped in a notch in the stone floor, and picked it up, only to stand in disbelief for a few moments to come.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hahahah!&quot; Jon burst into laughter! &quot;I'm a genius! It was right in front of me the whole time, the right path is the <i>right</i> path!&quot; he giggled to himself, pleased with his pun of sorts. &quot;Well, thank you trusty pokeball! You've served a great purpose!&quot; he patted it, as he put it back with his things, and began on his way, down the hall facing off to the right.</span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: green"><b>Torky Stu &amp; Joe:</b> Both of you getting off at the dock on the Diamond River, the separator of the docile Silver Forest and the hostile Red Forest. However, rather than going to the Silver Forest, you head off in search of danger, to the Red Forest. As soon as you and your Pokemon enter the forest, you notice the steamy, humid, and hot atmosphere of the place and the wild array of Pokemon which it could support. However, you don't seem to notice any of these Pokemon, all you hear are calls of Pokemon deep within the forest. Wondering where all of the Pokemon are, Joe turns around to ask Stu what he thinks. However, much to his surprise, a rather large Arbok is wrapped around a blue faced Stu, preventing him from moving and just barely allowing him to breathe. It would appear as though unless Joe acts fast, then Stu is in a bit of trouble, and on the Arbok's lunch menu...</span></span>

</blockquote>Awesome update. xD<br />
<br />
<span style="color: green"><span style="font-size: 9px">The fact that a huge Arbok could sneak up on both Joe and Stu unnoticed just proved how dangerous the Red Forest could be. But Joe didn't think about that for very long, as he saw the predicament he was in. He could tell by the sheer malicity of the attack that this Arbok was going to be as strong as anything else he'd ever fought. He reached to his belt, and grabbed the first Pokeball he could, before throwing it to the ground. After a large flash of red light, one of Joe's newest Pokemon unfurled on the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dunsparce, get that thing off of Stu with an Ancientpower, and then follow up by using Rage to knock it into a tree!&quot; ordered Joe, quickly, trying to spit out orders as fast as he could so that Stu didn't get choked to death. &quot;If it tries to attack you, use a Defense Curl to lighten the damage. Oh, and you better take this.&quot; He reached into his bag, and took out a small, pink berry, which looked a bit like an upside down peach. Joe gave the small berry to Dunsparce, and Dunsparce stared at it, confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;If that big snake thing poisons you, just eat that, and you should be alright in no time, okay?&quot; he said, and Dunsparce nodded, making it obvious that he now understood. Joe then got back to his feet, and waited for Dunsparce to start his assault on the Arbok, while Stu stood there, struggling to catch a breath.</span></span></div>

<b><span style="color: green">quilava plush:</span></b><span style="color: green"> Deciding to head off toward the Silver Forest, you look up in amazement of the leaves which give off a sort of glow, probably from the silver outlines to which the forest owes its name. Seeing little to no ground life at all, you are amazed by the sharp contrast-the treetops above are full of life, birds, bugs, a good quarter of everything under the rainbow. However, you hear something a distance away. It sounds like...machinery...<br />
<br />
Walking closer to the source of the noise, you gasp as you see what's happening. A large, cranelike machine, only sideways, with a large, rotating saw on the end, chops down trees in a single swipe, and the trees are then picked up by a large number of psychic Pokemon, mostly Hypno and Grumpic, telepathically, and thrown into another large machine, out of which comes a heaping pile of sawdust, and a pile of small sticks, which are carried along a conveyor belt into a box...which upon further inspection, it reads &quot;TOOTHPICKS - MADE WITH GENUINE SILVER FOREST TREES&quot;<br />
<br />
A woman's voice then says, &quot;If we would have just caught Celebii first, we'd be done by now.&quot; You look around, still ducking behind the trees, and see a small wooden building, which a man walks out of, followed by a woman. &quot;Shut up woman, is all you do complain about speed? We only have to clear about an acre more of land, and we'll be done. Shouldn't take more than a few hours. And I bet we could catch a few more scurrying baby Pokemon, and raise them to serve only us! And be experimental, of course.&quot; The woman shakes her head, and sighs before mumbling something under her breath.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span><br />

<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: Green">Snagging Celebi... poaching Pokemon... heavy deforestation? Rivka was certain this place was protected, or at least regulated by law, but heck if she knows anything. Heck if they know anything, either, because so long as they keep consuming the trees without making an effort to replant them, they won't have any more trees to make their precious toothpicks with.<br />
<br />
&quot;...well, looky here, Shrapnel! A parade t' rain on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rivka lets out a few more whispers, albeit inaudible, as she peeks over the bushes as she yanks her Fearow by the neck to show him the commotion, returned with a disgruntled squawk. Immediately lowering her cover behind the bushes, Rivka continues. &quot;Although all I see 're Psychic types... I guess Retsu could use a workout.&quot; Shrapnel ruffles his feathers; he needed to let his frustration out, but he didn't need that pathetic Nuzleaf around to feed it. <br />
<br />
&quot;...but we're not going t' just barge in on there. I think a well-organized plan t' masq'rade as helpful community service civilian type people <span style="font-size: 9px">(aren't we civilans anyways...? oh, whatever)</span> and get into their system is the way to go. And then we can gather intelligence on their scheme and <b>blow their plot to <span style="font-size: 12px">SMITHEREENS!</span></b>&quot; Immediately covering her mouth with her hands upon realizing what she just did, Rivka looks to Shrapnel, who just rolls his eyes. The girl returns to a soft whisper. &quot;But first! Let's take a completely casual stride through the forest so they can see us but not really. After all, we're completely normal trav'llers, right?&quot;</span></div>

Octazooka: Getting off of the ferry and walking onto the port, you quickly spot your destination, the Ebony Beach which encirlces the island. Walking along with your Wooper, you warn your Wooper not to go into the water, due to the volcanic properties of the water that kills any sort of life that is in it for too long. However, as you sit down to rest, right in front of you a mound of sand begins to push its way up out of the beach. It becomes larger and larger before it is about the size of your head. Wondering what the source of this is, you don't have to think about it long, as a Trapinch pushes its way out of the sand, and looks at you for a few seconds, before tilting its head. &quot;Tra?&quot; it says, not looking hostile. What will you do?

Zero and Wooper looked astounded at the apparently friendly Trapinch. Hesitantly, Zero crept slightly closer to the Trapinch. Uhh... hey little guy...&quot; Zero said creeping his hand slowly towards the Trapinch. &quot;Its okay... I won't try to hurt you...&quot; Zero said calmfully, doubting the words he said. &quot;Woop!&quot; Wooper cried gleefully as he toddled closer to the Trapinch to get a closer look before stopping about 6 inches away from the Trapinch's gaping jaws. &quot;Good god, he better not bite me...&quot; Zero thought to himself semi regretting the action he had just made incase things go for the worse </span></div>

The moment you step into the forest you realize just how populated the forest is, as the entire forest is filled with squawks and other Pokemon calls. You also see the leaves above, which have a slight silver tint to them, as well as the brush, are all full of life, rustling around often as Pokemon move through them. Not actually getting a good glance of a Pokemon, you simply continue along in your journey, before you hear the sounds of a call for help, from a human voice. You quickly pick up your pace and run toward the screaming, and find the source. A kid, roughly 13, is wrapped up in a white silk cacoon, probably from a Pokemon's string shot.

</blockquote><span style="color: Green">Saturn was surprised by seeing the kid in the cacoon. He thought that in the Silver Forest, he wasn´t going to see that kind of things because aggressive Pokémon lived on the Red Forest. Perhaps the kid offended the Pokémon but he wasn´t going to stay there all of his life if that was the case so he decided to help him first and ask questions later. While trying to break the cacoon, he wondered what kind of Pokémon did that and if it was nearby.</span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange"><b>Bloody Banette:</b> Walking off of the ferry onto the dock of Ruin Island, the eerie green glow of the ground deters you for only a moment as you head off to your journey to the Amor Temple. After a relatively short journey, you reach the temple. Made of gray stone, you take a deep breath before you walk into the temple. Finding yourself in a large room, you assume that you are in the main antechamber of the temple, your guess further supported by the smaller tunnels that branch out of the room. Finding yourself in sort of a dilemma, you find that there are three tunnels that branch out from your current room, from one, it seems as though water is flowing out at a steady pace, one with a light that looks like fire somewhere inside, and the third, an ordinary tunnel with nothing special about it.<br />
<br />
Which will you choose?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: DarkOrange">Felix called back Arikel to his pokeball. &quot;My bloody Ari, I can't take you any longer now&quot; he said as he pointed the ball to the ghost pokemon. He, then took another ball from his belt, enlarging and tossing it he realeased Malkav, his Shuppet. Malkav instantly started to look around the hall on entrance of the temple, being really curious, when she realized Colitas was there, looking at her in a strange way, Malkav got close to her and move around Colitas in a seductive fashion way.<br />
Felix was having a really funny time when he realized there were three tunnels in the hall, listening to the relaxing sound of the water, he decided to pass that tunnel and take his pokemon with him. &quot;Let's go my girls, something really beautiful waits for us there&quot;.</span></div>

Seeing no such thread, you continue on toward the mast of the huge ship, which itself stretches almost 10 feet into the air, which is almost nothing compared to the rest of the ship. Wondering to yourself what could have possibly caused such a large ship to sink, you and your Mantine circle around the mast for a few moments, seeing the rot of the wood because of the ocean currents and hoping that it's safe enough for adventure. While pondering this over, you hear something behind you, sounding like laughter...<i>pirate</i> laughter. You quickly turn around, but see nothing there...However, as you turn back around to investigate the shipwreck, everything suddenly goes black.<br />
<br />
You groggily open your eyes, and find yourself in a wooden room, your arms chained to the wall. It would appear as though you were in a ship, and you quickly, and rightly assume that you are inside the shipwreck. You search the area for your Mantine, and see a few chairs and a desk, but not a door. Resting on top of the desk is a strange ball. You assume that it's a Pokeball, and upon further inspection from your distance, you see a skull with crossbones at the point where the recall button is on a normal Pokeball. Suddenly, you feel chills run down your spine. You look around the room and see an eerie green fog filling the room. You hear the same laughter as before, as a a green arm comes out of the wall. Rather freaked, another arm and a pair of legs follow, attacked to a man. A pirate. A ghost pirate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arr!&quot; he says, in a ghastly tone, &quot;matey, ye be after me treasure, are ye? Now, ye shall walk the plank!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Walk the plank, squawk, walk the plank!&quot; On the man's shoulder, a small bird appears out of thin air. Its head is black, its beak is pink, and its wings are a bright blue and yellow. A white ruffle is around its next, but it is also surrounded in a green aura like the man. Smirking, the pirate snaps his fingers, and the chains binding you disappear. &quot;Arr, if ye can somehow escape from me ship by tomorrow, your life will be spared. If not, hope ye don't mind being ripped apart by Sharpedo!&quot; The pirate continues laughing as he walks out of the room, the bird repeating &quot;Sharpedo, Sharpedo, squawk, ripped apart by Sharpedo!&quot; as it disappears through the wall.<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: teal">Gary gasped as he looked around the room he was stuck in. Wooden walls in all directions caused a minimal amount of light to pour in. He was slightly chilled by the fact that he had just been haunted by a ghost pirate and his parrot and had been told that if he hadn't escaped by the next day, he'd be eaten alive by the Sharpedo. His only option was to get the hell out as soon as possible. Deciding to calm his nerves a bit, Gary pulled out a pokeball, and in a bright flash that temporarily lit up the gloomy wooden room, Scurvy, Gary's Aipom happily appeared, climbing up to his perch on Gary's shoulder. Scurvy is in sheer bliss as Gary explained to him that they were on a pirate ship, and tuned out that fact that it was haunted and impending Sharpedo wanted to eat them. Scurvy was a natural born pirate monkey, and had no hard time getting his sea legs. Scurvy shouted &quot;Arr!&quot; and then Gary frowned as he came to realize there was no door to get out of the room. &quot;Scurvy, we need to find Aero as well, wherever he may be. Don't let your stay be too welcome however, cause if we need to go underwater, I'm switching you for Devine!&quot; Scurvy shrugged, somewhat disapointed, but still kept smiling as he looked about the pirate ship from his perch on Gary's shoulder while the two stepped up to the wall. &quot;Hmm, this is gonna be tricky getting out of here, Scurvy... I could have Typhu teleport us in a heartbeat... that is only if we knew where we would be teleporting to. So I´m gonna have you try and Rock Smash the wall as hard as you can, okay?&quot; Scurvy nodded and hopped off of Gary´s shoulder.</span></div>

<span style="color: teal"><b>Kiera &amp; Skrutsi:</b> Both of you arriving at the shipwreck at the same time, you look at the huge wooden ship, the mast the only thing rising out of the water. Looking down into the water, you see a large hole in the side of the ship, through which many, many Pokemon swim in and out in schools. Just in the few minutes which you watch, a school of Magikarp enter the ship, a very large Mantine exits, as well as a HUGE Gyarados, which seems to be at least 50 feet long. It swims around a bit before it gazes to the surface, and sees the shadow of Swampert. Gyarados's eyes narrow, and you notice that they are a very deep red, the color of blood, with no pupils. Without warning, it rockets up to the surface. As it breaks the surface, large waves erupt from the point, sending Jeff and Swampert back a few yards. The Gyarados continues to glare, before it opens its mouth wide, a ball of golden energy beginning to form...What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: teal">Jeff lets out a gasp as the giant Gyarados breaks through the water, holding onto Jamie tightly as they're both pushes backwards by the waves. As Gyarados started charging an attack in its mouth, Jeff tapped Jamie on the shoulder, and the Swampert looked back at him, nodding. Joshua had given Jamie orders to listen to Jeff if they got in trouble, and this seemed like a time they were in trouble.<br />
<br />
As Jeff fumbled for a PokeBall on his belt, he stared at the Gyarados, thinking. &quot;Jamie, if that thing attacks us, use your <b>PROTECT</b> to shield us as best you can.&quot; Jamie nodded, bracing himself, and Jeff finally found the ball he was looking for. He triggered the release, and with a flash, a Shiny Breloom was released onto Jamie's back. Tifa steadied herself, staring out at the Gyarados before them. &quot;Alright, this is going to be tricky. We're going to have to time ourselves just right here...&quot; Jeff said, watching the giant Sea-Serpent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tifa, after Jamie finishes with his protect, I want you to launch a <b>LEECH SEED</b> onto that thing, hopefully you snare it up. Jamie, if you feel it's safe to do so, swim forward and rock that thing with a <b>DYNAMICPUNCH</b>. Tifa, if we do get close enough, hit it with a <b>STUN SPORE</b>. Afterwards, back off, and let Joshua have a turn.&quot; Jeff ordered, still watching the Gyarados warily.<br />

However, rather than going to the Silver Forest, you head off in search of danger, to the Red Forest. As soon as you and your Pokemon enter the forest, you notice the steamy, humid, and hot atmosphere of the place and the wild array of Pokemon which it could support. However, you don't seem to notice any of these Pokemon, all you hear are calls of Pokemon deep within the forest. Wondering where all of the Pokemon are, Joe turns around to ask Stu what he thinks. However, much to his surprise, a rather large Arbok is wrapped around a blue faced Stu, preventing him from moving and just barely allowing him to breathe.

<span style="color: green"><span style="font-size: 9px">The fact that a huge Arbok could sneak up on both Joe and Stu unnoticed just proved how dangerous the Red Forest could be. But Joe didn't think about that for very long, as he saw the predicament he was in. He could tell by the sheer malicity of the attack that this Arbok was going to be as strong as anything else he'd ever fought. He reached to his belt, and grabbed the first Pokeball he could, before throwing it to the ground. After a large flash of red light, one of Joe's newest Pokemon unfurled on the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dunsparce, get that thing off of Stu with an Ancientpower, and then follow up by using Rage to knock it into a tree!&quot; ordered Joe, quickly, trying to spit out orders as fast as he could so that Stu didn't get choked to death. &quot;If it tries to attack you, use a Defense Curl to lighten the damage. Oh, and you better take this.&quot; He reached into his bag, and took out a small, pink berry, which looked a bit like an upside down peach. Joe gave the small berry to Dunsparce, and Dunsparce stared at it, confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;If that big snake thing poisons you, just eat that, and you should be alright in no time, okay?&quot; he said, and Dunsparce nodded, making it obvious that he now understood. Joe then got back to his feet, and waited for Dunsparce to start his assault on the Arbok, while Stu stood there, struggling to catch a breath.</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Green">Stuart squirmed constantly, making no affect on the Arbok's constricting body. He watched on as Joe released his newest Pokemon and this clearly was becoming Joe's most un-thought through idea ever. &quot;WHAT IS JOE PLAYING AT!??!? Is he trying to save me or have the Arbok froffle into defeat at the sight of Joe's Dunsparce?&quot; Not wanting to rely on Joe's Dunsparce Stuart tried even more to escape from the constricting and super dangerous cobra Pokemon. Its clear neither Stu or Joe had thought through every possibility of death at the Red Forest. Stu then looked over at Lily and Splinter wondering if Joe actually remembered he still had Shiftry by his side to help him instead of Dunsparce. He tried to give Joe and the Pokemon a smile, however the pain became to much for him as he just gave up moving completely. Then it seemed he was starting to losing consciousness and his eyes starting to close, however he then gave Joe one last 'oh my god Joe could you not find a better Pokemon to help us?' look.</span></span><br />

<span style="color: green"><b>Centin: </b>Beginning your journey in the lush Silver Forest, you gasp in amazement of the beauty of the area. From the silver lined leaves to the amazing abundance of wildlife, you find yourself in a state of amazement. However, as you continue your journey on, it seems as though the silver leaves are beginning to slightly lose their color, and wildlife becomes more and more scarce. After a while, you hear the sound of rushing water. Realizing that it's impossible that you got to the Diamond River already, you push your way through some brush and find yourself at a lake, the water extremely murky, with a slight blackish purple tinge. Looking around, you find a pipe sending the purple and black contaminants into the lake, and eventually realize that this is what's causing the Pokemon to move away from this area in the forest, instead retreating to the edges of the forest.<br />
<br />
What will you do? Follow the pipe to the source, perhaps?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: green">&quot;Ew, what is this discoloured liquid, and what is that horrid odour?&quot; Centin quickly closed his nose. He returned whatever his pokemon was out into its pokeball as he was trying to escape the area first. He ran back to the field of red leaves. The almost-barren landscape which was seemingly half-lived struggling to live from death, this was the place that Centin reside for the time being. After running without breath, he finally released his fingers and took in a deep breath. &quot;That, was not pleasant, at, all. You may come out now, Axtan,&quot; and out came a xatu that fled to its trainer's left shoulder in fright, probably because of the wicked scenery that looked like a grave yard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Axtan, shouldn't you be panting? Oh wait, you weren't there at the pipeline. Heh, good for you, you do not want to be there,&quot; Centin took another breath after that sentence. And a few more after that. &quot;Ugh, that thing is such an unpleasant thing, that my senses can even sense it fom here,&quot; the confused trainer paused for a while. &quot;Is it..spreading to this area too? No, it can't be,&quot; the trainer looked around. His xatu gazed at him for a moment, then gazed back to the scenery. &quot;Oh, alright fine. This calls for immediate urgency. Axtan, we are charging in and following the pipelines, regardless of its difficulty, that smell has just got to go, now!&quot; hearing that grumble, the xatu knew that it was in grave trouble, it did not like his trainer being angry and all that, so it just floated, and slowly hid behind its trainer and just followed wherever he walked to, or ran to.</span></div>

<b>Kiera &amp; Skrutsi:</b> Both of you arriving at the shipwreck at the same time, you look at the huge wooden ship, the mast the only thing rising out of the water. Looking down into the water, you see a large hole in the side of the ship, through which many, many Pokemon swim in and out in schools. Just in the few minutes which you watch, a school of Magikarp enter the ship, a very large Mantine exits, as well as a HUGE Gyarados, which seems to be at least 50 feet long. It swims around a bit before it gazes to the surface, and sees the shadow of Swampert. Gyarados's eyes narrow, and you notice that they are a very deep red, the color of blood, with no pupils. Without warning, it rockets up to the surface. As it breaks the surface, large waves erupt from the point, sending Jeff and Swampert back a few yards. The Gyarados continues to glare, before it opens its mouth wide, a ball of golden energy beginning to form...What will you do?

<span style="color: teal">Jeff lets out a gasp as the giant Gyarados breaks through the water, holding onto Jamie tightly as they're both pushes backwards by the waves. As Gyarados started charging an attack in its mouth, Jeff tapped Jamie on the shoulder, and the Swampert looked back at him, nodding. Joshua had given Jamie orders to listen to Jeff if they got in trouble, and this seemed like a time they were in trouble.<br />
<br />
As Jeff fumbled for a PokeBall on his belt, he stared at the Gyarados, thinking. &quot;Jamie, if that thing attacks us, use your <b>PROTECT</b> to shield us as best you can.&quot; Jamie nodded, bracing himself, and Jeff finally found the ball he was looking for. He triggered the release, and with a flash, a Shiny Breloom was released onto Jamie's back. Tifa steadied herself, staring out at the Gyarados before them. &quot;Alright, this is going to be tricky. We're going to have to time ourselves just right here...&quot; Jeff said, watching the giant Sea-Serpent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tifa, after Jamie finishes with his protect, I want you to launch a <b>LEECH SEED</b> onto that thing, hopefully you snare it up. Jamie, if you feel it's safe to do so, swim forward and rock that thing with a <b>DYNAMICPUNCH</b>. Tifa, if we do get close enough, hit it with a <b>STUN SPORE</b>. Afterwards, back off, and let Joshua have a turn.&quot; Jeff ordered, still watching the Gyarados warily.<br />
<br />
He glanced a look upward to Joshua and Hayley, murmuring under his breath, &quot;...Stay safe you two...&quot;</span>

Joshua grips onto Hayley tightly as she hovers above the sea, the Gyarados staring down at Jamie. Joshua's heart races at the sight of Jeff and Jamie in the Gyarados' line of fire.<br />
<br />
Jeff's commands to Jamie and Tifa float up to Joshua, and he leans in to whisper in Hayley's ear. &quot;Let's get its attention now, so Jeff can swim closer. Smack Gyarados in the face with a Swift, then let's dodge the attacks it'll send our way. Then, after Jeff is finished, strike with a Rock Slide, then end by zipping in and smashing Gyarados in its eyes with an Ice Punch!&quot;</span></div>

<span style="color: green"><b>Alilatias:</b> Trekking through Silver Forest, you see a multitude of Pokemon going about their daily business, just ignoring you as they go along. Continuing to walk through, you soon find an area of the forest which you haven't seen before, one tree towering over the entire area around it, at least twice as all as the other trees in the area. Examining the large tree more closely, you see a multitude of birds flying in and out of its branches. However, everything suddenly goes quiet, all of the squawking of the birds vanishing instantly. Wondering why, you don't have to for too long, as a pair of older looking gray Swellow swoop down on you, looking ready to attack you, as they consider you a threat. What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Green">&quot;Hey Saito! Look! Two Swellows! Just like Faltzer!&quot;<br />
<br />
That was Soruta's first reaction upon seeing both of those Swellow. However, it didn't take long for Saito to figure out that fighting Flying-type Pokemon would be the death of him. And so he took refuge behind Soruta as both of the Swellow swooped overhead.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Swellow seem a bit hostile though. Saito, why don't you try talking to them?&quot;<br />
<br />
But no. Saito wouldn't budge. He held tightly onto Soruta's leg, not wanting to let go. The sight of <i>ANY</i> fast flying Pokemon that wasn't on Soruta's team would freeze him in fear, but seeing them <i>ATTACK</i> would end up scaring him to death.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not going to talk, huh? I can understand why. Mabye they can only understand their own kind. Just be prepared to fight if we need to.&quot;<br />
<br />
With this, Soruta took out a miniature Level Ball from under her cyan-blue coat. After enlarging it to normal size, she tosses it into the crystal-blue sky, and in one swift motion, the Pokeball opens and a flash rings out through the forest. After the flash fades, Faltzer, her Swellow, is shown in his full aerial splendor. Faltzer looked at both of the hostile Swellows overhead, and looked down at Soruta and Saito, a bit confused as to what he should do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Faltzer! Try talking to both of those Swellow! Tell them that we just got here, and that we're just a bit lost!&quot;<br />
<br />
She was hoping that this would stop both of the Swellow from attacking, but knowing what most birds are like, this might make both Swellow attack Faltzer since he's just another male bird intruding into their territory. But even then, they had to do something, but what?<br />
<br />
Just as Faltzer was able to fly off and talk to them, Soruta began to warn him of certain 'other' things.<br />
<br />
&quot;Faltzer! Be careful! There's a chance that they'll still attack you! If that happens, quickly use <b>Double Team</b>, then try to intimidate them with a <b>Growl</b>! If they're still attacking after that, confuse them with a <b>Supersonic</b>!&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning to Saito, who was still clutching onto her leg, she said, &quot;Saito. I'm pretty sure Faltzer can handle this. Don't try hitting them with an attack if they come too close. We're not trying to hurt them. But if this gets too serious, we're going to have to defend ourselves. Right now, just prepare yourself with a <b>Swords Dance</b>, and then we'll just wait and see what happens.&quot;</span></span></div>
