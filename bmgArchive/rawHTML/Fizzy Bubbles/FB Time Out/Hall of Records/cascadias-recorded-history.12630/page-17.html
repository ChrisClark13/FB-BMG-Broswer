SilverWind</b></u> – <b>Pearl Lake</b><i>Reply in deepskyblue<br />
</i><br />
Giving orders to the pokemon and putting on your diving gear you look at the ensuing battle. First to react is Pathos, sending a <b>Pulse </b>of dark <b>energy </b>underwater, hitting the biggest looking of the Huntail. It winces and looks at Pathos and <b>Screech</b>es, Causing the two other Huntail to swim forward and cover him. Seems like there is some sort of heirachy in this group. They both <b>growl </b>furiouslyat the pokemon, if they are willing to do this for some Clamperl there must be <i>something </i>important here. Next Seel and Pathos nod and swim forward, the Seel swimming forward as fast as it can possibly swim, knocking the wind out of one of a Huntail with a <b>headbutt</b>. This causes it to float backwards, allowing you to see a scar on its belly. Taking the chance Pathos aims at it and fires a <b>psy</b>chic <b>wave</b>, a perfect shot would defeat it. Before he can cheer however he sees that the second, non-scarred, Huntail takes the hit. They nod to each other and swim forward, their turn.<br />
<br />
They <b>both</b> swim forwards, their jaws opening and shutting enough to<b> crunch </b>through a rock. Pathos tries to <b>mimic</b> this, but to no avail, opening it's mouth underwater wasn't good for an airbreather. Alongside that, it has no teeth sharp enough to do damage! Since it can't actually defend Pathos takes a hit to the face, but reacts fast enough to kick the assailant away. Seel reacts fast enough to hit it with the<b> ice shard </b>attack you told it to do. The Huntail are both raring to go, but they're waiting for your squad's attacks.<br />
<br />
This round seems to have taken a light toll on the two Huntail, as they are both 90 percent healthy. Pathos is starting to turn a light shade of blue, it either needs to find some air or get in it's pokeball, as it probably won't last long here. Seel is okay as well, but it seems like it prefers long range to close combat fighting. Tortuga looks like he wants to get in the match to help his friends.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DeepSkyBlue">&quot;Pathos!” Flippy called out. But he didn't have any real battle strategy: Golduck hadn't told him anything about this strange Huntail Pokémon and all Flipp had to go off of was the surrounding terrain and the creature's unusal rankings. Knowing Pathos wouldn’t be able to continue this battle much further due to his need to breath, he felt it best to let Tortuga take his place. Reaching out of the Dive bubble, Flippy McGee pulled Pathos in, and Tuga darted out. Oddly enough the Bubble which held plenty of air, and the ability of speech, it held both Flippy and Pathos without the need of his Wartortle. <br />
<br />
Continuing his orders to Seel, he cried out, &quot;Wait for fishy to make a move, then use <b>Ice Shard</b>!&quot; Realizing he still didn't know what sort of attacks the glum glob might muster, Red added on, &quot;After that, I want you to use <b>Aura Beam</b> after Tuga finishs with his attacks!&quot;<br />
<br />
“Tortuga, let’s do some move attacks, eh?” Flippy spoke in her encouraging voice, and feeling the sensation of continuing the battle, the green tortoise raised a fist in the air, before pausing to hear more of his master’s orders. “Okay, so let’s see if you can use your <b>Tail Whip</b>ping action to power up your <b>Skull Bash</b>, most likely blasting through them. After the shards of course, then <b>Rapid Spin</b> your way back to deal some more damage!”<br />
<br />
Giving him the thumps up, understanding what her new commands were, Tortuga smirked, before he turned back to the Huntail, ready to carry on with the battle.</span></span></div>

Your negotiation's were replied by a mere chuckle, &quot;So you figured out what we'd do. Too bad, I really did like Mike, but its an acceptable loss. There's nothing to tell you.&quot; Mike turns to him in shock, clearly surprised by his leader's remark, accidentaly breaking your grip on him. &quot;But we can tell you this, Your friend Ranjona isn't everything you think she i...&quot; He doesn't get to end his sentence, a loud creak coming from the barred door as you are released from your cell! You look up at Mike, a key in his hands, who looks hurt at his leader's words.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you're gonna let me die, You will come with me!&quot; He looks at you with sadness in his eyes, &quot;I don't want this anymore. Please help me out.&quot; He grasps your hands non-threateningly and places a pokeball in your hands, &quot;They gave me this pokeball to use as a hostage if you got out, we heard you were a very dangerous person.&quot;<br />
<br />
The moment is interrupted as the captain speaks up &quot;Haha! You think that after your whole life as a Blood Syndicate member you can just quit?! You have made a blood oath to our king! There's only one way out, Death!&quot; He looks at two of the guards, &quot;you two, get rid of them, will you?&quot;<br />
<br />
One of the guards looks at him questioningly, &quot;S-s-sir, are you sure about this? Mike is just going through a phase, thats it!&quot; He looks at the captain for a mere second before being lifted by the neck onto a wall. The captain was a lot stronger than he looked.</span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DarkOrange"><br />
&quot;You kill him, or I kill you, make a choice.&quot; Dropping the guard the captain walked out, alongside him the rest of the guards, &quot;By the way, you have twenty minutes.&quot; They hesitantly nod before hesitantly releasing a Solrock and a Machoke. <br />
<br />
As Mike releases a Sandslash you have many questions running through your head: What pokemon is in the pokeball? Can you realy trust Mike? What will you do?<br />
<br />

</i>You ask Shane if he had ever tried climbing the waterfall, to which he just chuckles &quot;That's a crazy idea, I tried that once, and I ended up with a broken arm. If only I were a monkey.&quot; He contemplates. He pases a little, and steps on a rock. This causes the room's floor to collapse, with you and Krane faling alongside. <br />
<br />
After a few seconds of fallling you realise that you felt no pain, and that you and Krane are sitting in some sort of shrine. A shrine to a Mamoswine, but it had golden tusks. Underneath there is a plaque, with a few words inscribed into it &quot;<i>The Only way out is to defeat the tree guardians of the temple, find the answer to the riddle of the ancients, and destroy the totem of death.</i>&quot; You read it out loud and see three ornate doors behind you, one with a drawing of the earth, one of with a drawing of fire, and one with a drawing of the Sea. &quot;Woa! I feel the pokemon on the other side, they are, angry, to say the least.&quot; Krane yells, he was totally amazed at what was happening to the doors as they were moving, and was frigtened at what could be on the other side. They were taking each other's place, and you knew you would have to pick one, You look at the signs, &quot;The Earthly Bond&quot;, &quot;The Flames of Death&quot;, and the &quot;Sea of Souls.&quot; Very appealing. </span></span><br />

</i>The pokemon shoot out at the enemy and they shoot back. The scarred one brings creates a loud <b>screech</b> underwater which creates bubbles around it and the other two Huntails, an unorthodox way of using that particular attack, but an effective one, as they had cover. The Seel tries to get rid of the bubbles by using the <b>Ice shard </b>attack to pop the bubbles and it partially works, hitting the second Huntail<i>'s tail</i>, leaving a small cut. Normally this would cause no problems, but under deep water the coldness could kill a pokemon. The Huntail had to swim into the shallower water, soon. Departing, the pokemon left you to fight the bigger, and more dangerous one. <br />
<br />
Tortuga looks at the enemy, and as they lock eyes Tortuga waggles his tail like a whip, in a way that would make you proud. Distraught, the Huntail doesn't notice the Seel charging and shooting it with an<b> aurora beam</b>, knocking it back. Tortuga takes its chance and aims its <b>skull</b> at the enemy and<b> bash</b>es, hitting it straight on in the mouth! That proves to be too much as the Huntail's teeth shatter, leaving it to run away.<br />
<br />
The Third Huntail steps up and as you look at it you realise that it is at least twice the size of the other two! This match was gonna be hard, and you knew it.<br />
<br />
What will you do? </span></span></span><br />

</i>Your pokemon prepare to fight and Prestige begins by creating a barrier, taking half of his energy away from him. The sandsrew falls for the bluff and <b>Curls</b> into a ball to raise its <b>defence</b>. Prestige begins to<b> focus</b>, his energy reaching its peaks and a ball of energy begining to form. the Sandshrew begins to <b>roll out </b>at Prestige, hitting the barrier. The powers collide, and just as the Sandsrew breaks the barrier Prestige <b>Blasts</b> the energy, sending the enemy shrew flying, fainting it or worse. Prestige floats to you, it wasn't anywhere near fainting, but it did have zero energy left.<br />
<br />
Alberta begins her own match and looks at her opponent, they begin charging energy into their hands, Alberta's being <b>thunder</b> and Magby's being<b> fire</b>. They ram each other and <b>punch</b>, causing the air to cackle with all sorts of energy. The attacks end and Alberta comes out victorious, knocking the Magby back. Taking its chance Alberta began forming rocks in an <b>ancient </b>way, shooting them at the exposed Magby with all her<b> power</b>. The weight is too much and the Magby faints, ending the four matches!&quot; <br />
<br />
The unrelenting sun doesn't care however and you are overtaken by fire. You scream in pain as the flames bring you to your death.<br />

</i>Gek quickly finishes what it had started by freezing the man up to his neck, when the police came he would be there. The Ditto leads you to a cafe, where you sit at a round table with two chairs. The ditto uses its powers to transform into an Abra, and begins reeling memories into your mind. You see an younger looking old man capturing a Ditto with a Flaffy, the ditto rejoicing at having a home. You then see another memory, a pink egg, held by the old man at a closer age to what you saw him last, this Ditto's egg. A birthday Party with a cake labeled &quot;Happy 80th Boyd!&quot; The old man blows 3 candles and everyone rejoices. The memories end, and you see the Ditto as a Ditto again. <br />
<br />
Before you know it the Ditto morphs into a Pidgeot and becons you to get on. About a half an hour of flying later you find yourself at an intersection with three buildings, a warehouse, a condemned building, and a power plant. The Ditto morphs into a Natu &quot;I know he's here, in one of these buildings, I can feel it.&quot; it turns into a normal Ditto again, ready for you to make the choice. This was going to be a very dificult decision, as any of these decrepid buildings could hold the old man, Boyd. <br />

Your negotiation's were replied by a mere chuckle, &quot;So you figured out what we'd do. Too bad, I really did like Mike, but its an acceptable loss. There's nothing to tell you.&quot; Mike turns to him in shock, clearly surprised by his leader's remark, accidentaly breaking your grip on him. &quot;But we can tell you this, Your friend Ranjona isn't everything you think she i...&quot; He doesn't get to end his sentence, a loud creak coming from the barred door as you are released from your cell! You look up at Mike, a key in his hands, who looks hurt at his leader's words.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you're gonna let me die, You will come with me!&quot; He looks at you with sadness in his eyes, &quot;I don't want this anymore. Please help me out.&quot; He grasps your hands non-threateningly and places a pokeball in your hands, &quot;They gave me this pokeball to use as a hostage if you got out, we heard you were a very dangerous person.&quot;<br />
<br />
The moment is interrupted as the captain speaks up &quot;Haha! You think that after your whole life as a Blood Syndicate member you can just quit?! You have made a blood oath to our king! There's only one way out, Death!&quot; He looks at two of the guards, &quot;you two, get rid of them, will you?&quot;<br />
<br />
One of the guards looks at him questioningly, &quot;S-s-sir, are you sure about this? Mike is just going through a phase, thats it!&quot; He looks at the captain for a mere second before being lifted by the neck onto a wall. The captain was a lot stronger than he looked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You kill him, or I kill you, make a choice.&quot; Dropping the guard the captain walked out, alongside him the rest of the guards, &quot;By the way, you have twenty minutes.&quot; They hesitantly nod before hesitantly releasing a Solrock and a Machoke. <br />
<br />
As Mike releases a Sandslash you have many questions running through your head: What pokemon is in the pokeball? Can you realy trust Mike? What will you do?<br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Despite Stacey's threats and the choke hold she had on one of his recruits the leader she had demanded to talk to merely chuckled. Frowned whilst keeping her tight grip on Mike's torso and neck, she had this man at her mercy, able to end his life with a slight movement and he did not seem bothered, this is what had worried her.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you figured out what we'd do. Too bad, I really did like Mike, but its an acceptable loss. There's nothing to tell you.&quot; he said and Mike twisted in her tight grasp coughing from the pressure on his throat and a horrified look on his face. Had she'd been in the same situation she would be as concerned as he was. <br />
<br />
&quot;But we can tell you this, Your friend Ranjona isn't everything you think she i...&quot; he doesn't get to finish his speech as the door swings open, the bars through which Stacey had her arms moving away from her and she loses her grip on Mike. A faint look of pain flashes through her eyes before they stare at the man with confusion. <br />
<br />
&quot;If you're gonna let me die, You will come with me!&quot; He says eyes filled with sorrow, &quot;I don't want this anymore. Please help me out.&quot; Stacey couldn't help but feel how convient this all was. When the leader reveal how expendable he was he decided this way of life wasn't for him. What atrocities could he have performed in the past willingly for this man only to bail when his life was threatened. It was weak if nothing else but she could see desparation in his eyes and as he handed her a red and white sphere she felt doubt. <br />
<br />
&quot;They gave me this pokeball to use as a hostage if you got out, we heard you were a very dangerous person.&quot; he explained. 'Smart tactics' Stacey thought, had she grabbed anyone but Mike then he would have threatened her Pokemon. She growled low in her throat and grasped the ball tightly, she didn't doubt that he would have followed through too until now. <br />
<br />
&quot;Haha! You think that after your whole life as a Blood Syndicate member you can just quit?! You have made a blood oath to our king! There's only one way out, Death!&quot; He yelled before turning to the remaining two guards, &quot;you two, get rid of them, will you?&quot; causing startled gasps from them. It appeared that they were more loyal to their friends than the Captain would have liked as he rammed the one who dared to open his mouth against the wall by his neck threatening to kill him if he didn't follow orders. Dropping him to the ground he marched off leaving the two hapless guards to fight his battle. Mike stood his ground as they released their Pokemon, a Solrock and a Machoke and reached for a Pokeball his own releasing a Sandslash to fight.<br />
<br />
Stacey couldn't be sure that Mike's intentions were pure in all this, how could she trust someone who turned so fast from one side to the other? This could all be some elaborate ploy, a new kind of torture technique. But it appeared for now that she had no choice, she didn't fancy fighting in place of a Pokemon, that would not end well. Looking down to the Pokeball in her hand she studied it hard trying to decipher which of her Pokemon was within. A lot of her team were housed in special unique pokeballs making it easy to tell them apart, a few still remained in their original Pokeballs: Sableye, Zubat, Kabuto, Rotom, Koffing and Jolteon if she recalled correctly. Drusilla was still out in the forest somewhere, hopefully keeping far away from the rest of these mad soliders. This particular Pokeball was very worn with the odd few scratches on it surface. She instantly knew who was in it and grinned manically, 'oh they picked the wrong Pokemon to take hostage' she thought holding the ball close to her heart.<br />
<br />
&quot;You've both made a big mistake,&quot; she said releasing her Pokemon, the purple gremlin known as a Sableye appearing before her wearing a pair of black glasses. He stared at the two larger Pokemon before him and gave a wicked smirk, oh how he felt ready to battle.<br />
<br />
&quot;We will end this quickly. Impish, this man and his Sandslash ... may be on our side but keep a watchful eye.&quot; she said before turning to Mike.<br />
<br />
&quot;Solrock is ours,&quot; not giving him chance to protest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Imp, <b>Flash</b> then attack with <b>Nightshade</b> and <b>Shadow Claw</b>.&quot;</span></span></div>

</i>Your pokemon prepare to fight and Prestige begins by creating a barrier, taking half of his energy away from him. The sandsrew falls for the bluff and <b>Curls</b> into a ball to raise its <b>defence</b>. Prestige begins to<b> focus</b>, his energy reaching its peaks and a ball of energy begining to form. the Sandshrew begins to <b>roll out </b>at Prestige, hitting the barrier. The powers collide, and just as the Sandsrew breaks the barrier Prestige <b>Blasts</b> the energy, sending the enemy shrew flying, fainting it or worse. Prestige floats to you, it wasn't anywhere near fainting, but it did have zero energy left.<br />
<br />
Alberta begins her own match and looks at her opponent, they begin charging energy into their hands, Alberta's being <b>thunder</b> and Magby's being<b> fire</b>. They ram each other and <b>punch</b>, causing the air to cackle with all sorts of energy. The attacks end and Alberta comes out victorious, knocking the Magby back. Taking its chance Alberta began forming rocks in an <b>ancient </b>way, shooting them at the exposed Magby with all her<b> power</b>. The weight is too much and the Magby faints, ending the four matches!&quot; <br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DarkOrchid">After winning the last two battles, Alina noticed how unrelenting the sun was as they rose into the sky. The heat was unbearable, and within seconds she was engulfed by flames...<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Waking up with a jolt, Alina snapped her eyes open to find a wooden ceiling instead of a sun with the face of a bull above her. She stretched her arm out to examine it and found no sign of burns, or any damage what so ever, much to her relief. Sighing, she continued to stare at the ceiling, thinking over her disturbing nightmare, then began to laugh hysterically. What a messed up dream... pity that her Typhlosion actually didn't evolve. She yawned as she looked over to examine the room she was in, and her eyes fell on a kind looking lady, laying beside her was a fierce, yet familiar, Typhlosion. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why, it looks loke you woke up! Let me tell you you are lucky to be alive! Seviper venom is very lethal, if I hadn't found you you would be dead!&quot; the lady said with a smile. &quot;My name is Edna, by the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hello,&quot; Alina said, struggling to sit upright. &quot;My name is Alina. Thanks for curing me--&quot;<br />
<br />
Alina immediately rushed to finish this last sentence as the Typhlosion stretched and yawned widely, showing off a set of pearly white, perfectly aligned, and razor sharp teeth. The gigantic fiery behemoth before her was making her rather nervous... at least this old lady didn't have to worry about any burglars. However, instead of a terrifying growl like Alina expected, the Typhlosion got a puppy dog look on its face and trotted up to be petted instead. Confused and feeling rather shy, she scratched the Pokemon behind the ear, saying &quot;I have a Pokemon like you, only smaller. He's only a Quilava...&quot;<br />
<br />
As she said this the Typhlosion got a hurt look on his face as she tried to find the Pokeball which held her precious Ignatius. She saw Prestige back inside his own Pokeball and assumed that he left Alina and hid himself within his own Pokeball when the Seviper came. What a jerk. Finding the Pokeball she was looking for she tried to release her Quilava, but no Pokemon came out. She curiously looked inside the Pokeball and then turned to look over the familiar looking Typhlosion.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;That's yours, idiot,</i> came a voice, which obviously belonged to Prestige, from within her bag. <i>&quot;You didn't think I'd leave you to be a Seviper snack, did you? He must have evolved some time during then.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Half expecting to wake up again, Alina scrached behind the ear of her supposedly new Typhlosion. She glanced out the window and saw that the sun and the sky were normal once more, and all seemed good and logical in the world again. Perhaps this was reality...<br />
<br />
And the pain in her leg proved it. It was a throbbing pain, and definately real. It made her scared to look down to see the damage that was done to her, since she knew it would be a grotesque sight. God how she hated getting hurt, or seeing wounds. Her favorite show on TV was about a doctor, ironically, and she would always become woozy due at the sight of surgeries, or wounds of any sort. Despite her dread, however, she held her breath and winced as she looked down at her leg... But, the sight wasn't nearly as bad as it felt. It was neatly bandaged by Edna, preventing Alina from seeing anything too graphic besides some small spots of blood on the cloth. Attempting to stand, Alina pushed herself off the bed, using Ignatius for support and wincing when she put a little weight on her bad leg. Still, it wasn't too bad... but she was definitely going to be stuck here for a while. She certainly wasn't fit to be doing any traveling. She plopped back down on the bed and asked Edna &quot;Well, while I'm here, I have to repay you somehow. I wouldn't feel right about simply leaving without a proper thank you. Do you need to have anything done around the house, or..?&quot;</span></span></div>

Though it was kind of squat and full of root-tentacles, she figured that maybe when he got older he’d grow out of his unfortunate adolescent state.

What’s with the sudden change in attitude, and why did Rocky have googly-eyes all of a sudden? Either way he followed her while scratching every nervous itch that overcame his body, still extremely weary of the homely flytrap whom Rocky managed to give bedroom eyes to the whole time.<br />
<br />
Both Rocky and Paul became bothered when the carnivine revealed what he wanted to consume. The hippie managed to protest right away and yelped, “Oh, no, no no! I do NOT want to be responsible for whatever it is you want to do to that weanling chicken!” He took a step back from the nest and frowned. He had already been responsible for the lives of a couple dozen beetles, the last thing he needed on his shoulders was this.<br />
<br />
“<i>Hey, sweet-cheeks, you’re upsetting my hippie, here,</i>” the seedot cooed, trying to use what little sex appeal she had to divert the attention of the carnivine elsewhere. Winking at him seductively, she said, “<i>You’re a growing boy, and eating that little starly would be like shooting majikarps in a puddle. Maybe I can teach ya to hunt like a real man.</i>”<br />

</i>You ask Shane if he had ever tried climbing the waterfall, to which he just chuckles &quot;That's a crazy idea, I tried that once, and I ended up with a broken arm. If only I were a monkey.&quot; He contemplates. He pases a little, and steps on a rock. This causes the room's floor to collapse, with you and Krane faling alongside. After a few seconds of fallling you realise that you felt no pain, and that you and Krane are sitting in some sort of shrine. A shrine to a Mamoswine, but it had golden tusks. Underneath there is a plaque, with a few words inscribed into it &quot;<i>The Only way out is to defeat the tree guardians of the temple, find the answer to the riddle of the ancients, and destroy the totem of death.</i>&quot; You read it out loud and see three ornate doors behind you, one with a drawing of the earth, one of with a drawing of fire, and one with a drawing of the Sea. &quot;Woa! I feel the pokemon on the other side, they are, angry, to say the least.&quot; Krane yells, he was totally amazed at what was happening to the doors as they were moving, and was frigtened at what could be on the other side. They were taking each other's place, and you knew you would have to pick one, You look at the signs, &quot;The Earthly Bond&quot;, &quot;The Flames of Death&quot;, and the &quot;Sea of Souls.&quot; Very appealing. </span></span>

<span style="color: darkorange">The girl remembered this place well, albeit a little less fungus-laden. Heck, she even saw a couple of people put in the door way back when. Though she was a bit worried when she remembered what the people said; &quot;Never again.&quot; Their situation now was incredibly undesirable, what with three unappealingly-named doorways, inside of each what were no doubt vicious Pokémon. Desperately attempting to find a way out of this, she examined the Mamoswine statue from head to hoof, from tusk to tail, but to no effect. As little as she wanted to, she would, in fact, have to pick a door. As she weighed out the potential doorways, she finally decided upon the Sea Of Souls, which would be could and wet, a stark contrast to most of the place. She put her hand to the doorknob and opened the door...</span></span></div>

You step through the door with Krane following alongside, and once you step through you realise you are floating. A strange sensation wells up inside you, as if you were on an ever-moving pendelum. You look all around to see Krane floating as well, and that the entrance has disappeared! On closer inspection you realise that you and Krane are the only things in the viscinity, you were surrounded by blackness and there was no sound!<br />
<br />
&quot;It's like being in space!&quot; Krane breaks the silence, and as he does the world around you begins spinning! A few seconds later you are in what seems to be a raft, or more specifically some logs tied together with a makeshift sail at the top, made of what looked like palm leaves. Everywhere around you there is nothing but endless ocean, with water that seemed to be black, with no fish. The skies above you? Red, crimson red!<br />
<br />
&quot;It's like were in a totally different world. It seems like there is nobody here, but I feel many prescences&quot; Just then, a <i>pale hand</i> tugs at your raft. Then more, then millions. You look at the water, and find that the hands are attached to bodies. Half skeletonized bodies, with raw flesh still clinging to them. </span><br />
<br />
<i><span style="color: darkorange">&quot;FREEEEEEEE-DOM.&quot;</span></i><span style="color: darkorange"> a group of voices speak.</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"><br />

</span> <span style="font-family: 'Verdana'"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">You are sorrounded by the skeletonized bodies, before being <i>lifted? </i>You look around to see you and Krane on top of a giant Seadra's back, it was ten times the size of a regular Seadra! &quot;I hope you are okay.&quot; You turn to Krane, only to see him turn to you! &quot;Up here!&quot; You look up and sure enough The Kingdra is the one speaking! &quot;You two are very lucky, had I not come by your anscestors would have probably eaten you up.&quot; You and Krane share a look of confusion, Before it speaks: &quot;Yes, those things in the water were the <i>dead. </i>I am Horace, the guardian of the Sea of Souls. Pokemon and humans come here after death, occasionally a live human stumbles upon this place, and I have to protect them from their, less living counterparts.

You turn to see the culprit, a pale-white Mantyke with red Eyes, made that way by blood. &quot;It looks like a roudy dead one, do you mind taking care of it? I can't deal in the matters of the already-dead.&quot; Horace speaks up, as if he hadn't felt the last attack, and it didn't seem like he had.</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"><br />

Impish takes his opportunity to bring in energy from around him, turning all the potential energy around him into a dark aura before shooting it at the Solrock, who explodes and dissapears in a cloud of plush. The <b>nightshade</b> must have been stronger than it seemed!<br />
<br />
Wait, Plush?<br />
<i><br />
Alongside that on the field....</i><br />
<br />
The Machoke starts out it's battle by running up to the Sandslash, bringing its fist up, about to <b>karate chop</b> its opponent, but right before reaching it it falls into sand. <b>Sand </b>Placed there to create a <b>tomb </b>for the opponent, by the Sandslash. The proud pokemon begins <b>digging </b>underground for a while and you hear it as it tunnels under you, before coming out from under the trapped Machoke, effectively hitting it in the face. As the Machoke is thrown into the air it comes down with its leg aimed down, <b>kick</b>ing its opponent<b> low</b>ly. They both fall through the tomb, and end up in the tunnel. This one was going to be up to the pokemon then...<br />
<i><br />
Back to Impish...</i><br />
<br />
&quot;They fell for the <b>substitute</b> ploy Igniter, follow it up with a<b> Zen headbutt</b>!&quot; You hear the grunt that had been lifted say. Before either you or Impish can react the meteor pokemon comes down with all of it's rock weight falling from above. The energy surrounding it managing to hit Sableye and causing damage, but its physical body slamming right through! The Solrock hits the ground and creates a crater, one as deep as a pool! Looks like the power of the attack actually hurt the Solrock more than Impish, as he can't be hurt by Psychic types! The woozy meteor pokemon looks up at its opponent, who wastes no time using its<b> claws</b> infused with <b>shadow</b> energy, waking the Solrock up, who <b>Psywaves</b> Impish, causing minimal damage, but creating space between your pokemon and itself. <br />
<br />
You stomp your foot, and realise that the noise caused by the ground below you is twice as loud as it should be. Why could that be? You look at around you, where's Mike?! Where is the grunt in control of the Machoke?!<br />

“<i>Hey, sweet-cheeks, you’re upsetting my hippie, here,</i>”Rocky, being the attaractive acorn that she was, tried to use her apparent sex appeal to entice the Carnivine to hunt, which the Carnivine took to noticing really easily. “<i>You’re a growing boy, and eating that little starly would be like shooting majikarps in a puddle. Maybe I can teach ya to hunt like a real man.</i>” The Carnivine blushes and turns, before turning back at Rocky, a look of joy in his eyes. Was a female pokemon actually interested in him? He turned back at Rocky, his apparent inexperience with women lead him to this response:<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Uh, huh-huh,uh...&quot; </i>It stuttered <i>&quot;s-s-sure thing, whatever you want... um, beautiful. Whattttever you want.&quot;</i> He then proceeds to wipe the sweat from his brow and face, wait, sweat? He must really have it in for Rocky, or maybe it was his first experience with a female being interested in him? Nevertheless, he looked at Rocky, if she wanted to train him in the ways of hunting, he would listen, and maybe you wouldn't need to hunt a baby Starly tonight.<br />
<br />
You hear rustling in the bushes, and turn to find an angry Staravia mother staring at you from her nest, alongside Rocky and the Carnivine, maybe she'd get her chance to teach him to hunt later, but for the moment, they needed to protect themselves from a Glowing <b>bird</b>. </span><span style="color: green">A very <b>brave</b> looking one.</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"><br />

</i>After hearing your offering to help her Edna turns to you and smiles, showing you a very beautiful set of pearly whites. &quot;No, thank you. You are still in clinical condition, and I advise you to stay in bed for the next few hours, It is very sweet of you to ask though. Don't worry about being a burden, you can stay here as long as you need. This is a three bedroom house, and I'm the only person who lives here, so I have plenty of food and space.&quot; She smiles and looks at you, were you surprised an old woman was living alone in the world's most dangerous forest? <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I'm not the only one here technically,&quot; as she says that a Zigzagoon walks in the room, and you notice a bandage around it's front right arm. Edna catches you ogling at its leg and continues &quot;oh yes deary, Moofins here is my guard pokemon, and he's the one who lead me to find you, stepping on a Pineco on the way. It was not happy. When I was there you were on the ground mumbling something about Prestige using blizzard. The snake was long gone when I got there, but the puncture wounds made it very clear, your Typhlosion made the trek here with you on his back, and it all went downhill from there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh by the way, I had to wrap the punctures on your leg with a scarf, my <b>scarf </b>of <b>choice</b>. I don't think Its useful for me anymore, but if you are interested in it you can have it, although it needs some cleaning. I suggest you stay another night, it is getting dark outside. That is when you don't risk going outside. I won't stop you if you want to leave however.&quot; She leaves and comes back a few seconds later with some cookies, &quot;I made them in case you wanted anything when you woke up. So, Alina, anything alse you want to eat, perhaps talk to me about your adventures?&quot; She gives you a kindly smile, before petting her Zigzagoon.<br />

You step through the door with Krane following alongside, and once you step through you realise you are floating. A strange sensation wells up inside you, as if you were on an ever-moving pendelum. You look all around to see Krane floating as well, and that the entrance has disappeared! On closer inspection you realise that you and Krane are the only things in the viscinity, you were surrounded by blackness and there was no sound!<br />
<br />
&quot;It's like being in space!&quot; Krane breaks the silence, and as he does the world around you begins spinning! A few seconds later you are in what seems to be a raft, or more specifically some logs tied together with a makeshift sail at the top, made of what looked like palm leaves. Everywhere around you there is nothing but endless ocean, with water that seemed to be black, with no fish. The skies above you? Red, crimson red!<br />
<br />
&quot;It's like were in a totally different world. It seems like there is nobody here, but I feel many prescences&quot; Just then, a <i>pale hand</i> tugs at your raft. Then more, then millions. You look at the water, and find that the hands are attached to bodies. Half skeletonized bodies, with raw flesh still clinging to them. </span><br />

After the girl cleared her head, she then realized what she had got herself into. &quot;Oh, holy [censored]. How did I get myself into this? I'm up to my [censored] in corpses, stuck in the middle of [censored] nowhere, either out of my mind or completely and totally- Oh, my God? Why am I doing this? What is happening to me!? Snap out of it, snap out of it, SNAP OUT OF IT! ...Oh, lord, I'm still here. And I gotta get out as soon as I can.&quot; The girl now focused all her attention to looking at the dreaded corpse in front of her, and not the ones below her. She knew that Torchlight would be of little use here, and she decided to throw in two viable alternatives. &quot;Don't look down, don't look down... Volante! Grinder! Go!&quot; Out popped a Pidgey and an Aipom. &quot;Grinder! Open this round with a Tail Whip, then Sand Attack and Tackle in that order! Volante! When Grinder Sand Attacks, you join him!

Impish takes his opportunity to bring in energy from around him, turning all the potential energy around him into a dark aura before shooting it at the Solrock, who explodes and dissapears in a cloud of plush. The <b>nightshade</b> must have been stronger than it seemed!<br />
<br />
Wait, Plush?<br />
<i><br />
Alongside that on the field....</i><br />
<br />
The Machoke starts out it's battle by running up to the Sandslash, bringing its fist up, about to <b>karate chop</b> its opponent, but right before reaching it it falls into sand. <b>Sand </b>Placed there to create a <b>tomb </b>for the opponent, by the Sandslash. The proud pokemon begins <b>digging </b>underground for a while and you hear it as it tunnels under you, before coming out from under the trapped Machoke, effectively hitting it in the face. As the Machoke is thrown into the air it comes down with its leg aimed down, <b>kick</b>ing its opponent<b> low</b>ly. They both fall through the tomb, and end up in the tunnel. This one was going to be up to the pokemon then...<br />
<i><br />
Back to Impish...</i><br />
<br />
&quot;They fell for the <b>substitute</b> ploy Igniter, follow it up with a<b> Zen headbutt</b>!&quot; You hear the grunt that had been lifted say. Before either you or Impish can react the meteor pokemon comes down with all of it's rock weight falling from above. The energy surrounding it managing to hit Sableye and causing damage, but its physical body slamming right through! The Solrock hits the ground and creates a crater, one as deep as a pool! Looks like the power of the attack actually hurt the Solrock more than Impish, as he can't be hurt by Psychic types! The woozy meteor pokemon looks up at its opponent, who wastes no time using its<b> claws</b> infused with <b>shadow</b> energy, waking the Solrock up, who <b>Psywaves</b> Impish, causing minimal damage, but creating space between your pokemon and itself. <br />
<br />
You stomp your foot, and realise that the noise caused by the ground below you is twice as loud as it should be. Why could that be? You look at around you, where's Mike?! Where is the grunt in control of the Machoke?!</span></span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">With Impish next to her Stacey filled filled with renewed confidence, he always made her feel safe and there was no way that these two and their pathetic Pokemon would stop her now. Imp threw a sideways glance at Mike heeding Stacey's instructions to keep a careful watch on him. He could sense her concern and suspicions and was prepared to take him out, he would revel in it too. Focusing back on his intended target he approached it almost cockily, a wide smile on his face revealing his silver teeth. They circled one another before the Sableye's eyes glowed a bright white a Flash of burning light radiating from them blinding the Solrock. Cackling he summoned ghost energy into his Topaz eyes shooting twin beams of Nightshade at the Psychic rock causing an explosion of dust and fluff as the Solrock litterally explodes. Impish cackled and stood with his hands on his hips beaming like he just won the greatest fight of his life single handedly. Stacey rolled her eyes at his behaviour, something was off, there was not way a mere Nightshade would kill a Solrock.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Machoke was facing off against Mike's Sandslash and charged right for it arm pulled back ready to chop its head clean off its shoulders. Just as it reached the sand mouse it fell right into a Sand Tomb ensnared by the swirling pits of grit. Sandslash grinned and dived into the ground digging its way under the stone and popping up underneath Machoke driving its claws into its belly. Machoke regained its foot and baseball slided right at Sandslash with a Low Kick knocking them both into the tomb and subsequently underground.<br />
<br />
Focusing back on her battle Stacey heard the grunt congratulate his Solrock called Igniter for the Substitute Ploy and ordered a Zen Headbutt. The Solrock flew right for Impish and right through him impacting the floor rather hard. Impish brushed off the attack being immune to the psychic energy of it. Solrock woozily flotaed back up seeing stars before a purple claw entered its vision as Imp raked his Shadow Claw along its face. Brought out of its stupor Solrock fired some psywaves at Imp merely pushing him back slightly as he rolled his eyes at the feeble efforts of the sun Pokemon.<br />
<br />
Stacey grinned but her smile dropped when she saw that Mike had gone. How could he have dissappeared so quickly? As a matter of fact, his Pokemon had gone along with Machoke and the grunt that owned it. Tapping her foot against the floor she heard the hollow sound beneath, had they gone down a floor? Was there another floor below here? With Solrokc cirlcing Impish she'd have to go searching later, better finish off the battle first.<br />
<br />
&quot;Imp way to show them how pathetic their attempts are. Shall we really drive the point home?&quot; she asked as Impy cackled loudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then. <b>Nasty Plot</b> to churn up such wonderful ideas of torture and pain then attack with <b>Shadow Sneak</b> and <b>Hidden Power (Steel)</b>.&quot; </span></span></div>

</i>The pokemon shoot out at the enemy and they shoot back. The scarred one brings creates a loud <b>screech</b> underwater which creates bubbles around it and the other two Huntails, an unorthodox way of using that particular attack, but an effective one, as they had cover. The Seel tries to get rid of the bubbles by using the <b>Ice shard </b>attack to pop the bubbles and it partially works, hitting the second Huntail<i>'s tail</i>, leaving a small cut. Normally this would cause no problems, but under deep water the coldness could kill a pokemon. The Huntail had to swim into the shallower water, soon. Departing, the pokemon left you to fight the bigger, and more dangerous one. <br />
<br />
Tortuga looks at the enemy, and as they lock eyes Tortuga waggles his tail like a whip, in a way that would make you proud. Distraught, the Huntail doesn't notice the Seel charging and shooting it with an<b> aurora beam</b>, knocking it back. Tortuga takes its chance and aims its <b>skull</b> at the enemy and<b> bash</b>es, hitting it straight on in the mouth! That proves to be too much as the Huntail's teeth shatter, leaving it to run away.<br />
<br />
The Third Huntail steps up and as you look at it you realise that it is at least twice the size of the other two! This match was gonna be hard, and you knew it.<br />
<br />
What will you do? </span></span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: DeepSkyBlue"><span style="font-size: 9px">Tortuga's Skull Bash was a success and knocked a few teeth out of that Huntail, Seel also managed to spook the other fish off with a few knicks from her shards of ice, but left the group to face off against the Larger of the three hunttail, which was twice as large as normal. The greenish Wartortle retreated back into the comfort area near his trainer, awaiting orders for the round, but faint glow started to emit from Tuga's body, quickly consuming him in a heavenly aura. His form expanded greatly, his shell size had to have doubled in size, and his once coveted tail was a tiny little crayon. Tortuga had evolve, he was a Blastoise. Suddenly the battle didn't look so bleak, but would still be a great challenge.<br />
<br />
The diddler was shocked at the sudden evolving of his pokemon, unexpected to say the least. He turned to Seel, &quot;I think you've done great little buddy, but we can't take it from here.&quot; He gave their companion a thumbs up, then focused his attention back on the giant fish. &quot;Let's blast through that Huntail with a <b>FLASH CANNON</b>! Then <b>TACKLE</b> him into the wall of the cave so you can take a good <b>BITE</b> out of him.&quot;</span></span></div>

<span style="color: darkorange">You send out your pokemon in hopes of defeating the pokemon. &quot;Don't worry about the other corpses, they won't attack you when I'm carrying you, theres just something wrong with the Mantyke. You're pokemon can take care of them right?&quot; Horace says.<br />
<br />
Your pokemon set off and Grinder begins to shake his tail at the opponent, waging his finger in the process, enraging the Mantyke so much that it drops its guard. Great. Both pokemon proceed to hit the opponent with sand. Or try to considering they are on a Kingdra's back and there is no sand anywhere near you. Horace realises your inability to fight on his back, and steers to the left before he swims away quickly &quot;Hang on.&quot; Before you can argue about your ability to fight you realise that tackling is impossible from a distance in water.<br />
<br />
The Mantyke gives chace for a few seconds, but gives up due to the Kingdra's speed. After a few seconds Horace turns to you: &quot;How did you get here anyway?&quot;</span><br />

As the pokemon stare off, the round begins with Impish and Igniter upping their powers, Igniter <b>Harden</b>ing itself and Impish <b>Plot</b>ting<b> Nasty</b> things it will do to the Solrock, images flowing through his head. Next up Impish disappears by dissolving into the ground and hiding in the <b>shadow</b>s.

This makes no difference as it isn't prepared for a<b> sneak </b>attack from Impish, which knocks it into the air. As the Solrock falls back down it can't evade Impish's claws infused with a strange<b> steel power</b> from Impish's<b> secret </b>reserve. This proves too much and the Solrock drops to the ground, most likely fainted.<br />
<br />
Happy, Impish runs to you, ready to move on. &quot;Igniter, you worthless piece of shit! EXPLODE WITH YOUR LAST ENERGY MOTHERFUCKER!!&quot;<br />
<br />
You see Igniter's eyes open and radiate red, causing a loud thud, and your world slows down as your life flashes through your eyes. There is a second, louder noise and you feel the ground tremble below you, and as the flames of the explosion expand you hear a loud shreik as the trainer is engulfed by the flames, having beem very close to the blast source. As the flames reach a foot from you the ground beneath you gives, and you fall down a tunnel. You fall down a semi-natural slide with Impish beside you, and after a few seconds you reach the end, to find a horrific sight: Mike and Sandslash celebrating their win, but a fainted bloody Machoke next to them missing an arm. Uh oh.<br />
<br />
To do list: Find Ranjona, find your pokemon, and escape. All that matters is what you do first, and with Mike here you could squeeze some info out of him.</span></span></span> <span style="font-size: 9px"><br />

</i></span></span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'"><span style="color: DeepSkyBlue">The sudden evolution of your pokemon brings out your confidence in him and you prepare to fight. Giving Tortuga your orders you watch as his badass(yet highly improbable) Cannons appear out of his shell. A silver aura develops around Tortuga's <b>cannon</b>s, the light becoming so bright that you turn your eyes away in pain. On the other hand the Huntail prepares as well, <b>pulse</b>s of <b>water</b> forming into a sphere in front of the Huntail's gaping mouth. The attacks finish charging and launch towards a midpoint and, in the typical cliche fashion, the attacks cancel each other out, causing a very bright <b>flash</b>. The pokemon come out staring at and encircling each other, ready for round two.<br />
<br />
The two pokemon stare at each other before charging, Tortuga using tackle, and Huntail using a take down. The Huntail is faster, and hits Tortuga first. Tortuga, having a lot more muscle now, takes the hit and grabs the Huntail by the neck, hitting him against the wall. Tortuga brings his lesser known, yet formidable teeth onto the enemy, his Bite causing moderate damage. Held back against the wall the Huntail can only do one thing: hit its enemy with an aqua tail. This causes Tortuga to let go, prepared for the next round of the match.<br />
<br />
Overall strength for Tortuga is about 79 percent, while the Huntail's is about 72 percent.<br />

<span style="color: darkorange">You send out your pokemon in hopes of defeating the pokemon. &quot;Don't worry about the other corpses, they won't attack you when I'm carrying you, theres just something wrong with the Mantyke. You're pokemon can take care of them right?&quot; Horace says.<br />
<br />
Your pokemon set off and Grinder begins to shake his tail at the opponent, waging his finger in the process, enraging the Mantyke so much that it drops its guard. Great. Both pokemon proceed to hit the opponent with sand. Or try to considering they are on a Kingdra's back and there is no sand anywhere near you. Horace realises your inability to fight on his back, and steers to the left before he swims away quickly &quot;Hang on.&quot; Before you can argue about your ability to fight you realise that tackling is impossible from a distance in water.<br />
<br />
The Mantyke gives chace for a few seconds, but gives up due to the Kingdra's speed. After a few seconds Horace turns to you: &quot;How did you get here anyway?&quot;</span><br />

Okay, one of the towns caught fire, and the whole region thinks it's me. I left for here, because now they want my head. I've been kicked out of every place I visit, and it's not my fault. Every place...&quot; The girl remembered Mediville. There was one person there she sure wasn't gonna forget. She muttered under her breath. &quot;Harmony...&quot; She realized she was digressing and continued the tale. &quot;Well, I can't stay in the Oniero ruins...&quot; she began tearing up. &quot;Those ingrates threw me out... after I offed a mad Gyarados... those mother[censored]s think I brought in... Oh my God... why am I doing this? ...Anyway, I met Krane, and I really had to help him out. He's stuck in here, too. When we tried to leave, the floor gave out on us, and we were just a door away from here. Krane, I'm sorry I dragged you into this.

I can understand that, stuff happens, don't worry.<span style="color: green"><br />
<br />
“<i>Hey, sweet-cheeks, you’re upsetting my hippie, here,</i>”Rocky, being the attaractive acorn that she was, tried to use her apparent sex appeal to entice the Carnivine to hunt, which the Carnivine took to noticing really easily. “<i>You’re a growing boy, and eating that little starly would be like shooting majikarps in a puddle. Maybe I can teach ya to hunt like a real man.</i>” The Carnivine blushes and turns, before turning back at Rocky, a look of joy in his eyes. Was a female pokemon actually interested in him? He turned back at Rocky, his apparent inexperience with women lead him to this response:<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Uh, huh-huh,uh...&quot; </i>It stuttered <i>&quot;s-s-sure thing, whatever you want... um, beautiful. Whattttever you want.&quot;</i> He then proceeds to wipe the sweat from his brow and face, wait, sweat? He must really have it in for Rocky, or maybe it was his first experience with a female being interested in him? Nevertheless, he looked at Rocky, if she wanted to train him in the ways of hunting, he would listen, and maybe you wouldn't need to hunt a baby Starly tonight.<br />
<br />
You hear rustling in the bushes, and turn to find an angry Staravia mother staring at you from her nest, alongside Rocky and the Carnivine, maybe she'd get her chance to teach him to hunt later, but for the moment, they needed to protect themselves from a Glowing <b>bird</b>. </span><span style="color: green">A very <b>brave</b> looking one.</span></span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: green"><span style="font-size: 9px">Rocky smirked at the thought that she seemed to have the carnivine under complete control, and (having recently evolved into nuzleaf) placed her hand on her hip and looked at the flytrap, her eyebrows raised in a seductive glare. She opened her mouth to speak, but stopped herself when she saw the form of the staravia in the tree above them. She screeched and turned away from the tree, swiftly running past her trainer and ducked into the grass, her nose sticking up into the air.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Rocky, what’re you doing?” the hippie asked before realizing that a rather large adolescent bird was in pursuit of both him and his grassy party. He took a few steps backwards and cowered into the grass with his nuzleaf. “Why does everything in this wood wanna gut me?” he whimpered, covering his face with his dirty hands.<br />
<br />
Rocky clenched her fist and almost seemed to hit Paul, but instead motioned to the carnivine to come over and get some distance from the hostile bird. <br />
<br />
“<i>Oh, no, no, no, cried Chicken Licken,</i>” Rocky said while wagging her finger at her new hunter’s apprentice. “<i>We’re not gonna get that ickle bird up there if we fight with momma. She’ll rip us apart, got it?</i>”<br />
<br />
After another moment of sitting idle in the brush, Rocky conjured up a risky idea that could make or break the situation at hand. She scooted a bit closer to the carnivine and decided to tell him a secret.<br />
<br />
“<i>Let me be honest with you, sweetheart. I don’t know much about hunting. See this leaf on my head? It’s got chloroplasts in it. Makes sugar. As long as it’s sunny out I’m fine.</i>” She touched the end of her nose and winked, then reached out and gently touched one of the carnivine’s snaggleteeth. “<i>You though, you don’t need to hunt either, sweetie. Your pretty teeth will do all the work for ya. Go on, stick your head out of the bush and open wide, see what happens.</i>”</span></span></div>

<br />
&quot;Ekans!&quot; it seems to be logical, as an egg move of it would be able to learn poison tail, and it's fangs didn't develop poison until evolution. <br />
<br />
There is an eerie silence, before you hear the familiar voice stating: &quot;Correct, great job, Krane.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the world around you melts away. Before you know it you are at the top of a canyon, while Krane is at the bottom, all inside of that canyon is a tree, a big tree<a href="https://i317.photobucket.com/albums/mm371/Psychopath2008/Dibujo980.png?t=1244144002" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fi317.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fmm371%2FPsychopath2008%2FDibujo980.png%3Ft%3D1244144002&amp;hash=c06f5ffe092603c187a48cd0357a5cf7" rel="nofollow noopener">....</a><br />
<br />
&quot;For this Challenge, Krane will climb the tree and retrieve the an egg from an Arbok's nest at the top, but the deadly mother is also in that tree.&quot; You see as Krane's face turns pale white.<br />
<br />
&quot;But, with the help of one of her pokemon and heightened elevation , Alina shall guide you, and if nessesary, distract the Arbok, but she must stay where she is.&quot; If you can retrieve the egg, you shall both leave, having beaten my challenge...<br />

<br />
...and wait.<br />
<br />
...and wait.<br />
<br />
Finally, after about three hours something finally sits on the Carnivine's jaws. As you hear a loud snap, sure enough you can add a Lebyda to the night's death toll. Surprised the Carnivine rushes to Rocky and gives her a big hug, knocking the wind right out of her. He realises he does that and lets go, grabbing her hand, opening it, and leaving the promised <b>leaf stone</b> in her palm, alongside a surprise oran berry. He digs away and dissapears, and you look at the reward as the sun begins to rise...<br />

Demonic Skittle</u></b><b>–Bane Forest</b><i>Reply in darkorchid<br />
<br />
</i>After hearing your offering to help her Edna turns to you and smiles, showing you a very beautiful set of pearly whites. &quot;No, thank you. You are still in clinical condition, and I advise you to stay in bed for the next few hours, It is very sweet of you to ask though. Don't worry about being a burden, you can stay here as long as you need. This is a three bedroom house, and I'm the only person who lives here, so I have plenty of food and space.&quot; She smiles and looks at you, were you surprised an old woman was living alone in the world's most dangerous forest? <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I'm not the only one here technically,&quot; as she says that a Zigzagoon walks in the room, and you notice a bandage around it's front right arm. Edna catches you ogling at its leg and continues &quot;oh yes deary, Moofins here is my guard pokemon, and he's the one who lead me to find you, stepping on a Pineco on the way. It was not happy. When I was there you were on the ground mumbling something about Prestige using blizzard. The snake was long gone when I got there, but the puncture wounds made it very clear, your Typhlosion made the trek here with you on his back, and it all went downhill from there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh by the way, I had to wrap the punctures on your leg with a scarf, my <b>scarf </b>of <b>choice</b>. I don't think Its useful for me anymore, but if you are interested in it you can have it, although it needs some cleaning. I suggest you stay another night, it is getting dark outside. That is when you don't risk going outside. I won't stop you if you want to leave however.&quot; She leaves and comes back a few seconds later with some cookies, &quot;I made them in case you wanted anything when you woke up. So, Alina, anything alse you want to eat, perhaps talk to me about your adventures?&quot; She gives you a kindly smile, before petting her Zigzagoon.<br />
</span></span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote>Yeah, I'm sorry for the delay and stuff. I've been pretty stressed and a bit down lately. Not replying to this was kind of eating away at the back of my mind, though...<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Verdana'"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DarkOrchid">Edna merely smiled. &quot;No, thank you. You are still in clinical condition, and I advise you to stay in bed for the next few hours, It is very sweet of you to ask though. Don't worry about being a burden, you can stay here as long as you need. This is a three bedroom house, and I'm the only person who lives here, so I have plenty of food and space.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You sure?&quot; Alina said, still wanting to help in some sort of way. &quot;I have plenty of Pokemon that could probably help with something.&quot; As she said this she pointed towards Iggy, who was trying to look as useless as possible by yawning and laying on the ground all sprawled out. But then a small thought came to Alina... an old woman, living all alone in this forest? God, why? She tried to hide her small suspicion, however, as she didn't want to seem ungrateful for the woman's help. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I'm not the only one here technically,&quot; the woman continued on, a Zigzagoon limping into the room at that very moment. Its front right paw was bandaged up, and Alina couldn't help but wince a bit. Edna quickly glanced at Alina before explaining, &quot;oh yes deary, Moofins here is my guard pokemon, and he's the one who lead me to find you, stepping on a Pineco on the way. It was not happy. When I was there you were on the ground mumbling something about Prestige using blizzard. The snake was long gone when I got there, but the puncture wounds made it very clear, your Typhlosion made the trek here with you on his back, and it all went downhill from there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see. Well, let me try to fix that for you,&quot; smiled Alina, nudging her Typhlosion with her good foot to go over and try to heal the Zigzagoon's paw with a <b>Wish</b>. Iggy grudgingly got to his feet and wandered over to the raccoon-type Pokemon, not looking even remotely friendly to the creature.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh by the way, I had to wrap the punctures on your leg with a scarf, my scarf of choice. I don't think Its useful for me anymore, but if you are interested in it you can have it, although it needs some cleaning,&quot; continued Edna, motioning towards the scarf wrapped around Alina's leg. It shimmered blue and still looked very elegant despite the small spots of blood on it. Edna then stood up. &quot;I suggest you stay another night, it is getting dark outside. That is when you don't risk going outside. I won't stop you if you want to leave, however.&quot; Edna left the room and Ignatius quickly glanced over his shoulder, giving Alina a &quot;I'm not carrying you in the middle of the night&quot; look. Alina tested her leg again, but it was no use, she still couldn't walk on it. Edna was right, she should stay overnight. It would just be one night after all, right..? <br />
<br />
Just as quickly as she left, Edna reappeared with a platter of cookies, handing them to Alina before saying &quot;I made them in case you wanted anything when you woke up. So, Alina, anything else you want to eat, perhaps talk to me about your adventures?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, this more than enough,&quot; said Alina, taking a small cookie. God, she had forgotten all about how hungry she was. Ironically, the cookie reminded her of her own mother, always so health-crazed and anti-sugar. Hardly ever did Alina get the chance to stuff her face with something sugary. Ignatius returned to Alina's feet,stretching before yawning widely and curling up on the floor for a well-deserved sleep. Alina reached for another cookie hungrily before recounting her adventures so far. There was her first adventure in the Mirage Desert, where she didn't find what she was looking for, but rather a good friend. Or, her adventure in Miasma Heights, where she rescued her Flaaffy from a demented old man before a chance meeting with the Johto Elite 4 member Karen. And then there was the capture of a psychotic Gastly just recently, who held captive a family of ghosts in an incredibly old house. Alina was just in the middle of telling that story when she noticed the half moon in the middle of a sky dotted with stars. Drowsiness was catching up to Alina now, and she apologized to Edna for not finishing her story, but she needed her sleep if she was to get an early start in the morning. Curling up in the warm bed, Alina said good night to Edna and quickly fell asleep...<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
Alina woke the next morning after a restless night. She found it incredibly hard to sleep with her new Typhlosion by her side. It wasn't that she felt unsafe it was just the <i>snoring</i>... Good god, he shakes the house. As she rubbed her red eyes she put her foot over Ignatius's nose to close his mouth. After some choking and snorting, the Typhlosion woke with a start, eyes darting everywhere to find the culprit behind the crime of waking him up. Alina giggled slightly and Iggy's eyes darted back to her, giving her a nasty glare. &quot;Don't give me that, you ass,&quot; Alina muttered, yawning widely. &quot;You kept me up all night with your damn snoring.&quot; Ignatius scoffed as Alina tested her leg once again. It still hurt a bit, but it felt much better. She took off the scarf to examine her wound, which was healing at a surprisingly rapid pace. It definitely looked better than it did yesterday. She limped over to a nearby mirror and fixed her hair up, replaced the hat that was sitting on the nightstand to its proper place upon her head, and tried to make herself look as good as possible. Her clothing was becoming pretty tattered and worn, sadly, so it was difficult to make herself look &quot;presentable.&quot; She could walk, thankfully, but she probably couldn't get very far without stopping to rest every once in a while. Nor could she walk very fast. Alina took the last few cookies and nibbled on them as she left the room, trying to find Edna to thank her before Alina took her leave...</span></span></span></div>

<span style="color: DarkOrange">You hear Horace's familiar voice, &quot;I'm sorry, its close, but not right. I can't give you a second chance, but, your friend here can save you both.&quot; It's all up to Krane...<br />
<br />
&quot;Ekans!&quot; it seems to be logical, as an egg move of it would be able to learn poison tail, and it's fangs didn't develop poison until evolution. <br />
<br />
There is an eerie silence, before you hear the familiar voice stating: &quot;Correct, great job, Krane.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the world around you melts away. Before you know it you are at the top of a canyon, while Krane is at the bottom, all inside of that canyon is a tree, a big tree<a href="https://i317.photobucket.com/albums/mm371/Psychopath2008/Dibujo980.png?t=1244144002" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fi317.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fmm371%2FPsychopath2008%2FDibujo980.png%3Ft%3D1244144002&amp;hash=c06f5ffe092603c187a48cd0357a5cf7" rel="nofollow noopener">....</a><br />
<br />
&quot;For this Challenge, Krane will climb the tree and retrieve the an egg from an Arbok's nest at the top, but the deadly mother is also in that tree.&quot; You see as Krane's face turns pale white.<br />
<br />
&quot;But, with the help of one of her pokemon and heightened elevation , Alina shall guide you, and if nessesary, distract the Arbok, but she must stay where she is.&quot; If you can retrieve the egg, you shall both leave, having beaten my challenge...<br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange"><i>Alina... my name is Alina...</i> Alina stood proud to get her name back. One less thing to get off her chest. But she had a lot before her, and now, was not the time to let her courage do the thinking. Who should she pick? The flashy and combative Torchlight? The incredibly distracting Grinder? Volante, who could fly, and thereby actually strike the dang thing? But then she gave it some thought. Yes, Volante was perfectly capable of striking a large and potentially dangerous opponent, but that meant that a large and potentially dangerous opponent was perfectly capable of striking Volante. And none of the others could strike it from that far. So, she stuck with the court jester. She threw a Poké Ball to the ground, summoning her Aipom. &quot;Hey, Grinder, I need you to distract that Arbok for a bit. Hey, Krane!&quot; she shouted to Krane, at the bottom of the canyon. &quot;Thanks for saving me back there! I'll try focusing the Arbok on us!&quot; She then spoke softly to Grinder. &quot;Use Tail Whip twice, then Sand-Attack.&quot; She then gave a loud whistle. &quot;OVER HERE, UGLY!!!&quot; she shouted, trying to turn Arbok's head.</span></span></div>

<span style="color: Green">Rocky, being the plant that she is, explains to the Carnivine that he has to use his bodily functions to his advantage. He responds, with a quick, confused &quot;<i>Ok... I'll try</i>.&quot; he walks off and hides his body in a bush, while you and Rocky hide in a different area. Keeping your eyes on his gaping mouth of the grass type you wait.<br />
<br />
...and wait.<br />
<br />
...and wait.<br />
<br />
Finally, after about three hours something finally sits on the Carnivine's jaws. As you hear a loud snap, sure enough you can add a Lebyda to the night's death toll. Surprised the Carnivine rushes to Rocky and gives her a big hug, knocking the wind right out of her. He realises he does that and lets go, grabbing her hand, opening it, and leaving the promised <b>leaf stone</b> in her palm, alongside a surprise oran berry. He digs away and dissapears, and you look at the reward as the sun begins to rise...<br />
<br />
</span>OOC: Upon replying to this update you can leave Cascadia, your <b>Leaf Stone </b>and <b>oran berry</b> in hand.</span><span style="font-size: 9px"><br />

</blockquote><span style="color: green"><span style="font-size: 9px">The wait concerning the carnivine’s newfound hunting ability was long, and Paul had passed out beside his nuzleaf, who was blankly staring in front of her and waiting for something to happen. When the carnivine returned looking rather satisfied and somewhat bloated, Rocky managed to smile and nudge her trainer out of his light slumber. Paul groggily looked up and saw the carnivine before flopping back to the ground and grunting in disappointment.<br />
<br />
When the carnivine approached Rocky she held out her hand to get her prize, but was hugged first off much to her disgust. When the leaf stone hit her hand, however, her leaf seemed to shine with glee and the new dawn sunlight. She quickly dropped it, not wanting its effects to take place at this point in time, and raised her eyebrow when she saw the little blue oran berry roll onto the ground next to it. She picked it up and then took some blades of grass and used them to guard her hand when she picked up the leaf stone. <br />
<br />
Paul grunted when Rocky hit him in the head with it, and then squinted when the sunlight hit his eyes. He picked the stone and gave it a look over before putting it into his rucksack. He did the same with the oran berry when Rocky insisted on shoving that in his face, too. Slowly he got up, and realizing that the carnivine was gone, he decided that the best thing to do now was to leave this place. His head hurt, and he was sick of this forest and its pretty leaves and its hostile wildlife. Frankly he had wished that he had never washed up on this island at all. <br />
<br />
He took his nuzleaf by the hand and wandered throughout the forest until he found the beach, and wandered some more until he could find the ferry that would take him home.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"><br />

Thanks for the adventure and goodies, man.<br />

</i></span></span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DarkOrchid">You walk around the house to look for Edna, then walk outside her house when you can't find her inside, surprised to see her tending to a small garden in the morning. &quot;Oh, yes, it seems like you have done fine, that leg of yours seems well, although I would recomend you watch out where you are walking.&quot; You notice Moofins digging holes a few feet from you and before you can ask Edna speaks up:<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Moofins is digging holes for me to plant some more berries, you see, I've lived here since my days as a pokemon ranger almost 50 years ago. Back then we didn't have all of that special gear those young wimpersnappers have, oh no, we had to tame them the old fashion way, with berries and friendship. That's why we always plant things every two days, it keeps us busy, and with the berries we grow we can keep dangerous pokemon at bay without hurting them. It's also our only food source...&quot;<br />
<br />
She notices that you are preparing to leave and speaks again: &quot;Are you sure you want to leave, your leg is ok, but if you are attacked by a pokemon you won't be able to run. Maybe you want to come to our main garden where we plant our main berry trees? Well be able to make a herbal essence you can use to get out of the island while keeping the poison types away.&quot;</span></span><br />

You release Grinder, who jumps into the tree so that he is barely a few feet out of the Arbok's strike range. Krane begins his climb, made slightly harder by the fact that his leg is twisted. He keeps it up, and turns away so that he can get better footing and avoid being seen by the Arbok. He keeps climbing as fast as he can, him and Grinder being in more danger as every second ticked. <br />
<br />
The Arbok lunges at Grinder, its teeth barely missing and the bite being missed giving Grinder some relief. He waggles his<b> tail</b> at the Arbok like a whip, lowering its defence and distracting it. The Arbok lunges again, this time on a straight path towards Grinder. He reacts fast enough and uses his <b>tail</b> to<b> whip</b> the enemy away, keeping the fangs of his enemy a few inches off his face. <br />
<br />
The Arbok backs off, proceeding to<b> leer</b> at Grinder who prepares to throw<b> sand</b>... but there is no sand, so it it <b>attack</b>s with whats available: a branch! The Arbok takes the hit to the face, her rage aimed at Grinder now.<br />
<br />
You look sideways and see that Krane is about halfway up, what shall you do?<br />
