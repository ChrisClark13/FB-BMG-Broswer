<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> <i>((5 of 6 Pokemon declared: Snubbull, Litwick, Meowth, Audino, Growlithe))</i><br />
<br />
Time has come to step up your game. Red Skull, the whip-wielding, crimson leather-dressing woman who serves as Layard’s torturer, isn’t going to stop hurting Meowth any time soon; it falls on you to switch up roles to keep your friend safe from the opponent he can’t hope to defeat. Instead, someone else will have to do it for you: Ashley, a very special Audino.<br />
<br />
Red Skull grins upon watching you switch battlers. And her grin only widens once you demonstrate the skill that sets you apart from so many other Trainers: Mega Evolution!<br />
<br />
If Pinsir looks in any way intimidated, the blood-soaked insect doesn’t show it. It snaps its red stained pincers together in challenge, while Meow welcomes the sudden break and joins Snub in her search for the guard’s sister’s Pokemon. At least that way he isn’t being pummelled mercilessly, and he can still contribute!<br />
<br />
- Cute trick for a brat like yourself. But maybe it’s not such a great idea to give dangerous toys to small children… are you sure you know what you’re doing? Careful not to hurt yourself dear!<br />
<br />
As if moving in retaliation towards Red Skull’s taunting, Ashley lets out a soundwave that staggers Pinsir, and quickly follows up with a powerful Flamethrower that engulfs the insect! Before the Bug-Type can do anything to counter or fight back, the Mega Audino summons several boulder-shaped orbs of energy and hurls them at Pinsir, each of them connecting with frightening force! Red Skull’s partner falls over on its back, but the torturer doesn’t seem all that concerned. In fact, that nauseating grin is still there are she reaches for her cellphone…<br />
<br />
- Yes, it’s me boss. She can use it. Yeah, saw it with my own eyes. Seems you’re in luck. I know what I have to do, don’t worry.<br />
<br />
While Red Skull wraps up her phone call, Meow and Snub suddenly start calling incessantly, looking to grab your attention. You turn to face them and find the Snubbull and Meowth pointing frantically to one of the pods… they found it! The creature inside is a strange one, a Pokemon you take a while to recognise given its rarity – but you’ve definitely seen more of its kind on television several times. A mall quadruped with golden fur… Legendary Coordinators like the foreigners Elle and Serena are known to use similar partners. Yes, that’s definitely a

, the Pokemon that guard asked you to find for his sister!<br />
<br />
- Took you long enough! Too long, to be honest. Pinsir, get a move on!!<br />
<br />
The man-sized insect rises to its feet with visible effort, struggling for breath. Then, channeling its remaining force, it forms a <b>Focus Blast</b> orb in its hands and throws it! But it passes several inches away from Ashley… it missed! Or… did it?<br />
<br />
The sphere travels across the laboratory all the way to where Meow and Snub are standing! Both Pokemon jump away on time, but the Focus Blast hits Fennekin’s pod, shattering the glass and releasing the unconscious Pokemon within, which tumbles to the floor… Just then, Red Skull reaches for her whip and uses it to wrap the small fox, then pull it toward her!<br />
<br />
- This one’s coming with me. Pinsir, return!<br />
<br />
The woman recalls her exhausted partner and runs towards the elevator, just as power seems to come back on! Someone had this entire operation perfectly coordinated! Red Skull passes through the elevator door and blows you a kiss…<br />
<br />
- This little creature here, the one you were looking for, we’ll take great care of it where I’m going… but no, we’re not re-rooting energy back to any of those pods. So go ahead, break as many of them as you want, the Pokemon inside are as good as dead by now. They all drowned. Bye lovely! Tell your guard friend I send him a handshake, will you?<br />
<br />
She vanishes as the door closes. Where did she go now?! And where does it all leave you? You’re faced with a choice… do you rush after her, if you can guess where she went? Will you stay on the lab longer, even after Red Skull’s horrifying revelation? Will you head back to the prison floor?<br />
<br />
So, Liza… where to?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: silver">Liza's Pokémon were the first to rush towards the elevator doors that Red Skull had just run through &quot;Nooo! Stop!&quot; before halting their progress when they all heard their trainer screaming for them to stop.<br />
<br />
They all stopped in their tracks and turned around to find Liza standing there with her fists tightened in a ball, &quot;We don't even know where she is going! If we follow her now, we'd only be running into a trap. What we need to focus on is trying to save the other Pokémon trapped in their pods.&quot;<br />
<br />
Liza had no clue if what Red Skull was telling her was the truth, but she couldn't take that chance. The trainer was only human and she had spent a great amount of time training to be a nurse, she had done her internship in a local Pokémon Center in Cerulean, she had assisted with caring for many hurt and injuried Pokémon; the look on these Pokémon's faces- the look that they may never wake up again, was killing her inside. <br />
<br />
Liza quickly ordered her team to break the glass from each and every pod that contained a Pokémon within, &quot;Try to avoid any harm to the ones inside- Snub use <b>Rock Smash</b>, Meow use <b>Iron Tail</b> and Ashley use <b>Hidden Power</b>! To smash everyone free! Once we've set them free, we'll check for their vitals! Snub, I want you to use the strongest <b>Heal Bell</b> you can muster!&quot;<br />
<br />
Whatever happened after, Liza had to think of what it was she wanted to do next, she couldn't rest and she couldn't waste any time. She could try and save Sam from the clutches of the Vice President, but she was almost positive that the outcome of rushing in without a clear plan in place would only lead to a messy situation as the one she was already facing.<br />
<br />
She also had the option of going back to the prison floor where the guard that had helped her was, but there was no way of knowing if he was conscious enough to aid her or even if he would, after what Red Skull had done to him. For all Liza knew, he might've blamed her for the way the Pinsir had chopped his hand off.<br />
<br />
Where was Dana and Oscar in all of this? And where exactly was Red Skull planning to take Fennekin? And why just that specific Pokémon over all the others here? Unless it was so that Liza would have a reason to go chasing after her...<br />
<br />
It bothered the trainer not to have Sam by her side...but her loyal dragon would have to wait until their faithful reunion. Liza needed to correct a mistake she had made from before, it was decided then, Liza needed to go back to the prison level, she needed to get more info if she had any hope in saving anyone.<br />

<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u> Electric Blue Eye</u>:</b> Johan listens to your doubts in silence, a heavy expression on his face. He seems to be giving this as much thought as you, and for good reason: a Gym Leader was attacked backstage, jeopardizing the whole Tournament, for reasons unknown. Johan theorizes the culprit’s target might be Gottfried himself, making Trevor the means to an end. And with that in mind, you ask him what you consider to be the most relevant questions pertaining to the case.<br />
<br />
- Every Gym Leader and the Champion have access to the challenger registry. We can access all the information that is recorded during the sign-up process, which is to say, we know all the details you provided when you registered to run the gauntlet. That doesn’t mean we actively look up any of that information – speaking for myself and Gottfried at least – but every Leader invited to take part in this tournament would be free to look at the registry, though challengers cannot access that kind of data about one another. I suppose it would be easy to research other information about any contestant starting from the registry – you don’t have to own a Porygon these days to dig up data online. If you’ve gained any notoriety in your travels, odds are it’s been recorded somewhere digitally…<br />
<br />
- Concerning lingering issues between Leaders, I can’t think of anything relevant. Most people are put off by Luther’s aura, Pietro takes his business activities very seriously, Trevor was a pacifist at heart and extremely laid-back, to a fault perhaps… but these are all character quirks that are easily left aside when it’s time to do battle. Everyone respects Gottfried too, I can’t think of anyone who’d want to harm him without standing to gain something more from the attempt… Gottfried brought notoriety to an entire region, and even those who aren’t fond of his personality respect his accomplishments. Whatever this is all about, it can’t be purely a personal grudge... I think we should look at it in terms of what would the culprit stand to gain by targeting the Champion <i>behind</i> the scenes. And what role Trevor’s Plate plays in all this…<br />
<br />
- As for Kayl… yes, I know he’s here. He’s an old acquaintance, a former friend, but he made some unfortunate decisions in the past and we went our separate ways. He entered this tournament to find redemption, but he doesn’t care enough about anything to have orchestrated this whole thing. That much I’m certain of, none of this is his doing… Think with me – whoever did this knows who you are, hence the threats, and there’s very little chance any of the other challengers has that much knowledge about you. I think the culprit is someone on the inside – one of us. Nobody had a real issue with Trevor either, yet he was targeted and his Plate was sent to you. And I have reasons to believe his isn’t he only Arceus Plate you received since arriving here, is it?<br />
<br />
Johan doesn’t wait for an answer; he doesn’t need to.<br />
<br />
- Sean told me he felt something was off about this Tournament too. His Plate… he didn’t come clean about it, but he gave it to you, didn’t he? I could see it in his eyes – he trusts you implicitly. At first I was scared he fell into your plot to gather every Plate, but now I realize you’re as much a victim as anyone else – worse than that, someone’s trying to make you a scapegoat. Let me give you a piece of advice: go out there and face Luther like Gottfried requested. My mentor wants the show to go on, for the audience’s sake. And I don’t completely trust Luther either… maybe you’ll find out more about him during the battle. Meanwhile, I’ll dig around backstage, maybe get a word in with Trevor once he recovers… we have to work together if we want to get to the bottom of this. For your sake, and Gottfried’s.<br />
<br />
Johan bows respectfully and takes his leave. You look at the clock – it’s almost time. Luther, Trevor’s replacement for the second match, is probably waiting for you in the Arena… Maybe Johan’s right – maybe by confronting him in battle, you will find out more about him and his intentions, if any, regarding the Plates.<br />
<br />
You make your way back to the Arena, the path now familiar but nevertheless unnerving. To think you should be making your way over to fight Trevor, but the man was assaulted and the Tournament continued regardless… was this all part of Luther’s plan to get to you sooner?<br />
<br />
The noise of the crowd becomes progressively louder as you leave the residential area behind and enter the Arena from the competitors’ gate. A staff member welcomes you, checks your PokeBall line-up and wishes you luck. The heavy doors open to each side and you walk outside into the afternoon sun, setting foot on the dusty surface of the battleground once more, to the fans’ delight.<br />
<br />
- You show up after all. Brave of you indeed, young Trainer.<br />
<br />
Across the field is Luther, the Gym Leader that watched your match against Sean from the stands this morning, and who argued with Pietro following news of Trevor’s attack. He was chosen by Gottfried himself to replace the Grass Leader so that the Competition could continue, and if he is in any way troubled by the turn of events, his expression reveals none of that concern. His skin is pale white, his hair kept long and mostly pitch black with some contrasting white braids. He dressed in a long dark-gray tunic adorned with silver embroidery, and stares at you from his Trainer Pod with the faint outline of a smile on his face.<br />
<br />
- You honor Gottfried’s will by continuing to fight. Or perhaps you simply wish to draw attention away from other lingering concerns? Pietro refuses to trust you, while Sean refuses to doubt you. An interesting dichotomy – I long to see which of them is right.<br />
<br />
The Arena floor rumbles and the dust surface disappears into the ground below, while a new platform rises for the upcoming match – a field of white flowers…<br />
<br />
Luther picks a Pokeball from the confines of his tunic and tosses it in the air. A large red Pokemon takes its place on the battlefield, snapping its pincers – a vicious-looking

<br />
<span style="color: silver">With not much time before his next match in the tournament started, Ethan was left with more questions then answers after having a conversation with the future Champion, Johan.<br />
<br />
<i>It's to be expected,</i> Ethan thought, <i>there is little to nothing to go on currently on the culprit, his actions or what they aimed to gain for the growing terror.</i> All they could do was wait until the criminal made their next move or if/when Trevor were to regain consciousness to fill everyone in on what he experienced. The waiting game...something Ethan was never good at.<br />
<br />
There was still one good thing that came out of his confrontation with Gottifried's pupil, that there seemed to be a small group of very well respected people that believed Ethan wasn't involved in anything sinister, was a big relief! Even as a retired thief, Ethan had never resulted to violence to get what he wanted. There was just no art in causing harm to another person. Especially when there were so many other, creative ways in getting better results.<br />
<br />
There was still something that was bothering Ethan from earlier, at the end of his match with Sean, a singular thought that kept on repeating itself in his head would not stop pestering him: 'Why was Pietro so sure it was me that attacked Trevor?' <br />
<br />
The Gym Leader was the only one that shouted, from the gallows, accusing Ethan of any wrong doing. It seemed so out of place, now that he could recall what happened in the stadium.<br />
<br />
<i>Even when there was definitive proof, staring the Gym Leader in his face, showing that I couldn't have been in two places at the same time. The way the accusation went down, felt like Pietro knew more about me then he was letting on.</i><br />
<br />
Why would he assume that in the first place? The only possibility was if Pietro had found something linking Ethan to his nefarious past. <i>If that were the case, why did he bite his tongue? -sigh- I thought that time was over...and now, even after coming so far to turn my life around, my past is rearing its ugly head once again...</i> Ethan stopped by his own personal healing pod in the locker room, neglecting to heal his Pokémon before the match started would only spell trouble. So, he sat down by a bench for a few brief seconds, as the machine did it's thing...to recollect himself.<br />
<br />
Ethan had to shake off all of his concerns, because as soon as he stepped through the doorway, he was back onto the battle field. Any thoughts outside of this battle would only conflict with his mind and heart, which would prevent any well thought out strategies from taking place.<br />
<br />
As the trainer made his way out of the locker room, outside and up to the platform, the cheers of the crowd felt less intimidating and more welcoming. The expectations the crowd had of him were less threatening and more engaging, ultimately in his first match Ethan had gathered support, with some quick thinking and fun orders to test the limits of his skills. Now, it was the higher ups that he needed to impress more then anyone else. Show them, why he was such a threat in the tournament. Why, even Gottfried seemed to have faith in the young lad at this point! And Ethan wasn't about to disappoint!<br />
<br />
&quot;Luther,&quot; the young trainer addressed his new opponent, &quot;In my life I've learned countless life lessons. One of them is that life is never as black and white as everyone thinks it to be. For example, what I consider morally right or wrong is different from your definition. I've decided that, that what people think of me won't effect how I decide to carry myself forward. In the end, all you can depend on is yourself and your Pokémon...because without their strength or resolve, I wouldn't be here battling you today...and so, I'll treat you and your Pokémon with the same respect that I did Sean and his...by bringing them down and reigning supreme!&quot;<br />
<br />
Watching Luther draw out his first companion, the young trainer's eyes widen, &quot;I guess I know what Type of Pokémon you like to surround yourself with, what more surprises are the Gym Leaders of Fizzytopia going to show me? Haha.&quot;<br />
<br />
After observing the field and taking his opponent's first Pokémon into account, Ethan formulated a plan that would bring the ominous Luther to his knees! The trainer knew who he had to choose almost instantly and what Pokémon would be participating on this battle; <i>There's no other choice- with the choice of field meant for a Grass specialist like Trevor and our first obstacle being another Water Type....there's only one Pokémon that I can depend on to make a big enough splash on this match that he did in the last battle.</i><br />
<br />
Ethan grabbed a familiar Premierball from around his belt, unclipped the sphere and tossed it into the air- the ball spun before opening and with a shower of white light a Pokémon that had become quite a stable in the trainer's Pokémon journey shot forth, &quot;Snivy!&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>We've learned from the last battle that just because it looks like a clear advantage on our part, that doesn't mean a Gym Leader isn't prepared for the obvious threats...</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Let's give them something to be concerned about! Chris!&quot; The trainer spoke confidently as his Grass Starter began zigzagging towards his opponent, &quot;Begin with a <b>Double Team</b> before using <b>Magical Leaf</b>, end the round with <b>Leaf Tornado</b>!&quot;</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Raves</u>:</b> Disturbing such a massive creature feels wrong on several levels, chief among them your desire for prolonged survival. Even among those of its kind, this Beartic is especially large, and who knows where it even got that King’s Rock, or those strange flames to light up the room? Nothing about this feels like a good omen.<br />
<br />
Still, curiosity is part of the human nature. You hand Nothung an unlit torch, asking the ape to try and set it ablaze on one of the chandeliers. Your partner gives you a look, as if inquiring why the hell he couldn’t simply use his <i>own</i> fire to light up the damn thing – he has literal flames for hair, for Arceus’s sake. Still, he knows better than to question your ideas, having been together so long, and promptly obeys without complaining (out loud, at least). The Infernape approaches one of the ice chandeliers hanging from the cave’s ceiling, leaps and swipes the torch above one of the purple blazes. Immediately the stick catches fire, producing a beautiful violet flame…<br />
<br />
Suddenly, all the chandeliers’ flames light up, burning intensely as if something triggered after Nothung’s meddling. The blazes danced vividly, filling the clearing with a very bright, eerie purple light; the fires then began to <i>float</i> and spin around in a circle in mid-air, six violet fireballs in total, and from the nothingness of the chilly air an equal number of ghostly creatures materialized, each grabbing a flame – six

moaning loudly, their wailing echoing around the cave.<br />
<br />
The blood-curdling spectacle of light and sound is more than enough to awaken the slumbering beast, as the Beartic comes to its senses and unleashes a mighty roar! The Ice-Type rises to its feet, King’s Rock firmly perched atop its head, and the six Froslass bow, each still holding its respective <b>Will-o-Wisp</b>. As the titan stands up, you finally catch a good glimpse of what it was guarding while it slept – a large cradle sculpted out of ice… an empty cradle, no infant inside.<br />
<br />
Quick to follow your command, Nothung fights back his own fear and musters a poorly-convincing Yawn, the Infernape himself far from sleepy and, as such, unable to play the part properly. Recognizing the gesture as an attack towards their king, the six Froslass turn to Nothung, each materializing pointy <b>Ice Shards</b> dangerously close to the Fire-Type’s neck! One simple motion from the ghostly court and Nothung can find himself impaled on the icy lances… Beartic, meanwhile, has rage-filled eyes locked firmly on <i>you</i>, not Nothung, and although he isn’t oblivious to the Infernape’s weak attempt at putting him back to sleep, it’ll be a while before he’s afflicted by any sort of drowsiness… you can’t help but notice there’s way too much anger towards you in the beast’s eyes for a Pokemon you literally <i>just</i> met.<br />
<br />
The situation’s turned very complicated all of a sudden… What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: lightblue"><span style="font-size: 10px">With another shiver, Alex handed the torch to the Infernape, who gave him a quizzical look before pointing a finger at his fiery crown then the torch, before shrugging. Even in the bitter chill, his starter still found some way to make a jab at his trainer's quirks, and heads for one of the chandeliers, all the while Alex's eyes stared at the violet flames, wondering how they remained in the air, floating above the ice yet never melting-<br />
<br />
<i>Oh gods, of course! Those aren't flames, they're-</i><br />
<br />
A leap and a swing, and the torch takes on the same violet hue, before the fires flared up and began to drift around the chamber, and then from the chill of the air, a sextet of snowy spirits materialized, all the keys clicking together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Those are w-w-will o' wisps...&quot; he whispered, before a much greater concern rose, as the Froslass began to wail loudly, and from there Alex knew all Hel had broke loose. An enormous, frigid roar let him know his plan of being sneaky had gone very wrong, and as he turned to face the now awake Beartic, he spotted what seemed to be a cradle of ice. An empty cradle of ice. That, combined with the look it was giving him...<br />
<br />
With the giant before him, Nothung's orders still in his head, attempts to try and <b>yawn</b>, but given the Beartic's fearsome appearance and size, his attempt fell on deaf ears. With a sudden motion, Alex turned back to his starter to find the Froslass had formed numerous lances of ice, primed towards the Infernape, who looked set to kick off, before returning to the glare of the bear, and what anger those eyes had, given he had never met him. This wasn't anger at being awoken rudely, no, there was something else going on...<br />
<br />
And then the thought struck him.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-Nothung, stand d-d-down!&quot; he called to the Infernape, who was meeting the Froslass' cold stares with a <b>leer</b> of his own, trying to cow them into pulling those spears back. &quot;Lemme t-t-try and calm him down f-f-first...&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning back to the enraged Beartic, Alex took a second to collect himself, thoughts running through his mind, before taking a tentative step forward, towards the Beartic, arms away from his pockets and open-palmed to show he was hiding nothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, we c-c-came from up on the surf-f-face,&quot; he started to gesture to the ceiling, trying to explain things with motion in case language was difficult. &quot;There was a snowst-t-torm, we went into a crevice, and f-f-found a split path,&quot; with a motion of going down, then opening his arms wide to demonstrate the options. &quot;One was w-w-windy, the other not, and w-w-we followed the p-p-path here, where you were sleeping...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not sure what those flames w-w-were, I asked my partner to l-l-light a torch with one,&quot; pointing at the still burning torch Nothung held, still in a defensive posture, &quot;and then this h-h-happened...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're the first thing we've seen h-h-here,&quot; clenching one hand to show one finger, &quot;and we came alone. No other p-p-people with us...so we have no idea what th-th-that there is about,&quot; pointing at the cradle while shaking his head. &quot;All w-w-we know of this is that you were sleeping, and w-w-we woke you up. S-s-sorry about that...but if-f-f we could help you in some w-w-way, maybe find where your cub went to...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We've been places, got a p-p-pretty strong group, can help you out...N-n-not after treasure, nope. Left th-th-that life behind, was just curious on the island, why it's so c-c-cold...&quot; shivering, though this time not of a gesture but genune chill.<br />
<br />
Looking into the Beartic's eyes, he waited for the response, while the Infernape stood his ground, prepared to <b>protect</b> himself if needed.</span></span></div>

<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u> Electric Blue Eye</u>:</b> The crowd cheers at the sight of your first choice, a Pokemon that already impressed everyone on the stands in his first battle earlier in the morning: your Snivy! The choice seems logical – this is a grassy arena, and you’re fighting a Water-Type Pokemon. Even if you can never be too cautious against Gym Leaders, there’s no denying Chris is the best choice all things considered! So why is Luther smiling?...<br />
<br />
Chris starts things off by running around so fast, he creates multiple shadow clones of himself. Unfazed, Crawdaunt snaps its pincers together, awaiting instructions that come soon afterwards.<br />
<br />
- Very well, we can match your speed. Use <b>Agility</b> to keep up!<br />
<br />
Something about Luther’s tactic sounds off, but in the heat of battle it’s hard to pinpoint exactly what troubles you. The crawdad loosens its muscles and immediately its movements become quicker and less restrained by its cumbersome shell. And when your partner shoots off a dozen multicolored leaves that home in on the Water-Type, that unexpected speed boost comes in particularly handy!<br />
<br />
- Wait… wait… Now, <b>Dig</b>!<br />
<br />
Crawdaunt immediately digs a whole in the soft, grassy field and vanishes from sight at the last second, while the Magical Leaves stab the ground like a storm of arrows. Luther’s partner then re-emerges behind the several Snivy clones, and the black-and-white haired man does something truly unexpected…<br />
<br />
- Now, dispose of all those copies with a <b>Flamethrower</b>!!<br />
<br />
You can hardly believe your eyes: Crawdaunt opens one of its pincers and lets loose a jet of flames, spraying the field with blazes that engulf each Double Team clone one by one, erasing them all until they hit the real Snivy for frightening damage! Chris rolls around in the grass reeling in pain, its skin charred but fortunately not Burned. He looks at you in sheer confusion, only to find you equally dazed, and in his frustration retaliates with a storm of rotating leaves that strikes the opponent successfully!!<br />
<br />
Crawdaunt is pushed back by the move, but is clearly less hurt than you would expect. After all, it should have been a seriously damaging hit when you consider the Types involved… until…<br />
<br />
You feel your eyes stinging and burning all of a sudden. Instinctively you wipe them clean, and in that moment it’s as if a veil is lifted… When you look over to the battlefield again, there is no longer any Crawdaunt facing Chris. Instead, a new creature stands before him, grinning devilishly… a sight that explains everything that’s happened thus far. Luther has been playing you all along, right from the moment where you sent a partner to counter his first choice – because your foe was never a Crawdaunt to begin with, but a

</div>
!<br />
<br />
- Well, the truth is out. Let this be a lesson to you, Ethan: in life, just like in battle, not everything is what it seems. Yes, I wield the Dark-Type. But are you sure I’m the enemy?<br />
<br />
Zoroark growls, ready to strike back. Luther, in turn, is happy to comply.<br />
<br />
- <b>Hone</b> your <b>Claws</b>, then <b>Aerial Ace</b> so he can’t dodge!<br />
<br />
What will you do now?!</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> <i>((Oops, so he is. Please don’t let him bite me! <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite7" alt=":p" title="Stick Out Tongue    :p" data-shortname=":p" />))</i><br />
<br />
It’s clear as day at this point: you’re a one-woman army waging war with the local Government. And in every war, there is loss… Meow, Snub and Ashley concentrate their efforts on shattering the pods to release the Pokemon inside. But as their bodies tumble out of their stasis chambers and onto the floor, it soon becomes apparent that no Heal Bell can fix what happened to them: they aren’t suffering from any special condition… they just drowned.<br />
<br />
The sight makes your stomach turn: all these Pokemon, taken from their Coordinators, trapped inside glass cages like zoo animals, kept alive on a whim and now killed on a whim as well… Or was Layard only keeping them stable long enough for you to walk in and see them die? What if his plan all along was to preserve only that Fennekin? It scares you to think such a man even exists, one who toys with as many lives as it takes only to get inside an enemy’s head. These Pokemon, are they just collateral damage in Layard’s mission to destroy you and Dana?<br />
<br />
Speaking of Dana, you can’t help but wonder how she’s doing, if she’s still safe. The Vice President seems to have tentacles reaching everywhere in the city; it’d be easier than ever to root out the former Master Coordinator now that you’re making so many waves. Could you forgive yourself if the elderly couple was captured? Arceus forbid, if they were subjected to Red Skull’s torture?<br />
<br />
Your thoughts kept racing from one problem to another, and thinking about the cruelty of that woman in red immediately reminds you of the guard she mutilated… The one friend you’ve found since clashing with Layard. You were sceptical of him at first, but now that the truth is evident, you feel the need to correct that mistake – rushing in to face Layard with a hot head is a bad idea, and you want to check up on the prison guard; after all, everything that happened to him is partly your fault too!<br />
<br />
Trying your absolute hardest to push the image of all those Pokemon to the back of your head, you rush to the elevator and head back down. The power is still on, as if Layard and Red Skull are taunting you to follow them, but you return to the prison level instead, hoping the detour doesn’t bring any more harm to either Fennekin or Dana’s Arcanine, whom you are yet to meet…<br />
<br />
The elevator’s doors slid open after a while of descending, and you step back out into the familiar hallway lined by cells on both sides. The first door to your left is where you retrieved your Bag and found the Choice Scarf, while the first to your right… was your cell. Remembering how you trapped the friendly guard inside after tricking him, you instinctively run towards the metal door, which you find open… you take a deep breath and peer inside.<br />
<br />
- L…Liza? Liza dear, you’re alright!<br />
<br />
The familiar voice catches you completely off-guard, and it takes you a while to soak it in. Standing over someone lying on the ground… are Dana and Oscar!! What are they doing here?!<br />
<br />
- Oh dear, I’m so glad you’re alright!<br />
<br />
Oscar is visibly emotional as he walks over and gives you a hug. Dana, in her usually apathetic fashion, merely motions for you to approach her as she looks down towards the man on the ground… it’s the guard.<br />
<br />
- He kept calling out to you. I… I don’t think he will…<br />
<br />
The guard raises his arm once he sees you approaching – an arm with no hand, still bleeding. His voice is weak and his sentences cut abruptly by sudden bursts of pain, but he gets his message across…<br />
<br />
- Liza… How is Fennekin? I… I lied to you… I’m s-sorry. I d-don’t have… a sister. Fennekin was… my P-Pokemon. My p-price of admission into L-Layard’s Security. If I so m-much as hinted at… being concerned for h-her… they’d fire me… Heh, l-look how that turned out…<br />
<br />
Oscar places a hand on your shoulder, trying his best to be a reassuring presence, but everyone in the cell knows the man’s fate. He’s pale, sweating and can barely string together full sentences as he keeps talking. And judging by his torn, blood-stained uniform, his hand wasn’t the only body part targeted by Red Skull’s Pinsir…<br />
<br />
- T-tell me she’s… safe. If… if you can… t-tell her I’m sorry. Sorry for e-everything… Just like I’m s…sorry I… deceived you. I c-couldn’t b…b…bear the shame of admitting… that I actually a…abandoned Fen…<br />
<br />
He doesn’t manage to finish the last sentence as he breathes out a long sigh and goes limp. For such a young man to pass away from physical injuries… What kind of aggression did Red Skull put him through during her brief torture session?! Why is there so much death around you, all because of something as harmless as Pokemon Contests?!<br />
<br />
Oscar can’t hold back his tears, whereas the much colder Dana, whose pain she handles in a very different manner, merely closes her eyes and whispers a short prayer for the man’s soul. You can tell she blames herself for all of this, not to mention she’s still coping with the loss of her Arcanine… it’s no wonder she always looks like she carries the weight of the world on her shoulders. When she speaks, her voice is faint and barely audible, as if she too is fighting back tears of her own.<br />
<br />
- We received a letter… telling us to come here, that we should be able to enter and to meet you on this floor. It was signed by you, so we came. Strangely, we found no resistance on the way here… but judging by your expression, it wasn’t you who sent that letter.<br />
<br />
Oscar helps his wife to her feet and continues in Dana’s stead.<br />
<br />
- Maybe we were tricked… Maybe Layard wanted us all here so he could get rid of us all at once. But if so, why didn’t he attack us in our home? Clearly he found out our address, else we never would have received the letter in the first place! None of this makes sense…<br />
<br />
Dana looks at you with an expression even more serious than usual. Her voice shifts from shallow to dry and determined.<br />
<br />
- Too many have suffered because of me, because of us, because of Contests. We end this today.<br />
<br />
Oscar tries to smile, encouraged by his wife’s sudden fire.<br />
<br />
- That scoundrel Layard… he wants Contests erased from history so there are no distractions from the ultimate profit that are Battles. As long as there are no insurgents, no fragments of memory to remind the populace that there was once an alternative, then Layard wins. That’s why he needs Dana, you and all those Coordinators’ Pokemon gone. But we’re here, inside the dragon’s den. We can strike back! Liza, please… you’re our only hope. What do we do now?</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</u></b> Forward is the way to go, you reason – no point in checking out whatever room it was that the Electrode came out of, seeing as it was most likely already drained of power and, therefore, usefulness. You reason they are headed somewhere you want to follow if you want some answers, and that means Rowena’s services are once again required!<br />
<br />
The Nidoqueen roars as she tackles the huge pile of rubble. One by one, she removes boulders, broken pipes, wires and all other manner of debris, putting her muscles to good use… and after a while, she successfully disposes of the make-shift barricade put up by the sacrificing Electrode! However, the endeavour was taxing on the Poison-Type, as she’s visibly struggling to catch her breath; using Strength on one boulder is one thing, but an entire cave-in is a whole different ordeal.<br />
<br />
Looking around, you see no trace of the exploding Electric-Type. Although some Pokemon are known to remain intact following the energy outburst, it seems as if this Electrode really did blow up in a million pieces to ensure you lagged behind. And it was in part successful, as you’ve already lost precious time in your investigation! To make matters worse, unfortunately, there’s no distinct scent for Hermione to follow…<br />
<br />
All obstacles removed from your path, you finally press onwards, following the corridor to its conclusion and taking the left turn at the end with nowhere else to go. At the end of that hallway, you come across a sealed door reminiscent of the one that led you straight into that dark room filled with Golbat… however, once you approach this one, it slides open instantly, having detected the keycard from that dead employee. A sign above the door reads “SALIN - NORTH GENERATOR”…<br />
<br />
You walk inside a very large room, unfortunately as poorly-lit as most, the only sources of light being the emergency exit signs scattered along the walls… and a massive central cylinder radiating a powerful yellow glow, the largest reactor you’ve come across up until this point – and still functioning, if only at reduced capacity!<br />
<br />
Weary of the previous encounter with the hungry Golbat, you step around cautiously, eyeing the ceiling at all times but finding nothing noteworthy. It isn’t until the flapping of wings from somewhere nearby reaches your ears that you’re certain you’re not alone inside the room, much as you feared… but looking over to where the sound is coming from, you realize that’s no Golbat at all: happily munching on the generator’s main cable is the same creature from before, the one that escaped the previous room. Now that it’s much closer and standing still, you can actually identify it: it’s a

</div>
!<br />
<br />
But that’s not all… rolling into view from behind a wooden crate, the Electrode from before creeps up behind the Noibat, crackling with electricity from its earlier feast on the backup power source!<br />
<br />
There’s no telling what Electrode plans to do. He doesn’t seem to have noticed you yet, and keeps closing its distance on the tiny Dragon-Type. Meanwhile, Noibat continues to gnaw away at the cable, oblivious to its surroundings. Part of you can’t help but worry about Electrode’s intentions – what if it wants to feed on the major reactor by itself and is looking to dispose of Noibat? On the other hand, should you step in to keep Noibat safe from the possible threat, won’t you be giving the purple creature a chance to seriously damage the generator by biting off the cable?<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span><br />

<b><u>Icy Cavern</u></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Raves</u>:</b> It would have been easy to give in to the Trainer’s instinct and engage the foes. After all, Nothung is adept at both Fire and Fighting – a combination that easily lays waste to most Ice Pokemon. But you also know better than to fight outnumbered in a terrain that heavily favors the larger army, so instead you opt to try and reason with the angry polar bear – and when reasoning with an angry polar bear is your best option, you know you’re in some really deep s…now.<br />
<br />
Beartic growls the whole time while you plead your case, his eyes glistening with rage at the mention of the empty cradle. Clearly you’ve hit another nerve… but the fact he doesn’t behead you right here and now means you must’ve approached the subjected with enough tact that he at least hears you out until the end.<br />
<br />
The bear places a massive claw on the ice cradle, going from angry to deeply sad in a matter of moments. He then looks over to the opening behind him, the tunnel you intended to head towards unnoticed – which is kind of off the table at this point – and then picks something up from behind the cradle: a piece of cloth?<br />
<br />
One of the Froslass hovers over to the Beartic, bows and retrieves the fabric from his hand, then floats over to you and extends the rag as it chants something. Understanding it wants you to have it, you receive the item from the Ghost and inspect it a bit more carefully: it’s a torn piece of cloth indeed, the fabric not very different from that of your own coat, and stained with blood. This belongs to another human, someone who passed here before you did – only that someone probably didn’t do such a good job at reasoning with Beartic and ended up being attacked, leaving only this rag behind… Could it be the one responsible for the cub’s disappearance?<br />
<br />
Beartic looks at you pleadingly for the briefest of moments, a split-second sight of frailty, before returning to its menacing self. He curls himself around the empty cradle once more, but doesn’t fall back asleep, instead seeming lost in memories…<br />
<br />
Well, what will you do now? Any ideas on how to help Beartic?</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</u></b> Forward is the way to go, you reason – no point in checking out whatever room it was that the Electrode came out of, seeing as it was most likely already drained of power and, therefore, usefulness. You reason they are headed somewhere you want to follow if you want some answers, and that means Rowena’s services are once again required!<br />
<br />
The Nidoqueen roars as she tackles the huge pile of rubble. One by one, she removes boulders, broken pipes, wires and all other manner of debris, putting her muscles to good use… and after a while, she successfully disposes of the make-shift barricade put up by the sacrificing Electrode! However, the endeavour was taxing on the Poison-Type, as she’s visibly struggling to catch her breath; using Strength on one boulder is one thing, but an entire cave-in is a whole different ordeal.<br />
<br />
Looking around, you see no trace of the exploding Electric-Type. Although some Pokemon are known to remain intact following the energy outburst, it seems as if this Electrode really did blow up in a million pieces to ensure you lagged behind. And it was in part successful, as you’ve already lost precious time in your investigation! To make matters worse, unfortunately, there’s no distinct scent for Hermione to follow…<br />
<br />
All obstacles removed from your path, you finally press onwards, following the corridor to its conclusion and taking the left turn at the end with nowhere else to go. At the end of that hallway, you come across a sealed door reminiscent of the one that led you straight into that dark room filled with Golbat… however, once you approach this one, it slides open instantly, having detected the keycard from that dead employee. A sign above the door reads “SALIN - NORTH GENERATOR”…<br />
<br />
You walk inside a very large room, unfortunately as poorly-lit as most, the only sources of light being the emergency exit signs scattered along the walls… and a massive central cylinder radiating a powerful yellow glow, the largest reactor you’ve come across up until this point – and still functioning, if only at reduced capacity!<br />
<br />
Weary of the previous encounter with the hungry Golbat, you step around cautiously, eyeing the ceiling at all times but finding nothing noteworthy. It isn’t until the flapping of wings from somewhere nearby reaches your ears that you’re certain you’re not alone inside the room, much as you feared… but looking over to where the sound is coming from, you realize that’s no Golbat at all: happily munching on the generator’s main cable is the same creature from before, the one that escaped the previous room. Now that it’s much closer and standing still, you can actually identify it: it’s a

!<br />
<br />
But that’s not all… rolling into view from behind a wooden crate, the Electrode from before creeps up behind the Noibat, crackling with electricity from its earlier feast on the backup power source!<br />
<br />
There’s no telling what Electrode plans to do. He doesn’t seem to have noticed you yet, and keeps closing its distance on the tiny Dragon-Type. Meanwhile, Noibat continues to gnaw away at the cable, oblivious to its surroundings. Part of you can’t help but worry about Electrode’s intentions – what if it wants to feed on the major reactor by itself and is looking to dispose of Noibat? On the other hand, should you step in to keep Noibat safe from the possible threat, won’t you be giving the purple creature a chance to seriously damage the generator by biting off the cable?<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: YELlow"><span style="font-size: 12px">Rowena gave a determined roar as she took on the blockage, shifting aside every bit of debris in her path. Keith grinned as Electrode's blockage proved to be no match for his Nidoqueen's raw power. Sometimes a well-thought-out strategy was better than brute strength, and sometimes brute strength <i>was</i> the best strategy, and this was one of those times, for sure.<br />
<br />
As Rowena finally broke on through to the other side, Keith noticed something... unsettling. Namely, the complete lack of unconscious Electrode. That one Electrode who had used Explosion was nowhere to be seen. Did it regain consciousness and manage to escape? Electrode <i>could</i> learn Teleport... Or did it literally explode into millions of pieces? Keith shuddered at the thought of such a thing happening, even to a Pokémon that was antagonizing him. That was <i>not</i> how moves like Self-Destruct and Explosion worked...<br />
<br />
To make matters worse, a quick glance at Hermione revealed the Weedle sniffing around, but quickly shaking her head afterward- there had been no Electrode left behind (or at least, not intact...), and thus there was nothing to get the scent off of. &quot;Weedle...&quot; Hermione murmured, sounding apologetic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, don't sweat it, Hermione,&quot; Keith reassured her. &quot;If there's no scent to pick up, there's no scent to pick up. Not your fault. We'll think of something else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nii... Niiidoooh...&quot; grunted Rowena in agreement.<br />
<br />
This prompted Keith to wheel around- his Nidoqueen was exhausted, and oh, boy, did she sound it! &quot;Rowena, thank you,&quot; Keith said to his Nidoqueen. &quot;You were awesome just now, and you've more than earned a good rest.&quot; Rowena nodded in response to this, and Keith held out the Poké Ball, withdrawing his Nidoqueen into its spherical confines, the better for her to catch her breath and recuperate from the taxing task she'd just completed. Using Strength was no problem for her. But this wasn't a normal situation. Using Strength to shove a couple of boulders around was a cakewalk for Rowena, but using the move to tunnel her way through a caved-in corridor was a whole other swarm of Yanma altogether. Keith doubted that most other Pokémon would be able to get the job done alone in the first place, which made him all the more impressed with that Nidoqueen of his.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, wat do we do now?&quot; Meowth asked Keith.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there's only one way to go from here, it looks like,&quot; Keith replied, eyeing the lone path ahead of them. &quot;So we might as well go as far as we can.&quot; As he spoke, he held out his hand, allowing his Weedle to crawl back up his arm and onto his shoulder, and once she was in place, he headed down the corridor, following the only path accessible to him. At the end of that corridor, he made the left turn, the only one possible... and at the end of that corridor, he came face-to-face with a sealed door. &quot;Well, that's just grea- huh?&quot; Keith said, for mid-sentence, the door slid open on its own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe it detected dat card key,&quot; Meowth suggested, wisely deciding to not remind Keith about the deceased employee they got said card key off of.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that'd do it,&quot; Keith agreed. Noting how poorly-lit the next room was, he cautiously stepped inside. Every so often, his eyes scoured the ceiling, his previous close encounter of the Golbat kind still fresh in his mind, but nothing swooped down from the ceiling to attack them this time. On the other hand, however, he could hear the flapping of leathery wings nonetheless. Were there Golbat in this room after all? Or worse- wild Crobat? Owning a Crobat himself, Keith was all too aware of the dangers such a creature could pose. If they were indeed in the same room as a wild, bloodthirsty Crobat, with the lighting heavily favoring the Crobat, they were as good as dead.<br />
<br />
However, upon closer inspection of what little of their surroundings they could see, Keith could see a purple batlike creature, but this was no Crobat. No, indeed, this had to have been the same unidentified creature from before! And what was more, now that Keith could get a proper look, he realized he'd seen this before- it was a Noibat! He recalled the one a Team Rocket grunt had used to try and battle him and Stewie some time ago. And this one was happily and obliviously munching on a cable, connected to the generator. Could this innocent little Noibat really be a part of the source of the power plant's troubles, without even meaning to be?<br />
<br />
Before Keith could ponder this point too much, however, he saw a decidedly less welcome sight rolling on out from behind a crate- the Electrode from before, and it was heading straight for Noibat! Keith had to think fast- Electrode was likely still hungry, and probably wanted to make this generator its next course, and with Noibat unknowingly working on wrecking said generator, it was likely Electrode was looking to dispose of Noibat first before chowing down and charging up. But if Keith were to try and stop Electrode, Noibat would have ample opportunity to wreck the generator... Moreover, Electrode hadn't noticed them yet- this gave them the element of surprise, at least, which was better than nothing, though Keith knew that if he were to call out a Pokémon to fight Electrode, there goes the element of surprise. The sound of a Poké Ball opening up and unleashing its occupant would attract the Electrode's attention, no question.<br />
<br />
Keith exchanged looks with the Weedle on his shoulder, thankful that she was so smart, because if the look on her face was any indicator, Hermione was coming to the same conclusion her Trainer was doing. She nodded to him and started to quietly crawl down onto the floor, and once on said floor, kept moving, away from Keith, but within close enough range to land an attack on Electrode if the need should arise. She had a feeling she knew what Keith was going to do about the Noibat, and if her hunch was correct, she had a plan all set- it would do until Keith would start issuing her commands. <b>Voodoo Bugaloo</b> to hold Electrode in place, followed by a powerful <b>Blizzard</b> it would be in no position to evade, hopefully freezing it solid.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Keith put his plan into action- he knew that Noibat had very good hearing, so he was confident that if he whispered this at just the right volume, he could ensure Noibat would hear him, while Electrode might not. &quot;Noibat, look out, behind you,&quot; Keith whispered, hoping against hope that he was right, that Noibat- and only Noibat- would hear and react to this utterance. Hermione, meanwhile, made ready her first attack- this was exactly what she figured Keith would do! Once Noibat was made aware of the oncoming Electrode, that was when she'd make her move to incapacitate the Electric-type.</span></span><br />

<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u> Electric Blue Eye</u>:</b> The crowd cheers at the sight of your first choice, a Pokemon that already impressed everyone on the stands in his first battle earlier in the morning: your Snivy! The choice seems logical – this is a grassy arena, and you’re fighting a Water-Type Pokemon. Even if you can never be too cautious against Gym Leaders, there’s no denying Chris is the best choice all things considered! So why is Luther smiling?...<br />
<br />
Chris starts things off by running around so fast, he creates multiple shadow clones of himself. Unfazed, Crawdaunt snaps its pincers together, awaiting instructions that come soon afterwards.<br />
<br />
- Very well, we can match your speed. Use <b>Agility</b> to keep up!<br />
<br />
Something about Luther’s tactic sounds off, but in the heat of battle it’s hard to pinpoint exactly what troubles you. The crawdad loosens its muscles and immediately its movements become quicker and less restrained by its cumbersome shell. And when your partner shoots off a dozen multicolored leaves that home in on the Water-Type, that unexpected speed boost comes in particularly handy!<br />
<br />
- Wait… wait… Now, <b>Dig</b>!<br />
<br />
Crawdaunt immediately digs a whole in the soft, grassy field and vanishes from sight at the last second, while the Magical Leaves stab the ground like a storm of arrows. Luther’s partner then re-emerges behind the several Snivy clones, and the black-and-white haired man does something truly unexpected…<br />
<br />
- Now, dispose of all those copies with a <b>Flamethrower</b>!!<br />
<br />
You can hardly believe your eyes: Crawdaunt opens one of its pincers and lets loose a jet of flames, spraying the field with blazes that engulf each Double Team clone one by one, erasing them all until they hit the real Snivy for frightening damage! Chris rolls around in the grass reeling in pain, its skin charred but fortunately not Burned. He looks at you in sheer confusion, only to find you equally dazed, and in his frustration retaliates with a storm of rotating leaves that strikes the opponent successfully!!<br />
<br />
Crawdaunt is pushed back by the move, but is clearly less hurt than you would expect. After all, it should have been a seriously damaging hit when you consider the Types involved… until…<br />
<br />
You feel your eyes stinging and burning all of a sudden. Instinctively you wipe them clean, and in that moment it’s as if a veil is lifted… When you look over to the battlefield again, there is no longer any Crawdaunt facing Chris. Instead, a new creature stands before him, grinning devilishly… a sight that explains everything that’s happened thus far. Luther has been playing you all along, right from the moment where you sent a partner to counter his first choice – because your foe was never a Crawdaunt to begin with, but a

!<br />
<br />
- Well, the truth is out. Let this be a lesson to you, Ethan: in life, just like in battle, not everything is what it seems. Yes, I wield the Dark-Type. But are you sure I’m the enemy?<br />
<br />
Zoroark growls, ready to strike back. Luther, in turn, is happy to comply.<br />
<br />
- <b>Hone</b> your <b>Claws</b>, then <b>Aerial Ace</b> so he can’t dodge!<br />

<span style="color: silver">Ethan wasn’t as surprised as one might of thought, he knew there was a chance- a possibility that the Dark Gym Leader would have a Pokémon such as Zoroark to misdirect him. <i>But there was no way of knowing for sure, or even a way to convey that to my Pokémon, and because of that Chris got severely hurt.</i><br />
<br />
Why else send out a Water Type when Luther himself witnessed the battle Ethan had with Sean in the morning? <i>He wanted to score an early blow</i>. This battle against Luther was already proving to be much different than the one he had with Sean, while Sean was patient and calculating. Luther seemed to be more aggressive, though his moves were just as thought out. <br />
<br />
The battle was getting serious now, Luther’s trick would only work once as long as he couldn’t retrieve the Illusionist Fox Pokémon back inside its Pokéball...Either way, Zoroark didn’t have many super effect moves it could use against a Grass Type but neither did they have any super effective moves Chris could use to land a serious blow on the Dark Type...Ethan needed to think of a way to do the most damage in the shortest amount of time, but how?<br />
<br />
Luther and Zoroark were already going for their next attack, the Gym Leader wasn’t giving Ethan any time to think of a counter move, they had to decide how to deal with the situation as it developed, rather than plan ahead. They were keeping the pressure on, however Snivy wasn’t about to be made to look like a fool a second time. <br />
<br />
&quot;Use it!&quot; Ethan shouted, realizing his Pokémon’s overwhelming frustration, &quot;Use that anger you feel to fuel your next attack!&quot; <br />
<br />
Chris looked back, the grass snake-lizard understood what his trainer wanted from him, nodding as he struggled from the flame attack he endured earlier.<br />
<br />
Zoroark could attack on its own without any instruction from it’s trainer...Gym Leader’s Pokémon were capable of much more then wild Pokémon or your everyday trained Pokémon. This made the Gym Battle very unpredictable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chris use <b>Coil</b> before meeting their attack with a <b>Protect</b>! Bring Zoroark down with <b>Wring Out</b>!&quot;<br />
<br />
As the trainer looked across the field towards Luther he said in a hush tone, so that only the Gym Leader could hear, &quot;If you’re not the enemy, who is? And what interest do you have with me?&quot; The trainer didn’t think anything sinister about the Dark Type Gym Leader, it’s so easy to paint someone out to be the bad guy when you don’t understand them and act or dress a certain way...but that also didn’t make someone innocent either. &quot;By the way, thank you for defending me against Peitro earlier...I don’t know why you did it, but thanks just the same.&quot;</span></span><br />

<b><u>Iridi Beach</u></b><br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Emi</u>:</b> <i>((4 of 6 Pokemon declared: Alomomola, Binacle, Yanmega, Starly))</i><br />
<br />
Commanding your Pokemon like you would an army, you switch up roles to try and solve all three disasters at the same time: the wounded on the beach, the imperilled in the water and your idiot Binacle.<br />
<br />
Dutiful and to-the-point as Surgei and Farseer are in taking instructions, Adrammelech proves too unruly in the face of a challenge and now he’s gone and gotten himself overwhelmed by the Carvanha you never ordered him to attack. Bora, eccentric and apparently self-centered as he may be, is your choice to replace Farseer in the task of guiding people out of the water – you need the Alomomola’s services elsewhere, namely underwater where Adrammelech unwillingly requires assistance.<br />
<br />
While your troops mobilize, you shift your attention back to the wounded elder and patch him up as best you can before moving on to other wounded tourists. Fortunately mostly everyone else bears only superficial cuts and bite marks, and you’re quick to provide assistance with what limited tools you have available. Surgei keeps bringing in people from the water, while Bora is quick to realize he’ll have more success sticking to helping people who can already swim – there’s no way he’s big enough to actually carry anyone to shore, but he proves really good at setting the lost adults on the right path back to the sand.<br />
<br />
A sudden noise catches your attention, a loud bubbling sound coming from where Adrammelech was caught. You look over just in time to see at least a dozen Carvanha come to surface and swim frantically <i>away</i> from the shore, far off into the ocean until you lose them from sight… and then, Farseer emerges.<br />
<br />
The Alomomola’s expression says it all. On his back, Adrammelech is barely conscious, covered in severe wounds. Although he should be conserving his strength, he can’t stand still atop the larger Water-Type, instead flailing about hopelessly, intent on getting a message across, something he absolutely wants you to hear… as if he’s just discovered something incredible, or terrifying, while he was being dragged down into the depths of the sea before Farseer came to the rescue.<br />
<br />
Whereas most people seem safe thanks to you and your team’s efforts, there are still several tourists left with superficial physical scars, and many with deep psychological ones – though effectively helping every single one of them is almost impossible. And now, a new concern arises – Adrammelech’s health. Will you leave Iridi Beach to seek specialized medical help for your partner, or do you have anything in your possession that can help him out on the spot? Considering everything that’s happened in such a short amount of time, you can’t help but wonder now: is staying in Iridi Beach any longer a wise decision, or is it best to leave for another area?...</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: deepskyblue"><span style="font-size: 12px">Lillian would have to hope that Farseer would be able to keep the Carvanha at bay and rescue Adrammelech, as there was much she could do herself against a pack of ferocious fish with big jaws. She focused her attention on the injured old man in front of her, dressing the wound as much as she could before she went to go tend to the other injured people on the beach. Thankfully, she thought as she made sure to tend to as many wounds as possible, none of the wounds are as serious as that heavy bite wound on the old man, nothing that would require amputation at any rate. Even while Lillian was hard at work taking care of people, being the angel clad in...well a swimsuit for the injured at the beach, Surgei and Bora kept bringing in more people, although Bora was more or less assisting the people who could already swim. The amount of people was something that could be considered like a school of fish themselves, but Lillian was trying to keep them out of her head. Focus on the patient, make sure that they have the proper care, then move onto the next one. <br />
<br />
Lillian however heard a noise that startled her out of helping everyone, and looked into the water. It was something that could like a large bubble, and all of a sudden, a group of Carvanha immediately surface out of the water and speed towards the ocean, speeding away from the shore. The sight is confusing, and Lillian wonders to herself what exactly could be causing this. The Carvanha flee, far into the ocean, and that's when Farseer comes up from out of the water, with Adrammelech clinging onto him. Lillian immediately sees that Adrammelech is covered in extreme wounds, most likely inflicted from the pack of Carvanha. Immediately Lillian knew that it was going to be impossible to properly treat these wounds with the medical supplies she had on hand; the chances of an infection or other similar complications that would arise would be high. She also noticed that although he was holding onto Farseer, he was also thrashing about. <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it all Adrammelech, what in the hell are you doing?&quot; Lillian grumbled out. She was going to have to go check on him in order to more effectively gauge the severity of his wounds, and no matter what her thoughts and feelings were about his actions, she simply was unable to do anything to ignore his wounds, like she wasn't able to ignore the wounds of anyone on the beach. She immediately took off towards the edge of the beach, just as Farseer was coming in. <br />
<br />
For Lillian, the first thing that she had to do was to make sure that Adrammelech was as well taken care of as possible. She remembered that Farseer did have the move Heal Pulse, which might be able to heal some of the wounds, at least on a superficial level. But, she first had to deal with the crazy Binacle, who couldn't be treated if he was thrashing about like a man who saw a ghost on the battlefield. &quot;Adrammelech, listen to me and listen to me well. I'm going to try and take care of you as much as possible, but you need to allow me too. If not...there's a fair chance I'm going to have to amputate parts of you in order to keep you alive, and I'm sure that you certainly don't want that.&quot; She hoped that would allow Adrammelech to come to his senses, but she still wanted to know if Farseer had any information for her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Farseer, the first thing I want you to do is you use your Heal Pulse on Adrammelech. I don't know how much it will help, but hopefully it is able to abate his wounds long enough that we will be able to make some sense of the situation. Then, I want you to tell me anything that you might have seen while you were down there. Adrammelech seems to have seen something, but I need to know if you have seen anything about it as well. After we have this information, we can finally begin to understand our situation and think of a plan to do something.&quot; <br />
<br />
For Lillian, the idea of leaving was ridiculous. If they were to leave right now without knowing anything, the situation could happen again, or in the worst case, be significantly worse. Besides, with as much buzz was what happened now, it would be beyond doubt that someone in charge would have heard about it by now and was already trying to mobilize some kind of response. Leaving would just do no good and take up time, the best thing they could do was to wait and learn.</span></span></div>

<br />
<br />
<b><u>Bane Forest</u></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Ex-Admiral Insane</u>:</b> The disappearance of your partner Rags weighs the heaviest on your mind amidst all the mess you find yourself sunk into. A number of things could have happened to your Psychic-Type partner, none of them pleasant: becoming lost in the swamp, attacked by wild Pokemon, held hostage by Gastly are only some of the worst-case scenarios you can think of.<br />
<br />
But you have to put that behind you for now, however hard that proves to be. Right now, the EPAL need your help, and tagging along with them might be the best way to find your partner anyway. There is an obvious conflict of interests afoot in Venom Island, and despite caring little about either side, it seems you find yourself tangled in this web and will, sooner or later, have to make a choice. Right now, staying close to Ria seems like the best approach, even if you’re not sold on the idea of helping her over aiding Gastly.<br />
<br />
Such is your lack of security about the whole ordeal that you choose to call upon a scout to scan the area ahead – Mal the Zubat, a Pokemon who should feel right at home in this environment. Your winged ally heeds your instructions and, barely making a sound, takes flight high above the group and takes the lead, unseen by the EPAL team.<br />
<br />
- Lucas, I need you to look sharply too. Like I said, we know the Isle’s growing out of proportion, but so far we haven’t been able to track any sources of that expansion. We’re pioneers in that research, with all the hazards that come with that “honor”… I need you on your guard, remember you’re getting paid for this.<br />
<br />
Despite her words, it’s evident by Ria’s tone that she hold no ill feelings towards you, and is just completely invested in this endeavour. You can tell she’s both excited to be here, and extremely fearful of putting anyone in danger; deep down, she seems like a genuinely nice person, if a little blunt in her approach. But is helping her cause the right choice to make?...<br />
<br />
While you ponder on your previous encounter with Gastly, remembering its stance on the environmental conundrum, Mal returns to you and lands on your shoulder. Though you can’t understand anything she says, her body language is enough to put you on guard – she saw something up ahead… or someone. It’s not until she warns you that you notice how eerily <i>quiet</i> the whole swamp is… too quiet in fact, considering Mal definitely located activity up ahead. Which means… are you running straight into an ambush?!<br />
<br />
If your assumption is correct, then there are forces working against EPAL’s progress. Could this be the start of a war between Ria’s and Gastly’s team? And what is your role in all this – should you take Ria’s side and warn her of the impending danger, or wait and see what the Island’s dwellers intend to do?<br />
<br />
<br />
It’s time to choose a side…</span></span>

</blockquote><br />
<span style="font-size: 10px"><span style="color: DarkOrchid">Mal swatted her wings with silent effort as she flew ahead of the group to scout. Lucas took another look at the EPAL members hiking forwards. <i>’It seems no one noticed Mal. Perhaps for the best,’</i> he thought. After his last disappearance act, his actions may have appeared less than innocent. Even if it was to help them as well. He grumbled to himself. He didn’t exactly feel they were giving him a whole lot of free reign to do what he wanted. Why was this again?<br />
<br />
“Lucas, I need you to look sharply too.” Ria looked back at him again. “Like I said, we know the Isle’s growing out of proportion, but so far we haven’t been able to track any sources of that expansion. We’re pioneers in that research, with all the hazards that come with that ‘honor’… I need you on your guard, remember you’re getting paid for this.”<br />
<br />
<i>’Right, pay.’</i> That was the reason he was obeying them.<br />
<br />
Still, Ria looked genuinely concerned about their safety. Perhaps it was best he did stay close to them. If only to make them feel safer by having him around. After all, how else was he going to get paid? He plodded along through the mudded path. Tree after tree passed them as he went on, each a dirt grey from all the poison in the area. <i>’What was it that Ria said about the poison? The pollution was increasing, spreading from out of the forest and infecting the surrounding waters?’</i> Lucas couldn’t quite remember. He admitted it might have been better if he paid more attention to what was being said to him. Still, he was sure the island was growing, that much he could remember. But how though? Come to think of it, he never did ask <i>how</i> the island was growing. Was land suddenly appearing out of nowhere? <i>’Ria didn't seem to know yet either’</i><br />
<br />
Yet, the map showed that the growth was only in a few places, and when he tried to explore one of them, the Gastly from his dreams popped up to give cryptic messages. <i>’Something about Arceus wanting to grow. No, that doesn’t sound right.’</i> What was certain was that the Gastly was willing to fight him to protect this land. <i>’Him, and others.’</i> he remembered. But who exactly were the others? Was the entire island population plotting to get rid of them? Or are there just a few willing to make a stance?<br />
<br />
A small gust of wind brushed Lucas’ side. He hadn’t noticed Mal returning in his train of thought. “Why you’re getting stronger every day, aren’t you little girl.” The trainer reached out to pat the little Zubat on her head. “So? Did you find anything?” Mal was still panting heavily. A flier she may be, but the little Zubat was still young, and sunlight was damaging to her species if they stayed out too long. It didn’t help that it had been a while since she had been fed. Lucas briefly considered letting her feed on him when she made a jerking motion with her wing, the tip raised ahead of the group.<br />
<br />
“Hmm?” Lucas raised an eyebrow. “You found something?” The little Zubat nodded her head.<br />
</span></span><br />
<i><span style="font-size: 10px"><span style="color: DarkOrchid">’Rags!’</span></span></i><br />
<span style="font-size: 10px"><span style="color: DarkOrchid"><br />
The little Zubat gave a whiny screech in response. “Ouch! Don’t Farfetching do that when you’re next to me.” Lucas looked around. He hoped no one heard him say that.<br />
<br />
“So what?” Lucas rubbed his ears in discomfort. “It’s not Rags?” Lucas couldn’t quite tell what Mal was trying to say. He had trouble concentrating with the ringing in his ears. Eventually they popped and he could hear again. It was only then he realised how little there was to be heard. He hadn’t noticed it before, but the whole place was quiet, dead quiet in fact. He was sure there were other Pokémon though. At least, Ria assured him there were, but nothing seemed to bustle or shift through the dead vegetation.<br />
<br />
Lucas looked around nervously, trying to spot a glimpse of movement. His eyes rested on his Zubat and he stopped dead in his tracks. Was that what Mal was trying to tell him? Were they walking straight into a trap, the Pokémon waiting for them to come close? If so, the best option would be to walk around, or to go in with a surprise attack, neither of which Lucas wanted to do in case it was Rags.<br />
<br />
The best thing, Lucas decided, was to try and lure out whatever was ahead of them. But he had to do that from a safe distance. Mal was capable of supersonic to scatter enemies but she might not be able to retreat fast enough. Lucas tapped the last Pokéball on his belt and thought to himself. Wattson had rarely been used in the field or in combat, and Lucas specifically trained him to manage one enemy effectively; there might be more than one up ahead.<br />
<br />
“Ria, stop,” he called out to the EPAL member. He needed time to think and the sooner he could stop the group from walking into a potential trap the better. “There’s something up ahead and I’m not sure if it’s friendly.” He supposes he made a final decision following money above all else and siding with the EPAL members instead of Gastly. He remembered her having said that some the native Pokémon were hostile, inhabitants that could thrive on death and decay. He hoped that was enough to have her trust him and stop. He searched through his Pokédex to find some useful information. A Magneton would have been really helpful with Electric Terrain and Zap Cannon. Lucas had tried to find information on obtaining it but the exact understanding of evolution remained a slight mystery as accounts varied between books. He was going to have to stick with a Magnemite for now, and whatever it might have in its arsenal.<br />
<br />
He pulled out the Pokéball from his belt. Before he continued, he asked the EPAL members to hide any electronic device they might have. They didn’t have to turn them off but Wattson had the tendency to be a hypochondriac when it came to electromagnetism. It wasn’t so much that it was sensitive, as it was that it believed to be sensitive. So as long as the Magnemite wouldn’t have to see any electronics, it wouldn’t go into a screeching overdrive that eventually led to it shutting himself off.<br />
<br />
Once the devices were hidden from plain sight, Lucas called out his ally. “Wattson, show yourself.” A small white blast condensed in front of the Pokéball to form a metal ball with screws and magnets. Its single eye opened up and gave a gleeful <i>’Mag’</i> after spotting its trainer. It rubbed up closer to the Lucas’ head like a dog and nearly knocked Mal of off his shoulder. Mal screeched to regain her balance, causing the Magnemite to instantly back off with a head-ache that resonated like a microphone next to a speaker.<br />
<br />
“Quiet, Wattson.” The Magnemite ignored his trainer and flipped on his axis in mid-air. The wailing pitch continued its whine. Lucas clenched his fist in annoyance at his Pokémon. <i>’Every, damn, time.’</i> He struck the Magnemite on top and immediately snapped it out of its headache – the only way he knew how. Instead, the Magnemite looked at his trainer with a weeping eye, before bursting into wailing tears; ‘mite, mite, mite’. The trainer simply sighed at his Pokémon, Mal looked confused at her trainer and the Magnemite.<br />
<br />
“Wattson.”<br />
<br />
The Magnemite continued crying. “Mite, mite, mite.”<br />
<br />
“Wattson!”<br />
<br />
The Magnemite stopped and sniffed. “We need your help. We have something important that only you can do.” The Magnemite lit up when hearing it could be helpful. The fact that it was something important only he could do made him feel that much important. The Magnemite started flipping on his axis again, giving chirping ‘mags’ each time it did.<br />
<br />
“Alright Watts,” – the nickname he gave the Magnemite – “there’s someone out there and we don’t know what. You go and find it, and we’ll stay right here.”<br />
<br />
“Mite!”<br />
<br />
The plan sounded absurd and inconsiderate, but it was all Lucas had bothered to come up with. The Magnemite protested wholeheartedly on being separated from its trainer and going into the dank woods on its eyes. Lucas assured him with fake flattery and belittled the threat as much as he could. “Besides,” he finally added. “You’re a Steel-type. Poison attacks won’t harm you.” Lucas had remembered reading something about the type match-ups in one of many of the books he had at home. He wasn’t an avid reader any more, but before he was allowed to leave on his adventure, he and Rags had soaked up any information they could find in preparation. Steel types, he was sure, were completely immune to poison-type attacks.<br />
<br />
The plan Lucas had was this: the group would continue moving forward quietly until they came close to the spot. Once there, the group would have to take cover or hide. Perhaps they might turn the ambush around on their opponents. Wattson would go in alone and use <b>Metal Sound</b> as he continued. The Metal Sound, Lucas hoped, would either scatter any wild and hostile Pokémon out there and flee, or instigate them to attack the Magnemite. If they attacked, Wattson was to use <b>Volt Switch</b>. The speed of the move could hopefully allow him to retreat on time while stunning an opponent with an attack. Lucas had already prepared by placing Mal back in her Pokéball. Volt Switch wouldn’t work if Wattson didn’t have anyone to switch in for him. Hopefully, Lucas plan would draw out whatever it was that was waiting up ahead, whether it was friend or foe.</span></span><br />

<br />
It’s clear as day at this point: you’re a one-woman army waging war with the local Government. And in every war, there is loss… Meow, Snub and Ashley concentrate their efforts on shattering the pods to release the Pokemon inside. But as their bodies tumble out of their stasis chambers and onto the floor, it soon becomes apparent that no Heal Bell can fix what happened to them: they aren’t suffering from any special condition… they just drowned.<br />
<br />
The sight makes your stomach turn: all these Pokemon, taken from their Coordinators, trapped inside glass cages like zoo animals, kept alive on a whim and now killed on a whim as well… Or was Layard only keeping them stable long enough for you to walk in and see them die? What if his plan all along was to preserve only that Fennekin? It scares you to think such a man even exists, one who toys with as many lives as it takes only to get inside an enemy’s head. These Pokemon, are they just collateral damage in Layard’s mission to destroy you and Dana?<br />
<br />
Speaking of Dana, you can’t help but wonder how she’s doing, if she’s still safe. The Vice President seems to have tentacles reaching everywhere in the city; it’d be easier than ever to root out the former Master Coordinator now that you’re making so many waves. Could you forgive yourself if the elderly couple was captured? Arceus forbid, if they were subjected to Red Skull’s torture?<br />
<br />
Your thoughts kept racing from one problem to another, and thinking about the cruelty of that woman in red immediately reminds you of the guard she mutilated… The one friend you’ve found since clashing with Layard. You were sceptical of him at first, but now that the truth is evident, you feel the need to correct that mistake – rushing in to face Layard with a hot head is a bad idea, and you want to check up on the prison guard; after all, everything that happened to him is partly your fault too!<br />
<br />
Trying your absolute hardest to push the image of all those Pokemon to the back of your head, you rush to the elevator and head back down. The power is still on, as if Layard and Red Skull are taunting you to follow them, but you return to the prison level instead, hoping the detour doesn’t bring any more harm to either Fennekin or Dana’s Arcanine, whom you are yet to meet…<br />
<br />
The elevator’s doors slid open after a while of descending, and you step back out into the familiar hallway lined by cells on both sides. The first door to your left is where you retrieved your Bag and found the Choice Scarf, while the first to your right… was your cell. Remembering how you trapped the friendly guard inside after tricking him, you instinctively run towards the metal door, which you find open… you take a deep breath and peer inside.<br />
<br />
- L…Liza? Liza dear, you’re alright!<br />
<br />
The familiar voice catches you completely off-guard, and it takes you a while to soak it in. Standing over someone lying on the ground… are Dana and Oscar!! What are they doing here?!<br />
<br />
- Oh dear, I’m so glad you’re alright!<br />
<br />
Oscar is visibly emotional as he walks over and gives you a hug. Dana, in her usually apathetic fashion, merely motions for you to approach her as she looks down towards the man on the ground… it’s the guard.<br />
<br />
- He kept calling out to you. I… I don’t think he will…<br />
<br />
The guard raises his arm once he sees you approaching – an arm with no hand, still bleeding. His voice is weak and his sentences cut abruptly by sudden bursts of pain, but he gets his message across…<br />
<br />
- Liza… How is Fennekin? I… I lied to you… I’m s-sorry. I d-don’t have… a sister. Fennekin was… my P-Pokemon. My p-price of admission into L-Layard’s Security. If I so m-much as hinted at… being concerned for h-her… they’d fire me… Heh, l-look how that turned out…<br />
<br />
Oscar places a hand on your shoulder, trying his best to be a reassuring presence, but everyone in the cell knows the man’s fate. He’s pale, sweating and can barely string together full sentences as he keeps talking. And judging by his torn, blood-stained uniform, his hand wasn’t the only body part targeted by Red Skull’s Pinsir…<br />
<br />
- T-tell me she’s… safe. If… if you can… t-tell her I’m sorry. Sorry for e-everything… Just like I’m s…sorry I… deceived you. I c-couldn’t b…b…bear the shame of admitting… that I actually a…abandoned Fen…<br />
<br />
He doesn’t manage to finish the last sentence as he breathes out a long sigh and goes limp. For such a young man to pass away from physical injuries… What kind of aggression did Red Skull put him through during her brief torture session?! Why is there so much death around you, all because of something as harmless as Pokemon Contests?!<br />
<br />
Oscar can’t hold back his tears, whereas the much colder Dana, whose pain she handles in a very different manner, merely closes her eyes and whispers a short prayer for the man’s soul. You can tell she blames herself for all of this, not to mention she’s still coping with the loss of her Arcanine… it’s no wonder she always looks like she carries the weight of the world on her shoulders. When she speaks, her voice is faint and barely audible, as if she too is fighting back tears of her own.<br />
<br />
- We received a letter… telling us to come here, that we should be able to enter and to meet you on this floor. It was signed by you, so we came. Strangely, we found no resistance on the way here… but judging by your expression, it wasn’t you who sent that letter.<br />
<br />
Oscar helps his wife to her feet and continues in Dana’s stead.<br />
<br />
- Maybe we were tricked… Maybe Layard wanted us all here so he could get rid of us all at once. But if so, why didn’t he attack us in our home? Clearly he found out our address, else we never would have received the letter in the first place! None of this makes sense…<br />
<br />
Dana looks at you with an expression even more serious than usual. Her voice shifts from shallow to dry and determined.<br />
<br />
- Too many have suffered because of me, because of us, because of Contests. We end this today.<br />
<br />
Oscar tries to smile, encouraged by his wife’s sudden fire.<br />
<br />
- That scoundrel Layard… he wants Contests erased from history so there are no distractions from the ultimate profit that are Battles. As long as there are no insurgents, no fragments of memory to remind the populace that there was once an alternative, then Layard wins. That’s why he needs Dana, you and all those Coordinators’ Pokemon gone. But we’re here, inside the dragon’s den. We can strike back! Liza, please… you’re our only hope. What do we do now?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: silver">The glass capsules shattered one at a time, promoting a number of unconscious Pokémon to tumble over onto the floor, causing Liza to go in and check for their pulse. The Lass ordering her Snubbull to use Heal Bell, hoping the move might cause the Contest Pokémon to wake from their comatose state but...<br />
<br />
Liza ran to the nearest Pokémon and began to give it CPR. She placed her hands together and began pumping above the chest area. Every few seconds, 30 times before she would try breathing some life into them and repeating the process…over and over again “1, 2, 3, 4…15…30, 1, 2, 3…15…30”<br />
<br />
It was agonizing to witness, for her fellow Pokémon that all seemed to have accepted the harsh reality.<br />
<br />
“Come on!” Liza yelled, “We can’t just quit! Audino give me a hand! Damn it! Why isn’t it working!?”<br />
<br />
Both Meow and Snub looked up towards the Audino with pity in their eyes, whose own expression was one of concern as well. The pink bipedal Pokémon slowly made her way to its trainer, her mega form dissipating in a flourish of sparkling white energy. As the nurse Pokémon reached her trainer, Liza continued to try pumping the fallen Pokémon’s chest. Audino placed her hand gently on the Lass’s shoulder, Liza started to shake and it wasn't until she turned around that they would see the tears streaming down her face, her body shaking from frustration and sadness. <br />
<br />
There was no exchange of words for the next few moments, Liza knew deep down that there was a possibility that the Contest Pokémon were already too far gone to be saved, but she just couldn’t seat still and do nothing.<br />
<br />
The rest of her Pokémon all rushed to their trainer, hugging in a warm embrace in a room filled with death and despair…<br />
<br />
Liza wiped away any tears she had from her cheeks, there was one reassuring thing that made the Lass stand, made her push herself to keep fighting even though the sick bastards had tried a number of times to break her and regrettably succeeded. Dana’s Arcanine wasn’t there. There was still hope!<br />
<br />
Layard was collecting strong Fire Types, but why? There was her Charizard, Dana’s Arcanine and the Fennekin that belonged to- “The Guard!” how could she be wasting time here when she still needed to make amends and try to save the only person that had ever helped her during this whole ordeal.<br />
<br />
While instructing her Pokémon to stick close to her, Liza ran back inside the elevator to get back to the bottom floor where they had originally kept the Lass captive. <br />
<br />
Once the elevator doors opened she was greeted by the nauseous smell of bodily fluids that made her want to hurl. She suck it up and dealt with it, heading straight to the cell that they put her in, the same one she had left the guard, but what she found there was bitter sweet.<br />
<br />
“Dana, Oscar! What are you two doing here?” the Lass gasped, as she hugged the old gentlemen back. Her joyous reunion with the elderly couple coming to an abrupt end when she saw the guard laying on the disgusting floor bleeding from his stomach, the same man she had been hoping to save, that she now saw was beyond any help, “Fennekin, I-“ the words were nearly choking her now, “I couldn’t save her, Red Skull took her before I got the chance, but I promise, I’ll get her back…on my life, I’ll get her back. You didn’t do anything wrong,” she caught the man’a bleeding arm, “You just rest for now.” The last sentence coming out with a tiny sob at the end...he would never wake again...<br />
<br />
Liza was too tired to cry at this point, and by the look on Dana’s face. This might have not been the worst the elderly women had seen due to this awful administration.<br />
<br />
The Lass took a few breaths, composing herself. “I thought you two were captured or that Laylard had ordered someone to assassinate you…but if you’re both here, we’ll use our numbers to overpower them. We only have one option, to go in guns a blazing and take them out. I know that neither of you have any Pokémon between you, so I insist, please what’s mine is yours…Oscar I know it’s not much but there’s no one braver then my Meowth to join you in battle. You used to challenge Gym’s I’m sure you can come up with something with him. Dana, it’ll just be temporary, just until we can get you Arcanine back…but please if you want to help, use my Growlithe to aid in the fight we’re about to have. They’ve both fought bravely already and have wounds from earlier battles but that won’t matter once we’re in the elevator. The objective will be to raid Layard’s office and free any and all Pokémon in his possession. I know it’s not going to be easy, especially since the enemy knows we’re coming. But if we don’t take care of this now, no one will. No one is ever going to get as close as we are to taking Laylard down. Are you both with me?!” Liza then turned to her Snubbull who she had kept out of his Pokéball this whole time, “I got the feeling they’re waiting for us all to show up at Laylard’s office on the top floor...but you still have Fennekin’s scent, can you lead us to her?”<br />
<br />
“Snub!”</span><br />

Once you try to explain the situation to the flailing Adrammelech, the Binacle seems to calm down somewhat, though still visibly shaken and obviously hurt. There are fang marks on its rocky bottom half, which Farseer is quick to point out to great detail: the marks are deep and wide, and could only have been carved by the teeth or a large, powerful creature – one who has no business swimming this close to a beach area. These particular marks definitely weren’t made by regular Carvanha unlike all the others that covered your partner, hinting that something else might be dwelling down there… and that was probably what Adrammelech saw that left him in such a state of panic.<br />
<br />
Even once Farseer heals him with a pulse of energy, relieving his symptoms considerably, the Binacle can’t bring himself to relay any info on what he actually saw. And just as you’re about to press him some more, something strange happens…<br />
<br />
The skies begin to darken, countless rainclouds begin to gather overhead and the roar of thunder fills the air. In a matter of seconds, a heavy downpour begins, and the sea grows agitated with waves growing progressively in size. In no more than a minute, a veritable storm breaks out! Then, much to your dismay, you see the water just a little up ahead begin to swirl, slowly at first, then progressively faster until a large whirlpool has formed, and something begins to emerge from the center…<br />
<br />
A colossal blue serpent-like creature roars it way out of the whirling sea, its cry louder than the thunder in the background. A large specimen even for its kind, the

</div>
is one of the most terrifying sights you’ve ever seen, made all the more threatening by the heavy rain and intense thunderstorm, as well as the pack of Carvanha that swim around its massive frame, riding the whirlpool. And then, something even more incredible happens… with a mere glance, the Gyarados causes a wide pillar of <b>Thunder</b> to come crashing down from overhead on a group of fleeing tourists, with the expected consequences – but no Gyarados in the wild should even know that technique to begin with!<br />
<br />
While you struggle to make sense of all that’s happening, the rainstorm suddenly stops, the clouds disperse and intense sunlight fills the entire beach, along with a notable increase in temperature! Gyarados then proceeds to arch its head back, then unleash a massive <b>Fire Blast</b> tha whizzes just past your head and explodes violently some feet back from where you stand, hitting another large group of tourists including the old man you’d just been tending to!<br />
<br />
With that, the dragon lets out another roar and then dives back down, along with the Carvanha, disappearing from sight completely as if it were never there…<br />
<br />
You look around at the havoc wrought by the Atrocious Pokemon. This was no ordinary Gyarados, judging by the moves it used, and the way the Carvanha flocked to it, everything seems to be interconnected. But do you even want to pursue this situation any further – can you possibly hope to stand your ground against such a creature? Besides, it seems to be gone now, possibly never to return…<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u> Electric Blue Eye</u>:</b> Luther smiles at your questions.<br />
<br />
- If I knew who the enemy was, I would hardly allow myself to indulge Gottfried by wasting time with this battle. Since I do not, I hope to lure him or her out overtime. And that is precisely where my interest in you stems from: I still cannot say for sure you had nothing to do with Trevor’s assault, but I can tell you’re an essential piece of this puzzle and… I believe you’re innocent. What I’m curious to know is what role you do play in this entire story.<br />
<br />
Chris sees Zoroark sharpening its claws against one another and takes the opportunity to power up as well: he tenses his muscles as he coils his body, like a serpent ready to strike. But When Luther’s Dark-Type closes distance, moving forward in a complicated pattern, Chris instead goes on the defensive – the emerald Protect shield proving the perfect defense against the otherwise-unavoidable Aerial Ace! Zoroark’s claws collide with the barrier and the fox-like Pokemon is pushed back successfully, upon which Chris is quick to capitalize by wrapping two vines around the Dark-Type and squeezing as hard as he can!<br />
<br />
If Luther is in any way troubled by this turn of events, he doesn’t show it. In fact, he doesn’t show much interest in the battle at all – it turns out the older man is looking at the stands, rather than the arena, as if intrigued by something in the audience… But he soon shifts his attention back to the ongoing match, and snaps his fingers as if to signal for something. Zoroark, up until then wincing in pain from the constricting Wring Out, shifts its expression to a knowing grin, and howling loudly, unleashes a spiralling wave of pure darkness expands outwards in a circular pattern from the Dark-Type’s position, the <b>Night Daze</b> swiping the entire arena in a show of dancing shadows until it catches Chris in the blast radius and washes over the Grass-Type, causing him intense pain and forcing him to release the hold!<br />
<br />
- That was a nice way of avoiding our melee strike, but Zoroark excels at fighting from a distance. Here, witness the extent of…<br />
<br />
Luther stops mid-sentence, his attention once more drawn to the stands, his usual smile being replaced by a worried expression uncharacteristic of the man, even if you’ve known him for only a short amount of time.<br />
<br />
Without its Trainer to provide instructions, Zoroark looks temporarily puzzled even if it just gained an upper hand over Chris. Will you try to capitalize on Luther’s distraction to get the win, or refrain from taking advantage of the situation?</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> Dana stares a Leo for a while in complete silence. Oscar walks over to you and places a hand on your shoulder.<br />
<br />
- She was in her twenties when she picked up a young Growlithe just like that from an Adoption Centre. It grew to became her closest friend and the Arcanine that won her so many Contests… give her a quick moment to reminisce, then we’ll get going. Thank you for entrusting me with your Meowth dear, I will work with it to the best of my few remaining abilities.<br />
<br />
Snub, meanwhile, nods at your request to pick up Fennekin’s scent – something he’d already done but obviously lost track of once you exited through the prison level. No doubt Red Skull went to Layard’s office with the deceased guard’s fox, and scent or no scent, that’s the only destination you have left.<br />
<br />
Dana finally drops to one knee, pets Leo behind the ear and looks over to you with ice-cold determination.<br />
<br />
- I’m ready. Let’s meet Layard.<br />
<br />
The three of you make your way over to the elevator, followed by Snub, Meow and Leo. Oscar, Dana and yourself remain in silence as you press the button to the final floor and begin making your way up, each of you lost in your respective thoughts. You’re walking straight into the lion’s den… but what other choice do you have? Confronting Layard, Red Skull and their corrupt administration is the only way to bring peace to Contest lovers and allow the sport to flourish again, unimpeded by the shallow laws of economy and profit.<br />
<br />
After what feels like an hour, the actually-short ride comes to a conclusion. The elevator stops, the door slides open… and you find yourselves in a very small hallway, though tastefully decorated, and with only a single door on the opposite wall. Taking a deep breath, you exchange a glance with Dana and Oscar for reassurance, then turn the handle and push the door open, walking inside.<br />
<br />
- Took you long enough, Liza.<br />
<br />
That voice. That bone-chilling, rage-inducing voice… Vice President Layard.<br />
<br />
The office is surprisingly wide and spacious, even with the large round table at the far end of it, where you assume Layard holds his meetings. The man himself sits on a white couch facing a large window overlooking Salin City, his back turned to you. Next to him on another couch, but facing you straight ahead, is Red Skull with her nauseating grin…<br />
<br />
- Look at that. The fossils came along! Smart of you to invite them in, boss.<br />
<br />
Layard slowly gets up from his couch, turns to you and frowns.<br />
<br />
- I didn’t. But I’d be lying if I said I’m not pleased to see you… Dana.<br />
<br />
The elder does not respond, but she doesn’t blink once as she returns Layard’s stare. After a long couple of minutes of unspoken tension, the Vice President lets out a chuckle and walks over to the desk at the end of the office. It’s not until he does that you notice a third person standing in the shadows , leaning against the far wall with his arms crossed and his usual handsome smile… Whisper, the man who tricked you earlier by leading you straight to Layard in that warehouse. He doesn’t say a word but winks teasingly at you, further aggravating your already bitter state of mind.<br />
<br />
- I don’t think there’s much room for idle conversations at this point. You all know where I stand, and I know what you all came after. So… any offers?<br />
<br />
Layard sits at the meeting table, as you assume he often does when handling his shady businesses. He doesn’t seem eager to engage in an all-out brawl, at least not yet, but keeping your emotions in check with all your enemies standing right in front of you proves a difficult task…<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</u></b> You decide to help out the Noibat, even knowing it might just be the Pokemon responsible for the state of chaos derived from the Power Plant’s malfunctions. If you allow Electrode to get any closer, there’s a good chance it’ll attack the tiny bat just for a shot at draining this generator. And there’s no telling what the consequences of that will be, considering how few emergency power sources remain active to provide power to Salin City…<br />
<br />
Hermione, smart as she is, already has a plan of action in mind, which fortunately resonates with your own idea. She focuses her small reserve of Psychic energy into crafting a voodoo miniature of Electrode, then sticks an energy needle right in the center. The real Electrode, in turn, who was just about done charging up for a sneaky electric attack, suddenly finds itself frozen in place at the last second, much to its confusion!<br />
<br />
Blissfully unaware of the commotion behind it, Noibat continues to munch on the cable… until it hears something that causes it to stop and look around! You watch on from a distance, hoping it gets the message, but judging by its confused reaction you reason it might still be too young to understand… Intrigued, Noibat looks around to try and determine the source of the whispering, and fortunately peers back and catches a glimpse of Electrode! Frightened, it takes flight (albeit haphazardly, as if still struggling with its own wings) and lands on top of the reactor.<br />
<br />
Taking it as her chance to act, Hermione charges up again – this time tapping into its limited ice energy pool – and, horn glowing, causes the air within the reactor room to stir, twist and turn into a violent contained storm as the temperature lowers dramatically in a matter of seconds. Summon a full-on blizzard inside the room, rather than out in the open, causes the walls, cables and the generator itself to gather frost. Electrode is pummelled hard by the raging storm, pushed against a nearby wall and nearly faints in one hit… but the same happens to Noibat, who can’t cope with the extremely adverse environment generated by your Weedle and is carried off by the freezing whirling winds until it crashes against the ceiling, then tumbles down to the floor unconscious…<br />
<br />
You watch on as your plan backfires in a way you didn’t exactly predict – but in hindsight, whipping up a blizzard rather than using a pinpoint attack inside a closed room was a risk in of itself. Once Hermione’s storm subsides, you assess the damage – Electrode is still conscious, but severely injured, while struggling to unstuck itself from the wall it crashed into; Noibat is out cold, lying motionless on the floor next to the cable it was chewing on; the reactor is covered in a thin layer of ice, but mercifully still functioning.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, an incredibly loud burst of sound fills the room, and the metal door on the far end of the chamber bends, contorts and finally breaks open. Through it emerges a large creature, taller than any human; it is mostly black, two massive wings being dragged along the floor; it has a pitch black tail, a tuft of white hair around its neck and two large, loudspeaker-shaped ears.<br />

</div>
enters the room with an unfriendly expression on its face. It scours the room, trying to understand what happened… until it sees Noibat lying there, and even from such a distance away, you can fill its pupils narrow and body temperature rise in sheer anger! Its attention then shifts to the Electrode who’s just come unstuck, and without a single exchange between the two, Noivern unleashes a soundwave so destructive, Electrode isn’t merely propelled back – it <i>explodes</i> under the intense pressure of the <b>Boomburst</b>! But the creature’s hearing is even more fine-tuned than Noibat’s, and it quickly senses the faint sounds of your breathing. Its eyes land on your and Hermione and, apparently reasoning that the ice covering the entire room couldn’t possibly be Electrode’s doing, it roars madly as it declares you guilty for Noibat’s injuries! The creature arches its head back, and…<br />
<br />
- Noivern, <i>STOP!!</i><br />
<br />
The voice comes from behind you. A man comes rushing in from the same door you passed through and stops next to Hermione, his eyes locked on the black wyvern… it’s Bolt! And his face is pale if you ever saw one…<br />
<br />
- You…. You’re the one responsible for this freaking mess? Why? Why are you doing this?! I won’t let you harm Keith, you hear?<br />
<br />
Noivern seems to recognize Bolt. It walks over to the fallen Noibat, picks it up gently in its fangs and growls at Bolt with a mixture of defiance and amusement. Before walking back out through the door it blasted open previously, the creatue surprisingly shares a telepathic message with Bolt, though you can also hear it clearly:<br />
<br />
<i><span style="color: cyan">Your fault.</span></i><br />
<br />
It astonishes you that Noivern can use Psychic to communicate, but Bolt doesn’t seem nearly as shocked… just heartbroken.<br />
<br />
- I can’t believe it… Noivern… so I’m the one responsible for this whole damn mess?!<br />
<br />
Bolt drops to his knees and stares blankly at the ground, looking dejected. The once noisy reactor room falls into near complete silence, the only audible sound being the machine’s humming as it continues to provide what little power it can muster.<br />
<br />
What now? Will you talk things over with Bolt, who wasn’t even supposed to be here without backup, or will you rush after Noivern?</span></span><br />

Nothing left to do at this point but press onwards. The entire EPAL team hears you out and complies, Ria included.

dive down on your Steel-Type partner, probably annoyed by its Metal Sound! Watts disappears amongst the mess of purple wings, but soon, a yellow glow emanates from the pile of bodies and lightning shoots upwards, causing the Crobat to disperse!<br />
<br />
Wattson returns to you enveloped in electricity, vanishes inside its Pokeball and immediately Mal’s one snaps open, releasing your Zubat once more, this time to confront its three fully-evolved, and very angry, brethren…<br />
<br />
You were right all along, these three were lying in wait to ambush the group. Were they doing so at Gastly’s behest? You sense you’re closer than ever to the source Ria wants to locate, but the three human-sized bats stand in your way, and the EPAL team seems seriously frightened… Now that you’ve avoid the worst-case scenario, a sneak attack on the unsuspecting party, what will you do?</span><br />

If you allow Electrode to get any closer, there’s a good chance it’ll attack the tiny bat just for a shot at draining this generator. And there’s no telling what the consequences of that will be, considering how few emergency power sources remain active to provide power to Salin City…<br />
<br />
Hermione, smart as she is, already has a plan of action in mind, which fortunately resonates with your own idea. She focuses her small reserve of Psychic energy into crafting a voodoo miniature of Electrode, then sticks an energy needle right in the center. The real Electrode, in turn, who was just about done charging up for a sneaky electric attack, suddenly finds itself frozen in place at the last second, much to its confusion!<br />
<br />
Blissfully unaware of the commotion behind it, Noibat continues to munch on the cable… until it hears something that causes it to stop and look around! You watch on from a distance, hoping it gets the message, but judging by its confused reaction you reason it might still be too young to understand… Intrigued, Noibat looks around to try and determine the source of the whispering, and fortunately peers back and catches a glimpse of Electrode! Frightened, it takes flight (albeit haphazardly, as if still struggling with its own wings) and lands on top of the reactor.<br />
<br />
Taking it as her chance to act, Hermione charges up again – this time tapping into its limited ice energy pool – and, horn glowing, causes the air within the reactor room to stir, twist and turn into a violent contained storm as the temperature lowers dramatically in a matter of seconds. Summon a full-on blizzard inside the room, rather than out in the open, causes the walls, cables and the generator itself to gather frost. Electrode is pummelled hard by the raging storm, pushed against a nearby wall and nearly faints in one hit… but the same happens to Noibat, who can’t cope with the extremely adverse environment generated by your Weedle and is carried off by the freezing whirling winds until it crashes against the ceiling, then tumbles down to the floor unconscious…<br />
<br />
You watch on as your plan backfires in a way you didn’t exactly predict – but in hindsight, whipping up a blizzard rather than using a pinpoint attack inside a closed room was a risk in of itself. Once Hermione’s storm subsides, you assess the damage – Electrode is still conscious, but severely injured, while struggling to unstuck itself from the wall it crashed into; Noibat is out cold, lying motionless on the floor next to the cable it was chewing on; the reactor is covered in a thin layer of ice, but mercifully still functioning.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, an incredibly loud burst of sound fills the room, and the metal door on the far end of the chamber bends, contorts and finally breaks open. Through it emerges a large creature, taller than any human; it is mostly black, two massive wings being dragged along the floor; it has a pitch black tail, a tuft of white hair around its neck and two large, loudspeaker-shaped ears.<br />

enters the room with an unfriendly expression on its face. It scours the room, trying to understand what happened… until it sees Noibat lying there, and even from such a distance away, you can fill its pupils narrow and body temperature rise in sheer anger! Its attention then shifts to the Electrode who’s just come unstuck, and without a single exchange between the two, Noivern unleashes a soundwave so destructive, Electrode isn’t merely propelled back – it <i>explodes</i> under the intense pressure of the <b>Boomburst</b>! But the creature’s hearing is even more fine-tuned than Noibat’s, and it quickly senses the faint sounds of your breathing. Its eyes land on your and Hermione and, apparently reasoning that the ice covering the entire room couldn’t possibly be Electrode’s doing, it roars madly as it declares you guilty for Noibat’s injuries! The creature arches its head back, and…<br />
<br />
- Noivern, <i>STOP!!</i><br />
<br />
The voice comes from behind you. A man comes rushing in from the same door you passed through and stops next to Hermione, his eyes locked on the black wyvern… it’s Bolt! And his face is pale if you ever saw one…<br />
<br />
- You…. You’re the one responsible for this freaking mess? Why? Why are you doing this?! I won’t let you harm Keith, you hear?<br />
<br />
Noivern seems to recognize Bolt. It walks over to the fallen Noibat, picks it up gently in its fangs and growls at Bolt with a mixture of defiance and amusement. Before walking back out through the door it blasted open previously, the creatue surprisingly shares a telepathic message with Bolt, though you can also hear it clearly:<br />
<br />
<i><span style="color: cyan">Your fault.</span></i></span></span><br />
<span style="color: yellow"><span style="font-size: 12px"><br />
It astonishes you that Noivern can use Psychic to communicate, but Bolt doesn’t seem nearly as shocked… just heartbroken.<br />
<br />
- I can’t believe it… Noivern… so I’m the one responsible for this whole damn mess?!<br />
<br />
Bolt drops to his knees and stares blankly at the ground, looking dejected. The once noisy reactor room falls into near complete silence, the only audible sound being the machine’s humming as it continues to provide what little power it can muster.<br />
<br />
What now? Will you talk things over with Bolt, who wasn’t even supposed to be here without backup, or will you rush after Noivern?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: yEllOw"><span style="font-size: 12px">The Weedle had her plan firmly in mind, and started to execute it. First up was the Voodoo Bugaloo- a miniature Electrode doll conjured out of nowhere, and stuck with a pin, stopping the bewildered Electric-type where it stood. It was at this point Keith whispered a warning to Noibat, though the Flying/Dragon-type didn't seem to get the idea. Fortunately, however, the whispering in and of itself made it curious enough to glance around, and it caught sight of Electrode anyhow. With a haphazard flap of its wings, it took flight and landed atop the reactor.<br />
<br />
It was then that Hermione unleashed the second part of her plan- a Blizzard attack. This part, however, didn't go quite as smoothly as the Voodoo Boogaloo did. Oh, it hit Electrode just fine... but it neither knocked it out nor froze it solid. Moreover, Hermione had failed to anticipate the poor Noibat getting caught up in the attack as well. The attack outright knocked Noibat out. Hermione looked down at the floor, embarrassed at such a stupid mistake.<br />
<br />
Keith was about to reassure Hermione that mistakes happen, but before he got the chance, they were interrupted by an incredibly loud explosion of sound, so loud it blasted a door open. And through that door came a large creature, taller than any of them, with a large pair of wings and two speaker-like ears. Keith had only seen one of these before, last year, just before Christmas- this was a Noivern, the evolved form of Noibat. And as it dawned on Keith that Noivern was the evolved form of Noibat, he realized things were about to get even worse- this Noivern was almost certainly acquainted with this Noibat- the Noibat Hermione had accidentally KO'd. This was not good.<br />
<br />
Indeed, Noivern looked outraged upon seeing the unconscious Noibat. To Keith's relief, however, it noticed the Electrode. By way of a greeting, the Flying/Dragon-type unleashed a Boomburst so forceful that Electrode actually exploded upon impact. However, the Noivern seemed dissatisfied with simply this, and seemed to hear the slight sound that was Keith's breathing. Its eyes fell on him and Hermione, and despite the fact that a Weedle didn't seem at first glance any more capable of using Blizzard than an Electrode, it seemed to deem them guilty for the attack on Noibat! Which they basically were, Keith realized, but even though it was an honest mistake, he somehow doubted Noivern was gonna see it that way. The Sound Wave Pokémon arched its head back-<br />
<br />
&quot;Noivern, STOP!!&quot; came a sudden exclamation. There wee hurried footsteps, and a man came running in through the same way Keith had. Keith turned to look, to see the identity of this newcomer, and saw him to be none other than-<br />
<br />
&quot;Bolt?!&quot; Keith and Meowth exclaimed simultaneously.<br />
<br />
Indeed, the man who had gotten Keith's help in the first place was now by his side, addressing the Noivern as if they knew each other, an impression only strengthened by the way Noivern seemed to recognize Bolt. As Bolt insisted he wouldn't let it harm Keith, Noivern simply went to pick up the Noibat in its mouth. Before it left, however, Keith heard the words &quot;Your fault&quot; in his mind- the Noivern seemed capable of telepathic communication. Keith couldn't say this shocked him too much- after all, his Weezing was also able to telepathically communicate with him. Bolt, however, seemed to take the Noivern's words to heart, and sank to his knees, a blank look on his face, as Noivern stomped out of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Should we go afta Noivern?&quot; Meowth asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;First things first, I think we need some answers,&quot; replied Keith, and he turned to Bolt. &quot;Bolt... what the hell is going on? I... How do you know that Noivern? What does it mean, this is your fault?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And why's youse in here witout backup?&quot; Meowth added.</span></span><br />

<span style="color: darkorchid"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>Venom Isle</i></span><br />
<br />
<b><u>Plague Swamp</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>DaveTheFishGuy</u>:</b> Choosing sides between two radical factions is something you definitely want to avoid, finding middle ground to be the best approach in situations like this. The woman in particular sounds so far down the spectrum of natural devotion that it instantly rings a bell in your head to stay the heck away from her; on the other hand, it’s not like the Keeper is any less extreme in his own views, but in his case, there are valid points you can’t help but agree with – to some extent. Besides, you have the impression that, if you want to find out more about what’s <i>really</i> going on with this Island, the ones to ask would be the locals, which further solidifies your decision to chase after the man and his Arbok.<br />
<br />
You and your partners, Nobby and Jason, head South after the Keeper, who is long gone at this point. Although you fear the path ahead, due to how easy it is to get lost in the swamp, you have the distinct impression that even if you fail to find the Keeper, sooner or later, he will find you, especially the closer you are to his settlement.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, the stench around you fluctuates in intensity as you carefully progress through the muddy terrain, with some much-needed breezes of less-stagnant air punctuating your journey and allowing you breathe in just a little deeper. Lakes filled with black or purple liquids bubble on occasion, releasing noxious gases that you try your best to avoid. You keep going and going, fearful that you’ll run into an ambush by famished wild Pokemon – when was the last time <i>anything</i> around these parts had a proper meal? And how tasty would a foreign fisherman such as yourself look to creatures desperate for a solid bite?<br />
<br />
You try to block those thoughts and focus on finding the Keeper, but everywhere you look, everything looks the Arceus-damn same. You’re starting to grow weary of this bleak, lifeless, poisonous hell of a land… why would anyone actively fight to keep it that way, let alone make it <i>grow</i>? Yes, the Healer sounded like a fanatic nutjob, but the Keeper’s goals are equally incomprehensible, if what the woman said about the Isle’s expansion was true. Reason tells you it should be impossible for such a small landmass to make any progress across the vast ocean that surrounds it, but… what if it’s true? How <i>can</i> it be true? Those are some of the answers you hope to get from the Arbok Trainer, but… looks like you won’t be making it to his settlement any time soon.<br />
<br />
You’re forced to stop when you come across an unexpected obstacle – in front of you, extending for miles both to your life and your right, runs a wide river of some unrecognizable purple liquid, which might one day have been water. No plantlife whatsoever, dried or otherwise, lines its margins, indicating the substance is probably highly toxic. And while you wreck your brain trying to think of a way to make it across to progress further South, something emerging <i>from</i> the river forces you to postpone whatever plans you were formulating…<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: DarkOrchid"><span style="font-size: 12px">The brief interlude with the Grimer and the locals had allowed him some rest, at least. Dave could now trudge through the mire of the swamp a little easier, his muscles used to the force needed to pull his feet free after every single step. Jason easily hopped from patch of earth to muddy bank, while the ground proved no hindrance at all to Nobby, who could easily levitate above the poisonous muck. The squelching sound of each footstep was all that punctuated the deathly-silent swamp.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, the air proved a little easier to breathe the further he went. With any luck, he was getting close to the coast - the promise of a lungful of fresh sea air was a good motivator. On and on he went, skirting poisonous pools, struggling to keep himself upright as his feet fought for purchase on the slippery ground. With one of his companions so stoic, and the other more suited to comedy than conversation, he was mostly alone with his thoughts. Even though he'd decided to see the Keeper first, the young man's words still troubled him. The growth of this island should be impossible, and he'd rather not see it pollute the surrounding ocean... maybe he was just arguing for the island to remain as it is now? Only one way to find out.<br />
<br />
Even to one who practically grew up in a wetland, this place was starting to look all the same. He could navigate the Great Marsh blindfolded, but everything was starting to blend together. Dead tree after dead tree, pile of sludge after pile of sludge... but something eventually loomed out of the muck. A river. But like no river he'd ever seen. Rather than clear, life-bringing water rushing past, it was foul, poisonous gunge oozing along. This caused him to stop - he'd managed to nearly blunder straight into the bank of the stream, and it seemed to go for miles either way. His fingers played at his belt, dancing along his other PokéBalls - he surely had something that could help him cross the foulness, or it'd be a long walk along the bank.<br />
<br />
Before he could travel further down that train of thought, he froze, staring at the slime as bits of it peeled off from the main channel. He took a step back as the mass shifted, reformed, reared up... to reveal a familiar form. It was like the ones he and his team had recently seen off, but bigger, and angrier. Muk, the evolved form of Grimer. Jason hopped in front of him, taking up a defensive position between the newcomer and his trainer, while Nobby floated into line as well. As Dave watched, more gunge bubbled up behind the large creature - revealing the pair of Grimer they'd come across earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;...well, looks like it's Round 2. Only it seems like they've got backup.&quot; he muttered, eliciting a nod from both his partners. &quot;Guess we should even things up to match.&quot; With that, the fisherman produced another PokéBall from his belt, enlarging it before dropping it to the floor. The orb split, disgorging white light into a small form before the human, capped with a large, ovoid head. As the shape solidified, it was clearly amphibian, like Jason, but a more primitive, larval stage. The Wooper's tail swayed from side to side, the critter letting out a happy squeak, before noticing the foes bearing down on him. It made sense - the little guy was a perpetual optimist, even in the most dire of circumstances. He knew that most Poison-types didn't stand a chance here, but Wooper were known to sweat a toxic compound through their skin - hopefully that would buy him some protection.<br />
<br />
&quot;Twoflower, we need some help here.&quot; he said, the little axolotl nodding as he narrowed his eyes. The Water-type may be on the small side, but he'd recently been undergoing some pretty intense training - he was much stronger than he looked. &quot;Light the Muk up - <b>Eerie Impulse</b>. Then smash it with <b>Earth Power</b>.&quot; Twoflower nodded, before sparking with, strangely, electrical energy. &quot;Nobby, take the Grimer on the right - <b>Psybeam</b>, then nail it with <b>Shadow Ball</b>. Jason, hit the one on the left - slow it with <b>Icy Wind</b>, then use a <b>Shadow Ball</b> of your own.&quot; His two Poisonous Pokémon nodded, preparing their own attacks as the trainer grit his teeth.<br />
<br />
Talk about being thrown in at the deep end...</span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="color: silver"><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> Dana stares a Leo for a while in complete silence. Oscar walks over to you and places a hand on your shoulder.<br />
<br />
- She was in her twenties when she picked up a young Growlithe just like that from an Adoption Centre. It grew to became her closest friend and the Arcanine that won her so many Contests… give her a quick moment to reminisce, then we’ll get going. Thank you for entrusting me with your Meowth dear, I will work with it to the best of my few remaining abilities.<br />
<br />
Snub, meanwhile, nods at your request to pick up Fennekin’s scent – something he’d already done but obviously lost track of once you exited through the prison level. No doubt Red Skull went to Layard’s office with the deceased guard’s fox, and scent or no scent, that’s the only destination you have left.<br />
<br />
Dana finally drops to one knee, pets Leo behind the ear and looks over to you with ice-cold determination.<br />
<br />
- I’m ready. Let’s meet Layard.<br />
<br />
The three of you make your way over to the elevator, followed by Snub, Meow and Leo. Oscar, Dana and yourself remain in silence as you press the button to the final floor and begin making your way up, each of you lost in your respective thoughts. You’re walking straight into the lion’s den… but what other choice do you have? Confronting Layard, Red Skull and their corrupt administration is the only way to bring peace to Contest lovers and allow the sport to flourish again, unimpeded by the shallow laws of economy and profit.<br />
<br />
After what feels like an hour, the actually-short ride comes to a conclusion. The elevator stops, the door slides open… and you find yourselves in a very small hallway, though tastefully decorated, and with only a single door on the opposite wall. Taking a deep breath, you exchange a glance with Dana and Oscar for reassurance, then turn the handle and push the door open, walking inside.<br />
<br />
- Took you long enough, Liza.<br />
<br />
That voice. That bone-chilling, rage-inducing voice… Vice President Layard.<br />
<br />
The office is surprisingly wide and spacious, even with the large round table at the far end of it, where you assume Layard holds his meetings. The man himself sits on a white couch facing a large window overlooking Salin City, his back turned to you. Next to him on another couch, but facing you straight ahead, is Red Skull with her nauseating grin…<br />
<br />
- Look at that. The fossils came along! Smart of you to invite them in, boss.<br />
<br />
Layard slowly gets up from his couch, turns to you and frowns.<br />
<br />
- I didn’t. But I’d be lying if I said I’m not pleased to see you… Dana.<br />
<br />
The elder does not respond, but she doesn’t blink once as she returns Layard’s stare. After a long couple of minutes of unspoken tension, the Vice President lets out a chuckle and walks over to the desk at the end of the office. It’s not until he does that you notice a third person standing in the shadows , leaning against the far wall with his arms crossed and his usual handsome smile… Whisper, the man who tricked you earlier by leading you straight to Layard in that warehouse. He doesn’t say a word but winks teasingly at you, further aggravating your already bitter state of mind.<br />
<br />
- I don’t think there’s much room for idle conversations at this point. You all know where I stand, and I know what you all came after. So… any offers?<br />
<br />
Layard sits at the meeting table, as you assume he often does when handling his shady businesses. He doesn’t seem eager to engage in an all-out brawl, at least not yet, but keeping your emotions in check with all your enemies standing right in front of you proves a difficult task…<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: silver">In the elevator, as the trio and their Pokémon partners patiently waited in agonizing silence...Liza figured now was the only chance she would get to make sure her Pokémon were ready for the most important fight of their lives.<br />
<br />
Liza retrieved a number of items from her bag, among them, <a href="https://forums.bulbagarden.net/index.php?threads/cable-club.21796/page-2#post-5912848" class="link link--internal" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.bulbagarden.net%2Findex.php%3Fthreads%2Fcable-club.21796%2Fpage-2%23post-5912848&amp;hash=9b251abf2789b124168e1148bcceca8d" rel="nofollow noopener">5 Sweet Hearts</a> candies. Which she feed (3) to her Meowth, in order for him to recover from the super effective fighting type move Pinsir struck him with, and feed the remaining (2) to her Growlithe, who was still nursing his wounds from the Ice battle he endured fighting against the horde of Vanillite and their leader, Cryogonal.<br />
<br />
The Lass kneeled down and untied Meow's Green Contest Scarf, replacing it with a Silk Scarf instead. Gave a Polkadot Bow to her Snubbull and finally, gave her Growlithe a Dragon Gem, the Coordinator had managed to squeeze from the <a href="https://forums.bulbagarden.net/index.php?threads/all-i-want-for-christmas-is.213642/#post-5735859" class="link link--internal" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.bulbagarden.net%2Findex.php%3Fthreads%2Fall-i-want-for-christmas-is.213642%2F%23post-5735859&amp;hash=7ac19f4f86a0c4d08abda2d30a24bbc9" rel="nofollow noopener">Dragonair Plush</a> last Christmas. (Pocketing the x3 Royal Gummis that also fell out.)<br />
<br />
Liza had Audino, in her Pokéball, as a soft-reserve in case things <i>really</i> went south and was hoping to keep her from harms way, incase the trainer needed the Nurse Pokémon as a healer if the situation called for it. <br />
<br />
The Lass quickly stood up once she was satisfied with what little she could do and breathed in a few puffs of air to prepare herself for what's to come. She tried remaining composed...counting the number of Pokémon she had on hand with her. There was her Snubbull, Growlithe, Meowth and Audino...Charizard was taken and while her Litwick was being taken care of by the Nurse Joy in the city's Pokemon Center, the Lass remembered that she had indeed picked up an extra Pokémon before leaving the structure...<br />
<br />
*Just before Liza left the Pokémon Center heading towards the abandon warehouse, Liza stopped by a PC in the lobby. Leaving Litwick in the care of Nurse Joy, Liza felt uneasy about carrying only 5 Pokémon with her. It felt a little like a disadvantage. So, she requested a Pokéball, of a Pokémon of which she figured would be quite poetic if she could use against the people that had banned Contests from Slain City, her Siren Queen, Milotic- Boa.*<br />
<br />
The elevator stopped, and the trio walked down the hall. Liza looked at both elders, assuring that they were ready, before proceeding. <br />
<br />
Liza marched forward inside the spacious room that belonged to the monster that had caused so much pain and suffering to many Coordinators and their Pokémon.<br />
<br />
The expression on Layard’s face when he heard Dana had returned- his reaction and the hint of confusion in his voice, it all gave Liza a clear answer, 'He wasn't the one that sent the letter to the elderly couple.'<br />
<br />
Red Skull thought the Boss had sent for them, so it couldn't have been her and Whisper- he could be capable of orchestrating the meet up...but why would he? Wouldn't that go against what his Boss wanted? There was also a possibility Liza didn't take into account. The Black Van? Did it really belong to the administration? Did Whisper just jump off the black vehicle to pretend he wasn't connected, to gather Liza's trust? Or could it have been a different group all together that tried warning her not to pursue this?<br />
<br />
Speculating wouldn't do her any good, not when they had gotten this far...not when they were right in front of their enemy.<br />
<br />
&quot;You might think you're smart Laylard, I know exactly what you want. You want the Key Stone I carry, in exchange you'll offer up the leverage you have remaining, which are 3 if I'm correct- Dana's Arcanine, my Charizard and the guard's Fennekin!&quot; Liza paused for a second, reminding herself of the vow she made to the dying man, before continuing, &quot;But I don't trust you, and even if I were to agree to some form of trade off, we wouldn't make it back to the elevator before <i>something</i> were to happen to us. Accidents happen, right?&quot; Liza gritted her teeth, reminded of the motionless bodies of Pokémon that flashed in her mind, &quot;So, here's my proposal. You give us our Pokémon back and you pass a law allowing for Contests to return in Salin, as an alternative to battle like it does in many parts of the globe already. You'll step down from office, you'll all serve your time in prison for the crimes you've all committed and, we won't mess you up so bad that not even Arceus will recognize you.&quot; Liza had a feeling that her bold statement would cause some laughter among Layard, Whisper and Red Skull. But their opinions didn't matter to her. She knew what these people were capable of, but they didn't know what kind of hell she could bring down on them. &quot;Anything you got to say, Layard?&quot;<br />

<b><u>Icy Cavern</u></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Raves</u>:</b> It would have been easy to give in to the Trainer’s instinct and engage the foes. After all, Nothung is adept at both Fire and Fighting – a combination that easily lays waste to most Ice Pokemon. But you also know better than to fight outnumbered in a terrain that heavily favors the larger army, so instead you opt to try and reason with the angry polar bear – and when reasoning with an angry polar bear is your best option, you know you’re in some really deep s…now.<br />
<br />
Beartic growls the whole time while you plead your case, his eyes glistening with rage at the mention of the empty cradle. Clearly you’ve hit another nerve… but the fact he doesn’t behead you right here and now means you must’ve approached the subjected with enough tact that he at least hears you out until the end.<br />
<br />
The bear places a massive claw on the ice cradle, going from angry to deeply sad in a matter of moments. He then looks over to the opening behind him, the tunnel you intended to head towards unnoticed – which is kind of off the table at this point – and then picks something up from behind the cradle: a piece of cloth?<br />
<br />
One of the Froslass hovers over to the Beartic, bows and retrieves the fabric from his hand, then floats over to you and extends the rag as it chants something. Understanding it wants you to have it, you receive the item from the Ghost and inspect it a bit more carefully: it’s a torn piece of cloth indeed, the fabric not very different from that of your own coat, and stained with blood. This belongs to another human, someone who passed here before you did – only that someone probably didn’t do such a good job at reasoning with Beartic and ended up being attacked, leaving only this rag behind… Could it be the one responsible for the cub’s disappearance?<br />
<br />
Beartic looks at you pleadingly for the briefest of moments, a split-second sight of frailty, before returning to its menacing self. He curls himself around the empty cradle once more, but doesn’t fall back asleep, instead seeming lost in memories…<br />
<br />
Well, what will you do now? Any ideas on how to help Beartic?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: lightblue">The Beartic, while enraged, made no efforts to stop Alex from making his case, while Nothung remained as he was, still surrounded by icy lances. With his idea that the Tundra pokemon was waiting for him to act, he felt that his hunch on the situation was correct, and the bear was not a fan of people, but willing to hear him out. Even as the eyes glistened with rage on mention of the cradle, and as he finished he wondered if said ice type would crush him where he stood, shivering.<br />
<br />
Then the Beartic turned to the cradle, placing his claw on it and going from anger to sadness in moments, before looking at the opening Alex had planned to head for after the torch, before picking up some sort of object, which on second glance appeared to be cloth of some sort. Handing it to one of the Froslass, the ghost chanting before extending the fabric and proferring it to him.<br />
<br />
Looking at the cloth answered several questions: the cloth was not unlike his coat, some sort of cotton and hide, and with dark patches that quickly became clear to him as blood, which meant one clear thing. He wasn't alone down here, and the owner of said bloodied rag must have had an altercation with the Beartic, and most certainly links to the missing infant, if not responsibility. Looking back at the Beartic, he could see only for the briefest of moments pleading, sign of defeat, before it returned to its usual menacing demeanour, curling around the cradle, lost in memories.<br />
<br />
Alex held the cloth in hand, studying it. The blood had likely dried up with the extreme cold, but it was a start. He knew the owner was bound to be human, though what reason they had to potentially kidnap a Cubchoo was beyond his understanding, and rather foolish, given that Glacier Island was home to several groups of the bears in the wild. No, there was some ulterior motive behind this disappearance, and he felt, given the intrusion to Beartic's home, he had to at least solve this and help the ursine pokemon out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think-k-k we had best invessss-t-t-tigate this, Nothung...see if we can't find the b-b-big guy's child.&quot; Turning to the Froslass, he nodded. &quot;We'll f-f-find the missing cub and p-p-punish the one who took them...if-f-f you could l-l-let my Infernape go..&quot; motining to the ice shards still primed on the chimp. He would be heading for the passage Beartic had lookd at, as that seemed to be where this mysterious figure had arrived from, and given his best lead was a bloodied rag, this appeared to be the best choice. Looking at the Beartic once more, he closed his eyes and sighed. He knew how hard it was to lose loved ones.</span><br />

<span style="color: silver"><span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u> Electric Blue Eye</u>:</b> Luther smiles at your questions.<br />
<br />
- If I knew who the enemy was, I would hardly allow myself to indulge Gottfried by wasting time with this battle. Since I do not, I hope to lure him or her out overtime. And that is precisely where my interest in you stems from: I still cannot say for sure you had nothing to do with Trevor’s assault, but I can tell you’re an essential piece of this puzzle and… I believe you’re innocent. What I’m curious to know is what role you do play in this entire story.<br />
<br />
Chris sees Zoroark sharpening its claws against one another and takes the opportunity to power up as well: he tenses his muscles as he coils his body, like a serpent ready to strike. But When Luther’s Dark-Type closes distance, moving forward in a complicated pattern, Chris instead goes on the defensive – the emerald Protect shield proving the perfect defense against the otherwise-unavoidable Aerial Ace! Zoroark’s claws collide with the barrier and the fox-like Pokemon is pushed back successfully, upon which Chris is quick to capitalize by wrapping two vines around the Dark-Type and squeezing as hard as he can!<br />
<br />
If Luther is in any way troubled by this turn of events, he doesn’t show it. In fact, he doesn’t show much interest in the battle at all – it turns out the older man is looking at the stands, rather than the arena, as if intrigued by something in the audience… But he soon shifts his attention back to the ongoing match, and snaps his fingers as if to signal for something. Zoroark, up until then wincing in pain from the constricting Wring Out, shifts its expression to a knowing grin, and howling loudly, unleashes a spiralling wave of pure darkness expands outwards in a circular pattern from the Dark-Type’s position, the <b>Night Daze</b> swiping the entire arena in a show of dancing shadows until it catches Chris in the blast radius and washes over the Grass-Type, causing him intense pain and forcing him to release the hold!<br />
<br />
- That was a nice way of avoiding our melee strike, but Zoroark excels at fighting from a distance. Here, witness the extent of…<br />
<br />
Luther stops mid-sentence, his attention once more drawn to the stands, his usual smile being replaced by a worried expression uncharacteristic of the man, even if you’ve known him for only a short amount of time.<br />
<br />
Without its Trainer to provide instructions, Zoroark looks temporarily puzzled even if it just gained an upper hand over Chris. Will you try to capitalize on Luther’s distraction to get the win, or refrain from taking advantage of the situation?</span></span>

<span style="color: silver"><i>Why is it every time I face a Gym Leader, I start to doubt my abilities?</i> Ethan pondered.<br />
<br />
Though he had proven to know a great deal about Pokémon, countering his foes and coming out with a few hat tricks of his own. It still didn't feel like it was enough to make him stand out among the crowd. <br />
<br />
Strength and power were something Ethan craved ever since that fatal night. Not being able to protect the ones you love can do that to a person. Recent events were bothering him as well. If a Gym Leader could get ambushed and so many of them were secretly concerned about the tournament...what chance did he have to uncover this mystery?<br />
<br />
The young man's attention was soon brought back by the time Zoroark's Aerial Ace met his Snivy's Protect and after hearing everything Luther had to say, the ex-thief wondered even more what sort of motivation the Dark Type Specialist had in luring the culprit out. <br />
<br />
After the round was over, Luther got distracted for a second time. Chris rushed forward to capitalize on its opponents inability to receive orders, but before the grass starter reached the illusion Pokémon, he was stopped by his own trainer's refusal to order anything either.<br />
<br />
Chris turned around with a questionable stare. <i>Wouldn't this have been the perfect opportunity to gain an upper hand against their opponents in battle? Especially after the trick they pulled on them? Didn't Ethan want to win this battle? Didn't he want redemption!?</i> <br />
<br />
Ethan continued to remain silent, his eyes focused on the peculiar way Luther had been acting a few seconds ago.<br />
<br />
The trainer didn't know much about Luther, but if the Gym Leader didn't want to have any part in the tournament and only decided to play along to draw out the enemy, then that meant Luther's attention was grabbed by something worth observing. Or more accurately 'someone' that might've been acting out of the ordinary?<br />
<br />
If there was someone watching them, stopping the match so abruptly could've tipped them off. At least to the crowd, they might've just perceived this as two foes merely sizing each other up before they inevitably clashed. So, for the sake of keeping their cover, Ethan decided in the end, he had to go on the attack! Even if it meant fighting a foe that wasn't giving them, their one hundred percent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chris, let's finish this! Squeeze Zoroark with your <b>Vine Whip</b>, <b>Cut</b> it down to size with your <b>Leaf Blade</b>!&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>So Luther, what is it that's got you in such a serious mood all of a sudden?</i></span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u> Electric Blue Eye</u>:</b> Stopping now would only draw attention to an issue everyone prefers to keep under wraps. Trevor’s assault is being handled backstage, and already too much of the incident has been brought to public at the end of your match with Sean… acting suspiciously now will only make things worse for you, you reason. Still, something is definitely amiss for Luther to simply shut himself off from the match like that…<br />
<br />
Chris doesn’t much care for the Trainer’s motives – his target is right there, and he’s more than eager to capitalize on the opening, which means your next orders are right up his alley! With gusto, he lets loose twin vines that wrap around Zoroark, keeping the larger foe in place; then, the snake-like Grass-Type bolts forward and slashes away at the immobilized foe, with grace and precision that would have made Sean’s Dewott proud!<br />
<br />
Zoroark cries out in pain and drops to one knee, panting heavily, and breaking Luther from his reverie. Seeing what transpired while he was distracted, the Dark-Type expert maintains a stern expression, though not outwardly criticizing of your decision to keep fighting.<br />
<br />
- Not the noblest of calls, but a necessary one from your perspective, I’m sure.<br />
<br />
He then lowers hi voice, hoping nobody else but you can hear him.<br />
<br />
- Gottfried seems to be feeling unwell. He looked pale since our match started, and has just now left his seat at the balcony. This is, to my recollection, the first time our Champion has fallen ill… and I find it hard to dismiss it as coincidence. His closest friend and guardian, Drago, accompanied him to the back, and I see at least Johan, Pietro and Sean have done the same. The other Leaders remain on their seats. So…<br />
<br />
He looks over to his damaged Zoroark, then back to you, his earlier easy smile yet to return.<br />
<br />
- I don’t know about you, but I would very much like to make haste. If we keep fighting, your Snivy will no doubt incapacitate my Zoroark, claim victory and earn a considerable amount of experience. But I will lose a valuable ally should I need to confront anyone backstage. I leave the choice to you: we either stop this match now and hurry over to Gottfried, or we keep battling and let Drago, Johan, Pietro and Sean handle things in the back with our sick Champion, competent as they all are. I know which choice I prefer, but the challenger has the final say. I am but a tool to this crowd’s diversion, and a stepping stone to an aspiring Ace Trainer such as yourself.<br />
<br />
Calm and collected as always, Luther doesn’t seem like he’ll do anything to oppose you, whichever choice you make. But you do need to make one, and you’d best do it fast, because the fans in attendance are growing restless with the lack of action…</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> Layard hears you out without blinking, maintaining a stern, unreadable expression throughout. You assume it’s a necessary trait for someone who’s made a living off of politics, cutting deals and making arrangements. If he is in any way upset with your tirade, or even amused, he doesn’t convey it in the slightest until you’re done talking. When you do, he brings a hand to his face and massages his temples, as if plagued by an annoying migraine.<br />
<br />
- You… you really do have no business sense whatsoever. I expected nothing more of a child, admittedly, but I assume by your aging companions’ silence that this is a stance you all share. <i>That</i>, I find disappointing. – he answers, staring not at you, but at Dana. – Still, you would be wrong in your guess, partly at least.<br />
<br />
He stands up, realizing you aren’t willing to sit down at the negotiations table, and begins pacing around the room.<br />
<br />
- Yes, I do want that Key Stone of yours. But you’re mistaken as far as what I have to offer in compensation. Unfortunately, neither this remarkable Charizard nor Dana’s former Arcanine are negotiable, and Fennekin was really just a bait; I don’t intend to part with it either. But I have something infinitely more valuable to offer in return for your Key Stone, just to prove how generous I truly am: freedom, and written pardon of all your crimes committed against the Government – a luxury I cannot afford Dana, I fear. Before you rethink your counter-offer, and I strongly suggest you do so, let me explain to you why this deal is important to me. To Cascadia.<br />
<br />
He tries his best to sound serious, as if he was dealing with a business partner on equal footing, but something about the excessive formality makes you certain he’s dying of laughter on the inside, playing with you, treating you like the adult he doesn’t think of you as.<br />
<br />
- I needed Dana, I had to draw her out. That was the only thing I really expected to gain out of this whole game. That nabbing you in that warehouse Whisper led you to would force her to come out of hiding, and I was entirely successful on that account, even if I never expected her to walk right through my front door. Coming across your Charizard, dear Liza… let’s call that collateral damage. For you, anyway; for me, I call it a bonus. When I had my men rummage through your belongings, once I tossed you in that cell, I never expected to find such a powerful creature… one carrying a Mega Stone, no less. The prison guard begged me not to take it… but he was easily silenced when I reminded him what I could do to his Fennekin.<br />
<br />
Only then does he break a wicked smile, something you know he’s been dying to do from the beginning.<br />
<br />
- It will make a fine addition for the Government’s defense force. This one, I’ll keep to myself… but as luck would have it, it’s a female. I will let <i>every single one</i> of Salin P.D.’s compatible male Pokemon have a go at her, and soon we will be equipped with an army of top-pedigree Charizard. So as you can see, this is for the betterment of the community, and I’m sure you wouldn’t oppose that. Now, Dana! As for your Arcanine, you’ll be pleased to see for yourself how I’ve managed to open its eyes. It’s been under my care for long enough to see things how they <i>really</i> are – which is, that powerful creatures like itself should be using their strength the proper way, not performing to please a handful of onlookers. Here, see for yourself.<br />
<br />
Layard reaches for the inside of his suit and tosses a Premier Ball to the carpeted floor. The device snaps open and a large hound materializes in front of the Vice President… but the sight you’re met with doesn’t elicit the usual awe of beholding a majestic Arcanine. The creature is larger, more muscled than the usual specimen, its fur has lost all its luster, its mane doesn’t glisten. The beast’s eyes are glazed over, empty, devoid of any visible emotion. This is a broken Pokemon, forcefully raised to excel in combat and nothing else. Its mind has caved, all memories of its past life either erased completely or buried so deep under a pile of traumatic experiences that they are probably inaccessible all the same.<br />
<br />
- I’ve kept it as my personal bodyguard and companion ever since I acquired it. It has sat alongside me and witnessed the crumbling of the Contest scene from the beginning. I’ve turned it into a <i>proper</i> warrior, though not without considerable effort. All worth it, in the end. Now that I’ve explained my point of view, I’m hoping we can renegotiate the terms of our little business conversation... My offer: the Key Stone in exchange for your guaranteed safety. My insurance: the promise you’ll never walk out of this office should you refuse.<br />
<br />
Red Skull steps forward, grinning maliciously, and calls out her Pinsir a second time, the blood on its horns having dried out by now, coating them crimson. It stands next to Arcanine and beats its chest in defiance, as Layard concludes his speech.<br />
<br />
- Please understand. Or don’t. It really doesn’t matter either way.</span><br />

<br />
You see him clenching his fists as he speaks, his knuckles going white. It’s possible this decision will cost him his job down the line, but something tells you he isn’t the least bit concerned about that at the moment…<br />
<br />
- Yeah, all this crap is my fault. This whole freakin’ mess… but I didn’t realize it ‘til now. ‘Til I saw her…<br />
<br />
<i>The Noivern</i>, you quickly guess.<br />
<br />
- I had a Noibat a long time ago, back when I started doin’ this gig. Was the first Pokemon I ever had; I ain’t no Trainer, but I ran into the little thing in the middle of a job, y’know? We clicked. Even went out and bought her a bunch of TMs… I didn’t start out at the big fancy power plants, mind you… the odd job here and there, fixing power outages in smaller villages and stuff; I met her in an abandoned shack some guy wanted restored in Camphrier Town, when I went in to check the wiring. Noibat came along with me in every assignment since then, and every single damn time she’d come out of her Pokeball and destroy any cable she could find. She took a liking to the tingling sensation of the electric current as she chewed away, and everything going dark after her tampering was always a plus. I could never educate her to behave otherwise, no matter how hard I tried…<br />
<br />
He stops briefly, reminiscing and, as you can tell, fighting back tears.<br />
<br />
- I got fired three times because of that, once in Kalos and twice in Johto. When I decided to come here to Cascadia, I had to make another choice – I couldn’t let any more pay days go out the window. Once I got to Salin, I… dropped her off at the Adoption Centre. She didn’t take lightly to that, y’know? Stormed out of the building in a fit as soon as she realized what I was tryin’ to do. Never saw her again for five whole years… never got fired again. Until today, probably. But I can tell it’s her, y’know? Even after turning into that huge monster… Can’t explain how, I just know. And she’s still holding a grudge… She’s doing this deliberately, I can tell! And she’s even teaching her own child how to do it, to make sure I’ll never be able to fix anything.<br />
<br />
He takes a deep breath and looks at his own hands in disbelief.<br />
<br />
- Salin City… hell, most of Brine Island is about to run out of power, and it’s my fault. Noivern has it out for me, and out for you too probably, now that you knocked out her offspring… This is too much for us man. We should split, wait for back up. This entire facility is Noivern’s playground now, and I ran into a bunch of Golbat and Electrode on the way here that I’m sure are under her command…<br />
<br />
Bolt presents you with an opportunity to leave and wait for support rather than take on the heavily unfavourable odds ahead. It could be that deep down, he doesn’t want to be forced to confront his old Pokemon… or harm her if it comes to that. Either way, it’s evident Bolt hasn’t come to terms with Noivern’s abandonment. But now you know what you’re up against, for the first time since you entered the Power Plant…<br />
<br />
Will you accept Bolt’s request, or do things your own way?</span></span><br />

<b><u>Icy Cavern</u></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Raves</u>:</b> The Beartic breathes heavily, ice crystals escaping its mouth and nostrils as it does. It remains curled around the empty cradle, but raises one of its massive clawed hands. Immediately, the Ice Shards vanish and so do the Froslass… It seems the King’s Rock-wearing Beartic is allowing you permission to leave, though probably holding you to the promise of finding its stolen cub. Perhaps it’s wiser not to refuse its self-beneficial benevolence by retreating to whence you came…<br />
<br />
Bloodied cloth in-hand, you walk through the opening behind the grieving bear, the only other place where the kidnapper might have headed. The tunnel feels colder than the Beartic’s cave, which is easily explained by the absence of Litwick to provide light and heat outside the chamber. Still, Nothung’s flame provides enough clarity not only for you to move forward, but to spot the occasional trail of blood on the tunnel wall – the perpetrator must have passed through here, still bleeding, and leaned against the wall from time to time to rest. Everything indicates the kidnapper might be in bad shape, which hopefully means he won’t be hard to catch up to!<br />
<br />
It’s funny how a man with a purpose moves so much quicker and endures hardship so much better. Before you had a target to aim for, the unbearable cold of the iceberg maze threatened to make short work of you. But now that you’re roaming the labyrinth seeking a poacher, the atmospheric conditions seem to matter a lot less, as you find yourself moving swiftly and with newfound determination, aware that you just escaped from a dire predicament on the back of a promise. Beartic spared you in exchange for the safe return of its child, and you’re in too deep to back out now. So onwards you go, tracking the blood on the frozen walls…<br />
<br />
The tunnel leads to another opening, but something’s strange about this one: even before you reach the end of the path, the echoing cries of what sounds like blowing winds reaches your ears. And when you do make it to the hole on the wall, everything becomes clear: you’ve just reached another cave, almost as wide as a football field (making you wonder just how vast this iceberg really is), with a literal hailstorm raging within! Ice crystals spin and dance in the gale, bouncing off or shattering against the cave walls and ceiling. The second you step foot in the room, it pelts your skin making you wince in pain; Nothung growls in annoyance as well, growing obviously tired of this terrible weather.<br />
<br />
Then, you hear a roar amidst the hailstorm.<br />
<br />
A cavalcade of footsteps ensues, and as if shrouded in a <i>Cloak</i> of <i>Snow]</i>, a massive brown creature suddenly leaps forward and slams against Nothung, driving him into the icy wall with such force that the ape is partially stuck in the resulting crater!<br />
<br />
When the assailant steps back, huffing and snorting, you can finally make out the outline of the Pokemon in question – a large, angry

<b><u>Plague Swamp</u></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>DaveTheFishGuy</u>:</b> Things have just taken a turn for the worst, however unlikely you thought it possible. The Grimer you’d clashed with previously have now resurfaced, bringing a much bigger threat along… a massive Muk with evil intent in its eyes!<br />
<br />
Realizing you need to bring out back-up to even the odds – or at least, tilt the scales ever-so-slightly in an environment that heavily favors the opposition – you call out Twoflower, a Water-Type who should be more at ease in this marshy landscape than most other non-Poison Pokemon. You wonder if your trio of Croagunk, Wooper and Koffing can stand up to the native foes, especially the angry-looking, fully-evolved Muk who couldn’t be more at home than this…<br />
<br />
Making the first move seems like the only viable strategy; waiting around for your opponents to move first would be granting them an even greater advantage, and this is no ordinary Pokemon battle to begin with – if anything, it’s a game of cat and mouse where you are most definitely the latter, as the sludge trio will no doubt have plans for you and your partners if they overwhelm you…<br />
<br />
Your team’s attacks fly off almost simultaneously: a multitude of electric shockwaves that causes Muk visible discomfort, tampering with its offensive abilities; a beam of psychic energy that washes over one of the Grimer, causing it to shriek in pain; and a powerful breeze of chilling air that is visibly painful to the other Grimer, slowing it down as it gooey body hardens from the intense cold.<br />
<br />
The Poison-type trio seems staggered by your aggressive approach, and don’t seem ready to make a move, giving your team an opportunity to keep going into the next set of orders! Twoflower summons earthen spires from the depths of the swamp, Nobby hurls a mass of shadows and Jason does the same… but just as the attacks are about to hit, the three foes suddenly liquefy and vanish in the swampy ground! Your team’s moves keep going, finding no mark to hit, now that the venomous tricksters have dissolved into the very environment, using an attack you only later perceive as such: Acid Armor!<br />
<br />
The Wooper, Croagunk and Koffing look around in obvious concern. But there’s nothing they can do when the toxic pools around them start to swirl, coalesce and give rise to a <i>massive</i> Wave of Sludge, which engulfs and traps your team in filthy mud, covering them up like a moving mass of poisonous quicksand!<br />
<br />
It is then that the Muk and two Grimer solidify, and with wicked grins of their faces, begin to slither ominously towards your struggling partners. Their combined efforts, along with the advantageous terrain, allowed them to create a joint Sludge Wave that has rendered your team rather helpless for the moment, stuck from the waist down (or in Nobby’s case, the lower half of his strange little round body)… is this how they always hunt for prey?<br />
<br />
Quick, what now?!</span> </span><br />

I had to check up on you… besides, I was tired of waiting around for some damn nerds in suits to come and “assess the situation”!<br />
<br />
You see him clenching his fists as he speaks, his knuckles going white. It’s possible this decision will cost him his job down the line, but something tells you he isn’t the least bit concerned about that at the moment…<br />
<br />
- Yeah, all this crap is my fault. This whole freakin’ mess… but I didn’t realize it ‘til now. ‘Til I saw her…<br />
<br />
<i>The Noivern</i>, you quickly guess.<br />
<br />
- I had a Noibat a long time ago, back when I started doin’ this gig. Was the first Pokemon I ever had; I ain’t no Trainer, but I ran into the little thing in the middle of a job, y’know? We clicked. Even went out and bought her a bunch of TMs… I didn’t start out at the big fancy power plants, mind you… the odd job here and there, fixing power outages in smaller villages and stuff; I met her in an abandoned shack some guy wanted restored in Camphrier Town, when I went in to check the wiring. Noibat came along with me in every assignment since then, and every single damn time she’d come out of her Pokeball and destroy any cable she could find. She took a liking to the tingling sensation of the electric current as she chewed away, and everything going dark after her tampering was always a plus. I could never educate her to behave otherwise, no matter how hard I tried…<br />
<br />
He stops briefly, reminiscing and, as you can tell, fighting back tears.<br />
<br />
- I got fired three times because of that, once in Kalos and twice in Johto. When I decided to come here to Cascadia, I had to make another choice – I couldn’t let any more pay days go out the window. Once I got to Salin, I… dropped her off at the Adoption Centre. She didn’t take lightly to that, y’know? Stormed out of the building in a fit as soon as she realized what I was tryin’ to do. Never saw her again for five whole years… never got fired again. Until today, probably. But I can tell it’s her, y’know? Even after turning into that huge monster… Can’t explain how, I just know. And she’s still holding a grudge… She’s doing this deliberately, I can tell! And she’s even teaching her own child how to do it, to make sure I’ll never be able to fix anything.<br />
<br />
He takes a deep breath and looks at his own hands in disbelief.<br />
<br />
- Salin City… hell, most of Brine Island is about to run out of power, and it’s my fault. Noivern has it out for me, and out for you too probably, now that you knocked out her offspring… This is too much for us man. We should split, wait for back up. This entire facility is Noivern’s playground now, and I ran into a bunch of Golbat and Electrode on the way here that I’m sure are under her command…<br />
<br />
Bolt presents you with an opportunity to leave and wait for support rather than take on the heavily unfavourable odds ahead. It could be that deep down, he doesn’t want to be forced to confront his old Pokemon… or harm her if it comes to that. Either way, it’s evident Bolt hasn’t come to terms with Noivern’s abandonment. But now you know what you’re up against, for the first time since you entered the Power Plant…<br />
<br />
Will you accept Bolt’s request, or do things your own way?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: yellow"><span style="font-size: 12px">Keith listened as Bolt explained- he had come to check up on Keith, partly out of boredom just waiting around, but mostly out of concern that Keith might have died, he was taking that long. Much as Keith was certain his rash decision would cost him his job, it wasn't hard to tell that he didn't give a Raticate's ass about that at the moment.<br />
<br />
Bolt went on to explain about the Noivern. He used to have a Noibat way back when. He wasn't a Trainer by any means, but they met one day and just clicked. Another example of the bond between human and Pokémon. Only problem was, Noibat had a penchant for chewing on electric cables, which proved rather problematic, considering Bolt's profession of choice. Noibat got him fired multiple times, and once he came out to the Fizzytopia region to work in the Cascadia archipelago, he dropped Noibat off at the Adoption Center. Keith had a general idea as to where the story went from there, and sure enough, Noibat didn't take the perceived abandonment well, to say the least. Noibat flew from the building in a rage as soon as she realized what was happening, and for five years, he never saw her again... until today. The Noivern, he knew, was that same Noibat, still holding a grudge. He suggested they leave, wait for backup- this place, he explained, was essentially Noivern's playground by this point, and that they were in way over their heads.<br />
<br />
But Keith couldn't just leave. Not now. &quot;Bolt...&quot; he said. &quot;We could just turn tail and run from this, but... that's not gonna do any good, and you know it. Brine Island will run out of power, Noivern will still be mad at you, and she'll keep on doing this wherever she can find electric cables. And that's if the backup you want to wait for doesn't come in and hurt her first,&quot; he added. &quot;I know you don't want that. But... I say we find Noivern and talk to her,&quot; he stated. &quot;Apologize, try to make things right between you two again. If it comes to it, my Pokémon can defend us without hurting Noivern.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He ain't kiddin',&quot; Meowth added. &quot;If youse tinks he's in ova his head, you don't know Keith Masters. Ya had to have heard about wat happened on Aduro Island last summer, right? All da work o' dis guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith had produced a Poké Ball. &quot;Besides,&quot; he said to Bolt. &quot;I have the perfect Pokémon for this situation. She too knows the pain of being abandoned by humans. She's got speed to match Noivern's, and undoubtedly power as well. Hell, she could probably even help us locate Noivern.&quot; And he threw the ball. &quot;Hedwig, let's go!&quot; he exclaimed.<br />
<br />
In a flash of light, the Crobat materialized. &quot;Cro! Bat!&quot; she exclaimed, hovering by Keith's side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Meet Hedwig, my Crobat,&quot; said Keith. &quot;She's one of my oldest and strongest friends. If there is anyone who can reason with Noivern, it's her, for sure. So, Bolt, what do you say?&quot; Keith asked. &quot;Do you want to turn and just run from the problem, or do you want to take the chance that you might be able to make amends with your friend?</span></span><br />

The voice rings ominously in your head, familiar and unmistakable at this point. Gastly, wherever it is, has declared you guilty of treason… is it watching you? And if so, does it mean your plan is compromised?!<br />
<br />
Nothing left to do at this point but press onwards. The entire EPAL team hears you out and complies, Ria included. They all watch as the quirky little Magnemite floats ahead of them, emitting ultrasonic waves mercifully inaudible to humans, while the group moves as silently as possible right behind it.<br />
<br />
For a while, nothing seems to happen, which is even more unsettling than a big brawl breaking out. Maybe you misinterpreted Mal?...<br />
<br />
- Wh-what was that?<br />
<br />
Ria has stopped. She looks around, as if she caught a glimpse of something; her nervousness starts getting to the rest of the group, who also begin staring upwards in confusion, unsure of what they should be seeing…<br />
<br />
- You were right Lucas… we’re not alone. What on…<br />
<br />
<i>*SHRIIIIEEEEK!!*</i><br />
<br />
Unlike Wattson’s Metal Sound, this noise is loud and clear to everyone present. Ria was right; something begins stirring in the darkness, the flapping of wings it seems… and just then, quick as lightning, three huge

dive down on your Steel-Type partner, probably annoyed by its Metal Sound! Watts disappears amongst the mess of purple wings, but soon, a yellow glow emanates from the pile of bodies and lightning shoots upwards, causing the Crobat to disperse!<br />
<br />
Wattson returns to you enveloped in electricity, vanishes inside its Pokeball and immediately Mal’s one snaps open, releasing your Zubat once more, this time to confront its three fully-evolved, and very angry, brethren…<br />
<br />
You were right all along, these three were lying in wait to ambush the group. Were they doing so at Gastly’s behest? You sense you’re closer than ever to the source Ria wants to locate, but the three human-sized bats stand in your way, and the EPAL team seems seriously frightened… Now that you’ve avoid the worst-case scenario, a sneak attack on the unsuspecting party, what will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 10px">-Regrettable choice; I had a feeling that might have been the case. Unfortunately this decision made more sense for my character and I went with it. If anything to make you feel worse, your decision in Phantom Isle was regrettable as well ; )<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #a64dff"><span style="font-size: 10px">Lucas had made his choice and sent his Magnemite ahead. Somewhere far off in the distance the Gastly knew of this and the two of them had both declared Lucas’ allegiance.<br />
<br />
“Traitor,” the Gastly’s voice rings in Lucas’ head. The trainer wasn’t comfortable at the accusation but he supposed the Gastly was right. Even so, without a further understanding of what was really expanding the island, Lucas didn’t want to make any judgements on what was right or wrong. He just wanted to know the source, and get paid for it if he could. ‘With lots and lots of treasure’ his mind drifted. If anything, he felt the Gastly was the traitor. If it was ‘natural’ for the island to expand and infect the neighbouring islands, potentially destroying the habitats of the resident Pokémon, then it was only natural he thought that humans and Pokémon would fight back to protect their land. Lucas had no regrets on his decision son far.<br />
<br />
And is if on cue with his thoughts, the sound of Ria’s voice appeared to cut right through them.<br />
<br />
“Wh-what was that?”<br />
<br />
Lucas and rest of the group looked up to whatever it was that unnerved Ria. For a while it had been quiet and he thought Wattson’s Metal Sound might have scared off whatever lied up ahead. The sound of angry shrieks disproved the notion that they were alone.<br />
<br />
“You were right Lucas… we’re not alone. What on…”<br />
<br />
“SHRIIIIEEEEK!!”<br />
<br />
“Get back!” Lucas snapped at Ria. His thought raced on what to do and he made a snap response at her. He calmed down only to make him question his own words. Why did he decide to warn her? Not as if he cared, they should take care of themselves while he faced whatever was incoming.<br />
<br />
Three large shapes whizzed down from the air towards Wattsson, batting it with their wings as they closed in on it. The Magnemite let out a whining wail, scared like a little schoolgirl.<br />
<br />
“Wattson! Your orders!” Lucas yelled from the top of his lungs to overcome his Pokémon insistent cries. The Magnemite snapped out of its balling and gave a confirmed, albeit weak, pitch. A yellow surge of electricity cackled past the purple bodies, jolting their wings and fangs to snap off. The aggressors dispersed from the attack and Wattson too his chance to use the remaining energy and return to the safety of his Pokéball. Lucas focussed on the winged creatures that were attacking them and easily recognised that these were Pokémon, though ones he didn’t know. The Pokédex he hastily pulled out of a pocket clarified it for him.<br />
<br />

Crobat, the evolved form of Golbat and final form of Zubat. With its two additional wings, Crobat is able to fly much faster than Golbat.

</blockquote><i>‘So this is the final form of Mal?’</i> he pondered. <i>‘Speaking of which,’</i> the second part of Wattson’s <b>Volt Switch</b> activated and Mal pulled out of her Pokéball to replace her companion in battle, eager to help out.<br />
<br />
“Hold on Mal, something’s wrong,” he briefly peered over his shoulder to ensure the EPAL members had taken cover. “The size is wrong,” his fingers dancing across the touch screen as he scrolled through the data. “They shouldn’t be anywhere as big as this, they’re nearly the size of humans!” Probably a result of living in a poison type’s paradise such as Bane Forest <i>‘Not to mention,’</i> he grit his teeth, <i>’their your superior by two evolutions and have you outnumbered three to one. Still…’</i><br />
<br />
Lucas smirked as he realised Wattson’s clear type advantage.<br />
<br />
“Mal, I need you on reserve for scouting. <b>U-Turn</b> as quickly as you can. His hand clutched the Pokéball of the Magnemite. Steel types were immune to Poison types he recalled reading in his many books back home, and Electric types were super-effective against Flying types.<br />
<br />
There was one other thing that might help, the Electric Gem Wattson had balanced with his electromagnetism on top of his screw. It would power up one Electric type move, but only one and Lucas had no intention of wasting it. Wattson knew the move Recycle but he could only use it once per battle length. After that, he couldn’t use any more Electric type attacks, not without losing that item once and for all. So he was going to have to make it count.<br />
<br />
Luckily, Lucas had proven his merit and surprising knowledge to the Professor back in his home town and that had earned him the right to a Pokédex.<br />

I expected nothing more of a child, admittedly, but I assume by your aging companions’ silence that this is a stance you all share. <i>That</i>, I find disappointing. – he answers, staring not at you, but at Dana. – Still, you would be wrong in your guess, partly at least.<br />
<br />
He stands up, realizing you aren’t willing to sit down at the negotiations table, and begins pacing around the room.<br />
<br />
- Yes, I do want that Key Stone of yours. But you’re mistaken as far as what I have to offer in compensation. Unfortunately, neither this remarkable Charizard nor Dana’s former Arcanine are negotiable, and Fennekin was really just a bait; I don’t intend to part with it either. But I have something infinitely more valuable to offer in return for your Key Stone, just to prove how generous I truly am: freedom, and written pardon of all your crimes committed against the Government – a luxury I cannot afford Dana, I fear. Before you rethink your counter-offer, and I strongly suggest you do so, let me explain to you why this deal is important to me. To Cascadia.<br />
<br />
He tries his best to sound serious, as if he was dealing with a business partner on equal footing, but something about the excessive formality makes you certain he’s dying of laughter on the inside, playing with you, treating you like the adult he doesn’t think of you as.<br />
<br />
- I needed Dana, I had to draw her out. That was the only thing I really expected to gain out of this whole game. That nabbing you in that warehouse Whisper led you to would force her to come out of hiding, and I was entirely successful on that account, even if I never expected her to walk right through my front door. Coming across your Charizard, dear Liza… let’s call that collateral damage. For you, anyway; for me, I call it a bonus. When I had my men rummage through your belongings, once I tossed you in that cell, I never expected to find such a powerful creature… one carrying a Mega Stone, no less. The prison guard begged me not to take it… but he was easily silenced when I reminded him what I could do to his Fennekin.<br />
<br />
Only then does he break a wicked smile, something you know he’s been dying to do from the beginning.<br />
<br />
- It will make a fine addition for the Government’s defense force. This one, I’ll keep to myself… but as luck would have it, it’s a female. I will let <i>every single one</i> of Salin P.D.’s compatible male Pokemon have a go at her, and soon we will be equipped with an army of top-pedigree Charizard. So as you can see, this is for the betterment of the community, and I’m sure you wouldn’t oppose that. Now, Dana! As for your Arcanine, you’ll be pleased to see for yourself how I’ve managed to open its eyes. It’s been under my care for long enough to see things how they <i>really</i> are – which is, that powerful creatures like itself should be using their strength the proper way, not performing to please a handful of onlookers. Here, see for yourself.<br />
<br />
Layard reaches for the inside of his suit and tosses a Premier Ball to the carpeted floor. The device snaps open and a large hound materializes in front of the Vice President… but the sight you’re met with doesn’t elicit the usual awe of beholding a majestic Arcanine. The creature is larger, more muscled than the usual specimen, its fur has lost all its luster, its mane doesn’t glisten. The beast’s eyes are glazed over, empty, devoid of any visible emotion. This is a broken Pokemon, forcefully raised to excel in combat and nothing else. Its mind has caved, all memories of its past life either erased completely or buried so deep under a pile of traumatic experiences that they are probably inaccessible all the same.<br />
<br />
- I’ve kept it as my personal bodyguard and companion ever since I acquired it. It has sat alongside me and witnessed the crumbling of the Contest scene from the beginning. I’ve turned it into a <i>proper</i> warrior, though not without considerable effort. All worth it, in the end. Now that I’ve explained my point of view, I’m hoping we can renegotiate the terms of our little business conversation... My offer: the Key Stone in exchange for your guaranteed safety. My insurance: the promise you’ll never walk out of this office should you refuse.<br />
<br />
Red Skull steps forward, grinning maliciously, and calls out her Pinsir a second time, the blood on its horns having dried out by now, coating them crimson. It stands next to Arcanine and beats its chest in defiance, as Layard concludes his speech.<br />
<br />
- Please understand. Or don’t. It really doesn’t matter either way.</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: silver">&quot;I was willing to give you one more chance to see the errors of your ways and redeem yourself of the evil deeds you've committed but I see now that there is no hope, for any of you.&quot; Liza readied a Premierball she was holding since the moment she walked into Laylard's office. &quot;The time to negotiate is over!&quot; Liza tossed the sphere and upon opening a beautiful melody played, revealing a water serpent, &quot;Milooooootic~&quot; it's body shimmering underneath the warm glow of light shining through the windows, it's multicolored scales glistening as a blue dew drop pendant sat around the serpent's neck, replacing her usual burning orb.<br />
<br />
<i>Epy must've given her his <b>Mystic Water</b>, since he couldn't be here to fight...</i> she thought, it's as if her Piplup knew the trouble his eldest sister Samantha was in and wanted do something to aid in any way he could.<br />
<br />
Liza also had a hunch that if the Vice President had kept Dana's partner close all these years, there was a possibility they would of had to face it in battle. <i>That Fire Blast Laylard demonstrated in the abandoned Ice Cream Factory, that was a dead give away. It took down Cryogonal in one shot...this isn't a Pokémon I can win with brute force alone.</i><br />
<br />
What was going through the old women's head at this critical moment? Had Laylard planned for this all along? The final nail in the coffin to send Dana into a devastating mental break!?<br />
<br />
Even with Dana standing only a few feet away, Arcanine didn't even seem to recognize its true owner. Those soulless eyes...the majestic beast was nothing but an empty shell of it's form self, an innocent bystander of war. <br />
<br />
Liza wasn't sure what to say in a situation like this, but she felt compelled to grab the old women's hand and collapse it with her own, &quot;It's not over! I know it feels like the whole world is crumbling around you, but you're not fighting alone, not anymore! We can still save your beloved Pokémon, but that also means hurting it...&quot; It was a difficult position to be in and Liza knew it, this is where Liza needed to give Dana a little bit of tough love, &quot;The alternative will be never being able to see your Pokémon for what it once was, allowing Laylard to order it around for the rest of it's life, we can't let that happen! Leo will protect you, Oscar will look after you and we'll bring back your Pokémon, along with mine. We're all leaving here together!&quot;<br />
<br />
Liza turned to her enemies, &quot;You got that Vice President!&quot; the young Lass's rage was showing, &quot;Don't think I'll let what you said about my Pokémon slide, I won't allow anything you said take place, I'll make it my mission to rain hell on your world!&quot; Liza's other hand was balled up, &quot;Oscar, look after Dana and be cautious of Whisper. I can't read him and that makes me nervous...as for me, I came here to settle things...once and for all!&quot; She said letting Dana's hand go as her Snubbull joined her, &quot;Snub!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're ending this! Snub give Pinsir a taste of your <b>Fire Fang</b> followed by a <b>Thunder Wave</b>! Boa, use <b>Water Pulse</b> on Arcanine then a <b>Hidden Power (Ground)</b>!&quot;<br />

<br />
<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u> Electric Blue Eye</u>:</b> Stopping now would only draw attention to an issue everyone prefers to keep under wraps. Trevor’s assault is being handled backstage, and already too much of the incident has been brought to public at the end of your match with Sean… acting suspiciously now will only make things worse for you, you reason. Still, something is definitely amiss for Luther to simply shut himself off from the match like that…<br />
<br />
Chris doesn’t much care for the Trainer’s motives – his target is right there, and he’s more than eager to capitalize on the opening, which means your next orders are right up his alley! With gusto, he lets loose twin vines that wrap around Zoroark, keeping the larger foe in place; then, the snake-like Grass-Type bolts forward and slashes away at the immobilized foe, with grace and precision that would have made Sean’s Dewott proud!<br />
<br />
Zoroark cries out in pain and drops to one knee, panting heavily, and breaking Luther from his reverie. Seeing what transpired while he was distracted, the Dark-Type expert maintains a stern expression, though not outwardly criticizing of your decision to keep fighting.<br />
<br />
- Not the noblest of calls, but a necessary one from your perspective, I’m sure.<br />
<br />
He then lowers hi voice, hoping nobody else but you can hear him.<br />
<br />
- Gottfried seems to be feeling unwell. He looked pale since our match started, and has just now left his seat at the balcony. This is, to my recollection, the first time our Champion has fallen ill… and I find it hard to dismiss it as coincidence. His closest friend and guardian, Drago, accompanied him to the back, and I see at least Johan, Pietro and Sean have done the same. The other Leaders remain on their seats. So…<br />
<br />
He looks over to his damaged Zoroark, then back to you, his earlier easy smile yet to return.<br />
<br />
- I don’t know about you, but I would very much like to make haste. If we keep fighting, your Snivy will no doubt incapacitate my Zoroark, claim victory and earn a considerable amount of experience. But I will lose a valuable ally should I need to confront anyone backstage. I leave the choice to you: we either stop this match now and hurry over to Gottfried, or we keep battling and let Drago, Johan, Pietro and Sean handle things in the back with our sick Champion, competent as they all are. I know which choice I prefer, but the challenger has the final say. I am but a tool to this crowd’s diversion, and a stepping stone to an aspiring Ace Trainer such as yourself.<br />
<br />
Calm and collected as always, Luther doesn’t seem like he’ll do anything to oppose you, whichever choice you make. But you do need to make one, and you’d best do it fast, because the fans in attendance are growing restless with the lack of action…</span></span>

<br />
<span style="color: silver">Ethan had played this battle cautiously from the start, taking the advice of Johan to make his own judgment of Luther. The concern the Gym Leader had showen for Gottfried's condition was nothing short of real.<br />
<br />
There were rumors Ethan had heard down the grape vine, in Castelia City, of a notorious man and his shady deals. A business man whose only interest was to satisfy his own needs and greed. <br />
<br />
However what he wanted wasn't money or necessarily power, what he longed for were strong Dark Type Pokémon, his only goal- to bring out the best in them.<br />
<br />
So for someone like him to lose focus in the middle of a battle, this couldn't have been just an act.<br />
<br />
Ending this battle now, would benefit Ethan as well, he had hoped for a chance to talk to Gottfried privately- possibly learn something he wasn't quite understanding. For this villain to go to great lengths to try to frame him by hurting those around him was nothing more then a cowardly act- even more so then stealing! <i>This had to end now, before even more people got hurt.</i> Ethan thought.<br />
<br />
Ethan would no longer be standing in the limelight, he would be in the shadows where he was the most comfortable.<br />
<br />
But...that would also mean, that his dream to ascend to a higher plateau in the trainer world, would come to an abrupt end. Or at the very least be postponed. Who knew when another opportunity like this one would come along and present itself.<br />
<br />
No matter, because whichever way Ethan looked at it, people's lives hung in the balance...and that mattered much more then his own ambitions.<br />
<br />
The crowd wasn't the only one that seemed to be growing restless with the lack of activity, Chris stood with his arms crossed shooting Ethan an annoyed glare.<br />
<br />
It wasn't until Ethan broke his silence that his Snivy knew which choice his trainer was about to make, with an apologetic look splattered on his face he said, &quot;I have to do this.&quot; To this Chris just shot Ethan another look that said something along the lines of 'I hope you know what you're doing.' Releasing his hold on their opponent's Zoroark and unfolding his arms, bowing respectfully toward those attending as his trainer retrieved a Premierball from his belt, Ethan once again thanked his partner for a well fought battle.<br />
<br />
Clearing his throat Ethan spoke loudly and confidently. &quot;I, Ethan Rivers, have come to the harsh realization that this tournament is too much for a trainer of my current skill level to take on and do decide to take myself of out the running in this gauntlet. Effective immediately.&quot;<br />
<br />
What was sure to cause shock and confusion amongst the audience, Ethan focused his attention back to his opponent, the Gym Leader opposite to him, &quot;Well, don't just stand there, Luther!&quot; he said in a low enough volume for the Dark Type specialist to hear, &quot;Let's get going!&quot;</span></span><br />
