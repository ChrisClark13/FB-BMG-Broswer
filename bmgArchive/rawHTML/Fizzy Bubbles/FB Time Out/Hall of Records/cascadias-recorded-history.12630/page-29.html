<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>Brine Island</i></span><br />
<br />
<b>Salin City</b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Arc_Angel &amp; lilbluecorsola</u>:</b> The Kabutops sensed the urgency of Stacey’s request. After making sure that her Trainer is ready, he shoots forward almost faster than the eye can see, propelled by an Aqua Jet that sends parts of the hastily-assembled barricade flying everywhere. Police officers on the scene begin swearing, having had enough of just about everyone breaking through their security measures; clearly, not a good day to roll off of bed.<br />
<br />
Shattering a ground floor window, Wraith successfully enters the building. Leaping down from his back, soaked to the bone because of the unorthodox method of transportation, you look around alarmed. You’re in an empty room! Fortunately most of the flames in this division are out, probably a joint effort between the POLT and your own Rain Dance… but that’s where the good news end. You hear some commotion coming somewhere from your right, and you hurriedly motion for Wraith to follow you; Jess and Felicia are probably still in entrance hall! The door is closed, standard procedure in limiting the spread of house fires, and some rubble piled up in front of it. Cursing, you and your Kabutops start dislodging everything that’s blocking the door as fast as you can; Jess needs you!<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Atzu turns to Jess for a brief moment; he clearly doesn’t see the logic behind the orders she issued, until their true purpose dawns on him. As soon as Haruki has her Barrier in place, the Azumarill lets loose a stream of magical chocolate, covering as much of the Electrode as he can. Before its entire surface is coated however, Atzu realizes the Electrode is glowing as much as it ever will, which means no time to finish, he needs to switch to Ice Beam now! <br />
<br />
As you pull the mentally unstable young woman close to you, you feel Atzu’s concern, realizing in horror that it may not be possible to contain the explosion adequately. But if he fails… if it doesn’t work, you’ll die! With nothing more to be done, you close your eyes prepare for the worst... How <i>does</i> one prepare for something like this? For death?<br />
<br />
-	Poliwrath, Ice Beam!!<br />
<br />
Senior Agent Gouka’s voice suddenly echoes through the hall, loud and determined, and you find yourself opening your eyes again, expecting a miracle. Just as Atzu unleashes his own Ice Beam, a large Poliwrath next to the POLT Officer does the same, their combined power freezing the Electrode over much faster than Chocolate Magic had. And time ran out.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
You finally manage to get the door open, in large part thanks to Wraith’s strength, and rush to the entrance hall. Just as you reach it, a large chunk of ice flies dangerously close to your face and shatters against a nearby wall, as do a number of other frozen projectiles across the hall.<br />
<br />
You look around trying to understand what just happened. And why does the place smell of <i>chocolate</i> after a fire?! You quickly spot Jess, thank God, as well as the crazy girl called Felicia, taking cover behind a Shiny Corsola’s Barrier. And judging by the amount of ice in front Haruki’s shield, it’s a good thing they did. Three POLT officers are also in there, apparently recalling their Pokemon; two of them are staring at poor Jess with a look of sheer disbelief, while the tallest, oldest-looking one conveys no visible emotion.<br />
<br />
You run over to check on your friend just as Haruki dispels the Barrier, looking exhausted. As you kneel next to her, the tall POLT officer approaches you. After a moment of silence, he helps the three of you up, and turns to Jess.<br />
<br />
-	I apologize for my earlier approach. Had I realized you were one of <i>them</i>, I would have instead requested your collaboration instead of turning you away like a regular civilian.<br />
<br />
He motions for the other POLTs to gather samples of the remains.<br />
<br />
-	Your Chocolate Magic and Ice Beam combination was masterfully planned, especially at such a critical moment. That Electrode would have wiped us out otherwise; if you weren’t here, my Poliwrath’s Ice Beam alone would have been obviously insufficient, and Lord knows how dependable those two scrubs are. But as gifted as you are, I cannot endanger you further. If there’s anything you need from inside this building let me know, and I’ll personally retrieve it for you. Otherw…<br />
<br />
Suddenly, five police officers burst through the front door, trying their best to look professional even after blunder with the repeated security breaches. They grab hold of the three of you and are about to cuff you when Wraith ominously steps forward. They stop for a moment, unsure of what to do, until one of them addresses Gouka, stammering.<br />
<br />
-	S-s-sir, we have orders t-to remove all civs from the building and take them to the p-precinct for questioning. They’re being charged with breaking and entering, as well as d-disrupting police work. We…<br />
<br />
-	And what fine work that was, officer. Please do escort them out, but you are not to arrest them under any circumstance. At least one of them is a User*. – the policeman’s eyes widen upon hearing this. - I am the highest authority figure on site at the moment, and you’ll answer to me. These civilians just averted a second catastrophe, so you can overlook them stomping all over your impeccable perimeter. Make sure they get out safely, but that will be all officer.<br />
<br />
Senior Agent Gouka shakes Jess’s hand, and tries his hardest to smile. It comes off terribly, thanks to the lack of practice, but the thought should count.<br />
<br />
-	I will deliver a preliminary report to the local authorities after we conclude our searches. Contact them if you wish to know our findings, tell them I sent you; word spreads quickly when it needs to. Thank you once more for your help, Miss. Dismissed, officers.<br />
<br />
-	Y-yes sir. As you wish, sir. My apologies, ladies…<br />
<br />
After you’re taken outside, Felicia’s father comes to meet you. You can’t quite read his expression, but he’s no doubt grateful to see his daughter safe. The girl, however, remains absolutely silent, eyes fixed on the floor.<br />
<br />
-	I… I am so very sorry for all of this. I cannot thank you enough, nor express my remorse for everything you went through… I feel I owe you in the very least an explanation. I’ll answer everything to the best of my ability… however offensive or angry you might wish to be. I take full responsibility for Felicia’s actions.<br />
<br />
This was certainly not the best way to end an otherwise perfect day. You risked your lives for a woman you barely know, apparently for nothing… If you feel you’ve had enough of this crazy family, you might want to excuse yourselves and head elsewhere. You need to ask yourselves just how much of this incident you’re willing to put behind you if you really wish to move on though… between the fire caused by Electrodes, clearly a criminal act, to the number of casualties that you don’t even know, to this troubled woman and her obsession with a dead sister, there might be too much going on to ignore completely. And who knows? Senior Agent Gouka said you were special… surely there’s <i>something</i> you can do for Salin City after all that has happened.<br />
<br />
Between getting an explanation out of this old man and looking for other ways to help around… what do you do?</span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"><br />

</blockquote><span style="color: #ADD8E6"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Silver">As Atzu raced against the clock to cover Electrode in chocolate delight, prior to putting it on ice, Jessica grit her teeth and embraced the woman tightly, attempting to cover the shivering body with her own. At the very least, she would give up her life to be able to protect one person. Closing her eyes, she prayed for the safety of everyone besides herself.<br />
<br />
Before all hope and time were lost, however, she heard Senior Agent Gouka’s voice ring out, commanding his Poliwhirl to compound the cold. First melted, then frozen – a continuous life process – what followed felt like the sound of her poor, pounding heart exploding. Blasting into bits, breaking from all the stress built up behind false smiles and sincerities. Widening her gaze, she screamed and ducked as icicles came flying towards her face, pulling the woman with her to the floor. But the barricade held fast, fortunately, and the popsicle projectiles bounced harmlessly back before they could bury in her skin.<br />
<br />
When the barrage ended, Jessica sighed and sank in relief, reaching out to thank her lil blue bodyguard, who grinned wearily but puffed up his chest with pride as if to say, “It was nothing”. Atzu bounded over, exhausted yet eager for praise as well, and their trainer burst into both laughs and sobs as she drew them in for a group hug.<br />
<br />
It took a minute for her to realize the number of stares upon her – and in addition, there were two extras in the room compared to earlier. She gasped and stiffened upon seeing Stacey. When did she get here? Why? How? Was she here for the explosion? Jessica’s sight immediately slid to the shards embedded in the wood beside Stacey’s head. Oh God, had she endangered her friend’s life too?<br />
<br />
Stacey raced over and knelt next to Jess, flinging her arms around the smaller female as she scolded fiercely, although her tone was more relieved than truly cross. For some reason, the woman’s sleeves felt wet as she gently soothed the other’s hair, but Jess could sense the warmth underneath. It was now her turn to shudder and bury into someone’s support.<br />
<br />
“S-sorry,” she sniffed into Stacey’s chest.<br />
<br />
Stacey smirked in satisfaction but shook her head; she would have no worthless words of regret. She needed to say what was on her mind first, so let her speak selfishly for once. In fact, she seemed to be beaming at Jess with approval. Though she had been worried sick, certainly, she admired how well the girl had handled herself. Receiving congratulations for such a silly (but admittedly effective) strategy from someone as skilled and sophisticated as Stacey made Jessica blush and rub her neck. She wondered if the woman remembered where the idea had inspired from, and flushed in further embarrassment upon recalling the specifics of the situation. A fond and humorous memory served to help alleviate the current circumstances though, and she giggled as Stacey wagged a knowing finger with a wink.<br />
<br />
There was something else Stacey had said that stuck though: What did she mean by “trying to save a dead girl”? Jess glanced at the second lady in white, who was watching them without comprehension. After a moment of awkward silence, a shadow fell over the trio and Jess looked up to find Senior Agent Gouka standing over them. She shrank in anticipation of anger – or worse, arrest. To her surprise though, he offered to aid their standing. After seeing Stacey slowly accept, so did she (with their free arms, they guided the third to her feet as well). The man then turned to Jess and cleared his throat.<br />
<br />
“I apologize for my earlier approach. Had I realized you were one of <i>them</i>, I would have instead requested your collaboration instead of turning you away like a regular civilian.”<br />
<br />
Jessica cocked her head in confusion, comforted at least that she wasn’t being reprimanded. As he continued to commend her abilities, she shuffled again sheepishly, half-hiding behind Stacey as if to somehow give her the credit. When he asked if there was anything she wished him to search for inside the building, she opened her mouth to inquire about the missing sister, though something in her gut told her it would prove fruitless…<br />
<br />
Just then, as if to save her from one form of humiliation, five police officers busted belatedly through the door, striving their best to appear professional despite previous blunders regarding repeat security breaches. They grabbed the group of “civs”, prepared to take them to the “p-precinct” for questioning. While Stacey snapped and struggled, her Kabutops sharpening his scythes as he glared at the nearest who dared try to restrain his trainer, Jessica sagged and gave herself up easily. Sergeant Agent Gouka spoke up on their behalf though, allowing them to be forcibly dismissed, but at the same time defending their innocence and also advising against the use of handcuffs. Before leaving, he strongly shook Jessica’s hand and called her a <i>user</i>. (She noticed Stacey wrinkle her nose at the term, though apparently out of disgust rather than recognition.) The expression he wore seemed entirely foreign to his facial lines, but an earnest effort nonetheless.<br />
<br />
His subordinates swiftly ushered them away before she could question the man’s meaning. Though perhaps they were following orders more out of fear for their throats, as the rock fossil remained leering at them as they escorted the ladies out.  Less menacing in exterior but just as loyal, Haruki flanked the opposite side as they walked, while Atzu brought up the rear.<br />
<br />
Once outside, an elderly gentleman approached to gratefully greet the woman in white. Jessica tensed when he took the frail thing’s hand and held her close, suspicious of such a shady character prowling the perimeter, perhaps lurking in wait to take advantage of victims during a period of instability. Especially after what they just went through, she wasn’t willing to trust a stranger presenting kindness off the bat. Call her paranoid, but considering they were a party of three young women probably looking worse for wear, one of whom was obviously weak and easily singled out as a target… They were surrounded by police though (useless as they may be), and Stacey seemed somewhat familiar with him. Plus he referred to “Felicia” by name and assumed responsibility for her actions, so Jessica relaxed, presuming there must be some close relation between the two. Judging by his age, she would’ve guessed grandfather, though she supposed parenthood wasn’t outside the realm of possibility.<br />
<br />
She could perceive Stacey’s internal struggle with the decision whether to stay for an explanation, or put the past and all similar painful experiences behind as planned by this supposed vacation. Jessica would agree with whatever her companion chose, should it ease her mind, though her own curiosity desired to know more. So she was secretly glad when Stacey agreed to a conversation, and simply nodded silently in concurrence. Upon suggestion of a towel, her lips lifted as well. She felt a slight pressure in her palm, and squeezed back.<br />
<br />
Stacey then released Dwemer to fill him in on the current state of affairs, and returned Jessica’s own Poké Balls to her. Jess quickly called out Kristen to reassure her as well. The little Snorunt leapt into her trainer’s arms and snuggled close, happy she was safe. Jessica cuddled and rocked in return, then turned to her Corsola and Azumarill, withdrawing them for a well-deserved rest. Realizing she forgot to thank Stacey for looking after her team, she shifted uncomfortably, wondering if she had missed her chance to show common courtesy, let alone communicate her thoughts (as was typical). She hastily stammered her appreciation, hoping it wasn’t too late.</span></span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Stark</u>:</b> The temple was indeed a sight to behold, and you find yourself marveling at the architectural genius of the long-lost civilization that erected the building. Equally impressed is Aurora, unlike the hyperactive Twilight, who isn’t exactly culturally educated. But one thing the three of you were starting to agree on was that this’d be a great opportunity to explore and have fun, something you hadn’t done in a while… until the Baltoy decides to interrupt an otherwise idyllic trip. With nobody else around, the most logical conclusion is that it must be a wild Pokemon defending its territory, and in that case, you hope it won’t be too hard to take down.<br />
<br />
Trying to keep level-headed even through the storm, you decide that your Eevee duo might just be able to hold its own against the Clay Doll Pokemon. Issuing your first battle commands, while fighting to keep the sand out of your eyes and mouth, you command Aurora and Twilight to boost each other’s power through Helping Hand. The two foxes readily obey, as each of them start to glow before enveloping each other in their respective auras. Baltoy, in the meantime, simply stands where it is, an ever-increasing amount of sand swirling from underneath it and spreading throughout the hall with impressive force.<br />
<br />
The real battle would start now. Looking at each other, Aurora and Twilight nod with determination before charging up Shadow Ball. With Baltoy not fighting back, they successfully fight through the pain from the pelting sand and fire their respective attacks directly at the opponent. As the Shadow Balls are about to make contact, Baltoy suddenly vanishes, and both orbs collide and explode violently. Looking around nervously, both Eevee try to understand what just happened, but you already figured it out: <b>Teleport</b>. Turning your head in every direction, you try to spot the enemy as well, but to no avail…<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Aurora is enveloped in a bright pink light and starts floating briefly… before being hurled into Twilight, crashing into him, both foxes tumbling and rolling on the floor visibly hurt. No doubt that was <b>Psychic</b>… which for some reason makes you feel uncomfortable, as if something isn’t right. Should you have expected Psychic from a wild Baltoy?<br />
<br />
In any event, you realize you’re dealing with a very strong opponent, so the standard head-on approach won’t cut it. Not only can’t you spot it, the Sandstorm isn’t letting up either, and no doubt Baltoy will just Teleport away from the next wave of attacks it sees. As you hurriedly try to think of a solution, you spot a faint pink glow coming from inside one of the Gyarados pillars’ mouths through the corner of your eye…<br />
<br />
What is your next approach?</span></span>

&quot;Aurora! Twilight! Nooo...!&quot; Stark screamed.<br />
<br />
Stark could hardly believe what he was seeing. Not only did the Baltoy Teleport out of the way of the double attack, but it also used a move he didn't think it could use. The trainer bit down hard gritting his teeth as much in frustration as in defense against the sandstorm that seemed to be grinding against his face. It was obvious this was no ordinary baltoy. Unfortunately, Stark had only seen one baltoy during his travels and that was back when he was a young trainer. It was part of a team of odd almost inorganic pokemon that another trainer happened to have. Almost a complete opposite of the kind of team Stark had assembled over the years. His mind raced for ideas. Retreat was not out of the question. Better that than fighting a futile battle. Then again, Stark wasn't ready to throw in the towel just yet.He and his partners had come too far to give up at the first sign of adversity. <br />
<br />
The trainer recollected himself and pulled out his pokedex. The smooth black casing fit comfortably in his hand. Unlike his old red Kanto style dex, this new Unova style dex was less bulky. Unfortunately, Stark hadn't really played with it enough to know how to do much with it short of scan pokemon. Which at this moment happened to be just fine. With any luck he might be able to find some sort of weakness to exploit. <br />
<br />
Holding the pokedex up a familiar voice responded from the device, &quot;Baltoy. The clay doll pokemon. Discovered in ancient ruins, it moves by spinning around and forms a group when it finds others.&quot; Stark frowned. That wasn't exactly what he had hoped for. Regardless, he couldn't really waste any more time. Not with his Eevees in danger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hang in there you two. We can take him!&quot; Stark called out to his partners in the hopes that he could figure out a way to actually do what he said. It was then that he saw something through the blowing sand. Something he wasn't expecting. His two partners stood up and took their attack stances again. Only this time they were glowing. Not the soft glow of some kind of attack being charged up, but the bright glow that only comes from evolution. The trainer's heart began to race. As much as he might have wanted to keep them the way they were forever, having them evolve might be just what they needed to turn the tide. The glow around the pair brightened until it was blinding in its luminescence. Stark wasn't sure what was going to come of all of this. He knew that eevees were highly adaptable. That was part of the reason why they were his favorite type of pokemon. Still, it wasn't like he had used a stone on either of them, nor did he notice any strange glowing stones in the area. At least earlier he hadn't. The whipping wind howled through the air until at last the light had subsided and where once there were a pair of brown and white furballs, there now were a pair of sleek foxes of different appearances. <br />
<br />
Aurora now had a purplish pink hue to her coat while her tail had become long and slender. She had adapted to the psychic onslaught on her own way, taking a cue from her opponent in order to figuratively fight fire with fire. Meanwhile, Twilight had gone through a different transformation. His black fur highlighted with yellow markings and his own unique style of sleekness. Had he the time, Stark would have marveled at what he was seeing. However, this wasn't the time nor the place for such admiration. Not yet at least.<br />
<br />
A wry grin curled the side of Stark's lips as he thought about his next move. Out of the corner of his eye a faint pink glow threatened to steal his attention, but he kept his mind focused on the task at hand. &quot;Let's see it get away from this... Aurora! Go with Quick Attack to throw it off balance before it can Teleport. Then follow that up with Synchronise! Twilight! I want you to sit back and Mimic Baltoy's next move. Then send a Shadow Ball at it!&quot; <br />
<br />
Having given his commands, Stark once more found his eyes drifting to the faint pink glow. He hated to let his complete attention slip from the battle, but he just had to know what was going on in that pillar. Holding up his pokedex once more, the trainer attempted to scan whatever might be inside of the gyrados's mouth.</span><br />
<br />
Note: Sorry I took so long. I couldn't decide if I wanted to evolve these two or not. Or for that matter if I wanted to evolve both of them at the same time. I should be a little quicker on replies from here on out.</span></div>

<b>Iridi Beach</b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>kaisap112</u>:</b> Temporarily caught off-guard by the statistical impossibility that was Amelia’s Ninetales, you quickly regroup and boldly stand up to the woman once again.<br />
<br />
Listening intently to your commands, Kitty grins and jumps into action immediately: lunging forward, she rapidly slaps her tail across the bigger foe’s face, staggering it briefly and dealing light damage. Then, jumping back once again to keep her distance, she begins to focus on Double Team…<br />
<br />
-	Ohohoh, how <i>cute</i>! Seems your cat has some spunk… Oh well, nothing we can’t handle, right dear?<br />
<br />
Solstice nods and rushes forward, fast as lightning, slamming Kitty and sending it tumbling several feet back, landing close to you. That was no doubt a <b>Quick Attack</b>, and it managed to disrupt your Double Team…<br />
<br />
-	Well honey, what now? It seems you can’t hide behind your phoney doppelgangers after all… Is this “old hag” giving you more trouble than you can handle?<br />
<br />
As Kitty struggles to make it to her feet, the Ninetales moves faster once again, shooting an eerie-looking blue flame that disappears upon contact with your Skitty, apparently to no effect. Taking the opening, Kitty speeds up and hits an unavoidable Faint Attack, making Solstice growl in pain. As you begin to feel excited about the apparent turn-around of events, Kitty suddenly yelps as all of her fur catches fire spontaneously and briefly, and the flames disappear as quickly as they appeared. Kitty is <span style="color: red">Burn</span>ed!<br />
<br />
As reality sets in, you reassess the situation. Kitty hit Solstice twice, whereas the Ninetales only struck once. There’s no telling how effective any of the attacks have been this early on in the match, but Kitty has a burn and that can turn the tide… And more importantly, the sun is up and Ninetales is yet to take advantage of it…<br />
<br />
Before you issue a new wave of commands however, you notice one last thing… Amelia hasn’t issued a single order yet! Her Ninetales used Quick Attack and Will-o-Wisp entirely on its own, for some reason… Is she biding her time for a surprise attack, a magnificent strategy or is she just leaving it up to her Pokemon because she can’t really battle?<br />
<br />
What do you do now? </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: deepskyblue"><span style="font-size: 9px">Kitty was more than ready to kick some canine tail, grinning while dashing towards the Ninetales, slapping her in the face with <b>Fake Out</b>, causing the bigger Pokémon to stagger back while taking some damage. Jumping a good length back like a pro, Kitty focused hard on making copies of herself with <b>Double Team</b>.<br />
<br />
“Ohohoh, how <i>cute</i>! Seems your cat has some spunk… Oh well, nothing we can’t handle, right dear?”<br />
<br />
Noriko’s stomach turned a bit at Amelia’s words. The Ninetails moved faster than Noriko could keep up with; the canine slammed into Kitty, sending her flying with a powerful <b>Quick Attack</b>. Kitty landed a foot away from Noriko with a hard thud. “You alright, Kitty?” Noriko was confident that her partner wouldn’t fall that easily, the feline meowing in response and hissing at Ninetails while wobbling up.<br />
<br />
“Well honey, what now? It seems you can’t hide behind your phoney doppelgangers after all… Is this “old hag” giving you more trouble than you can handle?” The old hag in question was truly beginning to get on Noriko’s last nerve. “A real battler would save the chit-chat for after the battle is over. Not that I expected even the slightest bit of that from you in the first place.” Noriko indeed had more respect for battles than going as low as taunting overly much during one. Ninetails was suddenly on the move again, summoning a creepy blue flame that seemed awfully familiar to Noriko and sending it right at Kitty…with no apparent effect or damage. Kitty sped up into a dash and went for the opening, hitting Ninetails with <b>Faint Attack</b>. In no way capable of avoiding the onslaught, Ninetails growled from the damage.<br />
<br />
Noriko didn’t have the opportunity to celebrate though: out of the blue Kitty seemed to be covered in a flame that disappeared in the blink of an eye, causing visible pain to the small feline. <i>Darn, a Will-o-Wisp! Let’s hope that burn doesn’t get too bad…</i> Noriko started analyzing the situation. <i>We get two hits in, she gets one, and we’re still the underdogs. But there weren’t any verbal commands from the hag, so either that’s one messed up Ninetails or something else is up with all this. Let’s first deal with that sunshine, thing will get messy if more fire gets involved in this fight.</i><br />
<br />
“Kitty, use <b>Rain Dance</b>, then move in with <b>Thunderbolt</b> and <b>Faint Attack</b>!”</span></span></div>

<span style="color: silver">&quot;Hey, Cypress, wait up!&quot; Eric called as he entered underneath the park's leafy treetops. The Bellsprout had continued to push through the crowd of people thronging the streets of Salin City, and Eric was still attempting to catch up. &quot;Don't people have jobs?&quot; he asked himself as he finally caught sight of his little grass type near the entrance. As he approached, two children, a boy and a girl, noticed the gangly flower also and ran up for closer inspection. Eric caught some of their conversation as he drew near.<br />

&quot;--a Pokey-mon!&quot; <br />

&quot;Am too!

The Poké Ball skittered across the pavement, finally coming to a halt at the edge of the sidewalk. &quot;Bell-Bell-Bellsprout-sprout!&quot; Cypress chided the two kids, trying to convey that he already had a trainer. The Bellsprout drew up to his full height arrogantly and walked over to stand behind Eric's legs, finally noticing him. Eric smiled. <i>At least he's finally starting to trust and like me.</i> <br />
<br />
Taking pity on the two kids, Eric drew near them and bent down to their height. &quot;Hey there, kids. Sorry, but you can't just go around trying to catch Pokémon that could belong to others. You see, this Bellsprout here belongs to me. His name is Cypress.&quot; Eric paused, looking at both children in the eye. &quot;What are your names, and where are your parents,&quot; he asked, trying to lace his tone with friendliness.<br />

<br />
I'm back with updates! Have fun, I'll try to get into a more regular updating schedule now that things are getting more regulated in my life.<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px">uhhhhh, Missingno. Master &amp; Marion Ette: <i>With Connor riding his Girafarig, your group starts slowly but surely moving toward the way you came. Every single one of you on high alert in case the Sevipers return or something worse comes up. This is exactly why you don’t miss the quiet footsteps that echo from another path – walking right toward the intersection you’re headed to! All capable trainers grab a Pokéball just in case, slowly and quietly approaching the intersection. Aislyn seems to have caught the scent of whatever it is that’s walking around…and she visibly cringes. A bit confused by this, you look ahead, the footsteps getting a little louder.<br />
<br />
First you see something small. Something gray. Or is it green? Wait, there’s pink too. The creature turns your way.<br />
<br />
“Trubbish?” A trashbag-like Pokémon, which the Poison-expert of the group recognizes as Trubbish, cocks its head a little in confusion, staring at you all.<br />

<br />
Once Marion manages to shake her friend back to the realm of the calm and collected, Trubbish suddenly develops a sparkle in its eyes – dashing at you with its small feet. Keith is absolutely overjoyed, extending his arms toward the small Poison-type…and gets watch the Trubbish dash right past him to Marion, tugging on her dress happily. This Trubbish must be quite young, acting much like a small child. It doesn’t seem dangerous though, busy hugging Marion’s legs. You try to have a civil discussion about what to do with the Trubbish, but all conversation gets stomped by resident Poison-fanatic crushing all objections, trying to reach for the Trubbish in a friendly manner. It sticks its tongue out at Keith before hiding behind Marion. One thing you do figure out: asking a Ghost-Pokémon to translate for you, you start digging for some information from the Trubbish. The story goes along these lines: the Trubbish was playing happily outside its village with other Trubbish (Keith needs to be shaken to reality again) when they ran into a pile of Pokémon eggs. Not knowing any better, the Trubbish took one and hid it in a pile of trash at their secret hideout as treasure and resumed their hide-and-seek. Unfortunately, this very Trubbish was ambushed by a Seviper of all things, a very nasty one with a scar on its face, and it ran all the way to this cave…only to get lost in the process. Trubbish, a female as it turns out, had been looking for a way out for a long while now, and was glad to see other life forms than Sevipers for a change. Looks like the little one wants to tag along…<br />
<br />
What will you do?</i></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10px">Bane Forest</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b>blazeVA:</b> <i>Static releases a <b>Thunder Wave</b> over a group of small Trubbish running your way. The electricity crackles around them; a yellow glow and stopped movement indicating the Trubbish have been paralyzed. While the Trubbish in the area have their sights locked on you, Surgei sneaks away and takes off, soaring up in the sky, out of the sight of the Poison-types. The Trubbish holding the can with Lemon Drop in it drops both of them and dashes for you, leaving Surgei to make a skillful dive and snatching the can, Lemon Drop happy to see a familiar face. Static uses a <b>Confuse Ray</b> on another group of Trubbish, but this doesn’t help: now you’ve got about five Trubbish flailing and running about, completely out of control. As you notice Surgei’s success in obtaining Lemon Drop, you almost cheer – when there’s an earth-shaking stomp. And another. Another. Steps.<br />
<br />
Looks like your favorite giant garbage bags, Garbodors, are approaching.<br />
<br />
You reach the conclusion that sticking around could lead to a smelly death – if you’re lucky – and get yourself and your team to run for it. Static throws an <b>Electroweb</b> behind it to stall the Trubbish before turning around and dashing after you, Surgei and Lemon Drop flying above you. Things really start getting messy as an assortment of trash of different sizes and splashes of <b>Sludge Bombs</b> hit the tree trunks and ground around you. Shots of <b>Acid Spray</b> fly past you, and dodging a particularly close shot you suddenly fall down what might have been a cliff; tree trunks, ground and dust run and spin in front of your eyes for what feels like a good minute or two. <br />
<br />
When you finally stop rolling down and can actually see where you are, you take note you’ve landed in what looks like a crater made of trash. You hear the Trubbish in the distance, searching for you, and duck into the nearest trash pile. While you wait on the Pokémon to pass you, you feel something smooth against your hand – something relatively warm. It is not moist or soft, so you don’t get too panicked about it (as much as running right inside a Garbodor’s open mouth might be something that you’d deem your usual luck). After a good while of silence, you hear your own Pokémon arrive, quietly looking for and calling out for you. On a whim, you decide to grab on the warm, smooth item you’d touched and slowly make your way out of the trash. Before your team members run over to crush your lungs with all the hugging, you look down and see you’ve acquired…an egg? It has the most intricate pattern on it, with a black base and purple-yellow spots all over it. Once you’ve negotiated with your team you decide to hold on to the egg: abandoning it into the wild wouldn’t be too cool. Lemon Drop is still stuck in the can, so you should probably get her free again before progressing. And progressing where would be the next question…<br />
<br />
What will you do?</i><br />
<br />
NOTE FROM KAISAP: The egg is NOT a regular egg and you cannot go hatch it at the Egg House. Consider it a key item in this adventure that you should take very good care of for the time being. You can have a full party of six Pokémon, since the egg isn’t technically yours – you’re just looking after it.</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b>Meetan:</b> <i>”Oh, right. Alice, sorry, I-I-I’m bad with n-n-n-names…” Kenny blushes to the shade of a fire truck, writing so fast you’re half-expecting the paper to catch on fire. Aw, does the young boy have a crush? Wingy the Pidgey float in front of Kenny’s face, flapping his wings to create a little breeze – probably mistaking the cause for a fever. Pichu giggles a little before playfully pouncing Wingy, the two play-battling and tackling each other on the ground in front of you. You’re happy to see the two Pokémon getting along so well so quickly, but get snapped back into reality when Kenny softly taps your shoulder with his index finger. “S-s-s-sorry, but I-I-I-I have just a f-f-few more questions, then we’re s-s-s-set to go. Could you h-h-h-help out a little?” The Puppy-Dog Eyes of Doom are back, so you sigh and take the offered paper from him again. Before you get to reading the questions, you take note that Pichu’s climbing on Wingy’s back, the latter then flying a few feet from the ground – it doesn’t seem like anything you should worry about, since Pichu seems to be loving the ride. “I-I-I-I’ve never seen that happen, a flying Pichu.” Kenny laughs a little. He might have to give flirting a few more years, but you decide to humor him with a laugh of your own. Then you turn your attention to the cursed homework.<br />
<br />
7. Describe the appearance and effects of a Hondew Berry.<br />
8. Name all evolved forms of Eevee.<br />
9. Revival Herbs grow in only one place. Name this location. <br />
10. What kind of locations is the Mouse Pokémon Raichu fond of?<br />
<br />
After you’ve helped Kenny with his homework, he looks delighted. “Thank you so much! I-I-I have no idea why they ask us th-th-this stuff…will we ever r-r-really need to know all this?” Kenny looks around for a bit. “H-h-hey, where’d Wingy and Pichu go?” You both start looking around, the two Pokémon aren’t big and strong enough to have gotten too far. “M-m-maybe they’re playing hide and s-s-s-seek?” Kenny wonders out loud, scampering back up from the ground after checking under a few nearby bushes. Suddenly, you hear two loud cries and crackling electricity – that must be Pichu, and distressed at that! You’re dashing at the voices before you even realize it, Kenny trying hard to keep up with you. Finally, you reach a little alley way that leads to a dead end, trash and trash cans littering the place. Before you have the time to wonder what on earth got Pichu to come in this messy place, you hear the cry of your little friend. At the end of the alley, you see three boys who look about the same age as Kenny. They’ve surrounded Pichu and Wingy, the two Pokémon looking terrified – but Pichu’s trying to be brave, electricity coming from its cheeks. The boys aren’t fazed, instead laughing at your friends: “You think that’s gonna scare us? You little rat!”<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b>OkikuMew:</b> <i>”Well, Abra’s are pretty infamous for sleeping most of the day unless they’re in immediate danger…maybe it’s sleeping?” Elena scratches her head a bit. “But since it can sense danger, it’s not a solid plan to try and surprise it in its sleep. I think I heard some trainer try that with his Pikachu and that didn’t end too well.” She shivers a bit, indicating that the battle in question hadn’t ended happily, and then turns to call Milly back into her Pokéball. You turn over to Max, your buddy attempting to make friends with the wild Poochyenas. The older one growls a bit quietly, but the younger one pounces right at Max – she looks eager to play with Max! After watching Max and what you are starting to believe is the wild Poochyena’s little sister having a play-fight for a few moments, the bro-Poochyena inches closer. He doesn’t seem especially eager to be best friends for life with Max, but as long as he’s not aiming for the throat you’re happy.<br />
<br />
Elena suddenly stiffens right before pushing you into the bush you both had jumped out of before, diving in after you with a finger on her lips. You peek out from a small hole between all the leaves: to your astonishment and fear, a big canine of black and grey color is walking over to the Poochyenas and not looking very happy. Your eyes reach the size of big plates as you realize that you’re staring at a Mightyena. The canine starts growling at bro-Poochyena, the latter growling back, like they’re having some sort of conversation. Panic crosses your mind: what if this thing is in cahoots with the Abra? What if it’s dangerous? Could Max stand a stand against his evolved form? Mightyena eyes Max for a brief moment before snatching sis-Poochyena by the neck; is she their mother, perhaps? Before you can move a muscle, Bro-Poochyena looks at Max, and then cocks his head toward the Mightyena. The family of three starts walking toward the temple - with Max following right behind them.<br />
<br />
Elena lets out a held breath. “Looks like we’re getting somewhere…don’t think that Mightyena’s going to want to see us around anytime soon though. What do you want to do? Should we go after them?”<br />
<br />
What will you do?</i></span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 10px">Icicle Caverns</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b>Celebii151:</b> <i>The Frosslasses giggle attractively at your explanation, the male Snorunt going stiff in clear panic. The queen of the Froslasses turns to the Snorunt with an unreadable expression, the Snorunt quickly bowing down and visibly shaking, making noise that sounded very much like a groveling servant trying to explain its actions. The queen slowly floats over, gently petting one of the Snorunt. The Snorunt looks up cautiously…when the queen grabs it hard, lifts it up for all to see, eyes glowing with rage, ice suddenly covering the Snorunt from head to toe – exactly like the Snorunt-statues you saw earlier! The queen then tosses the frozen Snorunt aside, visibly sighing. Looks like you just solved the mystery of the ice sculptures…<br />
<br />
You don’t dare to move a muscle as you watch the queen gracefully float to her throne. The remaining male Snorunt is quickly on his feet, dashing into hiding, for understandable reasons. Your Pokémon are suddenly far less attracted to the Froslasses around you, looking at you for any sort of indication as to how you’ll get out of this potential mess. The queen waves her hand again, seeming utterly bored now, and suddenly the Frosslasses grab you and your team – two of them holding your hands behind your back, one holding Boing and another holding Larry. The queen’s eyes glow a soft purple…right before Boing starts to transmit something to you in a very low voice, his eyes shining a bright purple: “I wouldn’t try anything funny if I were you. These little children are no match for me, surely you realize that? My servant may have lead you here and he’s paying for that dearly. Now what should I do with you?” She taps a finger on her temple in mock wonder, clearly toying with you. <br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b>Thrain:</b> <i>The two toddlers stare at the Pokéball as it rolls on the ground before halting with a soft tud. Then they turn to look at each other.<br />
<br />
“Told you so. Dummy.”<br />
<br />
“AM NOT!”<br />
<br />
“ARE TOO!”<br />
<br />
“AM NOT!”<br />
<br />
The two children are scared silent when you approach them, as kind as your demeanor is. When you ask them for their names and give a gentle scolding about catching Pokémon at random, both of them stare at their shoe-covered toes. “Sowwy. We di’nt know.” The little boy then proceeds to promptly stick his right thumb in his mouth. Truly a great Pokémon trainer in the making, you think to yourself while trying to hold a straight face. The girl is getting over the initial silence, starting to blabber excitedly. “I’m Nora, and that big baby’s Tommy. We’re on a fiel twip. Is that your Pokey-mon? Is it stwong? Can it spwit fire? Are you a twainer? How many Pokey-mon do you have? Where are you fwom? What-“ <br />
<br />
Your head starts to spin a little from all the questions, but before you can start to answer even a single one, you hear a voice from behind the children. “Nora! Tommy! I told you to stay with the group!” A young woman wearing an apron approaches you, waving her hand, pouting a little at the kids. The duo in question mutters apologies and grabs on to the woman’s apron obediently. The lady sighs and turns to you. “I’m sorry if these two caused any trouble, they’re quite the handful. Turn your eyes away for one second and off they go.” She extends her hand while smiling. “I’m Lora, I’m an assistant at the local daycare center. The kids and I are on a field trip. We’re going to see some Pokémon at the Friend Park.” She notices your quizzical expression. “You must be new here. The Friend Park is a place where people can interact and play with Pokémon in a safe, friendly environment. There’s plenty of different Pokémon of a number of types. We’ve got a few children who’ve never seen Pokémon before, and we’re trying to get them used to Pokémon early on.” Lora looks down at Nora and Tommy. “Since I don’t have eyes in the back of my head and I’m alone with these two and eight other children…would you mind coming with us? I could use the help and I’m sure the kids would love to hear stories from a real Pokémon trainer!” She waves her hands apologetically. “Oh, silly me, you must be so busy with other things…but is there any way I could convince you? I think I’ve got something I could give you when we return to the daycare center afterwards.” Lora, Nora and Tommy all turn on the Puppy-Dog Eye of Doom, staring at you in a begging manner.<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: darkorchid"><span style="font-size: 9px">As they made their way back the way they came, Keith, Marion, and Connor were all on high alert, all of them made wary by their previous Seviper encounter, and not inclined at all to tangle with something worse. Then, they heard them- quiet footsteps, from another path, and from the sound of it, they were going to encounter the source of those footsteps at the next intersection! Aislyn caught the scent of the unknown being, and cringed, much to Keith's confusion. Then, they saw it, and for a moment, Keith didn't know what it was. Then, his eyes widened as it uttered &quot;Trubbish?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh,&quot; Keith exclaimed. &quot;It's a... It's a...&quot; he added excitedly as his Pokedex finished his sentence for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trubbish, the Trash Bag Pokemon. It prefers unsanitary environments. Inhaling the gas they belch will make you sleep for a week.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Keith, ahem, reacted to the sudden appearance of the <b><i><u><span style="font-size: 12px">CUTEST DAMN POKEMON IN THE ENTIRE WORLD</span></u></i></b>, Marion shook him back to reality, as Trubbish started running towards them. Ecstatic, Keith held out his arms... and the Trubbish ran right past him, opting instead to hug Marion's legs.<br />
<br />
A discussion ensued as to what to do with the Trubbish, with most of Keith's suggestions somehow seeming to involve the usage of one of his empty Poke Balls on it. He tried to reach for the Trubbish in a friendly way, but it merely stuck its tongue out at him and hid behind Marion.<br />
<br />
Keith sighed. &quot;Come on, Trubbish,&quot; he said in a gentle and friendly voice. &quot;It's alright, you can trust me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A-hem,&quot; interrupted Myrtle. &quot;So not sor-ry to in-ter-rupt your lit-tle talk, Meat Sack, but have you for-got-ten that I can trans-late what the Trub-bish says for us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, right,&quot; nodded Keith. &quot;Go ahead, Myrtle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Myrtle had a short discussion with the Trubbish, and translated the facts; the Trubbish had been playing outside her village with other Trubbish (the very mention of which made it necessary to shake Keith back to reality a second time) when they found some Pokemon Eggs, and she hid one of them in a pile of trash in their secret hideout. Then, a Seviper with a scar on its face ambushed it, and she got lost in the cave as she ran away. As it happens, she was glad to see some non-Seviper life-forms for a change, and wanted to tag along with them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw,&quot; sighed Keith as he heard the Trubbish's story. &quot;Well, Trubbish, it's certainly OK with me if you tag along with us,&quot; he said, still using a friendly tone of voice, determined to earn the Poison-type's trust. &quot;Marion, Connor, you guys are all right with this, right?&quot; he added hopefully.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px">uhhhhh, Missingno. Master &amp; Marion Ette: <i>With Connor riding his Girafarig, your group starts slowly but surely moving toward the way you came. Every single one of you on high alert in case the Sevipers return or something worse comes up. This is exactly why you don’t miss the quiet footsteps that echo from another path – walking right toward the intersection you’re headed to! All capable trainers grab a Pokéball just in case, slowly and quietly approaching the intersection. Aislyn seems to have caught the scent of whatever it is that’s walking around…and she visibly cringes. A bit confused by this, you look ahead, the footsteps getting a little louder.<br />
<br />
First you see something small. Something gray. Or is it green? Wait, there’s pink too. The creature turns your way.<br />
<br />
“Trubbish?” A trashbag-like Pokémon, which the Poison-expert of the group recognizes as Trubbish, cocks its head a little in confusion, staring at you all.<br />
<br />

<br />
Once Marion manages to shake her friend back to the realm of the calm and collected, Trubbish suddenly develops a sparkle in its eyes – dashing at you with its small feet. Keith is absolutely overjoyed, extending his arms toward the small Poison-type…and gets watch the Trubbish dash right past him to Marion, tugging on her dress happily. This Trubbish must be quite young, acting much like a small child. It doesn’t seem dangerous though, busy hugging Marion’s legs. You try to have a civil discussion about what to do with the Trubbish, but all conversation gets stomped by resident Poison-fanatic crushing all objections, trying to reach for the Trubbish in a friendly manner. It sticks its tongue out at Keith before hiding behind Marion. One thing you do figure out: asking a Ghost-Pokémon to translate for you, you start digging for some information from the Trubbish. The story goes along these lines: the Trubbish was playing happily outside its village with other Trubbish (Keith needs to be shaken to reality again) when they ran into a pile of Pokémon eggs. Not knowing any better, the Trubbish took one and hid it in a pile of trash at their secret hideout as treasure and resumed their hide-and-seek. Unfortunately, this very Trubbish was ambushed by a Seviper of all things, a very nasty one with a scar on its face, and it ran all the way to this cave…only to get lost in the process. Trubbish, a female as it turns out, had been looking for a way out for a long while now, and was glad to see other life forms than Sevipers for a change. Looks like the little one wants to tag along…<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: darkorchid"><span style="font-size: 9px">As the trio slowly head back to the entrance, each of them being extremely cautious of their surrounding just in case something attack them again. All of them suddenly heard footsteps and they became tense as Gaspard, Foster, and Biondello got themselves ready to attack just in case and Connor instinctively grabbed another Pokeball just in case as they slowly approached the intersection. He personally did not want to have any more trouble today. As they inched closer, Connor noticed how Aislyn seemed to have smelled something and seemed to have cringed. He too notices the scent and instinctively covered his nose, it seemed that whoever was making the footsteps has a really... <i>noticeable</i>... scent, to put it politely. The group then see who it was, a Trubbish. Connor eased a bit slightly as if knowing what's going to happen as he looked at Keith. &quot;Yup. Just as I thought,&quot; he said as he chuckled and grabbed his Pokedex to scan the Trubbish... only for Keith to finish what the Pokedex was going to say.<br />

</blockquote>&quot;-bish, the Trash Bag Pokemon. It prefers unsanitary environments. Inhaling the gas they belch will make you sleep for a week.&quot; says Keith.<br />
<br />
As Marion shook Keith back to reality, the Trubbish seemed to have a sparkle in its eyes, dashing towards Keith who already extended his arms towards the Trubbish... and then ran past him and was running towards Marion instead as it tugged on her dress. Keith tries to be friendly towards the Trubbish but all of his approaches were quickly shot down but the little trash bag before hiding underneath Marion. Foster couldn't help but laugh mockingly at these strange turn of events for Keith.<br />
<br />
As the group settled down, they discussed about what to do with the Trubbish, &quot;So... what should we do about it? And no Keith, we're not going to stuff it in into one of your Pokeballs first,&quot; he quickly said to Keith with a smile before he continued, &quot;Well, it doesn't seem harmless at least. But what's it's story though? I think we should ask it first before we decide on anything.&quot; thankfully Myrtle and Foster were there to translate for them and the two ghosts asked about its story and quickly translated them to Keith, Marion, and Connor. After hearing her story, Keith immediately suggested that they help the little girl out, hoping to earn her trust and convince her to join his team. <br />
<br />
Connor contemplated for a bit before he sighed, &quot;I see... I think I have a good idea on what's going on here. That egg she mentioned earlier... and those Sevipers that we fought. They were all female right? I remember Pomona's Attract failing at them before I was... bitten. This is all nothing but speculation, but I think it's very probable here. Could those Sevipers that we have met before possibly be the mothers of those eggs? And that our little friend here possibly took one of them away? I think we need to ask her more about what the egg looks like, but if my suspicions are true then I think we found our reason why the Sevipers did go out and attack not just us but also this Trubbish and those cartographers from earlier. Not to mention this little Trubbish is lost too and doesn't know the way back to her village,&quot; he said to Keith and Marion. &quot;Well, we can't exactly turn a blind eye on this now can we? All right, I'm fine with it. We'll help you get back to your clan alright little Trubbish?&quot; he said to her with a gentle smile and would have have pet her too were it not for him sitting on his Girafarig's back right now. He turned to face Marion as if knowing what she was going to say, &quot;Marion, don't worry about my leg. I'll be fine, I promise! Me and Biondello will try to keep our distance should a fight happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh and by the way you two,&quot; he said as he showed his camera to them, the display showing a picture of the Poison-type trainer's face who was in trance, &quot;I took this one when Foster and Myrtle mentioned about the Trubbish village. The look on your face was priceless! I couldn't help myself, sorry! Heheh,&quot; he grinned. &quot;But that's not why I showed my camera to you guys right now, you see... remember Jon and Jen? Well...&quot; he pressed a button on his camera to switch photos to that of the <a href="http://bmgf.bulbagarden.net/f252/cascadia-124768/index3.html#post4337765" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fbmgf.bulbagarden.net%2Ff252%2Fcascadia-124768%2Findex3.html%23post4337765&amp;hash=74af8a495e8d081124f2b28643d48626" rel="nofollow noopener">photo of the map of Bane Forest</a> from the cartographers they have met earlier, &quot;They did mention earlier that the Trubbish Village was somewhere out in the Bane Forest. That's got to be where this Trubbish lives. We should be able to find it easily with this map here... except I'm no good at reading maps so... Marion, you hold on to this for a bit, alright? And no deleting that photo of Keith I took earlier, alright?&quot; Connor grinned while handing over his camera to Marion where the photo of the map was still displayed on the screen. &quot;However, this means that we'll have to turn back <i>again</i> to where we fought the Sevipers. That path would most likely lead us into the Bane Forest. I can hope those Sevipers aren't fully recovered yet from our brawl earlier by the time we get back there... having to fight them again's the last thing we want to do right now.&quot;</span></span></div>

<br />
<b>Auronos Caverns</b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>ApertureScience</u>:</b> You aren’t exactly off to the greatest start. Chilling out one moment, fighting a hungry shark the next with no help in sight for miles around…<br />
<br />
Maxwell is swimming for his dear life, trying to outrun the Sharpedo – with little success – while paying attention to your orders. As you instruct him to go on the defensive with Aqua Ring, he slows down briefly to focus, and the predator takes its chance to speed up and <b>Bite</b> his arm ferociously!<br />
<br />
Struggling to break free from the hold, in visible pain, Maxwell somehow musters up the strength to yank his arm away. You can’t assess the damage from where you are, but forcefully pulling away from a row of sharp teeth must have left a mark… You’re worried sick for Max’s safety now, but there’s not much you can do other than continue the battle!<br />
<br />
Your Buizel dutifully summons several blue orbs that envelope him, but before he can consume one, the Sharpedo goes back on the offensive, this time moving in for an even deadlier <b>Crunch</b>!! Yet somehow, maybe by pure instinct, Max dodges the charge at the last second by submerging briefly, then resurfacing behind the disoriented shark. And then…<br />
<br />
He raises his fingers and starts motioning them rhythmically, the tips glowing white before fading… It’s all riding on this one. The odds of a helpful move in the water, against a faster and stronger opponent, are very slim… From all the maneuvers to be executed, what’s the likelihood that it’ll actually do any good <i>here</i>?<br />
<br />
Maxwell’s eyes start glowing with a blue hue, he arches his body back… and unleashes the largest stream of water you’ve ever seen, much larger than someone his size should be able to muster. Even from where you’re standing the move is clear to you… it’s a massive <b>Water Spout</b>!! The blast hits Sharpedo dead on, and effective or not, the sheer force of the jet propels the attacker so far it’s suddenly out of your field of vision!<br />
<br />
Gasping for air, visibly exhausted and in pain, your Buizel takes a brief moment to consume an orb and recover before swimming back to you as fast as he can. Worried, you take a look at his arm… it’s bleeding from two deep cuts, and the salt water has to be making the pain even worse. He needs medical assistance, but you’re stranded in the middle of nowhere! Lucky as you were to fend off the threat, you’re still not in the clear, and you realize that whatever you do has to be quick in case the Sharpedo comes back.<br />
<br />
Trying to think of something, <i>anything</i>, you fail to notice Maxwell calling for your attention until he hits you in the arm. Brought back to Earth, you see he’s telling you to look in the distance, in the same direction the Sharpedo was propelled. Was it coming back?! No… it was a noise… the sound of an engine! Squinting, you spot a speedboat headed straight in your direction. Even more bad news, or the second lucky break in a row?...<br />
<br />
The boat slows down as it draws closer; at least you’re not getting rammed. Coming to a halt, the single occupant leans over and extends a hand, which you instinctively grab – you don’t really have much in the way of options, and this might be your chance to get Maxwell fixed up. You look at your apparent rescuer – no more than 20 years old, you guess, with short blonde hair combed to the side, light-blue eyes and clean-shaven. The look on his face appears to be one of admiration and surprise, as he stares at you for a good while before speaking, as if measuring you up.<br />
<br />
-	Dude, that was <i>insane</i>! Your Buizel is off the charts!! You gotta be an awesome Trainer to have it pull off an attack like that, how long did it take for you to teach it to him?!<br />
<br />
As he raves about your feat, deeply convinced that it was entirely a matter of skill, you give him a confused look. He witnessed the whole fight? He catches your stare and interrupts himself.<br />
<br />
-	I’m sorry man, I think I owe you an explanation. My name’s Sean, I’m a Gym Leader at Brine Island’s Salin City. And if you can’t guess by my name… - he reaches for a Pokeball in his belt and shows it to you – then I should tell you that the Sharpedo you just fought… is mine.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, you’re at a loss. This guy might be your only hope of healing Maxwell… but he’s the one responsible for his injury in the first place! The hell was he thinking?!<br />
<br />
-	Look, I know you’re probably pissed. You have every right to be… But I had to know if I could count on you. You see, I spotted you with my binoculars a while ago, and I could tell you’re not just deepsea diving here by chance. You’re after something, and well, so am I! But what I’m looking for ain’t just any old cave of legend, filled with loot that may or may not be rusty kitchenware. I’m after something a lot more valuable, and a lot more dangerous… and I can’t do it on my own! So when I saw you, I had to test your mettle, get it? And <i>man</i>, did you deliver! I don’t think any of my own Water-Types could pull off a move like that, you’re the man! So…<br />
<br />
He opens his backpack and retrieves a Super Potion, which he hands to Maxwell and urges him to drink.<br />
<br />
-	… you in? With our combined talents – and my diving gear, which you seem to lack -, I’m sure we’ll find some amazing stuff in no time! What’s a little danger for a wicked Trainer like you?!<br />
<br />
Sean is deeply convinced that you’re the greatest Trainer he’s ever seen, not once contemplating the possibility that Maxwell doesn’t really know the Water Spout it used. He seems intent on finding something in particular, which may be completely irrelevant to you and even put you in harm’s way. On the other hand, he does have proper equipment which could help you in your own adventure, and it’s right there on the far end of the speedboat…<br />
<br />
A number of possibilities are at your disposal now. How will you deal with this man, after all he has said and done?</span></span>

<br />
The battle began quickly, with the Sharpedo biting down on Maxwell. James cringed at this and would’ve grabbed a potion then and there if he wasn’t too anxious about the battle. The weasel evaded the Sharpedo’s last attack- “Oh thank Arceus…” James thought, before finding that he wanted to hug Arceus. The WATER SPOUT that ensued was massive, and Maxwell’s luck was so unbelievable that James struggled to comprehend what just happened. Maxwell kicked up his tails and rode over to James to slap him back into reality with his uninjured arm.<br />
<br />
“Right, better fix up that arm quick before that Sharpedo comes back…” James said, swinging his waterproof- pack over his shoulder to search through it. His hands dug into the organized chaos that was the bag, hunting for a Potion and gauze. He barely felt the first punch, but most certainly noticed the WATER GUN sprayed at him. “Gah, what is it…” He looked up and squinted to closer see the dot on the horizon. His fears that it was the Sharpedo again were quickly put to rest, however, when he heard the whir of an engine… Which meant it was a boat. “Now watch, Maxwell, as it mows us down.” Maxwell shot a glare which clearly meant, “Stop being a pessimistic dumbass and find the gauze.” “Relax, I’m sure nothing bad will happen. Maybe they’ll help us.” James calmly said, and waved over to the boatman.<br />
<br />
The boat slowed as it reached him, and a man extended his hand. James zipped up the bag before reaching with one hand, Maxwell in the other. The captain pulled him up and James fell to the floor of the boat, setting Maxwell on the ground to sit while James stood up. “Let’s see, first impressions… Surfer. Beach boy, at least.” He thought to himself, sizing his rescuer up while he did the same. The pilot of the boat began to speak about Maxwell, raving about the weasel’s and James’ skills. “How did you see the fight?” James said, having no desire to introduce himself, the same as the other. What irritated him was that this man could’ve helped Maxwell and instead decided to sit on his boat and do diddly squat while Max was mauled. He introduced himself as Sean, a Gym Leader in Salin City, who happened to own a Sharpedo. James gave him a mental middle-finger. He then goes on to explain his plans, and handed a Super Potion- even better than what James would’ve done- to Maxwell. The Water-type gave no regards to modern machinery and bit off the top, dripping it slowly among the wound on his arm. The salt water within was pushed out, and the cut was even starting to heal a bit along the edges.<br />
<br />
“Well, first of all, Maxwell here,” James began, pointing to his Buizel, “doesn’t know Water Spout. He knows Metronome. Almost every move is at his disposable, it’s just a bit random on which ones he uses. Second, we certainly weren’t finding anything on our own, so we might as well team up. Now, where do we start? I’m ready when you are.” He said, keeping an eye on Maxwell's arm.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"><br />

I'm back with updates! Have fun, I'll try to get into a more regular updating schedule now that things are getting more regulated in my life.<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px">uhhhhh, Missingno. Master &amp; Marion Ette: <i>With Connor riding his Girafarig, your group starts slowly but surely moving toward the way you came. Every single one of you on high alert in case the Sevipers return or something worse comes up. This is exactly why you don’t miss the quiet footsteps that echo from another path – walking right toward the intersection you’re headed to! All capable trainers grab a Pokéball just in case, slowly and quietly approaching the intersection. Aislyn seems to have caught the scent of whatever it is that’s walking around…and she visibly cringes. A bit confused by this, you look ahead, the footsteps getting a little louder.<br />
<br />
First you see something small. Something gray. Or is it green? Wait, there’s pink too. The creature turns your way.<br />
<br />
“Trubbish?” A trashbag-like Pokémon, which the Poison-expert of the group recognizes as Trubbish, cocks its head a little in confusion, staring at you all.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://ossukaru.deviantart.com/art/Rena-Omochikaeri-2-Vector-89791553" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fossukaru.deviantart.com%2Fart%2FRena-Omochikaeri-2-Vector-89791553&amp;hash=b9d19da725de9b13d72e69cc3fb6673a" rel="nofollow noopener">Keith has an appropriate reaction.</a><br />
<br />
Once Marion manages to shake her friend back to the realm of the calm and collected, Trubbish suddenly develops a sparkle in its eyes – dashing at you with its small feet. Keith is absolutely overjoyed, extending his arms toward the small Poison-type…and gets watch the Trubbish dash right past him to Marion, tugging on her dress happily. This Trubbish must be quite young, acting much like a small child. It doesn’t seem dangerous though, busy hugging Marion’s legs. You try to have a civil discussion about what to do with the Trubbish, but all conversation gets stomped by resident Poison-fanatic crushing all objections, trying to reach for the Trubbish in a friendly manner. It sticks its tongue out at Keith before hiding behind Marion. One thing you do figure out: asking a Ghost-Pokémon to translate for you, you start digging for some information from the Trubbish. The story goes along these lines: the Trubbish was playing happily outside its village with other Trubbish (Keith needs to be shaken to reality again) when they ran into a pile of Pokémon eggs. Not knowing any better, the Trubbish took one and hid it in a pile of trash at their secret hideout as treasure and resumed their hide-and-seek. Unfortunately, this very Trubbish was ambushed by a Seviper of all things, a very nasty one with a scar on its face, and it ran all the way to this cave…only to get lost in the process. Trubbish, a female as it turns out, had been looking for a way out for a long while now, and was glad to see other life forms than Sevipers for a change. Looks like the little one wants to tag along…<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: darkorchid"><span style="font-size: 9px">Marion and Keith lead Biondello towards the entrance of the cave, ensuring that their steps are slow and measured so that the Girafarig can keep up. The trio, wary of future attackers, does their best to minimize the amount of noise they make, limiting their sound production to mere footsteps. Every so often, Marion turns back to check on Biondello and Connor, just to make sure that Connor is still conscious and stable, and that Biondello is not too fatigued by the task of transporting his trainer through the cave. Both trainer and Pokemon seem in good spirits, so the trek continues... though Marion tries to stay focused on watching out for potential danger, her mind is far too distracted by all that has happened to her and her friends thus far. Seviper nests... A possible clan of Trubbish... flying garbage... the cartographers Jon and Jen... There was definitely more than meets the eye going on around here, but with Connor in his current state, it was best to get him to the surface and help him recover before even so much as attempting to go back inside. Even if she did return to satisfy her curiosity, she would likely have to rely on her strongest Pokemon; calling out Sakura before had definitely been a mistake. She only hoped that the little trainee Pokemon would forgive her for putting her in such a dangerous situation, albeit unintentionally. And what was with that Seviper with a scar, anyway? Had a flying piece of trash cut the creature so deep that it endured an impromptu lobotomy? Was something more sinister going on? These thoughts swirl around in Marion's head, and in her attempts to process them, she almost misses the sound of footsteps in the cave, though Aislyn's sudden change in expression shakes Marion out of her reverie. At first, the Ninetales' ears perk, her eyes immediately turning in the direction of the footsteps... then, her nose begins to crinkle up as she makes a face, as if disgusted by something. Though the trainers become aware of the smell some time after the perceptive fire fox does, Marion recognizes her Pokemon's expression immediately. It was the same expression she made when Marion tried giving her organic, vitamin-rich Pokechow at the recommendation of Nurse Joy when Aislyn was just a young Vulpix, and she had reacted as if she had been given a plate full of Tauros dung. Clearly, something in the air smelled vile to her, but what could it be...?<br />
<br />
&quot;Be careful,&quot; she advises her friends, in a quiet voice. &quot;I'm not sure what Aislyn smells, but I'm hoping it's not some kind of poisonous gas or something. Stay alert.&quot; Soon enough, the smell makes itself known to Marion's nostrils... The faint scent of rancid garbage, which becomes more and more distinct as the footsteps grow louder. As Aislyn focuses on the direction of the noise, poised to attack, Marion's hand hovers over her Dragonite's Pokeball, ready to call out her beloved defender if necessary. Her hand moves away from the Pokeball the moment she sees the source of the scent and footsteps, however; while the other two trainers pull out their Pokedex, Marion nods to August and motions for her to ease up a bit. After all, Marion could easily recognize the Pokemon from earlier conversations in the Bar with Keith, in which he had expressed to her just how much he had wanted this very garbage-like creature to join his team. The last thing Marion wanted to do was ruin Keith's chances at a Trubbish by having Aislyn destroy the poor thing with her powerful fire attacks. Marion turns to Keith, hoping that he will make some sort of logical move towards capturing or befriending the little Trubbish, but the moment the adorable garbage bag cocks her head with curiosity at the sight of the three trainers, he seems nearly paralyzed with cute overload, his eyes glittering with such a starstruck gaze that Marion wonders briefly if his brain has become a supernova. Sighing a bit, she gently grabs him by the shoulders and gives him a little bit of a shake, trying to talk some sense into him; &quot;Keith, don't you think we should be figuring out what that Trubbish is doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the little Trubbish develops an adoring sparkle in its eyes, much as Keith had done moments before. Keith flings out his arms wide with a huge smile on his face as it makes a mad dash towards the trio, and Marion briefly thinks about how wonderful it was that the poison Pokemon had recognized Keith's adoration and love for it, and that the love was being responded to with such fervor; she is startled a bit at the sudden tug at the frayed ends of her dress, which had been torn to help create a bandage for Connor. Its little garbage hands smear all over the pale fabric; thankfully, Marion does not seem to mind the mess very much, chuckling a bit at the sheer irony that the garbage bag Pokemon was drawn to the trainer who had the absolute least intent on capturing it. Even so, Marion had a surprisingly big heart when it came to Pokemon of all kinds, and the Trubbish's enthusiasm was infectious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there! Nice to meet you,&quot; Marion greets the Trubbish with a gentle smile. Keith is startled out of his cuteness trance by the rejection, and Marion gives him a bit of an embarrassed look, shaking her head as if trying to convey the fact that she had no intention of taking the Trubbish from him. He pulls out a Pokeball and eagerly suggests capturing Marion's new admirer, which is met with a bit of sass from the Trubbish, who hides behind Marion in protest. It clings to Marion's legs, and though the feeling of garbage clinging to her bare skin is... less than pleasant, she inhibits her discomfort surprisingly well under the circumstances. &quot;We don't want to scare it away,&quot; she gently responds to Keith's vehement desire to go in for the capture immediately. &quot;Why don't we try having our Pokemon talk to it first and maybe see if it knows something about what's going on around here...?&quot; Myrtle and Foster are quick to remind the trainers that they can translate the Trubbish's speech. From Myrtle and Foster's description, it sounds as if the little one (who was apparently female) had run away from the Trubbish Village she called home... Before Myrtle and Foster can continue, Marion finds herself gently shaking Keith's shoulder once again, as the cuteness coma threatens to render him braindead. &quot;We should listen to the rest of the story before daydreaming about a village full of Trubbish,&quot; she says with a bit of a laugh. The curious young Pokemon had apparently gotten her hands on a Pokemon egg, which she stored in a hidden location before resuming a game of hide-and-seek with her friends. She was attacked by a Seviper that matched the description of the one that had bitten Connor, and she had ran all the way to the cave. Perhaps that same Seviper was out looking for her, and that's why they ended up running into it at the cave...<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like the same Seviper that bit our friend,&quot; Marion says to the Trubbish, gesturing to Connor. &quot;It was very mean to us. I am sorry to hear that it was mean to you, too.&quot; Connor and Keith seem enthusiastic about helping the Trubbish get back to her clan. Marion sighs a bit, looking hesitant. &quot;Connor, you-&quot; As if anticipating her concern, Connor immediately cuts her off, letting her know that he will be fine. Connor then remembers the picture he took of Bane Forest, and decides to hand Marion his camera; before that, however, he shows off a perfectly-executed shot of Keith's wide-eyed Trubbish admiration before flipping the picture, and Marion stifles a giggle. Connor teases Marion, saying that she's not allowed to delete the photo of Keith; &quot;Hah, are you kidding? That's hilarious,&quot; she replies with a wide grin. She takes a quick photo of the photograph of the map (a bit of photoception) with her Xtranceiver, and hands the camera back to Connor. &quot;Here, I don't want to be responsible for your camera if it breaks. I tend to be really clumsy with technology... Besides, if we get separated for some reason, I want both of us to have a copy of the map.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sensing that the Trubbish would likely respond to her better than Connor or Keith, she offers her open arms to the small garbage bag, kindly offering to pick her up and carry her. After all, if she had ran all the way to the cave from her home, her legs must be incredibly tired. If she accompanied them, perhaps she could convince her fellow Trubbish to let them into the village and avoid any conflict with the residents, which would not only be rife with research interest and photo opportunities for Marion and Connor respectively, but Keith would certainly be happy to go and see so many Trubbish in one place... Perhaps there would be one that would take a liking to him, as this little girl had taken a liking to Marion. Besides, if those eggs had anything to do with what was going on in the cave, it would be wise to get a closer look at the Trubbish's stowed treasure. She gives the Trubbish a gentle smile. &quot;What do you say? Want us to take you back to your village?&quot;</span></span></div>

I'm back with updates! Have fun, I'll try to get into a more regular updating schedule now that things are getting more regulated in my life.<br />
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b>Meetan:</b> <i>”Oh, right. Alice, sorry, I-I-I’m bad with n-n-n-names…” Kenny blushes to the shade of a fire truck, writing so fast you’re half-expecting the paper to catch on fire. Aw, does the young boy have a crush? Wingy the Pidgey float in front of Kenny’s face, flapping his wings to create a little breeze – probably mistaking the cause for a fever. Pichu giggles a little before playfully pouncing Wingy, the two play-battling and tackling each other on the ground in front of you. You’re happy to see the two Pokémon getting along so well so quickly, but get snapped back into reality when Kenny softly taps your shoulder with his index finger. “S-s-s-sorry, but I-I-I-I have just a f-f-few more questions, then we’re s-s-s-set to go. Could you h-h-h-help out a little?” The Puppy-Dog Eyes of Doom are back, so you sigh and take the offered paper from him again. Before you get to reading the questions, you take note that Pichu’s climbing on Wingy’s back, the latter then flying a few feet from the ground – it doesn’t seem like anything you should worry about, since Pichu seems to be loving the ride. “I-I-I-I’ve never seen that happen, a flying Pichu.” Kenny laughs a little. He might have to give flirting a few more years, but you decide to humor him with a laugh of your own. Then you turn your attention to the cursed homework.<br />
<br />
7. Describe the appearance and effects of a Hondew Berry.<br />
8. Name all evolved forms of Eevee.<br />
9. Revival Herbs grow in only one place. Name this location. <br />
10. What kind of locations is the Mouse Pokémon Raichu fond of?<br />
<br />
After you’ve helped Kenny with his homework, he looks delighted. “Thank you so much! I-I-I have no idea why they ask us th-th-this stuff…will we ever r-r-really need to know all this?” Kenny looks around for a bit. “H-h-hey, where’d Wingy and Pichu go?” You both start looking around, the two Pokémon aren’t big and strong enough to have gotten too far. “M-m-maybe they’re playing hide and s-s-s-seek?” Kenny wonders out loud, scampering back up from the ground after checking under a few nearby bushes. Suddenly, you hear two loud cries and crackling electricity – that must be Pichu, and distressed at that! You’re dashing at the voices before you even realize it, Kenny trying hard to keep up with you. Finally, you reach a little alley way that leads to a dead end, trash and trash cans littering the place. Before you have the time to wonder what on earth got Pichu to come in this messy place, you hear the cry of your little friend. At the end of the alley, you see three boys who look about the same age as Kenny. They’ve surrounded Pichu and Wingy, the two Pokémon looking terrified – but Pichu’s trying to be brave, electricity coming from its cheeks. The boys aren’t fazed, instead laughing at your friends: “You think that’s gonna scare us? You little rat!”<br />
<br />
What will you do?</i></span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: deepskyblue"><span style="font-size: 9px">Alice smiles at Kenny regardless, telling him sweetly that it’s alright and that it sometimes happens with her, too. After all, she’s visited quite a few places by now and met a fair few people, not to mention all the new teachers and students at the academy she had spent so long studying at.<br />
<br />
“Alrighty, a Hondew Berry...” The girl taps his pen on the counter, grinning at Pichu and Wingy, who seem to be getting on splendidly. She was worried for the bird Pokemon, however. The baby mice were notorious for zapping others and themselves by accident, and Pidgey would definitely feel it if such an accident happened. Unwilling to interrupt their play session while it was going so well, she got on with the homework. “Well, there’s the kid’s story of Yellow Forest, where Pikachu fly attached to balloons. So why not a Pichu? Anyway...<br />
<br />
“A Hondew Berry is green with yellow bumps, and it has a stork with leaves on the top. If you feed it to a Pokemon it’ll be friendlier to you, but its special attacks will be weaker.” Alice began, pushing stray bangs behind her ear. “The evolved forms of Eevee are easier, and you should know these. Jolteon, Flareon, Vamporeon, Espeon, Umbreon, Leafeon and Glaceon.” She listed them off with a hint of scolding in her tone, “Revival Herbs grow on Milos Island. As for Raichu, I love them, so of course I’d know this. Forests, and places like Power Plants.”<br />
<br />
Satisfied that they were done, the girl couldn’t help but remark that as annoying as homework was, it was nostalgic to complete it. “Some people learn these things on their journey, but you definitely need to know it. Especially the berries and the Eeveelutions – the latter you should know already! Study harder.” She bopped his forehead with the pen, and then frowned as the boy noted their Pokemon had escaped them. Concerned, the trainer followed him from the cafe, even more alarmed at the sound of trouble, in which she picked up her pace.<br />
<br />
The sight they found in the alleyway evidently displeased her. The swimsuit-clad girl placed her hands on her hips.<br />
<br />
“Are you bullying my Pichu and her new friend, you little shits?” She replaced her sunglasses with regular ones, narrowing her eyes now that the punks were in perfect vision. The baby looked over, crying out. “If you weren’t scared then, you better be now. She’s young, but she’s had some training and seen some good battles already. You better apologise now and scram or we’ll /both/ Mega Kick you out of ever having children! Y’hear me?”<br />
<br />
This is why, cute kids like Kenny aside, she hated children.<br />

So welcome, ApertureScience, who may or may not be Tyoyo! <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite7" alt=":p" title="Stick Out Tongue    :p" data-shortname=":p" /> Hopefully you like your adventure, and if there’s something about my writing style that you don’t like, let me know.<br />

Again, if it seems you’ve been thrown in a random battle, it’s not the case. All battles in my updates have clear purposes, so please bear with them even if it isn’t your favourite thing!

Also, please let me know how many Pokemon you brought to this adventure considering the timeline, for future reference.))</span><br />
<br />
You figure the best – and perhaps only – way out is to reason with the native. After all, making a run for it while surrounded by buffalos didn’t exactly sound like a great plan.<br />
<br />
As you slowly address the man to make sure he understands what you’re saying, his eyes remain locked on you, expressionless. When you’re done talking, he spits on the ground and speaks back – perfectly fluently.<br />
<br />
-	Patronizing idiot of a Trainer. You judge me for my appearance, treat me like an ape? I can speak your language just fine, I am no savage. Would a savage land two arrows with pinpoint precision to stop you on your tracks? – he asks, his lips forming a proud grin. – Would a savage write you two messages that clearly told you to stay away?<br />
<br />
He motions his hand forward, and his Bouffalant charges with unbelievable speed for a beast of its size. Your eyes widen as you realize its aiming straight for your tree with no intention of slowing down… and it doesn’t, as it <b>Head Charge</b>s the tree with frightening strength! You lose your balance and tumble down to the floor below hard, a stinging pain running through your body as the right side of your ribcage meets the ground. Heracross can’t hold on either and falls as well, barely having time to spread his wings before crashing down.<br />
<br />
The Bouffalant now towers over you ominously; its rider dismounts and kneels in front of you, not the least bit fazed by your injury.<br />
<br />
-	You should have left. I gave you fair warning. We don’t want outsiders snooping around, disrupting our peace. But you’re not the first Trainer to disregard our missives, and you won’t be the last I stomp to death. You should nev… What?<br />
<br />
His eyes shift from you to your belt. Reaching out to it, he takes the Rocket Ball and Fire Ball and gazes at them in disbelief.<br />
<br />
-	These Pokeballs… How did you come by these? They’re… they’re exclusive to <i>them</i>! It’s impossible… Are you one of them?! Answer me!<br />
<br />
With no idea what he’s talking about, and the sheer pain you’re in making it impossible to talk back, you leave him with no answer for now. But the answer wouldn’t have mattered, as he hastily – and effortlessly – picks you up and lays you on Bouffalant’s back, then hops back on it as well and motions for the herd to follow him. Barely conscious, you watch as you’re taken away and Heracross is left behind, hurt on the ground, unable to give chase…<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
You’ve practically lost track of time by now, but you can’t have been riding for more than half an hour before you reach what seems the outside wall of a village, tall and made of round, vertically arranged logs ending in a spiked tip. The pain isn’t getting any better as the ride wasn’t exactly smooth, but it’s manageable now. You hear your captor talk to somebody.<br />
<br />
-	Let us through. I caught someone he’ll want to see.<br />
<br />
Once past the gates, it’s like a whole different world. People with similar skin tone and garments as the one that captured you start to flock toward you, looking with curiosity at you while the Bouffalant rider takes you… somewhere. Being the target of indiscrete stares while mangled on top of a buffalo isn’t really making you comfortable, but fortunately it seems you reach your destination soon as the whole herd stops moving.<br />
<br />
You feel yourself being lifted again and placed on the floor this time, and you find it’s difficult to keep your balance after the bumpy ride and the ribs still nagging. Making a run for it is once again impossible, as the injury wouldn’t let you go very far, and even if you were healthy, the man looks so athletic that he’d catch up to you in seconds. You have no option but to go where you’re told for now. If only Heracross were here…<br />
<br />
-	Inside. Now.<br />
<br />
You realize you’re standing in front of a very large and colorful tent. The scent emanating from inside reminds you of incense, actually quite pleasant. Without much of a choice, you walk inside, followed closely by the large man.<br />
<br />
Once inside the tent, you marvel at what you see. Dozens of candles lit, several incense burners, golden statuettes of multiple Pokemon… In the centre there is a long wooden red table with gold decorations, and at the far end of the table sits an old man, that slowly gets up as he sees you. A <i>very</i> old man, judging by his appearance: a long white beard covers most of his face, but he’s completely bald. His skin tone is noticeably lighter than that of the other natives, and his eyes are dark brown. His frame is small compared to the man that captured you, but he might still be slightly taller than you. Muscles are mostly nonexistent, as he’s practically all skin and bone – again, in stark contrast with your captor. He wears a long crimson toga, and a bead necklace like the others. His gives you a long, inquisitive look, and waits for an explanation.<br />
<br />
-	Saint, I found this man in the woods; he failed to heed my warning so I engaged him, and was about to dispose of him when something caught my attention…<br />
<br />
The man steps forward, and places the Rocket Ball and Fire Ball on the table before bowing respectfully and stepping back again. The elder picks them up in silence and twirls them in his fingers, studying the Pokeballs with evident interest. Then, returning them to you instead of the man, he places a hand on your shoulder and smiles.<br />
<br />
-	I see. You may be quite the special man, you know. Good find, Baro.<br />
<br />
He motions for you sit down as he does the same. Baro remains standing and looks troubled.<br />
<br />
-	Saint, then is he truly?...<br />
<br />
-	A User, yes, I believe it so. It would not have been possible for him to obtain these items otherwise, unless he murdered a true User, which… he doesn’t seem like the kind of man that would do so.<br />
<br />
The elder turns his attention to you again, still smiling.<br />
<br />
-	Well? Did you steal those special Pokeballs, or were they… given to you? Perhaps by a “higher power”? I know, I know you cannot speak of them. In fact, you may not even be able to <i>describe</i> them, or yourself, even if you wanted to… Ah yes, a true User. A Trainer who owns unique items, given to him by the overseers of his adventures. A Trainer with the power – or better, permission – to teach his Pokemon companions maneuvers that no regular Trainer could… Do you know what I speak of? Tell me, what is your name, User?<br />
<br />
He retrieves a vial from a drawer in the table and hands it over to you.<br />
<br />
-	Drink. It’ll help with your injuries. You must forgive Baro, he’s an impeccable hunter but not much of a… people person. Now, I know this must all be daunting, and I’m sure you have questions. So please ask, and I’ll answer to the best of my ability.<br />
<br />
This “Saint” seems to have good intentions. And more importantly, he’s said a number of things that are worth your attention; he seems to know a lot more about the world of Fizzy Bubbles than the common mortal should...<br />
<br />
What do you do?!</span></span>

</blockquote>OOC: I believe when I started, I only had Cyndaquil, Heracross, and Numel. Numel is definitely in the Rocket Ball, so we'll go with just the three of them. <br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: green">Chad awoke in immense pain, and he noticed he was on the back of a Bouffalant. He must have fallen out of the tree when the Bouffalant struck it. Perhaps he should not have spoken to the man the way he did. He wasn't sure why he took his Rocket Ball containing his Numel and his Fire Ball, but now he was down two of his three Pokemon. There was not much he could do currently due to the pain and the sheer number of Bouffalant that accompanied the man. All he could do was watch his Heracross lying on the ground unable to rescue one another.<br />
<br />
After some unknown amount of time, Chad, the man, and his Bouffalant arrived at the wood walled entrance to his village. Chad could just lift his head to see the pointed wooden posts that serve as the village's walls. He heard the man mention bringing him to see another. He wondered why. He looked around the village while they continued towards their destination. There were more people of the same skin tone as his captor, and they stared back at the stranger on laying on the back of the Bouffalant. Finally, the herd stopped. The man dismounted and lifted Chad off and stood him on the ground. He felt a little imbalanced after being draped over the Bouffalant for so long. No thought of escape ever entered Chad's mind, as the thought of quickly being caught by this muscular man did not appeal to him. He thought he would go along with things until he had more information. Then he would go find Heracross.<br />
<br />
The man pushed Chad into a large tent. Inside, he saw many candles and incense burners. There were many golden statues of Pokemon all over the room. His focus was drawn to the center to an old man sitting behind a table. He was noticeably smaller in stature than the man who captured Chad. His skin color was also lighter than his captor's, than the rest of the village too. The old man studied Chad for quite a while.<br />
<br />
&quot;Saint, I found this man in the woods;&quot; the man began to speak, &quot;he failed to heed my warning so I engaged him, and was about to dispose of him when something caught my attention…&quot; He approached the table and presented Chad's Rocket Ball and Fire Ball. After studying the two Pokeballs extensively, the elder returned them to Chad.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see. You may be quite the special man, you know,&quot; he spoke. The elder gestured to Chad to have a seat. &quot;Good find, Baro.&quot; That didn't comfort the man, as he still looked bothered by something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Saint, then is he truly?&quot; Baro asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A User, yes, I believe it so,&quot; Saint replied. &quot;It would not have been possible for him to obtain these items otherwise, unless he murdered a true User, which… he doesn’t seem like the kind of man that would do so.&quot; Chad focused on Saint, listening intently, trying to understand what was going on. The whole time he spoke, he seemed relieved.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well?&quot; Saint turned to face Chad. &quot;Did you steal those special Pokeballs, or were they… given to you? Perhaps by a “higher power”? I know, I know you cannot speak of them. In fact, you may not even be able to <i>describe</i> them, or yourself, even if you wanted to… Ah yes, a true User. A Trainer who owns unique items, given to him by the overseers of his adventures. A Trainer with the power – or better, permission – to teach his Pokemon companions maneuvers that no regular Trainer could… Do you know what I speak of? Tell me, what is your name, User?&quot; Chad shook his head after hearing Saint's questions.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Chad,&quot; he began explaining his story. &quot;I came to Silver Forest with my Heracross to celebrate his birthday.&quot; Chad held out his Rocket Ball and the Fire Ball. &quot;As for those two Pokeballs, I received an alternately-colored Numel as a trade from a friend recently. He's inside the Rocket Ball. The Fire Ball is empty, but one of my friends has a golden Torkoal that he was planning to trade to me when I see him next. I'm not sure what a User is, but I did not obtain my Numel or the Fire Ball in any dishonorable way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Saint took a vial from a drawer in the table and handed it over to Chad. &quot;Drink,&quot; he said. &quot;It’ll help with your injuries. You must forgive Baro, he’s an impeccable hunter but not much of a… people person. Now, I know this must all be daunting, and I’m sure you have questions. So please ask, and I’ll answer to the best of my ability.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad looked at the vial. He questioned to himself whether or not to trust Saint. Afterall, he was the one Baro delievered him to. For all he knew Saint could have handed him some poison! 'Then again,' Chad thought, 'if he was trying to poison him, would he really have given back his Pokeballs?' The pain he was feeling got the better of him, so Chad decided to drink the vial's contents. He figured he could get the information he was after while whatever he drank went to work.<br />
<br />
&quot;First, may I ask what I drank?&quot; It seemed like a good question to ask. &quot;Do you have any information about what a User is? Is something the matter here that I may be able to help out with? It's the least I could do for trespassing on your land. Also, I have a Heracross that was left in the forest when I was taken here. I said I would help out, but I must request to go find my friend first. He was injured from a fall, and I'm worried for his safety.&quot; Chad turned to Baro. &quot;I apologize for speaking to you the way I did. I should not have assumed anything.&quot;<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>Aduro Island</i></span><br />
<br />
<b>Geyser Park</b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Hayward</u>:</b> In a sudden moment of inspiration, you decide to at least <i>try</i> to minimize the casualties, refusing to accept a scenario where someone gets left behind. Banking everything on the chance that Teddiursa is a wild Pokemon, you pick a rare Chocolate Ball and pray that this works as you hop back on Skarméo to simultaneously rescue the man.<br />
<br />
Your Skarmory skillfully maneuvers around the falling boulders, making it exceedingly hard to aim at Teddiursa in the process. As a particularly large rock falls just next to you as you were about to throw the Ball, you’re forced to postpone the attempt lest you fall off the bird’s back. But time’s running out, as the entire cave is about to collapse!<br />
<br />
Skarméo grabs the man by his shoulders with her large talons; however, lifting him up with you already riding on her back proves challenging for the Skarmory, who for a brief moment seems unable to fly back up, seconds that look like decades as rubble keeps falling all around you. You see it as an opportunity to attempt the throw, and hurl the Pokeball as hard as you can across over the fissure, hitting the tiny cub and pulling it inside. However, before you can witness the result, the tunnel gives in and a number of large rocks come crashing down on the place where Teddiursa stood, making it impossible to spot the Chocolate Ball…<br />
<br />
From then on, everything happens way too quickly. Skarméo finally manages to take flight again, carrying both of you, putting her under enormous strain as she dodges most of the rubble as best she can. Immediately behind you the entire tunnel gives in, collapsing at alarmingly fast rate, with the Sarmory just barely staying ahead of the cave-in. Again her natural instincts, stemming from her past life as a wild Pokemon of Aduro Island, start to kick in, as if she knows exactly where to go. And just as it seems you’ll be crushed under the enormous boulders falling all around you, the bird spots a crevice on the ceiling leading outside – no doubt a large fissure that formed after this last earthquake. Flapping her metal wings as hard as she can, she heads for the crack on the tunnel ceiling, managing to pass through just as you duck and hold on to her neck as hard as you can – the hole seems too small to pass through, but somehow, some way, she pulls it off. You feel a sharp pain on your back as Skarméo flies through the crevice, a sharper rocky edge leaving a large cut, though fortunately not too deep, between your shoulder blades. And the next thing you know, you’re tumbling down hard, your Pokemon unble to fly any higher… but you’re on solid ground. Shoulder and back badly hurt, bleeding, but alive – as well as the man you rescued. Skarméo lies on the floor not far from you, eyes shut, having blacked out from exhaustion. You close your eyes shut for a split second, just a second to regroup, that’s all you need… just a minute… just ten minutes…<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
The sun shines bright and painful to your eyes. You try to move; you can’t. The pain coursing through your left arm and back won’t allow it. You feel the clothes pressed between your skin and the rocky soil moist, the cut must be bleeding. You look around confused, still laying face-up on the ground… It’s still daytime, so you can’t have been out for too long. Then, a child’s voice. At first imperceptible, but soon you realize what it says; one word.<br />
<br />
-	Dad? Dad! Daaad!!<br />
<br />
Struggling to roll over to your right side, you indeed spot a young boy kneeling over the man you rescued. He’s still passed out, and the kid is trying to wake him up. His son, no doubt. Next to him is an older woman, looking on with great concern, possibly his wife. She looks you’re your way; seeing you awake, she rushes toward you with the angriest expression you’ve ever seen on a woman before.<br />
<br />
-	What have you done to him?! Answer me!!<br />
<br />
Oh boy. This seems to be a fine day for misunderstandings; first the man, now his wife! Before you can answer, another, more familiar voice echoes through the air. An alarmed, painful “Skaaaaaaaar!”. To the left of the boy you spot Skarméo, still grounded, and pinned down by a relatively small Kangaskhan who’s having no trouble keeping the wounded bird on the ground. It seems she was made captive by the family’s Pokemon to ensure she wouldn’t harm them…<br />
<br />
-	What did you do to my husband? What did you do to him?!<br />
<br />
The woman kneels down and slaps you across the face with tears in her eyes. While the pain is nothing compared to what you’ve been through already, it’s enough to make your blood boil, after all you went through to save that bastard…<br />
<br />
Weakened, in dire need of medical treatment and fearing for the safety of Skarméo, as well as wondering, in the back of your mind, if the Teddiursa ever made it, your next words to the woman – and how convincing you sound – will be critical in deciding whether you’ll earn her help… or be left for dead.<br />
<br />
What do you do?</span><br />

<br />
<b><u>jolteonjak</u>:</b> Your reluctance is entirely understandable – brought into a stranger’s tent, offered a weird concoction with no explanation about its effects, and asked a number of questions that you don’t quite understand all of a sudden are more than enough reason to rise your suspicion.<br />
<br />
As politely as you can, you ask the man known as Saint what is you drank, to which Baro promptly intervenes.<br />
<br />
-	It is one of Saint’s secrets; using his divine knowledge, he has created a Potion for humans, akin to that widely used on Pokemon.<br />
<br />
The old man smiles at Baro’s immediate answer and looks at you.<br />
<br />
-	It’s simply a medicinal beverage I’ve created using a particular selection of Berries that I discovered to have healing properties in humans. Your pain will ease up in a little while, please be patient.<br />
<br />
With your mind somewhat more at rest, even though you’re curious about what Baro meant by “divine knowledge”, you inquire about the meaning of “Users” – the term is largely foreign to you in context, but Saint’s questions troubled you.<br />
<br />
The old man again opens the drawer on the table and retrieves an item, laying it on the table for you to see. The object is very familiar to you, but you onder how he can possibly have come across since the only way to own one was…<br />
<br />
-	This is a Magical Glass Rose. By the look in your eyes, I’d say you’re acquainted with it, which further proves my point. Users are just that… Trainers who know more than a regular one should.<br />
<br />
You get the feeling he is intentionally holding back information, but something tells you you know what he’s getting at…<br />
<br />
-	You may not realize it yet, but you’re part of something far greater than you can imagine, and far older than you’ve been told. A select number of Trainers, not only in Cascadia but the entire land of Fizzy Bubbles, have been blessed since ages long past with the ability to wield particular items that most others don’t even know exist. Had I shown this Glass Rose to any other Trainer, they would have dismissed it as an ornament; but you know better, you’re familiar with its purpose.<br />
<br />
He turns his attention to the big man still standing near the entrance.<br />
<br />
-	Baro, take our guest to the Old Wall. Maybe he’ll understand, like you did.<br />
<br />
Baro stiffened up for a brief moment, taken by surprise.<br />
<br />
-	Saint, are you?.... Yes, Saint.<br />
<br />
The old man put the Magical Glass Rose away and smiled at you once more.<br />
<br />
-	Go with Baro. There’s something important you need to see if you’re to comprehend the magnitude of your role in this land. Until you do, there is little you can assist me with, but return here after you’ve been to the Old Wall, if you so wish. I might have something to ask of you then.<br />
<br />
Baro motions for you to leave the tent, bowing to Saint before exiting himself. The day is warm outside, and a number of people are still gathered around the tent looking at you with great interest, much to your discomfort. Baro disperses the crowd and starts walking quickly with impressively large steps, as you struggle to keep up with him. You walk past the gates where you had come in from earlier on the Boufallant, and you wonder why you can’t ride the bull Pokemon again this time around.<br />
<br />
After what seems like half an hour of walking in complete silence through the forest outside the village, seemingly moving away from it, you decide to remind Baro about Heracross. Going back to get him was still your top priority, and it seems Saint had overlooked that part of your request. Baro stops and answers dryly, without even turning around.<br />
<br />
-	Saint believes you’re a User. If he’s right, then you have nothing to worry about; your Pokemon will find you wherever you are if you know how to call it. But you see…<br />
<br />
Only now does he turn to face you, an angry look on his face.<br />
<br />
-	I think Saint is wrong about you. You’re nothing remarkable, just another trespasser like so many before; the fact you happen to own those Pokeballs proves nothing about you. Saint’s been waiting so long for a true User to come about that I think it’s taken its toll on his judgment. Because there is no way…<br />
<br />
He brings his fingers to his lips and whistles, a melodic, unnatural tune unlike anything you’ve ever heard echoing throughout the woods. You never knew whistling could sound like that. And suddenly, you feel a weak tremor beneath your feet as the ground begins to shake.<br />
<br />
-	… there is no way you’re the same as me!!<br />
<br />
From the ground directly in front of Baro emerges a large Excadrill, menacingly spreading its claws as it looks your way.<br />
<br />
-	Prove me wrong boy, and I’ll accept you as a User. I’ll even teach you how to summon your Heracross and take you to the Old Wall! But if you fall to me, and you will, I’ll return to Saint with proof that you’re not all he hopes you to be.<br />
<br />
This is a clear challenge to a battle. The only way you’re getting Baro to trust you is by proving your worth to him, and you can already tell this isn’t going to be easy…<br />
<br />
What do you do?</span></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: deepskyblue"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>Crater Island</i></span><br />
<br />
<b>Iridi Beach</b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>kaisap112</u>:</b> You realize that, early in the match as it may be, the setup is entirely in favour of Ninetales: the sunshine and the burn are details in of themselves, but when played to their advantages they can turn the match around. As such, you immediately try to counteract the weather conditions to even the playing field.<br />
<br />
Amelia’s Solstice stands motionless as it hears your instructions to Kitty. Your Skitty instantly complies and waggles her tail in a complex pattern, as clouds begin to gather overhead. Just then, the Ninetales seems to spot an opening and dashes forward with a <b>Quick Attack</b> that connects head-on, partially disrupting Kitty’s dance and slowing the clouds’ gathering. <br />
<br />
Kitty gets back to her feet, having taken light damage from the assault, and begins to charge up electricity in her body. Solstice is intent on interrupting her again and her arches her head back, flames escaping her mouth and nostrils as she prepares to unleash a powerful Fire attack, no doubt!<br />
<br />
-	Let’s go dear, show her who she’s dealing with, <i>roast that little bitch!</i><br />
<br />
Amelia Vas Hengel seems to lose her composure once again, enthralled in the emotion of battle, even if she is still to issue a single command on her own. It becomes more and more apparent that she’s just going along with the flow of the match, entirely dictated by her Pokemon, which is quite unusual…<br />
<br />
The Ninetales launches its head forward, ready to unleash its attack, but this time around Kitty proves faster and lets loose a wicked <b>Thunderbolt</b> that scores a direct hit, making the Ninetales yell in pain and aimlessly release its <b>Fire Blast</b>into the sky, where it explodes in a beautiful, fortunately inconsequential display of pyrotechnics.<br />
<br />
Kitty seems proud of herself, jumping excitedly, but you notice her panting. The Thunderbolt drained a considerable amount of energy, not to mention most of her Electric reserves; a shame she wasn’t allowed to summon the rain faster, as it would have been all the more devastating on a wet opponent, but it was still a small victory – the failed Fire Blast took its toll on Solstice as well, as you notice the Ninetales gasping for air.<br />
<br />
Remembering the last part of your instructions, Kitty runs forward and speeds up, surrounding herself with a black aura before disappearing briefly and reappering right next to the fox, connecting with a second <b>Faint Attack</b> that makes the opponent lose its balance temporarily and fall on its hind legs.<br />
<br />
-	Wh-what?! You stupid little kid! Do you have any idea how much this Ninetales is worth?! Don’t… don’t you <i>dare</i> keep this up, I’m warning you!!<br />
<br />
Amelia’s battle skills maybe be doubtful by now, but even she can tell that the match is no longer going her way. Solstice took way more damage than Kitty this turn and lost its footing, not to mention the weather advantage, as the rainclouds finally gather and grow enough for a faint drizzle to begin falling. Another Burn suddenly makes Kitty’s fur ignite briefly before subsiding, making her screech in pain, but the rain appears to ease the pain somewhat. It seems you have an opening now, the tide has definitely turned!<br />
<br />
What do you do?</span></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: silver"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>Brine Island</i></span><br />
<br />
<b>Salin City</b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Arc_Angel &amp; lilbluecorsola</u>:</b> The buzz around you dies down along with the flames, most curious bystanders already gone to carry on with their lives. The rain begins to let up as well, and slowly but steadily, the curtain closes on the horrific scene. You have no idea how many casualties there were, but if not for your quick thinking, that number could have been at least five people higher.<br />
<br />
The police is still on-site, although their attitude toward you has changed considerably – several of them pass by and mutter an embarrassed “thanks”, “good job” or simply throw you a quick look of admiration before resuming their activities, now largely reduced to cataloguing evidence and rushing to deliver equipment from the nearby vans to the POLTs inside the building for their investigation.<br />
<br />
Felicia’s father has begged for your forgiveness and offered to provide any explanation you may want, and life-threatening as it was, the events brought about by the girl’s less-than-healthy state of mind picked your curiosity. Stacey agrees to listen to the old man, half-heartedly joking about a towel to lighten the mood, but he seems to take it seriously.<br />
<br />
-	Absolutely, it should have been my foremost concern! I apologize for my lack of manners… please come to my house, you should be in dire need of a bath and shelter after what you went through because of my daughter… I won’t take no for an answer! And I promise to explain everything once you’ve made yourselves more comfortable.<br />
<br />
The invitation catches you off-guard. Both of you have travelled enough to know better, to be wary of strangers no matter how harmless they may seem… but this old man seems genuinely invested in repaying you for the trouble Felicia caused, and you find the young woman staring at you with a warm smile – a radical change in posture, come to think of it, from the frightened and confused girl of mere moments ago.<br />
<br />
-	Daddy, we’re having visitors? It’s been forever since we’ve had anybody over!! Oh please, you <i>must</i> accept!<br />
<br />
She walks over to you, holding Stacey’s hand and pulling gently, as if encouraging to come along, smiling all the while. Just like a little girl…<br />
<br />
You look at one another, hesitating briefly. But it’s obvious that the only way you’ll be getting answers is by complying for now, and you really could use a warm bath and some towels… Nodding, you decide to accept the invitation. Somehow, it just doesn’t feel right to leave the man alone with his daughter in this state anyway…<br />
<br />
The four of you walk slowly, mostly due to the man’s pace, but at least it’s a much-welcome moment of tranquility. All the while your eyes keep turning to Felicia, who still seems delighted with your company – as if the previous events never happened. She playfully talks to Dwemer and Kristen, remarking she had never seen a live Golett before and how the Snorunt looked positively adorable with her artist gear on. The father, meanwhile, won’t take his eyes off of Felicia either, a look of concern clearly visible in his face. You can only imagine what kind of torment it must be for him to endure her erratic behaviour every day…<br />
<br />
It’s well past dusk by the time you arrive. The air feels chilly, all the more so while blowing on wet clothes and skin. Felicia’s father invites you inside, closing the door behind him as he asks you to make yourselves comfortable. The front door leads to the living room, it seems, with a door on the far wall leading to another division and a staircase to your right giving access to the second floor.<br />
<br />
-	Welcome to our home. The bathroom is on the second floor, first door to your right. Feel free to take your time, and if you need a change of clothes, Felicia may have something that fits you… I’ll get to work on supper in the meantime, if you’d care to join us. It’s the least I can offer after what we put you through, and we’ll be able to talk calmly over at dinner.<br />
<br />
Felicia excuses herself and goes up the stairs to her own room. Her father heads to the kitchen, the division beyond the living room where you are now, leaving the two of you alone. You’re now free to discuss what to do next, or each of you can do as you prefer: take up the offer for a warm bath, dry clothes and a meal, go take a look around the house by yourselves, talk to either Felicia or the old man or simply leave altogether.<br />
<br />
What do you do?<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>empoleon_dynamite</u>:</b> You see the opportunity to ask the old man about the event. After all, &quot;original Gym Leaders&quot; had a nice ring to it...<br />
<br />
Turning around to face you, the man smiles; then, retrieving a pair of sunglasses from his pocket, he puts them on and clears his throat.<br />
<br />
- Well, new blood wants to test his mettle against the veterans, heh? Well, it's been a while since I've done this, but... Hello! I'm Clyde. I used to be the guide for Trainers challenging the Pokémon Gym. Take this to commemorate the occasion!<br />
<br />
Suddenly, he dashes toward a nearby vending machine, he pops in a few coins and selects an item. Then, running back to you, he hands you a <b>Fresh Water</b>.<br />
<br />
- Used to have more of these at hand, you know. I'm retired now, so... oh well. If you lose, you owe me 20 coins for the bottle.<br />
<br />
He removes his sunglasses again and points at the counter some feet away from where you're standing, where several people are gathered and a good number is walking away with a disappointed look in their faces.<br />
<br />
- Head over there and apply for registration. Heard they have some demanding criteria though... you can't just have anyone taking the Gym Leaders' precious time. They only accept some Trainers... why don't you go try your luck?<br />
<br />
Saying goodbye to Clyde, you hurry over to the counter. After waiting a good fifteen minutes in line, your turn arrives; the person before you had apparently been rejected as well...<br />
<br />
-Hello sir. Here for the Gym Challenge, yes? You need to meet some requirements, I'm afraid. First, we require an official Pokedex. Please place it on the counter. Next, you need to own at least two official Beginner Battle Trophies and one Advanced Battle Trophy. If you have these, please place them next to your Pokedex. Lastly, you will need to register a team of six Pokemon to enter the competition with - all of which at Level 50 or above. If you meet these requirements, please register them in the computer to your left.<br />
<br />
The lady then hands you a pen and paper.<br />
<br />
- And when you're done, please fill in this form.<br />
<br />
You glance at the paper; it consists of three simple questions, amidst all the bureaucratic text and emblems:<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;1) What are your favourite and least favourite Pokemon Type?<br />
2) What are your preferred and least preferred terrain for battle?<br />
3) What are your preferred and least preferred battle styles - Single, Double or Triple Battle?&quot;</i><br />
<br />
The selection criteria are indeed very strict... If you still meet all the requirements, show them to the woman at the counter and fill out the form to proceed!</span></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: yellow"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>Ion Island</i></span><br />
<br />
<b>Storm Lake</b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Myahoo</u>:</b> You’ve had just about enough of Cam’s speeches, that although predictable still hit home in unnerving fashion. You begin to wonder if he’s saying all those things just to spite you and make you lose focus, or just the opposite.<br />
<br />
Whichever the reason, you realize you’ll have to pull out the big guns soon if you’re going to beat a fully evolved Ampharos who already has a distinct advantage so early on in the match. Wildfire is looking around, disoriented, desperately trying to sort out the mess in his head… but the soft sand seems so appealing, so inviting to bury his snout in again…<br />
<br />
Cam’s Ampharos begins to charge up electricity, small blue sparks escaping its body, indicating a different kind of charge – it’s preparing to release Thunder Wave, and if it connects, the combination of paralysis and confusion will certainly prove too much to overcome.<br />
<br />
As the opponent releases the blue jolt of electric current, you yell at your Cyndaquil to snap out of it and fight back with Heat Wave. The plea seems to make it through, as Wildfire inhales deeply and blows a wave of blazing-hot wind at Ampharos. The mass of heated-up air is strong enough to dispel the electric wave and travels all the way toward Ampharos, who can’t dodge it due to having begun charging up for Thunder already, scoring a direct hit on the Electric-Type for considerable damage!<br />
<br />
Cam smiles at the outcome, but doesn’t issue any new commands. Ampharos resumes charging up for his strongest attack, the sand around its feet rising and floating as if magnetically-charged (which it likely is), signaling the immense electrical power building up inside your opponent…<br />
<br />
You plan to carry on with your strategy, moving in at close range with Wild Charge, but the although the first order had been successful, the string of instructions proves too much for the confused Cyndaquil, who just can’t remember what he was supposed to do next. You watch in horror as Ampharos unleashes a massive Thunder that travels at frightening speed toward Wildfire, arching in the air before crashing down on your Pokemon, whipping up a large amount of sand around it.<br />
<br />
As the dust settles, you look on worried sick, wondering what the attack might have done to your poor Cyndaquil… only to discover him hurt, but still hanging on just fine! How?...<br />
<br />
Just then, you hear Cam laugh. Genuine laughter too, not the sarcastic type... You take a while to realize what’s going on, but when you do, a smile involuntarily forms on your lips as well. Wildfire’s snout is buried deep in the sand, and it acted as a ground! In his confusion, it seems he failed to resist the urge to play in the sand like earlier, and his long nose probably helped drive most of the current into the electrified sand, dispersing it and only somewhat hurting your Cyndaquil. And it seems Cam has loosened up a bit too, at least for the moment…<br />
<br />
It was a lucky break, but it means you still have a fighting chance, especially when you realize Wildfire is looking at you expectantly, awaiting a new set of orders – he <b>snapped out of confusion</b>!<br />
<br />
With this new opportunity to turn the tide in your favour, you have to think carefully about your next orders. The opponent has taken more damage overall, but both Pokemon are healthy enough to go on for a while longer. Ampharos has the size and power advantage, but you can seemingly use the terrain to your advantage and Wildfire might just have the edge in terms of speed…<br />
<br />
What will you do now?</span></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: lightblue"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>Glacier Island</i></span><br />
<br />
<b>Boreal Wastelands</b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Trepie</u>:</b> The choice is evident to you; the closest you’ll get to guaranteeing Pandora’s survival is by relying on these men. Reluctant, you wait for them to wrap up whatever it is that they came to do, mentally yelling at them to hurry it up…<br />
<br />
You watch your two unexpected saviours while they maneuver around the dead Beartic they unearthed. One of them drops to his knees and pulls a knife from one of the suit’s pockets, then proceeds to scalpel a small area on the bear’s front legs, severing hair from flesh and storing it a small plastic container that the other man hands him. Then, he cuts off a portion of the exposed flesh and places it in a separate container. They work in complete silence, and their coordination makes it obvious they’ve been doing this for a while – but it still stirs all sorts of doubts and concerns in your head. Was that kind of procedure what they planned to do with Pandora too?!<br />
<br />
The men return to the snowmobile soon afterwards. Motioning for you to get on, one of them starts the engine as the other sits directly behind him. You do the same, sitting at the far end of the snowmobile, wary of falling during the ride back to whatever they were headed. But it had to be done, for your Cloyster’s sake.<br />
<br />
The journey itself is mostly quiet; the two men don’t address you at all, for what seems like a good thirty minutes of riding. You take a look at your surroundings, familiar from your background. The Glacier Island spreads as far as the eye can see all around you, a frozen plains of lifeless silence; the sky above, still painted by the aurora from before, with its undulating green hue, seems more alive than the land beneath it. And yet, when that notion last crossed your mind, you were attacked by three hungry bears. You quickly dismiss the thought lest you’re proven wrong again.<br />
<br />
-	Funding’s not gonna last forever if all we retrieve are remains of dead Pokemon. It’s been an entire week like this!<br />
<br />
-	Yeah, well, like you said, Beartic DNA is resistant. Guys down at Lab C can prime it for research.<br />
<br />
-	It ain’t the quality of the samples I’m worried about, it’s the amount of tissue. Priming only gets you so far, PCR doesn’t account for intra-species variations, let alone sporadic mutations, and end-product viability depends on how stable it remains in the event it mutates. You know the suits want us to get results faster; we need live specimens, no way around it.<br />
<br />
The men sound thoroughly disappointed by their latest trip, it seems. And while the topic remains uncomfortable to you, you notice they don’t bring up Pandora; for what it’s worth, it seems they intend to uphold their end of the bargain and simply nurse it back to health. If that’s the case, maybe you can be at ease.<br />
<br />
After a while, you spot something in the distance; several structures standing out in the middle of the empty plains. As you approach them, you realize they’re tents – huge tents, surrounded by an iron fence all around, establishing a considerably large perimeter. The snowmobile passes through the open gates as two men, equally clad in orange, close it behind you.<br />
<br />
You’re now standing in the middle of the campsite; several people move around hurriedly, some wearing orange suits, others lab coats, and some others in what seems like a military outfit. One such man comes to meet the three of you as the driver switches off the snowmobile’s engine. As he salutes your rescuers, you take a better look at him – probably in his sixties by now, he wears a dark green uniform with a camo pattern and three medals across the chest. White hair shows beneath his peaked cap, and he sports an impressive moustache. There’s an aura of authority about him, made all the more evident when the two explorers stand at attention at his salute.<br />
<br />
-	At ease, men. Any news?<br />
<br />
-	Nothing good, sir. I’m afraid we only turned up some more samples… dead Beartic this time. Although it probably wasn’t a natural death this time.<br />
<br />
You catch on to their meaning as one of them motions with his head toward you. The man in military uniform turns his attention to you for the first time.<br />
<br />
-	Oh? Seems dead remains wasn’t all you picked up.<br />
<br />
- No sir. This young man was on site when we arrived. He needs assistance with a wounded Pokemon, it’s all we know.<br />
<br />
The older man gives you a long, silent look. His expression is unreadable, but the tone of voice with which he addresses the men hints annoyance.<br />
<br />
-	Nebula doesn’t do charity work, Doctor. Unless we suddenly got permission to research human DNA and I wasn’t briefed. Be that as it may… how many Beartic were there?<br />
<br />
-	Th-three, s-sir…<br />
<br />
-	I see. And his Pokemon’s condition?<br />
<br />
-	A Cloyster, s-sir. Critical. Shell won’t open.<br />
<br />
The military man walks over to you and extends a hand with a faint smile. Or is it a grin?...<br />
<br />
-	Seems you might be a blessing in disguise after all. I am Comander James Kessler, overseer of this little project and Chief Officer for ground missions. Now, it seems to me we have something you need… and you might have something that we require in exchange.<br />
<br />
The man you handed Pandora to steps forward and hands Commander Kessler the Pokeball.<br />
<br />
-	We’ll be going on a field mission soon; as you might have pieced together by now, our research requires live Pokemon to be successful. None are harmed, and we release them back in the wild when done, if you’re the type to be concerned about those things. But we simply cannot remain in activity without some specific specimens to resume the studies. What I require from you, in exchange for nursing your Cloyster back to health, is your collaboration in capturing these Pokemon. Someone who defeated three Beartic on his own is likely more capable than a good number of these imbeciles I got stuck with.<br />
<br />
Twirling Pandora’s Pokeball in his fingers, he looks at you awaiting an answer.<br />
<br />
-	What do you say? Make no mistake about it – if you refuse, your Pokemon dies. I know what my men mean by “critical condition”, it’s not just an expression. Our medics are trained and equipped to resolve these situations, but the only way they’ll admit an outside Pokemon is with military-grade clearance, so…<br />
<br />
The offer for help still stands, but you can’t ignore that you’re practically being coerced into accepting Commander Kessler’s terms. While accepting to hunt down wild Pokemon for research purposes – especially not knowing what kind of research – sounds unethical, playing along seems like the only way of assuring Pandora’s survival. On the other hand, the Commander did make it seem like nobody will be harmed, and maybe this research does serve a noble cause… You clearly weren’t offered enough details to make an informed decision, but how much leeway do you have anyway? Could you perhaps try to bargain your way around, or is it better to just play along for now?<br />
<br />
What do you do?</span></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: teal"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>Silver Ocean</i></span><br />
<br />
<b>Auronos Caverns</b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>ApertureScience</u>:</b> You feel it’s your duty to explain what really went down, lest Sean mistakes you for a more formidable Trainer than you actually are. Not everyone would have chosen to be truthful in this situation, and fortunately for you, the Gym Leader takes it rather well – seems it’s in his nature to be laidback.<br />
<br />
-	Nah man, it’s cool! Wicked stroke of luck you got there, heh? But wait… I didn’t know Buizel could learn Metronome! How did you teach ‘im that?!<br />
<br />
Easily excitable too, it seems. The “surfer boy” first impression apparently wasn’t too far off. <br />
<br />
-	As for how I saw the battle, well… I wouldn’t just send my Sharpedo off into the unknown without keeping an eye on it, would I? – he asks with a wide green as he fetches a pair of goggles from under the seat.<br />
<br />
Walking to the far edge of the boat, he retrieves a large backpack and lays it at your feet. <br />
<br />
-	First rule of deep-sea diving: always bring extra gear in case something goes wrong. So look in there, I got an extra oxygen mask you can attach to the mini-tank over there. Nice to find someone with a drive for adventure, mate! See, what we’re gonna do here…<br />
<br />
He gears up, strapping an oxygen tank of his own to his back and sitting on the edge of the boat.<br />
<br />
-	… is we gonna bust some myths! There’s a huge underwater cave in particular I’ve been meaning to explore in the last months. So if you’re still up for it, suit up and meet me down there!<br />
<br />
And with that, he dives. You're left alone in the boat, and Max urges you to hurry up before you lose Sean. You hastily rummage through the bag and retrieve the mask, and struggle to fit the other oxygen tank over your shoulders like a backpack, much like Sean had done. The guy is probably a bit out there, but his conversation sparked your interest. What did he mean by &quot;busting a myth&quot;? When you think you got it all working, you jump out the boat and into the water, with Max close behind.<br />
<br />
At first you have a little trouble adjusting to the underwater view, but after a while you spot Sean swimming down a bit further ahead. The oxygen seems to be flowing fine, which is reassuring, and you start flapping your legs hard to go deeper. You swim by a school of Finneon, who scatter as you approach, and further down you see a rocky formation taking form up ahead. Sean seems to know his way aroundm but he slowed down noticeably for you to join up with him; you double your efforts, your legs already hurting a bit, but you persevere - after all, you might have a decent supply of oxygen, but Buizel only has his natural reserves; enhanced in comparison to other Pokemon who can't Dive, but he's no fish. You have to hurry.<br />
<br />
Sean seems aware that you can't afford to go sightseeing and resumes swimming at full speed; after a while of following him, you spot a large opening in the rock wall and head inside. Sure enough, it seems to lead to a cave, as the Gym Leader slowly starts swimming upwards. You do the same, and before long your head is out of water again, stone walls all around you - you made it to the surface, and just in time too, as Max jumps out of the water in distress and inhales deeply three or four times before throwing you an angry stare that read &quot;why the bloody hell did you take so long?!&quot;<br />
<br />
You make it to shore and sit on the cave's rocky ground for a while to rest your legs as you remove the mask. Sean doesn't seem as tired, but he's clearly done this many times before.<br />
<br />
- Not bad mate, glad you could keep up! So, what do you think? A bit chilly, but what's that for a couple of fearless adventurers, right?<br />
<br />
Maxwell rolls his eyes. You get back to your feet and look around the cave - it's big indeed, and there seems to be a tunnel leading deep inside the rock on the far wall.<br />
<br />
- Now, let me explain a bit better. As you might know, Cascadia has been a prime location for the spotting of exceedingly rare Pokemon, what the general population would call &quot;Legendaries&quot;. Well, I've made it my life's goal to disprove a theory about the status of the Pokemon known as Lugia. See, people say it's a one-of-a-kind creature. I disagree, and I've pleaded my case several times with the Pokemon League to let me capture and train a Lugia to use in my Gym on grounds that it actually isn't a single specimen. I've been laughed out of the building every single time, obviously... So now I'm here to hunt for Lugia eggs!!<br />
<br />
He puffs his chest, as if that added to his credibility.<br />
<br />
- There have been several reports of Lugia sightings around Brine Island, and I have good reason to believe it might use this cave as its nest. So what we do is we split up and search; if you find anything relevant, you let me know and vice versa! And how do we do that? We shout! Well, let's get going! Good luck mate!!<br />
<br />
Deeply convinced that his theories and his plan are flawless, Sean starts running toward the tunnel on his own, and before you know it you lose sight of him. You're left all alone in the cave entrance... You reluctantly head for the tunnel as well, Maxwell following close, and sigh as you reach a crossroads: a path on the left, dark and with salt water dripping from the ceiling, and one on the right, illuminated by a flickering green light. You carefully think about what to do before you make your choice to enter either tunnel. <br />
<br />
What do you do?</span></span></div>

<span style="color: lightblue"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>Glacier Island</i></span><br />
<br />
<b>Boreal Wastelands</b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Trepie</u>:</b> The choice is evident to you; the closest you’ll get to guaranteeing Pandora’s survival is by relying on these men. Reluctant, you wait for them to wrap up whatever it is that they came to do, mentally yelling at them to hurry it up…<br />
<br />
You watch your two unexpected saviours while they maneuver around the dead Beartic they unearthed. One of them drops to his knees and pulls a knife from one of the suit’s pockets, then proceeds to scalpel a small area on the bear’s front legs, severing hair from flesh and storing it a small plastic container that the other man hands him. Then, he cuts off a portion of the exposed flesh and places it in a separate container. They work in complete silence, and their coordination makes it obvious they’ve been doing this for a while – but it still stirs all sorts of doubts and concerns in your head. Was that kind of procedure what they planned to do with Pandora too?!<br />
<br />
The men return to the snowmobile soon afterwards. Motioning for you to get on, one of them starts the engine as the other sits directly behind him. You do the same, sitting at the far end of the snowmobile, wary of falling during the ride back to whatever they were headed. But it had to be done, for your Cloyster’s sake.<br />
<br />
The journey itself is mostly quiet; the two men don’t address you at all, for what seems like a good thirty minutes of riding. You take a look at your surroundings, familiar from your background. The Glacier Island spreads as far as the eye can see all around you, a frozen plains of lifeless silence; the sky above, still painted by the aurora from before, with its undulating green hue, seems more alive than the land beneath it. And yet, when that notion last crossed your mind, you were attacked by three hungry bears. You quickly dismiss the thought lest you’re proven wrong again.<br />
<br />
-	Funding’s not gonna last forever if all we retrieve are remains of dead Pokemon. It’s been an entire week like this!<br />
<br />
-	Yeah, well, like you said, Beartic DNA is resistant. Guys down at Lab C can prime it for research.<br />
<br />
-	It ain’t the quality of the samples I’m worried about, it’s the amount of tissue. Priming only gets you so far, PCR doesn’t account for intra-species variations, let alone sporadic mutations, and end-product viability depends on how stable it remains in the event it mutates. You know the suits want us to get results faster; we need live specimens, no way around it.<br />
<br />
The men sound thoroughly disappointed by their latest trip, it seems. And while the topic remains uncomfortable to you, you notice they don’t bring up Pandora; for what it’s worth, it seems they intend to uphold their end of the bargain and simply nurse it back to health. If that’s the case, maybe you can be at ease.<br />
<br />
After a while, you spot something in the distance; several structures standing out in the middle of the empty plains. As you approach them, you realize they’re tents – huge tents, surrounded by an iron fence all around, establishing a considerably large perimeter. The snowmobile passes through the open gates as two men, equally clad in orange, close it behind you.<br />
<br />
You’re now standing in the middle of the campsite; several people move around hurriedly, some wearing orange suits, others lab coats, and some others in what seems like a military outfit. One such man comes to meet the three of you as the driver switches off the snowmobile’s engine. As he salutes your rescuers, you take a better look at him – probably in his sixties by now, he wears a dark green uniform with a camo pattern and three medals across the chest. White hair shows beneath his peaked cap, and he sports an impressive moustache. There’s an aura of authority about him, made all the more evident when the two explorers stand at attention at his salute.<br />
<br />
-	At ease, men. Any news?<br />
<br />
-	Nothing good, sir. I’m afraid we only turned up some more samples… dead Beartic this time. Although it probably wasn’t a natural death this time.<br />
<br />
You catch on to their meaning as one of them motions with his head toward you. The man in military uniform turns his attention to you for the first time.<br />
<br />
-	Oh? Seems dead remains wasn’t all you picked up.<br />
<br />
- No sir. This young man was on site when we arrived. He needs assistance with a wounded Pokemon, it’s all we know.<br />
<br />
The older man gives you a long, silent look. His expression is unreadable, but the tone of voice with which he addresses the men hints annoyance.<br />
<br />
-	Nebula doesn’t do charity work, Doctor. Unless we suddenly got permission to research human DNA and I wasn’t briefed. Be that as it may… how many Beartic were there?<br />
<br />
-	Th-three, s-sir…<br />
<br />
-	I see. And his Pokemon’s condition?<br />
<br />
-	A Cloyster, s-sir. Critical. Shell won’t open.<br />
<br />
The military man walks over to you and extends a hand with a faint smile. Or is it a grin?...<br />
<br />
-	Seems you might be a blessing in disguise after all. I am Comander James Kessler, overseer of this little project and Chief Officer for ground missions. Now, it seems to me we have something you need… and you might have something that we require in exchange.<br />
<br />
The man you handed Pandora to steps forward and hands Commander Kessler the Pokeball.<br />
<br />
-	We’ll be going on a field mission soon; as you might have pieced together by now, our research requires live Pokemon to be successful. None are harmed, and we release them back in the wild when done, if you’re the type to be concerned about those things. But we simply cannot remain in activity without some specific specimens to resume the studies. What I require from you, in exchange for nursing your Cloyster back to health, is your collaboration in capturing these Pokemon. Someone who defeated three Beartic on his own is likely more capable than a good number of these imbeciles I got stuck with.<br />
<br />
Twirling Pandora’s Pokeball in his fingers, he looks at you awaiting an answer.<br />
<br />
-	What do you say? Make no mistake about it – if you refuse, your Pokemon dies. I know what my men mean by “critical condition”, it’s not just an expression. Our medics are trained and equipped to resolve these situations, but the only way they’ll admit an outside Pokemon is with military-grade clearance, so…<br />
<br />
The offer for help still stands, but you can’t ignore that you’re practically being coerced into accepting Commander Kessler’s terms. While accepting to hunt down wild Pokemon for research purposes – especially not knowing what kind of research – sounds unethical, playing along seems like the only way of assuring Pandora’s survival. On the other hand, the Commander did make it seem like nobody will be harmed, and maybe this research does serve a noble cause… You clearly weren’t offered enough details to make an informed decision, but how much leeway do you have anyway? Could you perhaps try to bargain your way around, or is it better to just play along for now?<br />
<br />
What do you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: lightblue"><span style="font-size: 9px">Auric's stomach turned as he watched the men from a distance. Of course it wasn't so much what they were doing but the fact that he was responsible for their deaths. The 'We had no choice' excuse played over and over in his head. The night had started with a quiet celebration and quickly devolved into chaos. It wasn't the first time he had been that close to death and it wouldn't be the last. Still he felt terrible about the Beartic and what he put Ares and Pandora through. Shivering in the night air he stood up to get the blood pumping again. Compared to the what the workers were wearing Auric may as well have been dressed for a day at the beach. He had lost his gloves digging for Pandora, his feet were soaked, and his coat was pretty much frozen but he pulled it tighter around himself anyways. <i>'Cold hardy, fool hardy too'</i> he laughed to himself. Looking down at his hands he saw how scratched up they were from digging through the ice and even though they hurt like hell they never seemed to get cold. <br />
<br />
With the strange workers finishing their work Auric headed closer to the snowmobile. He was fighting every urge in his body to just take the snow mobile and run. But the reality of the situation was clear, Pandora needed help and these people were his best and likely only chance. All he could do was hope that their intentions were pure. When they returned to Auric was about ready to deck one of them for taking so long. They motioned for him to climb on and so he did. The engine hummed to life, the machine jumped forward and they were off.<br />
<br />
Thankfully the ride was quiet. The strangers didn't seem much like talking which was fine by Auric. His mind was racing about everything that had happened and the last thing he wanted to do was make chit chat. The snowmobile skidded through the drifts of snow for what seemed like ages. With the wind sweeping the snow across the landscape and the aurora casting a glow in the sky, it at least gave himself something to calm his mind. Of course the thought of the Beartic cropped into his head again. The more he thought on it the more it was bothering him. Suddenly a voice broke his train of thought . He was overhearing a conversation between the strangers. While it was hard to make out everything over the engine what he did gather was informative at least. They were a part of a research team, though who was funding them was still a mystery. They were harvesting DNA samples from dead pokemon. The next part was considerably more disturbing as they let loose some of the more intimate details, including something about mutations and the need for live specimens. Not the whole story but enough for him to keep his guard up. As long as they helped Pandora, Auric was at least willing to entertain whatever he needed to for the time being. <br />
<br />
After their conversation something finally stood out on the horizon. There were a few lights highlighting a series of tents. With the snowmobile coming up to it fast Auric noticed the whole site was entirely fenced off. Two men manning the gate closed it as they pass through, leaving a caged feeling in his gut. The snowmobile skidding to the stop in the middle of the settlement. There appeared to be a mix of personnel around, including some well armed soldier types. Meaning this place was either military run or mercenary run. <i>'Either one could be trouble'</i>Auric thought to himself. When the engine was turned off all of their attention turned to a man who approached the snowmobile saluting the two men. The man was later on in years and very stoic in appearance. The two men stood at attention as the addressed the man. Auric got off the back of the back of the snowmobile to listen to the conversation. It wasn't long until the topic of conversation turned to their hitchhiker and his wounded pokemon. Time was ticking by with Pandora in dire straights. When he walked closer to Auric an uneasy feeling began to creep into his mind. <br />
<br />
&quot;Seems you might be a blessing in disguise after all. I am Comander James Kessler, overseer of this little project and Chief Officer for ground missions. Now, it seems to me we have something you need… and you might have something that we require in exchange.&quot;<br />
<br />
Auric was only half paying attention to the man, instead staying focused on Pandora's pokeball. He was frustrated and it was growing. Resisting the urge to tell the man to get to the point he turned his attention back to the Commander. <br />
<br />
&quot;We’ll be going on a field mission soon; as you might have pieced together by now, our research requires live Pokemon to be successful. None are harmed, and we release them back in the wild when done, if you’re the type to be concerned about those things. But we simply cannot remain in activity without some specific specimens to resume the studies. What I require from you, in exchange for nursing your Cloyster back to health, is your collaboration in capturing these Pokemon. Someone who defeated three Beartic on his own is likely more capable than a good number of these imbeciles I got stuck with.&quot; Commander Kessler said as he cavalierly spun Pandora's pokeball in his fingers. &quot;What do you say? Make no mistake about it – if you refuse, your Pokemon dies. I know what my men mean by “critical condition”, it’s not just an expression. Our medics are trained and equipped to resolve these situations, but the only way they’ll admit an outside Pokemon is with military-grade clearance, so…&quot;<br />
<br />
Blackmailed and caged. Blackmail was the wrong angle if this Commander was looking to make an ally. Instead, in that instant he became Auric's enemy and a threat. This all felt rotten even with all of Kessler's assurances. Auric really didn't have a choice and he knew it but that didn't mean he liked it. His only advantage at the moment is that they didn't know a thing about Auric except that he needed their help. They didn't know his past. They didn't know how far he would go to protect his pokemon and they didn't know how acclimatized to the cold he was. So for now his best option was to let them have the upper hand. To play along, play it stupid, and play it quiet. If there was ever a chance for him to make a move to change the status quo, he would take it. <br />
<br />
Looking at the Commander dead in his eyes Auric wanted to make sure he was clear in what he was going to say. &quot;If you can heal my Cloyster then I'm in. Just know that I will hold you to your word Commander. I accompany you on your field trip, you help Pandora. But If anything happens to her I will hold you responsible. While that may seem like an empty threat from a civilian against all your fire power and fences, I promise you it's not. So let's get this party started then shall we? Oh, and don't expect me to salute you.&quot; Auric said walking away from the Commander.</span></span></div>

I think I heard some trainer try that with his Pikachu and that didn’t end too well.” She shivers a bit, indicating that the battle in question hadn’t ended happily, and then turns to call Milly back into her Pokéball. You turn over to Max, your buddy attempting to make friends with the wild Poochyenas. The older one growls a bit quietly, but the younger one pounces right at Max – she looks eager to play with Max! After watching Max and what you are starting to believe is the wild Poochyena’s little sister having a play-fight for a few moments, the bro-Poochyena inches closer. He doesn’t seem especially eager to be best friends for life with Max, but as long as he’s not aiming for the throat you’re happy.<br />
<br />
Elena suddenly stiffens right before pushing you into the bush you both had jumped out of before, diving in after you with a finger on her lips. You peek out from a small hole between all the leaves: to your astonishment and fear, a big canine of black and grey color is walking over to the Poochyenas and not looking very happy. Your eyes reach the size of big plates as you realize that you’re staring at a Mightyena. The canine starts growling at bro-Poochyena, the latter growling back, like they’re having some sort of conversation. Panic crosses your mind: what if this thing is in cahoots with the Abra? What if it’s dangerous? Could Max stand a stand against his evolved form? Mightyena eyes Max for a brief moment before snatching sis-Poochyena by the neck; is she their mother, perhaps? Before you can move a muscle, Bro-Poochyena looks at Max, and then cocks his head toward the Mightyena. The family of three starts walking toward the temple - with Max following right behind them.<br />
<br />
Elena lets out a held breath. “Looks like we’re getting somewhere…don’t think that Mightyena’s going to want to see us around anytime soon though. What do you want to do? Should we go after them?”<br />
<br />
What will you do?</i></span></span>

&quot;True, true,&quot; Okiku nodded in agreement, having forgotten that trait typical of Abra.<br />

The Pokémon Breeder's face was surely a giveaway to Okiku about how bad it went. While Elena called back her Miltank, Okiku looked over Max, who is trying to socialize with the other Poochyenas. The big brother-looking one seemed to snarl under his break but still looked somewhat respectful towards him, but the younger one surprisingly was no longer afraid, happily and playfully pouncing on Max!<br />
<br />
&quot;Cuuuute,&quot; Okiku giggled.<br />
<br />
Before she could continue to enjoy the adorable scene, Elena suddenly pushed her into a bush. Okiku opened her mouth to ask why did she do that, but she was cut off by Elena signalled her to stay quiet. She returned her signal with a confused look, then peeked through the leaves towards the Poochyenas: They were now accompanied a mighty... well, aptly-named Mightyena. Okiku's expression changed into a surprised and understanding one, her jaw slightly open in a way she could have muttered 'Ooooooooooh. Crap.' The evolved Pokémon seemed to be exchanging words with the brother Poochyena, then grabbed the playful young one by the neck like a mother would do. Panicking a bit, Okiku pulled out the Pokéball of one of her Pokémon... but then the brother Poochyena tilted his head to the side towards the Mightyena to ask to join them. The little family walked towards the temple, and Max followed them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like we're getting somewhere...&quot; Elena sighed, &quot;don't think that Mightyena's going to want to see us around anytime soon though. What do you want to do? Should we go after them?&quot;<br />
<br />
Okiku looked at her feet, thinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I would've thought of maybe sending one of my Psychic Pokémon after them to spy on them and report back to us, but none of them have developed their Psychic abilities enough to be able to speak to me telepathically yet,&quot; she frowned and sighed in disappointment. &quot;Well, it seems that the Mightyena either doesn't use her sense of smell much or doesn't mind the scent of humans, as she didn't go after us even if we were hidden only from her sight...&quot; she bit her lip, knowing the risk her other plan could imply, &quot;so I guess we should try to follow them... as subtle as possible. Hope and pray the wind blows on the front of us, and not on our backs...&quot; reminding herself some tricks her father used to not get detected by the Stantler, Deerling and Sawsbuck he (legally) hunted.</span></span></div>

<br />
<b>Boreal Wastelands</b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Trepie</u>:</b> The situation was abundantly clear to you: you either complied, or Pandora would be left for dead. Determined to save her – as her life-threatening injury was, at least in part, your responsibility -, you accept the assignment, at the same time planning to bide your time until you could turn the situation in your favour.<br />
<br />
Making a point not to sound subservient, but rather make it clear that you can see right through his intentions, you stand up to the Commander, issuing a very blunt threat of your own. Whether you’d be able to follow through with your claims or not, however, remains to be seen. Commander Kessler for one just smirks, before patting you on the shoulder.<br />
<br />
-	Guts <i>and</i> skill? Seems you’re a keeper. We leave in an hour; join the party at the front gate when you’re ready.<br />
<br />
You turn away from the Commander without another word. Having overheard the conversation, another man in military uniform runs over to you and offers a handshake (instead of a salute, you notice).<br />
<br />
-	Hey man! Welcome aboard! Heard you’re joining us; that was pretty ballsy of you! A word of caution, though… Commander Kessler might seem calm and collected, but rub him the wrong way and you’re gonna regret it… Trust me, step out of line or compromise any small part of this assignment and you might never see your Pokemon again!<br />
<br />
You try to ascertain whether this is another threat, but you conclude that this guy’s just giving you heartfelt advice. From his tone, you can tell he’s genuinely concerned about you, which is a welcome change from the norm so far.<br />
<br />
-	Haven’t introduced myself yet. Name’s Sid Gapp. I’m just a lowly Private around here… but I got picked to join the mission! Seems the Colonel – sorry, the Commander – noticed the effort I put in… Can’t let him down!<br />
<br />
He seems to notice you picked up on his correction, as you give him an inquisitive look.<br />
<br />
-	Oh, that… Commander Kessler was originally in the Navy; that’s why we call him “Commander”, that used to be his rank. But something happened that forced him to join the Army instead, he never talks about it though… and nothing good ever happens to the scrub who asks. We figure he should technically be the equivalent to a Colonel by now, and a lot of the men hate being bossed around by a Navy guy, so we call him Colonel between ourselves to make his orders easier to bear… What’s a regiment without its pride?<br />
<br />
He then points to one of the tents.<br />
<br />
-	That’s where you should head now. There’s a PC inside, make sure to <b>choose which Pokemon you’re bringing along</b> carefully. There are also some supplies in there, you should stock up. The rest of the crew will be by the gate, I’ll introduce you when you get there!<br />
<br />
You thank Private Gapp and head to the tent – there’ll be time for small talk on the way to the mission site, you figure. As you enter, you realize just how fully equipped these guys have come: a PC is indeed switched on and ready for use, and several large shelves and crates are piled up and filled with various supplies: rations, medicine, Pokeballs, ammo, etc. No firearms, but you figure those must be stored elsewhere and inaccessible to outsiders like you.<br />
<br />
You first head over to the PC, and after a while, you decide on the party that will accompany you*. Next you rummage through the shelves, looking for anything useful. You find <b>2x Potion</b>, <b>2x Ice Heal</b> and <b>1x Escape Rope</b>, that you store in your Bag. Finally, you begin to hear some commotion outside, and figure the team is gathering by the front gate, so you take a deep breath and exit the tent.<br />
<br />
You slowly approach the group, seven men in total, all with thick orange overcoats on top of their uniforms. Gapp spots you and hands you an <b>Orange Overcoat</b>** too; it has a purple “N” embroidered on the right arm, which you assume stands for “Nebula”, based on Commander Kessler’s previous speech.<br />
<br />
Kessler himself joins up with you shortly afterwards, dressed in similar fashion. Not saying a word, he jumps on one of the snowmobiles and motions for the team to mobilize. Everyone runs to their snowmobiles in pairs, each vehicle carrying two soldiers. Gapp calls you over to his, motioning for you to sit behind him. You figure he’s probably the best company you can ask for right now and accept the lift. Everyone starts their engines and soon you’re moving through the snow again, passing the front gate into the frozen plains once more.<br />
<br />
James Kessler leads the formation, driving with purpose – seems he’s absolutely certain of the route to follow, even if everything around you looks exactly the same. The other four snowmobiles speed up behind, the frigid wind blowing against your face, but you barely feel the cold at all; you’ve been used to it your entire life, apparently unlike the troops. If it were up to you, you wouldn’t have brought an overcoat at all, but why turn it down? If you make it out of this alive and well, at least you can keep it as a souvenir – if the journey ends up being one to remember fondly, anyway. So far, it’s looking pretty grim…<br />
<br />
You start thinking that you know absolutely nothing about any of this; who is James Kessler, what are these guys truly after, what is Nebula, why they require live Pokemon so badly… You realize the trip is likely going to take a while longer, and Gapp seems like someone you can trust – or at the very least talk to. You might try asking him a few questions, though there probably won’t be time to ask <i>everything</i> that’s been bothering you…<br />
<br />
What do you do?</span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"><br />

</span><b><u><span style="color: red">[FONT=&amp;amp]Hayward[/FONT]</span></u></b><b><span style="color: red">[FONT=&amp;amp]:[/FONT]</span></b><span style="color: red"> In a sudden moment of inspiration, you decide to at least <i>[FONT=&amp;amp]try[/FONT]</i> to minimize the casualties, refusing to accept a scenario where someone gets left behind. Banking everything on the chance that Teddiursa is a wild Pokemon, you pick a rare Chocolate Ball and pray that this works as you hop back on Skarméo to simultaneously rescue the man.<br />
<br />
Your Skarmory skillfully maneuvers around the falling boulders, making it exceedingly hard to aim at Teddiursa in the process. As a particularly large rock falls just next to you as you were about to throw the Ball, you’re forced to postpone the attempt lest you fall off the bird’s back. But time’s running out, as the entire cave is about to collapse!<br />
<br />
Skarméo grabs the man by his shoulders with her large talons; however, lifting him up with you already riding on her back proves challenging for the Skarmory, who for a brief moment seems unable to fly back up, seconds that look like decades as rubble keeps falling all around you. You see it as an opportunity to attempt the throw, and hurl the Pokeball as hard as you can across over the fissure, hitting the tiny cub and pulling it inside. However, before you can witness the result, the tunnel gives in and a number of large rocks come crashing down on the place where Teddiursa stood, making it impossible to spot the Chocolate Ball…<br />
<br />
From then on, everything happens way too quickly. Skarméo finally manages to take flight again, carrying both of you, putting her under enormous strain as she dodges most of the rubble as best she can. Immediately behind you the entire tunnel gives in, collapsing at alarmingly fast rate, with the Sarmory just barely staying ahead of the cave-in. Again her natural instincts, stemming from her past life as a wild Pokemon of Aduro Island, start to kick in, as if she knows exactly where to go. And just as it seems you’ll be crushed under the enormous boulders falling all around you, the bird spots a crevice on the ceiling leading outside – no doubt a large fissure that formed after this last earthquake. Flapping her metal wings as hard as she can, she heads for the crack on the tunnel ceiling, managing to pass through just as you duck and hold on to her neck as hard as you can – the hole seems too small to pass through, but somehow, some way, she pulls it off. You feel a sharp pain on your back as Skarméo flies through the crevice, a sharper rocky edge leaving a large cut, though fortunately not too deep, between your shoulder blades. And the next thing you know, you’re tumbling down hard, your Pokemon unble to fly any higher… but you’re on solid ground. Shoulder and back badly hurt, bleeding, but alive – as well as the man you rescued. Skarméo lies on the floor not far from you, eyes shut, having blacked out from exhaustion. You close your eyes shut for a split second, just a second to regroup, that’s all you need… just a minute… just ten minutes…<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
The sun shines bright and painful to your eyes. You try to move; you can’t. The pain coursing through your left arm and back won’t allow it. You feel the clothes pressed between your skin and the rocky soil moist, the cut must be bleeding. You look around confused, still laying face-up on the ground… It’s still daytime, so you can’t have been out for too long. Then, a child’s voice. At first imperceptible, but soon you realize what it says; one word.<br />
<br />
- Dad? Dad! Daaad!!<br />
<br />
Struggling to roll over to your right side, you indeed spot a young boy kneeling over the man you rescued. He’s still passed out, and the kid is trying to wake him up. His son, no doubt. Next to him is an older woman, looking on with great concern, possibly his wife. She looks you’re your way; seeing you awake, she rushes toward you with the angriest expression you’ve ever seen on a woman before.<br />
<br />
- What have you done to him?! Answer me!!<br />
<br />
Oh boy. This seems to be a fine day for misunderstandings; first the man, now his wife! Before you can answer, another, more familiar voice echoes through the air. An alarmed, painful “Skaaaaaaaar!”. To the left of the boy you spot Skarméo, still grounded, and pinned down by a relatively small Kangaskhan who’s having no trouble keeping the wounded bird on the ground. It seems she was made captive by the family’s Pokemon to ensure she wouldn’t harm them…<br />
<br />
- What did you do to my husband? What did you do to him?!<br />
<br />
The woman kneels down and slaps you across the face with tears in her eyes. While the pain is nothing compared to what you’ve been through already, it’s enough to make your blood boil, after all you went through to save that bastard…<br />
<br />
Weakened, in dire need of medical treatment and fearing for the safety of Skarméo, as well as wondering, in the back of your mind, if the Teddiursa ever made it, your next words to the woman – and how convincing you sound – will be critical in deciding whether you’ll earn her help… or be left for dead.<br />
<br />
What do you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">On Aduro Island, the trainer William Hale awakens to find himself in excruciating pain, lying in a pool of his own blood, staring up at the sun shining brilliantly over head. Seeing this welcome sight, he lets out a grateful sigh knowing that his Skarmory Skarméo was able to carry both himself and their attacker out of the collapsing tunnel to safety. Closing his eyes, he tries to replay the last few moments underground, but it all seems like such a blur, and he is suddenly filled with anxiety to know whether Teddiursa is safe.<br />
<br />
Just then, a nearby shout catches Will’s attention and interrupts his thoughts. The lad glances around to find an older woman and a small boy kneeling next to the prostrate form of the Cascadian man which he and Skarméo just rescued from the caverns. Will immediately reasons that they must be the man’s wife and son and wonders what their reaction to their loved one's return will be. The youngster sobs for his father, while the woman, seeing that Will has regained consciousness, puts on an angry expression, stands up, and quickly hurries over, demanding to know what's going on.<br />
<br />
It’s at that moment that Skarméo lets out a pained screech, and Will swivels his head around to see the giant steel condor pinned to the ground by an energetic little Kangaskhan. Will motions to Skarméo to lie still and not fight as the woman repeats her questions. Before Will can answer, however, the woman gives him a stinging slap to the face, causing his eyes to water with pain. Realizing he's in no condition to do anything but lie there on the ground and bleed, Will fights back his anger at the woman's ungrateful behavior by gritting his teeth in disgust, before slowly beginning to explain what happened.<br />
<br />
“I was in... ...the caverns,” Will gets out between labored breaths. “Looking for... ...a lost Ursaring.”<br />
<br />
“Your husband... ...thought I... ...was some kind... ...of poacher,” Will continues weakly. “I’m not.”<br />
<br />
He glances at Skarméo and a feeling of fierce pride suddenly surges within him as he thinks back on how she risked her life and bravely flew him and their wounded attacker out of danger.<br />
<br />
Breathing ragged, Will goes on. “That’s when... ...the whole place... ...started to come down... ...Somehow... ...Skarméo carried us... ...out here to safety... ...There was also... ...a wild Teddiursa... ...it was trapped... ...I tried to... ...rescue it... ...with a Pokéball but... ...didn’t get to see... ...if it worked.”<br />
<br />
With a slight groan, Will closes his eyes and lays his head back in utter exhaustion, anxious to know about Teddiursa and wondering how the woman will respond...</span></span></div>

<br />
<b>Geyser Park</b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Hayward</u>:</b> You struggle both to remain conscious and to refrain from lashing out at the woman for the injustice – something you’re in no position to do right now, as she and her son are your only hope.<br />
<br />
Reluctantly, you limit yourself to telling your version of the story, explaining how you meant no harm to anybody in the first place – not toward Aduro Island’s Pokemon, and certainly not toward her husband. Intentionally, you only refer to the man’s misjudgment of character, not to how he attacked you inside the tunnels; making him seem like the bad guy here would lower your chances. Exhausted, you close your eyes, desperately fighting to stay awake while awaiting the verdict.<br />
<br />
The woman stands silent for what seems like an eternity. Then, she turns around and walks away from you. You reopen your eyes to see where she’s going, unable to follow or so much as call her.<br />
<br />
-	Terry, let’s go. With need to get dad to the hospital. Hurry! And bring Kangy along, we don’t need another one being poached.<br />
<br />
She and her son Terry help the man up, each draping one of his arms across their shoulders and pulling him up. The woman then reaches for a Pokeball in her belt and releases another Kangaskhan, considerably larger than the boy’s, and urges it to carry her husband. With little difficulty, the 7-feet-tall Pokemon places the man across her shoulders in an impressive display of <b>Strength</b>. You notice her pouch is empty... was her infant the one that was poached, like the woman said?<br />
<br />
The family starts to walk away, leaving you to your fate. Suddenly, a faint voice, filled with pain, is heard.<br />
<br />
-	No… stop…<br />
<br />
The woman turns around, startled.<br />
<br />
-	B-Barry? Dear, are you okay?! Don’t talk, save your strength! We’re taking you to a hospital right now, honey!<br />
<br />
-	Kelly… t-the boy… where is he?...<br />
<br />
His wife, apparently named Kelly, throws you a confused look.<br />
<br />
-	He’s over there… what did he do to you?! He deserves to be left there for putting you through…<br />
<br />
-	He s… saved me… He said the… the truth. I owe him my life... Now p-please, save his…<br />
<br />
Upon hearing this, the young Terry makes his way over to you running.<br />
<br />
-	Is it true? You saved daddy?! Thank you!! Mom, we can’t leave him here, he’ll… he’s not gonna be okay!<br />
<br />
Kelly ponders on it for a brief moment, then acquiesces.<br />
<br />
-	You’re right. We… if my husband’s right, then we’re in your debt, stranger… Terry, have Kangy carry his Skarmory. You and me will help the young man.<br />
<br />
---- <br />
<br />
It’s morning. You adjust your eyes to the light and try to figure out where you are. There’s a roof over your head, and everything looks so… <i>white</i>. There’s a curtain in front of you, you’re lying on a bed. There’s a needle in your right hand and one on the right side of your neck, each with a tube attached, and the left half of your thorax and upper left arm are tightly bandaged. There are two sacks hanging from a metallic support; one with a transparent fluid, the other with blood, each draining slowly to its respective tube.<br />
<br />
You try to move, but you’re still weak. As long as you stay still though, you feel no pain at all, which is a clear improvement over the last time you were conscious. You must be in a hospital now…<br />
<br />
-	Awake, heh?<br />
<br />
You look to the side. Next to you is the man you rescued, Barry. Not as banged up as you are, but still made to rest in his own bed for precaution, he tries to muster a smile.<br />
<br />
-	I’m sorry boy. I took you for someone you’re not, even though you tried to open my eyes repeatedly. I feel like I owe you an explanation in addition to an apology, though… When we’re both feeling better, I’ll walk you through what’s happening on the island and why I reacted the way I did. In the meantime, I do have some good news… Terry, can you come in please?<br />
<br />
The young boy opens the door and enters the room. Seems he was expecting to be called.<br />
<br />
-	While you were asleep, I asked my wife to talk to the Nurse down in the Pokemon Center on the first floor. She accessed the records of recent PC deposits and contacted the Aduro Pokemon Lab in my behalf. We thought you might like this back.<br />
<br />
Terry, with the largest grin you’ve ever seen on a child, hands you something haphazardly wrapped in a tissue. You smile back and open the gift, your eyes lighting up as you realize what it is. A Chocolate Ball… <i>your</i> Chocolate Ball.<br />
<br />
Pressing the red button in the center, you open the Pokeball, its contents materializing on your lap…<br />
<br />
-	Teddi, Teddiursa!!<br />
<br />
It takes a while for the realization to set in, but your mind can finally be at ease: <b>you’ve captured a Level 4 Male Teddiursa!</b><br />
<br />
The young cub gives you a hug, clearly grateful that you rescued him from that horrible predicament. He curls up on your chest and closes his eyes, clearly still tired from the ordeal, and quickly falls asleep. You can’t help but smile at the huge success your rescue attempt turned out to be… ignoring the fact that you’re confined to a hospital bed, that is.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a cell phone rings. It’s Barry’s. He reaches to his bedside table and picks up.<br />
<br />
- Yes? Honey, hi! I’m doing fine, we already gave W…. what? What’s wrong, why are you talking so low? You.. WHAT?! Hostage?! What do you?... Kelly? KELLY!!<br />
<br />
His face has turned pale. He looks at you delivers the news.<br />
<br />
-	Kelly… she’s downstairs at the Pokemon Center. Says five guys broke in with their Pokemon, wiped the security and are holding everyone hostage… Says she doesn’t know what they’re after and hung up. I… what do we do? She might be kil…<br />
<br />
He stops mid-sentence and turns to Terry.<br />
<br />
-	Son, stay here. Whatever you do, do <i>not</i> go downstairs no matter what! Will, please… please keep an eye on my boy. I have to do something!<br />
<br />
Struggling to get up, he puts on his shoes and walks out of the room limping, closing the door behind him. You’re left alone with Terry and the Teddiursa, still sleeping.<br />
<br />
-	Daaad! Don’t go, don’t leave me here!! Mister, we have to do something, we gotta help mom and dad!!<br />
<br />
The kid’s desperate pleas are heart-wrenching, but what can you do? You feel you might try to muster the necessary strength to get up, after pulling off the needles, but you’re far from your best condition and even walking around will be a chore. You’re on the first floor, and the Pokemon Center is immediately below… but your other Pokemon are down there, too! Skarméo was delivered for healing, and Kelly handed your other remaining Pokeballs to the Nurse for safekeeping as well… Your only partner right now is the recently captured Teddiursa.<br />
<br />
You look out the window; there’s a tree branch you might be able to reach and climb down to get outside, physically punishing as it would be to try and pull it off, but it’d be a way to escape and take the boy to safety. On the other hand, his parents are down there, and there’s no guarantee the captors won’t harm them. You can try to get the boy to safety by fleeing the building, or go down to the floor below and see what you can do – but what will you do with Terry in that case?<br />
<br />
What do you do?</span><br />

<br />
<b>Auronos Caverns</b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>ApertureScience</u>:</b> You feel it’s your duty to explain what really went down, lest Sean mistakes you for a more formidable Trainer than you actually are. Not everyone would have chosen to be truthful in this situation, and fortunately for you, the Gym Leader takes it rather well – seems it’s in his nature to be laidback.<br />
<br />
-	Nah man, it’s cool! Wicked stroke of luck you got there, heh? But wait… I didn’t know Buizel could learn Metronome! How did you teach ‘im that?!<br />
<br />
Easily excitable too, it seems. The “surfer boy” first impression apparently wasn’t too far off. <br />
<br />
-	As for how I saw the battle, well… I wouldn’t just send my Sharpedo off into the unknown without keeping an eye on it, would I? – he asks with a wide green as he fetches a pair of goggles from under the seat.<br />
<br />
Walking to the far edge of the boat, he retrieves a large backpack and lays it at your feet. <br />
<br />
-	First rule of deep-sea diving: always bring extra gear in case something goes wrong. So look in there, I got an extra oxygen mask you can attach to the mini-tank over there. Nice to find someone with a drive for adventure, mate! See, what we’re gonna do here…<br />
<br />
He gears up, strapping an oxygen tank of his own to his back and sitting on the edge of the boat.<br />
<br />
-	… is we gonna bust some myths! There’s a huge underwater cave in particular I’ve been meaning to explore in the last months. So if you’re still up for it, suit up and meet me down there!<br />
<br />
And with that, he dives. You're left alone in the boat, and Max urges you to hurry up before you lose Sean. You hastily rummage through the bag and retrieve the mask, and struggle to fit the other oxygen tank over your shoulders like a backpack, much like Sean had done. The guy is probably a bit out there, but his conversation sparked your interest. What did he mean by &quot;busting a myth&quot;? When you think you got it all working, you jump out the boat and into the water, with Max close behind.<br />
<br />
At first you have a little trouble adjusting to the underwater view, but after a while you spot Sean swimming down a bit further ahead. The oxygen seems to be flowing fine, which is reassuring, and you start flapping your legs hard to go deeper. You swim by a school of Finneon, who scatter as you approach, and further down you see a rocky formation taking form up ahead. Sean seems to know his way aroundm but he slowed down noticeably for you to join up with him; you double your efforts, your legs already hurting a bit, but you persevere - after all, you might have a decent supply of oxygen, but Buizel only has his natural reserves; enhanced in comparison to other Pokemon who can't Dive, but he's no fish. You have to hurry.<br />
<br />
Sean seems aware that you can't afford to go sightseeing and resumes swimming at full speed; after a while of following him, you spot a large opening in the rock wall and head inside. Sure enough, it seems to lead to a cave, as the Gym Leader slowly starts swimming upwards. You do the same, and before long your head is out of water again, stone walls all around you - you made it to the surface, and just in time too, as Max jumps out of the water in distress and inhales deeply three or four times before throwing you an angry stare that read &quot;why the bloody hell did you take so long?!&quot;<br />
<br />
You make it to shore and sit on the cave's rocky ground for a while to rest your legs as you remove the mask. Sean doesn't seem as tired, but he's clearly done this many times before.<br />
<br />
- Not bad mate, glad you could keep up! So, what do you think? A bit chilly, but what's that for a couple of fearless adventurers, right?<br />
<br />
Maxwell rolls his eyes. You get back to your feet and look around the cave - it's big indeed, and there seems to be a tunnel leading deep inside the rock on the far wall.<br />
<br />
- Now, let me explain a bit better. As you might know, Cascadia has been a prime location for the spotting of exceedingly rare Pokemon, what the general population would call &quot;Legendaries&quot;. Well, I've made it my life's goal to disprove a theory about the status of the Pokemon known as Lugia. See, people say it's a one-of-a-kind creature. I disagree, and I've pleaded my case several times with the Pokemon League to let me capture and train a Lugia to use in my Gym on grounds that it actually isn't a single specimen. I've been laughed out of the building every single time, obviously... So now I'm here to hunt for Lugia eggs!!<br />
<br />
He puffs his chest, as if that added to his credibility.<br />
<br />
- There have been several reports of Lugia sightings around Brine Island, and I have good reason to believe it might use this cave as its nest. So what we do is we split up and search; if you find anything relevant, you let me know and vice versa! And how do we do that? We shout! Well, let's get going! Good luck mate!!<br />
<br />
Deeply convinced that his theories and his plan are flawless, Sean starts running toward the tunnel on his own, and before you know it you lose sight of him. You're left all alone in the cave entrance... You reluctantly head for the tunnel as well, Maxwell following close, and sigh as you reach a crossroads: a path on the left, dark and with salt water dripping from the ceiling, and one on the right, illuminated by a flickering green light. You carefully think about what to do before you make your choice to enter either tunnel. <br />
<br />
What do you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: teal">“Just a TM I got from some guy. He changed it to be able to be taught to anything. So now Max here has a bit of a wild card.” James told him, avoiding the complete story on how he obtained the attack. Sean threw him a bag, and James started pulling things out while Sean explained what was going to happen, something about busting myths. Odd, but James didn’t think much of it and set up his oxygen tank. “Okay, let’s go Max. Wouldn’t want him to be waiting on us.” James dived off the edge of the ship, with the Sea Weasel following behind.<br />
<br />
And for once, James was able to see the true beauty of the ocean. He had never really been able to see: he was afraid of opening his eyes underwater. The very thought of it stung his eyelids shut. The fish pokémon were beautiful as well: including a group of Finneon. James quietly considered attempting to find one before being punched in the shoulder and passed up by his Buizel. The two ahead of him took no time to sightsee and blazed ahead towards the cave they supposedly were heading to.<br />
<br />
Eventually, the group reached the cave with seconds to spare as Maxwell jumped ahead into the stone cell, breathing deeply and glaring at his trainer. Sean took a few seconds, and still as insane as ever, started finally explaining his plan, which included capturing a Lugia and using it in his gym to maul challengers. Sean told him to shout if he found anything, then ran off without them. “Well, just us again, huh? Might as well keep moving.” James said and dusted himself off as he got up. “To the caves!” He said, and moved forwards to find treasure. <br />
<br />
Eventually, he found a crossroad: one path lead to a flickering green light, another in to pitch darkness. “I don’t know about you Maxwell, but I’d prefer the lighter side. Agreed?” Maxwell nodded to this, and bounded down the path to the light.</span><br />

<span style="color: lightblue"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>Glacier Island</i></span><br />
<br />
<b>Boreal Wastelands</b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Trepie</u>:</b> The situation was abundantly clear to you: you either complied, or Pandora would be left for dead. Determined to save her – as her life-threatening injury was, at least in part, your responsibility -, you accept the assignment, at the same time planning to bide your time until you could turn the situation in your favour.<br />
<br />
Making a point not to sound subservient, but rather make it clear that you can see right through his intentions, you stand up to the Commander, issuing a very blunt threat of your own. Whether you’d be able to follow through with your claims or not, however, remains to be seen. Commander Kessler for one just smirks, before patting you on the shoulder.<br />
<br />
-	Guts <i>and</i> skill? Seems you’re a keeper. We leave in an hour; join the party at the front gate when you’re ready.<br />
<br />
You turn away from the Commander without another word. Having overheard the conversation, another man in military uniform runs over to you and offers a handshake (instead of a salute, you notice).<br />
<br />
-	Hey man! Welcome aboard! Heard you’re joining us; that was pretty ballsy of you! A word of caution, though… Commander Kessler might seem calm and collected, but rub him the wrong way and you’re gonna regret it… Trust me, step out of line or compromise any small part of this assignment and you might never see your Pokemon again!<br />
<br />
You try to ascertain whether this is another threat, but you conclude that this guy’s just giving you heartfelt advice. From his tone, you can tell he’s genuinely concerned about you, which is a welcome change from the norm so far.<br />
<br />
-	Haven’t introduced myself yet. Name’s Sid Gapp. I’m just a lowly Private around here… but I got picked to join the mission! Seems the Colonel – sorry, the Commander – noticed the effort I put in… Can’t let him down!<br />
<br />
He seems to notice you picked up on his correction, as you give him an inquisitive look.<br />
<br />
-	Oh, that… Commander Kessler was originally in the Navy; that’s why we call him “Commander”, that used to be his rank. But something happened that forced him to join the Army instead, he never talks about it though… and nothing good ever happens to the scrub who asks. We figure he should technically be the equivalent to a Colonel by now, and a lot of the men hate being bossed around by a Navy guy, so we call him Colonel between ourselves to make his orders easier to bear… What’s a regiment without its pride?<br />
<br />
He then points to one of the tents.<br />
<br />
-	That’s where you should head now. There’s a PC inside, make sure to <b>choose which Pokemon you’re bringing along</b> carefully. There are also some supplies in there, you should stock up. The rest of the crew will be by the gate, I’ll introduce you when you get there!<br />
<br />
You thank Private Gapp and head to the tent – there’ll be time for small talk on the way to the mission site, you figure. As you enter, you realize just how fully equipped these guys have come: a PC is indeed switched on and ready for use, and several large shelves and crates are piled up and filled with various supplies: rations, medicine, Pokeballs, ammo, etc. No firearms, but you figure those must be stored elsewhere and inaccessible to outsiders like you.<br />
<br />
You first head over to the PC, and after a while, you decide on the party that will accompany you*. Next you rummage through the shelves, looking for anything useful. You find <b>2x Potion</b>, <b>2x Ice Heal</b> and <b>1x Escape Rope</b>, that you store in your Bag. Finally, you begin to hear some commotion outside, and figure the team is gathering by the front gate, so you take a deep breath and exit the tent.<br />
<br />
You slowly approach the group, seven men in total, all with thick orange overcoats on top of their uniforms. Gapp spots you and hands you an <b>Orange Overcoat</b>** too; it has a purple “N” embroidered on the right arm, which you assume stands for “Nebula”, based on Commander Kessler’s previous speech.<br />
<br />
Kessler himself joins up with you shortly afterwards, dressed in similar fashion. Not saying a word, he jumps on one of the snowmobiles and motions for the team to mobilize. Everyone runs to their snowmobiles in pairs, each vehicle carrying two soldiers. Gapp calls you over to his, motioning for you to sit behind him. You figure he’s probably the best company you can ask for right now and accept the lift. Everyone starts their engines and soon you’re moving through the snow again, passing the front gate into the frozen plains once more.<br />
<br />
James Kessler leads the formation, driving with purpose – seems he’s absolutely certain of the route to follow, even if everything around you looks exactly the same. The other four snowmobiles speed up behind, the frigid wind blowing against your face, but you barely feel the cold at all; you’ve been used to it your entire life, apparently unlike the troops. If it were up to you, you wouldn’t have brought an overcoat at all, but why turn it down? If you make it out of this alive and well, at least you can keep it as a souvenir – if the journey ends up being one to remember fondly, anyway. So far, it’s looking pretty grim…<br />
<br />
You start thinking that you know absolutely nothing about any of this; who is James Kessler, what are these guys truly after, what is Nebula, why they require live Pokemon so badly… You realize the trip is likely going to take a while longer, and Gapp seems like someone you can trust – or at the very least talk to. You might try asking him a few questions, though there probably won’t be time to ask <i>everything</i> that’s been bothering you…<br />
<br />
What do you do?</span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"><br />
<br />
((* Please specify which Pokemon you’re bringing with you in your next reply;<br />
** Not an official FB or Pokemon game Item, but you can still add it to your Inventory and wear it on your character in the future or keep it as a souvenir.))</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: lightblue"><span style="font-size: 9px">Having parted ways with the Commander for the time being Auric felt oddly relieved. He wasn't normally so aggressive with authority figures. The night, this night, had him on edge. Before he could get to far he was stopped by another military man. His out stretched hand was a gesture he had yet to be offered since the ice cave. Auric gave the best smile he could and shook the mans hand. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey man! Welcome aboard! Heard you’re joining us; that was pretty ballsy of you! A word of caution, though… Commander Kessler might seem calm and collected, but rub him the wrong way and you’re gonna regret it… Trust me, step out of line or compromise any small part of this assignment and you might never see your Pokemon again!&quot;<br />
<br />
Again with the veiled threats. Every time these people gained a little bit of trust from Auric they seemed to be tearing it away. If their goal was to keep Auric suspicious then they were doing a bang up job. <br />
<br />
&quot;Haven’t introduced myself yet. Name’s Sid Gapp. I’m just a lowly Private around here… but I got picked to join the mission! Seems the Colonel – sorry, the Commander – noticed the effort I put in… Can’t let him down!&quot;<br />
<br />
The minor slip of the tongue was large enough to peak Auric's interest. &quot;Colonel?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that… Commander Kessler was originally in the Navy; that’s why we call him “Commander”, that used to be his rank. But something happened that forced him to join the Army instead, he never talks about it though… and nothing good ever happens to the scrub who asks. We figure he should technically be the equivalent to a Colonel by now, and a lot of the men hate being bossed around by a Navy guy, so we call him Colonel between ourselves to make his orders easier to bear… What’s a regiment without its pride?&quot; Sid replied before pointing to a near by tent. &quot;That’s where you should head now. There’s a PC inside, make sure to choose which Pokemon you’re bringing along carefully. There are also some supplies in there, you should stock up. The rest of the crew will be by the gate, I’ll introduce you when you get there!&quot;<br />
<br />
Auric nodded to Sid. &quot;Alright. Thank you for your help Private.&quot; With Sid now departed, Auric made his way to the tent and stepped inside. What he saw made him do a double take. Who ever these guys were they were well equipped. The tent was lined with shelves of supplies. They may be struggling out here but they weren't in dire straits for surplus just yet. Still he didn't want to pull too many resources from them. <i>Well let's get this done.</i> he thought to himself moving to the PC. It was a step up from the model PC used in Pokemon centers. Looking through his team he saw each of their profile pictures flashing on the screen. He paused on Pandora's picture for a minute. &quot;I promise I'll be back for you Pandora. Please be ok...&quot; he spoke quietly to himself before minimizing her profile. <br />
<br />
He had to consider the conditions outside and who would be viable out there. <i>'Hyperion couldn't fly in this cold, Athene would freeze, Pontus and Eris are too inexperienced. Zephy and Perseus don't have the greatest traction as it is, Chiron's too heavy for the ice to support his weight, Midas would freeze up, Phrixus would be scared of all these people and I couldn't trust Thanatos around other people'</i> He thought to himself, minimizing window after window. It didn't take him long until the screen only had a few profiles left standing.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://forums.upnetwork.net/showpost.php?p=242753&amp;postcount=1" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.upnetwork.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D242753%26postcount%3D1&amp;hash=ac46ce86cde446a6f9aa18f1455249ee" rel="nofollow noopener"><b>Charizard- Ares<br />
Houndoom- Iris<br />
Nidoking- Odysseus</b></a><br />
<br />
It was a decent line up. With Pandora down his team was lacking another ice type, so he'd have to rely on Pokemon who were their own heat source or simply too rugged to be bothered by the cold arctic air. Plus with Iris along for the ride Ares wouldn't have so much weight on his shoulders if they were to get into trouble. Powering down the PC Auric turned his attention to the supplies. On the first shelf he came to he picked up 2x Potions, and 2X Ice heals. A few feet away on a bottom shelf he grabbed 1X Escape rope just in case they ran into another situation where they were backed into a corner. Not wanting to over take he left the tent and headed back towards the gate.<br />
<br />
It wasn't a huge crowd but it was much larger then Auric was used to working with. Private Gapp walked over and handed Auric an Orange overcoat. It wasn't really Auric's style, but his current jacket was still frozen. So Auric smiled and took the coat. Slipping it on he noticed a purple 'N' on the sleeve. <i>Nebula</i> he thought to himself as Kessler headed over to the group. When Kessler gave an order his people were quick to follow. Everyone pairing off onto snowmobiles. Private Gapp motioning for Auric to his snowmobile. <i>Here we go</i> was all he could think as the fleet of snow mobiles sped off into the night. <br />
<br />
The adventure was on. Commander Kessler leading his team deep into the unknown tundra. At least this time his coat wasn't frozen. Still, there was an opportunity to be had being stuck on this snow mobile with the nicest member of this group he had talked to. Time to see if he could gather some information. Maybe they were good, or maybe not, but Auric didn't have enough information yet to make a call either way and there might not be another time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry if this is overstepping a little, but I have to ask. What is Nebula and what the hell are you guys doing out here? I mean I know you're looking for certain strains of Pokemon DNA, and live specimens have been hard to come by, but what is all this for?&quot; Auric asked hoping the sound of the engine would drown out their conversation to the others. </span></span></div>

<span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>Aduro Island</i></span><br />
<br />
<b>Geyser Park</b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Hayward</u>:</b> You struggle both to remain conscious and to refrain from lashing out at the woman for the injustice – something you’re in no position to do right now, as she and her son are your only hope.<br />
<br />
Reluctantly, you limit yourself to telling your version of the story, explaining how you meant no harm to anybody in the first place – not toward Aduro Island’s Pokemon, and certainly not toward her husband. Intentionally, you only refer to the man’s misjudgment of character, not to how he attacked you inside the tunnels; making him seem like the bad guy here would lower your chances. Exhausted, you close your eyes, desperately fighting to stay awake while awaiting the verdict.<br />
<br />
The woman stands silent for what seems like an eternity. Then, she turns around and walks away from you. You reopen your eyes to see where she’s going, unable to follow or so much as call her.<br />
<br />
- Terry, let’s go. With need to get dad to the hospital. Hurry! And bring Kangy along, we don’t need another one being poached.<br />
<br />
She and her son Terry help the man up, each draping one of his arms across their shoulders and pulling him up. The woman then reaches for a Pokeball in her belt and releases another Kangaskhan, considerably larger than the boy’s, and urges it to carry her husband. With little difficulty, the 7-feet-tall Pokemon places the man across her shoulders in an impressive display of <b>Strength</b>. You notice her pouch is empty... was her infant the one that was poached, like the woman said?<br />
<br />
The family starts to walk away, leaving you to your fate. Suddenly, a faint voice, filled with pain, is heard.<br />
<br />
- No… stop…<br />
<br />
The woman turns around, startled.<br />
<br />
- B-Barry? Dear, are you okay?! Don’t talk, save your strength! We’re taking you to a hospital right now, honey!<br />
<br />
- Kelly… t-the boy… where is he?...<br />
<br />
His wife, apparently named Kelly, throws you a confused look.<br />
<br />
- He’s over there… what did he do to you?! He deserves to be left there for putting you through…<br />
<br />
- He s… saved me… He said the… the truth. I owe him my life... Now p-please, save his…<br />
<br />
Upon hearing this, the young Terry makes his way over to you running.<br />
<br />
- Is it true? You saved daddy?! Thank you!! Mom, we can’t leave him here, he’ll… he’s not gonna be okay!<br />
<br />
Kelly ponders on it for a brief moment, then acquiesces.<br />
<br />
- You’re right. We… if my husband’s right, then we’re in your debt, stranger… Terry, have Kangy carry his Skarmory. You and me will help the young man.<br />
<br />
---- <br />
<br />
It’s morning. You adjust your eyes to the light and try to figure out where you are. There’s a roof over your head, and everything looks so… <i>white</i>. There’s a curtain in front of you, you’re lying on a bed. There’s a needle in your right hand and one on the right side of your neck, each with a tube attached, and the left half of your thorax and upper left arm are tightly bandaged. There are two sacks hanging from a metallic support; one with a transparent fluid, the other with blood, each draining slowly to its respective tube.<br />
<br />
You try to move, but you’re still weak. As long as you stay still though, you feel no pain at all, which is a clear improvement over the last time you were conscious. You must be in a hospital now…<br />
<br />
- Awake, heh?<br />
<br />
You look to the side. Next to you is the man you rescued, Barry. Not as banged up as you are, but still made to rest in his own bed for precaution, he tries to muster a smile.<br />
<br />
- I’m sorry boy. I took you for someone you’re not, even though you tried to open my eyes repeatedly. I feel like I owe you an explanation in addition to an apology, though… When we’re both feeling better, I’ll walk you through what’s happening on the island and why I reacted the way I did. In the meantime, I do have some good news… Terry, can you come in please?<br />
<br />
The young boy opens the door and enters the room. Seems he was expecting to be called.<br />
<br />
- While you were asleep, I asked my wife to talk to the Nurse down in the Pokemon Center on the first floor. She accessed the records of recent PC deposits and contacted the Aduro Pokemon Lab in my behalf. We thought you might like this back.<br />
<br />
Terry, with the largest grin you’ve ever seen on a child, hands you something haphazardly wrapped in a tissue. You smile back and open the gift, your eyes lighting up as you realize what it is. A Chocolate Ball… <i>your</i> Chocolate Ball.<br />
<br />
Pressing the red button in the center, you open the Pokeball, its contents materializing on your lap…<br />
<br />
- Teddi, Teddiursa!!<br />
<br />
It takes a while for the realization to set in, but your mind can finally be at ease: <b>you’ve captured a Level 4 Male Teddiursa!</b><br />
<br />
The young cub gives you a hug, clearly grateful that you rescued him from that horrible predicament. He curls up on your chest and closes his eyes, clearly still tired from the ordeal, and quickly falls asleep. You can’t help but smile at the huge success your rescue attempt turned out to be… ignoring the fact that you’re confined to a hospital bed, that is.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a cell phone rings. It’s Barry’s. He reaches to his bedside table and picks up.<br />
<br />
- Yes? Honey, hi! I’m doing fine, we already gave W…. what? What’s wrong, why are you talking so low? You.. WHAT?! Hostage?! What do you?... Kelly? KELLY!!<br />
<br />
His face has turned pale. He looks at you delivers the news.<br />
<br />
- Kelly… she’s downstairs at the Pokemon Center. Says five guys broke in with their Pokemon, wiped the security and are holding everyone hostage… Says she doesn’t know what they’re after and hung up. I… what do we do? She might be kil…<br />
<br />
He stops mid-sentence and turns to Terry.<br />
<br />
- Son, stay here. Whatever you do, do <i>not</i> go downstairs no matter what! Will, please… please keep an eye on my boy. I have to do something!<br />
<br />
Struggling to get up, he puts on his shoes and walks out of the room limping, closing the door behind him. You’re left alone with Terry and the Teddiursa, still sleeping.<br />
<br />
- Daaad! Don’t go, don’t leave me here!! Mister, we have to do something, we gotta help mom and dad!!<br />
<br />
The kid’s desperate pleas are heart-wrenching, but what can you do? You feel you might try to muster the necessary strength to get up, after pulling off the needles, but you’re far from your best condition and even walking around will be a chore. You’re on the first floor, and the Pokemon Center is immediately below… but your other Pokemon are down there, too! Skarméo was delivered for healing, and Kelly handed your other remaining Pokeballs to the Nurse for safekeeping as well… Your only partner right now is the recently captured Teddiursa.<br />
<br />
You look out the window; there’s a tree branch you might be able to reach and climb down to get outside, physically punishing as it would be to try and pull it off, but it’d be a way to escape and take the boy to safety. On the other hand, his parents are down there, and there’s no guarantee the captors won’t harm them. You can try to get the boy to safety by fleeing the building, or go down to the floor below and see what you can do – but what will you do with Terry in that case?<br />
<br />
What do you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px"><br />
<br />
In a medical facility somewhere on Aduro Island, the trainer William Hale comes to and finds himself in a sterile recovery room, dressed in<span style="font-size: 9px"> a</span> plain hospital gown, hooked up to an IV, with the upper half of his body wrapped tightly in clean bandages. The pain he felt after having escaped from the collapsing cavern has lessened considerably, however as he attempts to reposition himself, he quickly realizes that he<span style="font-size: 9px"> still has some soreness and that </span>his strength hasn't fully returned yet.<br />
<br />
Just then a voice comes on to remark that Will has finally awakened, and the lad bolts in surprise when he looks to one side to see that the speaker is none other than Barry, the man he and his Skarmory<span style="font-size: 9px">,</span> Skarm</span></span><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">é</span></span><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">o, had rescued from underground danger. Before Will can say anything however, Barry goes on to apologize for everything that happened earlier, then promises to tell Will why he responded so harshly once they have both fully recovered. Will nods <span style="font-size: 9px">and assures him not to <span style="font-size: 9px">worry about it, and</span></span> the man suddenly calls for his son Terry to come into the room. Almost im<span style="font-size: 9px">mediately,</span> the youngster enters, wearing an enormous smile on his face and carrying something hastily wrapped in a thin, tissue-like covering. Terry holds it out to Will who gratefully accepts the gift and eagerly opens it to discover that the item inside is none other than the Chocolate Pok</span></span><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">éb</span></span><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">all he tossed at Teddiursa.<br />
<br />
Pressing the round trigger switch, the candy-coated capture capsule quadruples in size before cracking along its midline to release a mass of white energy which molds itself into the form of a tiny bear cub, then fades to reveal a chestnut-colored male Teddiursa who coos his species' name as Will lets out a grateful sigh that his rescue attempt was successful and that the litt<span style="font-size: 9px">le Pok</span></span></span><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">émon</span></span><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px"> is alive and safe after all. As Teddiursa snuggles up to Will, clearly appreciative of the boy's heroic acts on its behalf, the lad confesses that he simply acted on impulse in the cavern and never really considered at the time that he was actually acquiring a new teammate. Turning to Teddiursa, Will inquires if it would in fact like to accompany him and his companions on their travels, and the tiny cub nods enthusiastically in agreement before suddenly drifting off to sleep<span style="font-size: 9px">, still <span style="font-size: 9px">somewhat exhausted from the whole ordeal.</span></span><br />
<br />
Just then Barry's phone rings, and the man answers to hear the panic-stricken voice of his wife Kelly on the other end. He <span style="font-size: 9px">gapes his mouth as he list<span style="font-size: 9px">ens</span></span> to her talk for a moment, then exclaims in shock at the woman's awful news that the downstairs floor of the hospital has just been taken hostage. Will and Terry look on in stunned silence as the man tries to gather more information from his terrified wife, but to everyone's horror, the call suddenly cuts out mid-sentence, and Barry turns to the two boys with a grave look on his face. He sternly warns them not to leave the room or go downstairs, then struggles out of bed, slips on his shoes, and limps off towards the door, exclaiming that he is going do something about their current threat.<br />
<br />
Once Barry has left, Terry cries out in anguish that he wants to help too, and pleads with Will to <span style="font-size: 9px">let</span> him follow his father. However, Will <span style="font-size: 9px">has finally just gained the Cascadian man<span style="font-size: 9px">'s trus<span style="font-size: 9px">t and is hesitant to disobey his order now. </span></span></span>Dragging a hand through his short brown hair, Will glances at his surroundings and thinks hard to come up with a plan. Through an adjacent window, he spies a tree branch, and wonders briefly if they could climb down to the ground below and sneak off to safety before being spotted, but then realizes that in his present condition, it would be an extremely difficult task<span style="font-size: 9px">.</span> Besides, he doubts that Terry would want to be separated from his parents, even if it meant that the youngster himself was safe. For a moment, Will considers <span style="font-size: 9px">consenting to Terry's plea to </span>follow Barry to the ground floor and possibly lending a hand, but with only Teddiursa available for action, Will speculates that the hostage-takers might have them outmatched.<br />
</span></span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">As difficult as it may be, <span style="font-size: 9px">for the ti<span style="font-size: 9px">me being, </span></span>Will feels <span style="font-size: 9px">that </span>the best course of action is <span style="font-size: 9px">simply</span> just to stay put and lie low as Barry instructed, while waiting to see what develops. A veteran of many travels, Will realizes though that he should take precautions and do his best to be ready for anything. He rouses <span style="font-size: 9px">his still sleeping Teddiursa, who he has decided to nickname </span>Urs</span></span><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">éo, and </span></span><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">quickly explains their situation before remarking that while they wait he plans to teach it some new skills that may help to defend both themselves and Terry.
