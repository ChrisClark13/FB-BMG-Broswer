<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange"><b><u><i>Ruin Island</i></u><i><br />
Military Base, Arc_Angel: Reply in DarkOrange</i></b><br />
You suddenly remembered Drusilla—perhaps she was safe and could help her trainer. However, that thought was quickly pushed out of your head, it wasn’t very likely after all. You finally resort to something you deem very disgusting, putting your hands behind your head and pushing against the prison bars with your leg. You hoped to entice the male guard, or whoever was that, just hoping that there weren’t any female guards around to mess up your plan.<br />
<br />
However, things finally seemed to go your way as the male guard from earlier showed up once again, hearing your comment. Instantly, he began to sweat and stutter, saying, “S-S-Sure, we can g-get you something to d-d-drink.” He said, walking away once again, but not getting close enough for you to reach him. A few short moments later, he was back, with friends, and a glass of water. His friends start smiling, but staying back, having dirty thoughts in their heads. The guard with the water got very close to you. “Here is some water, this is against our policy, so thank your lucky stars.” He said. You take the water, drop it, then quickly grab his hand and slam him against the bars. “Woah woah woah! What do you think you’re doing?!” asked one of the other guards. “I’m getting the boss!” said another, running out. The others stayed and tried to help him. You squeeze harder, causing more pain for the helpless guard. “Don’t come any closer, she’s killing me when you assholes do!” yelled the guard frantically.<br />
<br />
A few moments later, the guard who left came back with the commander of the base. All the other guards saluted him and told him of the situation. “Colonel, this crazy woman just lunged forward and trapped Mike against the bars! You gotta do something!” said one of the guards. The colonel rubbed his chin and began to speak. “Alright, alright. Since you’ve done nothing wrong—except help your old friend, Ranjona—I’ll let you go if you let go of him,” he said holding up his hands, “I promise.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><i>Amor Temple, Khom?s: Reply in DarkOrange</i></b><br />
“You will? That’s fantastic, thank you!” says the man, “My name is Krane by the way.” He ushers you to follow him deeper inside the temple, the only way out, apparently. You look around the temple to see strange plants growing here and there. You also notice Krane walking strangely, not in a straight line like people usually do, but in a sort of zigzag pattern. “You have to be careful, the Pokemon are around, you can’t just run into them, that makes them angry.” He says quietly.<br />
<br />
After some time, you finally reach what looks like the main chamber of the temple. “Okay, so, I always start here, but no matter what, I always end up here because this temple is really confusing.” Krane remarks. Your attention is instantly drawn to the waterfall in the center. You assume that he gets his water from here, as this seems to be the only source of water. “There are doors upon doors upon doors, always leading to something different,” Krane says, “I always seem to pick the wrong combination, as it leads me back here.” Looking around, you see the multitude of doors, each leading somewhere, some mysterious place inside the temple. “There is only one right way out of here. Since I’m not very certain which door to go through, can you pick one for me?” Krane asks.</span><br />

<span style="color: silver"><b><u><i>Brine Island</i></u><i><br />
Salin City, Lemon~Lime: Reply in Silver</i></b><br />
The woman replied, “That robber took my purse with all my money and medication in it!” she sobbed. You tried to reassure her that her purse would get back to her, but she kept sobbing. Meanwhile, the two Magnemites silently floated away. Your own Pokemon obey your orders as Pear the Bellsprout releases a cloud of <b>Sleep Powder</b> after the masked bandit, who inhales the powder. He instantly gets drowsy, and then sleeps. Gek continues on by firing an <b>Ice Beam</b>, effectively freezing the robber to the ground, making him immobile. However, the robber also wakes up because of the sudden cold. He struggles to get free, but he has no luck.<br />
<br />
You walk up to him and take the purse. “Hey, what’s the big idea?! Did you do this to me?” asks the robber, still trying to get free. You ignore him for the time being and hand the purse back to the woman. “Thank you, th-th-thank you very m-much.” She says, still a bit shaky. “Let me give you something for your troubles.” She says as she digs into her purse to find something suitable. She takes out a <b>Rindo Berry</b>. “I’m afraid that’s all I have to give you for now.” She says, handing the berry to you. She says goodbye and leaves. You shift your attention to the robber. “Are you going to leave me here or let me go?! Sheesh!” he says.</span></span></div>

SilverWind</b></u> – <b>Pearl Lake</b><i>Reply in deepskyblue<br />
<br />
</i></span></span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"> <span style="color: DeepSkyBlue">As you gave your orders to your Abra takes the form of another pokemon, its evolution, Kadabra. After you give your pokemon their orders they set to work. On the other hand, your opponents prepare for their own attacks. Pathos begins it by searching the three enemy pokemon to attract and finds out that only one pokemon is a female... The Feraligatr! It looks at the Abra who dances around in a distracting manner, then as they lock eyes, the Feraligatr, being struck by the apparent beauty of the Kadabra, doesn't realise a black ray entering it's eyes and lulling it to sleep. Pathos realises the redundancy of trying to attract a sleeping pokemon and <b>kisses </b>her <b>sweet</b>ly on the cheek, as she yawns one more time as she dreams of her boyfriend, and her<b> Fatal Attraction</b>.<br />
<br />
Somewhere alse on the area Bubbles begins to focus his energy. Or at least he tries, but is stopped by the Golduck using an <b>aqua jet </b>to stop his energy from focusing. However, as the Golduck had gotten close enough for the<b> Faint Attack</b> to hit and knock the Golduck ten feet into the air! As the duck pokemon came down Bubbles catches it and<b> Crushes</b> its left arm with its <b>Claw</b>. The Golduck feels the pain of the attack and doubles over, falling into the water in the process. This leaves the Dewgong. Boy is that important.<br />
<br />
As Tortuga begins to create a<b> haze </b>around itself, the Seel, and the Dewgong it is stopped from happening with a dose of <b>icy wind</b>, courtesy of the Dewgong. However as it begins to make the wind more powerful to attack it is countered by the Seel who angrily counters with its own<b> Icy wind</b>, that not only matches the power of the Older seal pokemon, but outmatches it! As It does that Tortuga Makes a <b>ring </b>of <b>water </b>around itself to heal itself later. The Seel looks back at Tortuga and you and it shows in it's eyes, It wants Tortuga's help to defeat the scarier looking seal. You might as well, considering that the Feraligatr is sleeping and The Golduck is distracted by the pain in its arm. Bubbles looks a bit ruffed up, but not in the way that it could break down any time soon.<br />
<br />
What shall you do?<br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DeepSkyBlue">Pathos started the battle by immediately scanning the field for a possible suitor. Golduck was the only given at this point, the Dewgong seemed pretty manly, Feraligatr on the other hand seemed quite pretty for something so beastly. Her gigantic thighs, masculine figure, untamed scales, this was far from Pathos’ dream girl.. But hey.. Every progeny needs a little lovin’ sometimes, and Pathos wasn’t one to disappoint. Releasing the toxic pheromone, known only as his Fatal Attraction. This attack could leave even the strongest of opponents cringing from the pain of their unspoken love, never to be whole or complete. To further his plan in total seduction, to lay a gentle Kiss on the rough scaled cheek of the lovers denied, ever so sweetly did the giant gator lull herself to sleep with thoughts of passion and romance.<br />
<br />
Red thought of the best course for this battle. She was asleep right now, but Pathos didn’t have any attacks that could take advantage of this state. But.. There was something, something alittle risky that just might work. As the Feraligatr lay in a helpless state, “Pathos! Lets <b>Swap</b> the <b>Guard</b> with the Feraligatr, this will take an incredible amount of energy. After creating a link between the two of you, take a well deserved <b>Rest</b>, battle will resume once you awake from your slumber.”<br />
<br />
Bubbles continued with an attempt to Focus all his Energy for future attacks, but was rudely interrupted by a blast of Water, courtesy of our friendly neighbourhood Globberduck. Completely enraged by this unexpected refreshment, Bubbz body was soon consumed with a dark aura, and within a matter of seconds, disappeared, only to knock the golduck up into the air. His claws still trembling with excitement extended out for the Golducks arm as he came flying back down to earth, doing some decent damage to the duck.<br />
<br />
“Alright Bubbz keep your eye on the prize now,” Red said, “Let’s show this Golduck we don’t take to kindly to little butt moochers. Use your <b>Pursuit</b> to lay some Dark damage on the psychic type, followed by a brutal <b>Slash</b> to the neck, or maybe even that bad arm. Yawning should get it nice and drowsy in time for out next round.” Turning to the Seel and the Squirtle, Red wasted no time in ordering Tortuga’s attack’s. “<b>Ice Beam</b>! Give it a something surprising like an <b>Ice Punch</b>, ending with a <b>Blizzard</b>.&quot;</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><br />
</span><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Green">As Rocky leads the Carnivorous Plant pokemon towards the breeding ground you follow it wearily. In one day you had fought off Spiders, Lead a fly to an orgie and were now following a plant towards its food. As you reach the grounds with the Pokemon ahead you watch the scene in horror. The Plant pokemon calls out and out of the ground uproot many more Carnivine, most about the size of the father, but some about the size of a pin. They begin attacking, and as they do so the single Volbeat and his harem of Illumise are surprised and don't fight back. The Carnivine begin eating the bugs in many grotesque ways from bloodily decapitating them to drinking their blood as it came out of their arm sockets. As you see the battle reaching to a close a different Carnivine begins to dash at you and leaps...<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>STOPPPPPPPPPP!</i>&quot; the father Carnivine calls out, &quot;<i>We made a deal, leave the tasty human alone</i>.&quot;<br />
As the plant pokemon leaps away you see that there are only three Illumise left, along with their lone male counterpart. &quot;<i>Leave. Now!</i>&quot; You ponder why the bugs argue with the plants and Rocky begins to hear &quot;<i>We need a food source. Go, Mate, We'll wait for your descendants</i>.&quot; You see the plans smile widen to a horrible degree. The Bugs leave, the Volbeat saddened by the loss of his many mates.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Three shall have to do...</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
Having eaten every possible scrap of flesh from the area the Carnivine disperse, except for the father and young one that had been with you from the start. &quot;<i>You didn't eat anything</i>?!&quot; The Pokemon looks at you and walks, alongside it the young pokemon. &quot;<i>Look, I need a favor, convince your master to fees my son please? If you do I will give you this Stone thingy I found.&quot; </i>He says to Rocky. You look at its hands and see a leaf stone init.<br />
<br />
What shall you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: green"><span style="font-size: 9px">As the carnage took place, Rocky could do no more than to look at the ground in disgust, and her unfortunate trainer slumped to the ground and puked beside her. Paul had gone through a lot tonight, and the little acorn couldn’t help but feel bad for him. Surely when he buried her in the campground dirt that one summer, he didn’t think he’d become the witness to copper-blood decapitations and disembowelments. <br />
<br />
The acorn looked up at the carnivines that had not dispersed, and the look of disgust on her face deepened when they told her that the little one hadn’t eaten yet.<br />
<br />
“<i>Maybe your kid’s just stupid, then. Maybe you could’ve shared, you dick. Maybe…</i>” the seedot stopped suddenly. A big wave of excitement flowed through her as soon as she saw the leaf-shaped rock that the big carnivine held in its leafy arm, and her eyes glinted deviously. “<i>I’m not going to feed my trainer to you, if that’s what you’re implying.</i>” She spoke nonchalantly as if uninterested; as if to make them think that the thought never crossed her mind.<br />
<br />
Luckily Paul noticed the stone too, and after clearing his mouth of acid remnants, finally spoke up. <br />
<br />
“Hey, hey, hey, is that what I think it is?” he asked, looking up in awe at the stone and crawling over to have a closer look. “That… that’s great.” He forced a smile and pushed his glasses up from the tip of his nose. He looked at Rocky, “Is that something you want, man?”<br />
<br />
The seedot proceeded to move in front of Paul and stood her ground. She wasn’t going to let the big weeds scam her. She then decided to start a negotiation, and began by inquiring, “<i>How is this going to work?</i>”</span></span></div>

The woman replied, “That robber took my purse with all my money and medication in it!” she sobbed. You tried to reassure her that her purse would get back to her, but she kept sobbing. Meanwhile, the two Magnemites silently floated away. Your own Pokemon obey your orders as Pear the Bellsprout releases a cloud of <b>Sleep Powder</b> after the masked bandit, who inhales the powder. He instantly gets drowsy, and then sleeps. Gek continues on by firing an <b>Ice Beam</b>, effectively freezing the robber to the ground, making him immobile. However, the robber also wakes up because of the sudden cold. He struggles to get free, but he has no luck.<br />
<br />
You walk up to him and take the purse. “Hey, what’s the big idea?! Did you do this to me?” asks the robber, still trying to get free. You ignore him for the time being and hand the purse back to the woman. “Thank you, th-th-thank you very m-much.” She says, still a bit shaky. “Let me give you something for your troubles.” She says as she digs into her purse to find something suitable. She takes out a <b>Rindo Berry</b>. “I’m afraid that’s all I have to give you for now.” She says, handing the berry to you. She says goodbye and leaves. You shift your attention to the robber. “Are you going to leave me here or let me go?! Sheesh!” he says.</span></span>

While Mike tried to comfort the lady, she started crying, unable to bear the thought that all her valuables would be at the disposal of the thief. “That robber took my purse with all my money and medication in it!” the woman suddenly cried out. &quot;It's okay, ma'am.&quot; Mike said. &quot;You'll get it back soon.&quot; The woman, not comforted, continued to shed tears. &quot;Goodbye!&quot; Mike cried after the two leaving Magnemite, who he had just noticed following his orders and going away. Meanwhile, Pear and Gek ran after the mysterious masked man. Thinking quickly, Pear shot a cloud of Sleep Powder into the man’s face, stopping him in his tracks and giving him a chance to take a nice nap. Gek also followed orders and used an Ice Beam on the snoozing man, freezing him to the ground. The man jolted up suddenly, awakened by the extreme cold. Struggling to no avail, Gek climbed on top of him and raised a claw in triumph.<br />
<br />
Mike helped the woman over to the thief and took the purse from beside him where it had fell when he dozed off. “Here,” he said, Ditto tagging alongside him. “Your purse, madam.” Gratefully, she accepted the purse and thanked him quite shakily. “Thank you, th-th-thank you very m-much,” she said, still in shock at having been burgled. “Let me give you something for your troubles.” Mike looked alarmed. He had just been doing what he thought had been right. He certainly wasn’t expecting a reward. “Oh, that’s alri-“ he began, only to be cut off by the lady handing him a Rindo Berry from her purse. “I’m afraid that’s all I have to give you for now,” she said. “Wow!” Mike said in reply. “This is one of the rarest berries I’ve ever seen! Thanks!” Waving goodbye as the lady walked away, Mike turned and faced the thief. “Well,” he wondered aloud. “What have we here?” Angered, the masked perpetrator asked “Are you going to leave me here or let me go?! Sheesh!” “Well,” Mike replied, “ There isn’t anyone around and I don’t have a phone with me, so I can’t contact the police. And it just wouldn’t be right to let you go on your evil way.” After thinking for a moment, Mike came up with a solution. “Gek,” he said. “<b>x2 Ice Beams</b> on the man. Then, catch up with us. Yell if anything happens.” Walking off of the street into a more populated area of the city, Mike recalled Pear and Scorpio. “Now,” he remarked to the Ditto, “Let’s go get a bite to eat. You can tell me some stuff about your owner that might help us, then we’ll get right to searching.”</span></span></div>

As time passes you feel seconds steadily melt into hours and before you know it night falls. You wearily realise that you have reached the bane forest, and begin to look at the area, many trees in bad shape on the ground, the others felt like stone, as if they were made out of it.

You awaken a while later, and by the position of the moon you realise its been at least 6 hours, the log has been removed from on top of you. After looking around you feel that you are not alone, and be gin to hear some chanting in a strange nasally voice, three of them to be exact.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;I LOVE YOOOOUUUUU!

The small flytrap pokemon looks at you and at its father and gives a look as it to say 'Why them?' </span><span style="color: darkgreen">But before you do anything its father speaks again, &quot;<i>You will follow them you, lazy ass, and if you don't come back willing to hunt for your own food then don't come back at all!&quot;</i> The father Carnivine barks at its son who comes to you with teary eyes, wether from hunger or sadness you couldn't tell.

</i>As you finish giving your orders to your pokemon they set off to attack. Forstly, Bubbles takes advantage of the Golduck feeling pain and and rushes up to it, The Golduck tries to run but is caught in a <b>pursuit</b>, Bubbles then proceeds to taking him out of the water and pinning him down, where he violently begins to<b> slash</b> at the duck pokemon. He manages to create a tear in the Golducks Right arm, causing it pain but numbing the pain in its arm. Feeling the pain leaving its body the Golduck retaliates with a <b>psychic</b> attack, which normally would cause strong damage to Bubbles. However, the attack is done at close range, causing Bubbles to be knocked back by an even stronger Psychic attack. The Golduck takes advantage of this and runs toward the Sloth Pokemon, starting its own string of <b>slash</b> attacks...<br />
<br />
Somewhere alse on the field, Pathos begins to<b> swap</b> its <b>guard</b> powers with the Feraligatr, who feels a little nudge and begins to awake, Oh-oh! However, as it turns it closes its eyes and Yawns! That was a close one. Where did the yawn come from though? Bubbles, having pushed the Golduck away with its size advantage had done that <b>yawn</b> attack, causing drowsiness in both enemy pokemon. As Pathos finishes his swap you see his arms and chest buffer than they were before, and the Feraligatr with tiny arms, looking rediculous in its supertoned body. Pathos feels a lack of energy and lays down beside you for a quick <b>rest</b>.<br />
<br />
The two other pokemon on your side leap into the water and begin sircling the much more powerful Dewgong, looking for an opening... Finally they catch one whenthe pokemon looks at the Seel, and Tortuga shoots a<b> beam</b> of<b> ice</b> at it, the Dewgong shrugs away the attack and <b>growls</b> at Tortuga. The seel takes the oportunity to cheer for the Dewgong and causes it to do an <b>encore</b> of a useless attack. When the two pokemon notice this they begin attacking, Tortuga hitting it with an <b>Ice punch</b> to distract it, and the Seel bringing in the<b> rain</b> with a <b>dance</b>. As it pours the pokemon focus in the larger seal and the Seel makes a wind as <b>Icy</b> as the north pole, causing Tortuga's following <b>Blizzard</b> attack to take less energy than usual. The Dewgong winces in pain as it is struck with the blast full force, and retreats back, ready for the next round.<br />
<br />
Bubbles took a bi hit this round and his health is at 3/4ths normal, while his energy is at about 4/5ths. Tortuga has near perfect health and 6/7ths of his energy left. With the pouring rain, water attacks would be at their best right now...<br />

You begin to walk into a foul-smelling wretched forest, boy, when Prestige said you had bad taste in places he meant it! As time passes you feel seconds steadily melt into hours and before you know it night falls. You wearily realise that you have reached the bane forest, and begin to look at the area, many trees in bad shape on the ground, the others felt like stone, as if they were made out of it. You look up and see that there is something glimmering on the top of a tree but as you look up a tree beside you topples over. You hear a loud crack, and the world goes black...</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"><br />

You awaken a while later, and by the position of the moon you realise its been at least 6 hours, the log has been removed from on top of you. After looking around you feel that you are not alone, and be gin to hear some chanting in a strange nasally voice, three of them to be exact.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;I LOVE YOOOOUUUUU! YOUUU LOVVVEEE MMMEEEE</i>.&quot; You look around and see three dinosaur pokemon, Cranidos, who happen to be of all sorts of strange <a href="http://s317.photobucket.com/albums/mm371/Psychopath2008/th_Dibujo6.png" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fs317.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fmm371%2FPsychopath2008%2Fth_Dibujo6.png&amp;hash=3165edf859993c2f62f268ddf8cb7e1e" rel="nofollow noopener">coloring.</a> Before you can even say anything they speak up in the same strangely comedic, if not someowhat creepy, voice &quot;We are the quardians of the trees.

<br />
&quot;We do however need to protect this land so PLEASE leave, we wouldn't want to HUG you to death.&quot; Continues the yellow one, in its weird nasaly voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;OR you could help us...&quot; the third green one finished.<br />
<br />
With three eerily familiar dinosaurs in your sight you think of your possible objectives, help them with whatever they want, or leave.<br />
<br />

</blockquote><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorchid">She woke up in a daze, head aching as if being smacked with a sledgehammer. The last thing she remembered was a crack beside her and a tree toppling over... which was obviously what caused her to black out, of course. Beside her stood Prestige, poking her leg with a stick hopefully, looking somewhat desperate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, what time is it?&quot; Alina said, rubbing her head. Prestige flung the stick over his shoulder hugged her, overjoyed to see that she was finally awake, and said <i>&quot;Oh, dear God, PLEASE, TAKE ME AWAY. It's been like, 6 hours, dumbass, can't you see the moon? You're obviously not blind.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Alina could barely comprehend why exactly her Abra was so joyous, with her headache and all, but it didn't take a genius to figure out what had caused the desperation in her Abra once she heard what sounded like a chant off to her side...<br />
<br />
&quot;I LOVE YOOOOUUUUU! YOUUU LOVVVEEE MMMEEEE!&quot; <br />
<br />
Alina looked over to see three Cranidos, in peculiar colors, singing away and dancing merrily. The purple one chanted, &quot;We are the quardians of the trees. WE SHARE!&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;I've been listening to that for fucking SIX HOURS. FUCKING SIX HOURS,&quot;</i> cried Prestige, his face growing more and more desperate with each passing second. <i>&quot;GET UP, LET'S GO.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
As the three Cranidos approach, one of them (the yellow one) said, &quot;We do however need to protect this land so PLEASE leave, we wouldn't want to HUG you to death.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Yes, fine by me! Come on Alina, let's leave!&quot;</i> agreed Prestige, pulling on Alina's arm and trying to drag her away in vain.<br />
<br />
But the third one seemed to have other plans, finishing its comrade's sentence saying &quot;OR you could help us...&quot;<br />
<br />
This was almost too much for Alina to handle. Prestige's claws were digging into her arm as he desperately tried to pull her away, and the three happy (and disturbed) little dinosaurs were all staring at her, waiting for her answer... and they were definitely the creepiest little things she ever did see. But they looked oddly familiar, as if they were out of a children's TV show.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Alina began as she pried Prestige's claws off of her arm. &quot;They helped me get out from under that tree, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Well, yeah, of course. I obviously couldn't move it by myself,&quot;</i> growled Prestige, returning to his &quot;dragging.&quot; Alina then forced her Abra away, saying, &quot;Well, we owe them something--&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;We can return the favor,&quot;</i> Prestige began, his desperate pleas now turning into a frustrated growl. <i>&quot;By leaving the forest. Come on, do you honestly want to hear songs about friendship and sharing all day?&quot;</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Well, as long as I don't have to sing along...&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;You're kidding me,&quot;</i> Prestige said, staring blankly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nope,&quot; Alina bluntly said. &quot;You could benefit from listening to songs about friendship and kindness yourself, you know.&quot; As she said this Alina hauled herself up, using another tree for support. Once she had regained her balance she said, &quot;Okay, we'll do all we can to help with whatever it is...&quot;</span></span></span></div>

</i>As you finish giving your orders to your pokemon they set off to attack. Forstly, Bubbles takes advantage of the Golduck feeling pain and and rushes up to it, The Golduck tries to run but is caught in a <b>pursuit</b>, Bubbles then proceeds to taking him out of the water and pinning him down, where he violently begins to<b> slash</b> at the duck pokemon. He manages to create a tear in the Golducks Right arm, causing it pain but numbing the pain in its arm. Feeling the pain leaving its body the Golduck retaliates with a <b>psychic</b> attack, which normally would cause strong damage to Bubbles. However, the attack is done at close range, causing Bubbles to be knocked back by an even stronger Psychic attack. The Golduck takes advantage of this and runs toward the Sloth Pokemon, starting its own string of <b>slash</b> attacks...<br />
<br />
Somewhere alse on the field, Pathos begins to<b> swap</b> its <b>guard</b> powers with the Feraligatr, who feels a little nudge and begins to awake, Oh-oh! However, as it turns it closes its eyes and Yawns! That was a close one. Where did the yawn come from though? Bubbles, having pushed the Golduck away with its size advantage had done that <b>yawn</b> attack, causing drowsiness in both enemy pokemon. As Pathos finishes his swap you see his arms and chest buffer than they were before, and the Feraligatr with tiny arms, looking rediculous in its supertoned body. Pathos feels a lack of energy and lays down beside you for a quick <b>rest</b>.<br />
<br />
The two other pokemon on your side leap into the water and begin sircling the much more powerful Dewgong, looking for an opening... Finally they catch one whenthe pokemon looks at the Seel, and Tortuga shoots a<b> beam</b> of<b> ice</b> at it, the Dewgong shrugs away the attack and <b>growls</b> at Tortuga. The seel takes the oportunity to cheer for the Dewgong and causes it to do an <b>encore</b> of a useless attack. When the two pokemon notice this they begin attacking, Tortuga hitting it with an <b>Ice punch</b> to distract it, and the Seel bringing in the<b> rain</b> with a <b>dance</b>. As it pours the pokemon focus in the larger seal and the Seel makes a wind as <b>Icy</b> as the north pole, causing Tortuga's following <b>Blizzard</b> attack to take less energy than usual. The Dewgong winces in pain as it is struck with the blast full force, and retreats back, ready for the next round.<br />
<br />
Bubbles took a bi hit this round and his health is at 3/4ths normal, while his energy is at about 4/5ths. Tortuga has near perfect health and 6/7ths of his energy left. With the pouring rain, water attacks would be at their best right now...<br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: deepskyblue">Red cussed under his breath at the mistake of using Ice type attacks on an Ice type, Dewgong. Thankfully his Squirtle didn't use up much energy thx to their little Seel friend. With things pretty much even between the trio, more thought would have to be put into what attacks should be ordered. With time to mull things over as the Dewgong retreated from the oncoming onslaught, a thought of genius popped into his head. If he could get the Seel to somehow distract his evolutionary form from noticing Tuga, propelling himself forward with help with a <b>Tail Whip</b>, it could perhaps help strengthen a <b>Tackle</b> attack. Now would be the best time to take advantage of his Aqua Ring he'd used earlier, and with the help of his Northern Star Bangle, that should give him enough HP to go head on for now. <br />
<br />
Tortuga turned back, await his next commands. But.. Something didn't seem right with this situation. 'Strange that a group of fully evolved spokesman would attack so unexpectedly.' Red muttered, but shrugged it off. &quot;I was hoping you could help me with something, my friend.&quot; he said loudly, motioning to the Seel, who listened intently. &quot;Distract the Dewgong, attract all attention to yourself while Squirtle here lands something sneaky.&quot;<br />
<br />
Red turned to Tortuga, explaining what course of action should be taken. If the Dewgong happens to see through this little plot, &quot;<b>Withdraw</b>ing into your shell should keep quoi protected enough for the Seel to interject,&quot; Tuga nodded.<br />
<br />
Pathos had successfully executed his orders, leaving himself all nice and buff, while his override opponent looked rather sickly now. his previously stick thin arms were now all bulged and vinery, swapping with Forgive. Though a slight scare when the connection was first made, praise the lord it was just a false alarm. Pathos grumbled, much energy was used to use that attack, decided to take a much needed rest at Red's feet. &quot;Don't worry, I'll watch over you.&quot; he whispered. Now both ponies were left sleeping, and now orders were needed now.<br />
<br />
He turned to the last remaining team member, Bubby, who had taken a little beat down during the round. Being blasted back by a nasty Psychic, and Slashed in a fury of defence, Bubbz was left flustered. Foam started to seep through his mouth, his eyes staring bullets through the Go duck, who was left drowsy from his Yawn. Usually waiting for the victim to fall asleep before using any attack in case he should snap, attacking now felt right.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bubbz, <b>Focus</b> your <b>Energy</b> now that it'll be harder for him to disrupt you. This boost will help when you're using your <b>Strength</b> to toss it further inland, the water isn't our friend,&quot; He didn’t remember being expected to provide this. He couldn’t remember off the top of his head, &quot;Then let cause an <b>Uprooar</b>, this should be waking everyone up from their little nap.&quot;</span></span></div>

Military Base, Arc_Angel: Reply in DarkOrange</i></b><br />
You suddenly remembered Drusilla—perhaps she was safe and could help her trainer. However, that thought was quickly pushed out of your head, it wasn’t very likely after all. You finally resort to something you deem very disgusting, putting your hands behind your head and pushing against the prison bars with your leg. You hoped to entice the male guard, or whoever was that, just hoping that there weren’t any female guards around to mess up your plan.<br />
<br />
However, things finally seemed to go your way as the male guard from earlier showed up once again, hearing your comment. Instantly, he began to sweat and stutter, saying, “S-S-Sure, we can g-get you something to d-d-drink.” He said, walking away once again, but not getting close enough for you to reach him. A few short moments later, he was back, with friends, and a glass of water. His friends start smiling, but staying back, having dirty thoughts in their heads. The guard with the water got very close to you. “Here is some water, this is against our policy, so thank your lucky stars.” He said. You take the water, drop it, then quickly grab his hand and slam him against the bars. “Woah woah woah! What do you think you’re doing?!” asked one of the other guards. “I’m getting the boss!” said another, running out. The others stayed and tried to help him. You squeeze harder, causing more pain for the helpless guard. “Don’t come any closer, she’s killing me when you assholes do!” yelled the guard frantically.<br />
<br />
A few moments later, the guard who left came back with the commander of the base. All the other guards saluted him and told him of the situation. “Colonel, this crazy woman just lunged forward and trapped Mike against the bars! You gotta do something!” said one of the guards. The colonel rubbed his chin and began to speak. “Alright, alright. Since you’ve done nothing wrong—except help your old friend, Ranjona—I’ll let you go if you let go of him,” he said holding up his hands, “I promise.”</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Stacey leant her full weight against the steel bars hoping that her plan would work and hoping that it wouldn’t at the same time. She didn’t know how long she had maintained her alluring position asking daintily for some water sounded like a lost little lamb (and wanting to vomit at doing so) but as her muscles began to ache she heard noises coming closer. Readjusting her pose groaning against her aching body she asked the guard the same question smiling from under her hood as she saw him begin to sweat nervously stuttering a response before running off. Stacey frowned as soon as he was out of sight, she hated acting like that, and he hadn’t even gotten close. He soon returned and seemed to have brought a party of leering males with him, all of them hanging back but their eyes scouring her body like she was a piece of meat. She suddenly felt almost naked and felt a flush of anger paint her cheeks, thankfully her hood shielded that from view. The guard with the water approached and Stacey pulled her hood back so he could get a good view of her dazzling smile as he presented her the drink. He explains nervous that he shouldn’t be doing this but was helping her out and she batted her eyelashes her smile widening.<br />
<br />
“Oh thank you so much for this. I won’t tell anyone I promise I was just getting sooo hot this will cool me down,” she said pulling on the sides of her little jacket grabbing his attention. As she took the glass with him close to the bars she dropped the glass along with her charade and taking hold of his hand she pulled back hard ramming him into the bars with as much force as she could muster. He spluttered in shock and panic as the other guards sprung into action edging closer to her. Stacey had switched her grip though and wrapped her arms around his throat and chest and began to squeeze just enough to make him suffer. The closer the guards came the harder she squeezed a sadistic smirk rising to her lips, now this was more like her.<br />
<br />
“Any closer and I’ll snap his neck” she warned casting a sweet smile at her ‘hostage’ and one of the others ran off to get their boss. Good she would like to see the face of the bastards who ordered her imprisonment. Some of the guards tried to approach again and she dug her short nails into his throat and he cried out to the other in a panic swearing, it was music to her ears. It didn’t take long for the other guard to return to with the commander, the rest saluting him despite the severity of the situation. He called her crazy and informed her that her hostage was called Mike. <br />
<br />
“Alright, alright. Since you’ve done nothing wrong—except help your old friend, Ranjona—I’ll let you go if you let go of him,” he said holding up his hands, “I promise,” he says and Stacey can’t keep the laughter from escaping sounding as crazy as she must have looked.<br />
<br />
“Do I look stupid to you? I will not release him <i>before</i> you release me, what is there to stop you from just walking away when I let Mike go and leaving me to rot. No no that’s not how we’re going to play this. I think I want some questions answered first and if I get answers I won’t snap Mike’s neck, he seems a nice guy after all. Then after I get my answers I want Ranjona brought in here to me … alive!” she demanded feeling as though she was channelling Drusilla and Macabre right now as she drew on the darkness within to aid her actions.<br />
<br />
“Here are my questions: Where are my Pokemon? I want them back. No. 2: Where are we? As you can see my room doesn’t come with much of a view. No. 3: Why are you after Ranjona and I? You are right that all I did was help her and after I saw what you sadistic sods have done I’d side with her any day. No. 4: Why do you follow this King, he obviously has no-one’s best interests in mind but his own, killing innocents in these sacrifices? Its digusting.</span></span></div>

“You will? That’s fantastic, thank you!” says the man, “My name is Krane by the way.” He ushers you to follow him deeper inside the temple, the only way out, apparently. You look around the temple to see strange plants growing here and there. You also notice Krane walking strangely, not in a straight line like people usually do, but in a sort of zigzag pattern. “You have to be careful, the Pokemon are around, you can’t just run into them, that makes them angry.” He says quietly.<br />
<br />
After some time, you finally reach what looks like the main chamber of the temple. “Okay, so, I always start here, but no matter what, I always end up here because this temple is really confusing.” Krane remarks. Your attention is instantly drawn to the waterfall in the center. You assume that he gets his water from here, as this seems to be the only source of water. “There are doors upon doors upon doors, always leading to something different,” Krane says, “I always seem to pick the wrong combination, as it leads me back here.” Looking around, you see the multitude of doors, each leading somewhere, some mysterious place inside the temple. “There is only one right way out of here. Since I’m not very certain which door to go through, can you pick one for me?” Krane asks.</i></b></span></span>

Unless you knew the details, it would take an eternity of trial and error to succeed. And Krane was most likely sick and tired of eating foul plants, and, deciding after a drink, water that wouldn't be fit for fungus. She decided to try and recall something. No luck. &quot;Let's see... Une poule sur un mur picotte à la pain dur-&quot; And then it hit her. &quot;Hey, Krane? Have you considered climbing up the waterfall?&quot;</span></span></i></b></div>

</i>As you finish up your orders all pokemon set off and you turn your attention to Bubbles, who begins to<b> focus</b> on his opponent and his eyes turn red in fury as he looks at the Golduck, ready to strike with his mighty <b>energy</b>. The Golduck merely blinks and yawns, too distracted to notice the sloth pokemon charging at it with its superpowered arms at high speed knocking it over with all of its weight and <b>strength</b>, sending the Golduck tumbling over into the water, where some bubbles rise to the surface for a continuous 6 seconds. Before you turn away the stream of bubbles ends and the once-mighty pokemon sinks down, forever. <b><i>Level up for Bubbles. <br />
<br />
</i></b>Alongside the lake you watch as Tortuga and Seel set off against the Dewgong, who begins staring down its evolutionary relative. Ad their staring contest begins they both break away and start swimming in circles around each other, their eyes locked on each other. Taking its opportunity Tortuga sets up to attack and swims behind the Seel and wags its<b> tail</b> like a <b>whip</b>, the Dewgong doesn't notice this and doesn't feel itself lowering its defences. The two seals start shooting a multicolor beam of ice energy at each other, and as the two attacks colide in the center they push back, both beams as strong as the other. As the Seel begins to tire out Tortuga swims under the Dewgong and takes its opportunity to Tackle the Dewgong from underneath. As it comes up the distracted Dewgong can't react and is hit perfectly mid-torso. As it takes the damage the big seal stops shooting its <b>aurora beam</b>. Thisallows the Seel's <b>own beam</b> to go unchecked towards the Dewgong where it collides straight-on, knoking the enemy ice type back. The Dewgong retaliates by surrounding its <b>tail</b> with <b>water</b> and swinging it at Tortuga. The little turtle is fast to react and <b>withdraw</b>s into its shell. The attack hits dead on and Tortuga gets thrown back like a puck, but it actually heals, thanks to the aqua ring surrounding it. As Tortuga flies backwards the Seel reacts, creating an <b>Aqua Tail</b> of its own, slamming it into the flying turtle, sending it back at the Dewgong who takes the hit straight to the face. It's eyes go black and close, the heavy shell having knocked it out, its body floating on the water because of its<i> thick fat</i>. <i><b>Level up for Tortuga</b></i>.<br />
<br />
Back on land Bubbles begins to yell and causes an <b>uproar</b>, as your team had defeated two of the enemy pokemon. The noise wakes up the sleeping alligator and Psychic pokemon who are too sleepy to attack. They see each other and lock eyes, waiting for the next round.<br />
<br />
Tortuga has healed back to perfection because of the Aqua Tails. Bubbles looks like he could walk around for a while but his attack energy seems to be depleted. The Feraligatr is weaker stat-wise than Pathos but seems to be evenly matched as they are both healthy-looking.</span></span></span><br />

You decide on helping the strange dinosaurs and listen as to what they have to say, &quot;We need your help reaching our FRIENDS over the hills and delivering these Leichi Berries,&quot; the Yellow one sais as as he points to a pile of berries a few feet from you, &quot;to them for their food, we'll even SHARE some with you!&quot; As he sais that he is interupted by the Purple one who finishes by saying &quot;We still need to go with you, and you will get your berries when we are done.&quot; The idea seems good and you listen to the rest of what they have to say. The green one ends it with her nasaly voice &quot;Could you please take the berries in your bag? We will need to prepare and will leave in the morning.&quot; You and Prestige sit next to a nearby campfire the yellow and purple cranidos had built as the green one spoke. You slowly drift to sleep as the songs of the dinosaurs get in your head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I LOOOVVEEEE YOUUUU, YOUU LOOVVVEEE MEEEEE.&quot;<br />

You awake to the singing of the dinosaurs at dawn and they give you a few minutes before telling you it was time to go. As the five of you set of you realise just how dangerous Venom Island is, but also that there seems to be a strange lack of wild pokemon. After a very long walk you see a mountain chain, the Cranidos begin climbing the long climb and you follow for what seems like an eternity. Finally after about three hours you reach the top of the mountain. As you look down you see a big canyon, but instead of being rocky you see that it is a giant perfect bowl. That bowl is very Grassy and has grass everywhere at short height. At the center of the bowl is a large metal dome, and as you look up you see that the sun has a face. A baby face. The five of you all go down to the dome, where a double door slides open, revealing four pokemon stranger than thew Cranidos. One of them was a Sableye with an antenna ending in an upside down triangle &quot;Tinky Winky!&quot;, next to it a Politoed, but instead of its curly hair it had a long straightr antenna &quot;Dipsie!&quot;, next to him a Sandshrew with an corcksrew-like antenna &quot;Laa Laa!&quot;, and lastly, a Magby with a circle antenna &quot;Po!&quot;. All of them with a square grey spot on their stomach. They begin talking, their voice even worse than the Cranidos. &quot;HIIIIII!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have brought you ingredients for your Tubby Cust--&quot; The green cranidos begins, however she is attacked by the Magby as she shoots some embers at her. &quot;EVIL, EVIL!&quot; Surprised by this you see all the Cranidos ran off and you are surrounded by the four monster <a href="http://s317.photobucket.com/albums/mm371/Psychopath2008/th_344.png" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fs317.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fmm371%2FPsychopath2008%2Fth_344.png&amp;hash=77106419a1545832d9250ee80a37363c" rel="nofollow noopener">creatures.</a> Luckily you have your pokeballs.<br />

Now the last of the group to battle was Pathos, whom had just awoken from his short slumber. He let out an enormous yawn, noticeably re-energized and ready to battle. Bubble’s, however; in a rage, sent Red flying backwards, being tackled from his usually The Vigoroth’s pokéball had broke free from his hand. Realizing this; he promptly made dash for it, scooping it up in his mouth. With one sudden crunch of his jaw, the pokéball was shattered. Red looked onward, shocked at the sudden outburst of his trusted partner. Without warning, Bubbles ran off into the Jungle, never to be seen for a second time...<br />

Rather than waste time dawdling on the past, he turned his attention back to Pathos and his potential mate, or so he wished. “<b>Attract</b> it even further, Pathos, since we never got the chance last time.

You decide on helping the strange dinosaurs and listen as to what they have to say, &quot;We need your help reaching our FRIENDS over the hills and delivering these Leichi Berries,&quot; the Yellow one sais as as he points to a pile of berries a few feet from you, &quot;to them for their food, we'll even SHARE some with you!&quot; As he sais that he is interupted by the Purple one who finishes by saying &quot;We still need to go with you, and you will get your berries when we are done.&quot; The idea seems good and you listen to the rest of what they have to say. The green one ends it with her nasaly voice &quot;Could you please take the berries in your bag? We will need to prepare and will leave in the morning.&quot; You and Prestige sit next to a nearby campfire the yellow and purple cranidos had built as the green one spoke. You slowly drift to sleep as the songs of the dinosaurs get in your head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I LOOOVVEEEE YOUUUU, YOUU LOOVVVEEE MEEEEE.&quot;<br />

You awake to the singing of the dinosaurs at dawn and they give you a few minutes before telling you it was time to go. As the five of you set of you realise just how dangerous Venom Island is, but also that there seems to be a strange lack of wild pokemon. After a very long walk you see a mountain chain, the Cranidos begin climbing the long climb and you follow for what seems like an eternity. Finally after about three hours you reach the top of the mountain. As you look down you see a big canyon, but instead of being rocky you see that it is a giant perfect bowl. That bowl is very Grassy and has grass everywhere at short height. At the center of the bowl is a large metal dome, and as you look up you see that the sun has a face. A baby face. The five of you all go down to the dome, where a double door slides open, revealing four pokemon stranger than thew Cranidos. One of them was a Sableye with an antenna ending in an upside down triangle &quot;Tinky Winky!&quot;, next to it a Politoed, but instead of its curly hair it had a long straightr antenna &quot;Dipsie!&quot;, next to him a Sandshrew with an corcksrew-like antenna &quot;Laa Laa!&quot;, and lastly, a Magby with a circle antenna &quot;Po!&quot;. All of them with a square grey spot on their stomach. They begin talking, their voice even worse than the Cranidos. &quot;HIIIIII!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have brought you ingredients for your Tubby Cust--&quot; The green cranidos begins, however she is attacked by the Magby as she shoots some embers at her. &quot;EVIL, EVIL!&quot; Surprised by this you see all the Cranidos ran off and you are surrounded by the four monster <a href="http://s317.photobucket.com/albums/mm371/Psychopath2008/th_344.png" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fs317.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fmm371%2FPsychopath2008%2Fth_344.png&amp;hash=77106419a1545832d9250ee80a37363c" rel="nofollow noopener">creatures.</a> Luckily you have your pokeballs.<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: DarkOrchid"><span style="font-size: 9px">&quot;We need your help reaching our FRIENDS over the hills and delivering these Leichi Berries to them for their food, we'll even SHARE some with you!&quot; explained the yellow one. All four of those little dinosaurs seemed to enjoy emphasizing words like &quot;friends&quot; and &quot;share,&quot; and Alina was starting to get annoyed. The trainer and her Abra exchanged a look of regret before turning their attention back to the yellow Cranidos, who continued on &quot;We still need to go with you, and you will get your berries when we are done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could you please take the berries in your bag?&quot; asked the green Cranidos. &quot;We will need to prepare and will leave in the morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alina didn't realize how late it was, at first. She wasn't tired at all, due to being passed out for so long, and she was totally ready to get this over with and move on with her life. However, Prestige was nearly hysterical, sine he hadn't had his full 18 hour nap today due to the obnoxious chants of the Cranidos. So, perhaps it was a good idea to get some rest... at least for her Abra's sake. The four dinosaurs began to sing once again as Prestige cried quietly to himself and rocked back and forth, staring into the fire that two of the Cranidos had built. Meanwhile, Alina was trying to make herself comfortable, turning her back to the fire and covering her ears with her hands in vain. <i>Don't these Pokemon ever get tired?</i> she thought to herself as she struggled to get to sleep. The fact that she wasn't tired and that there were four obnoxious Pokemon making such a racket didn't help much. But eventually, after what felt like an eternity, Alina drifted off to sleep, the song of the Cranidos still ringing through her head...<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
Alina woke in the morning to find Prestige trying to dig a shallow grave for himself and the dinosaurs still singing their song. &quot;How did you sleep?&quot; Alina asked, although she already knew the answer by the look of Prestige. He merely glared back and pointed a menacing claw at her, and then went back to digging. Alina tried to smile and control her urge to beat the four Cranidos to death with a stick as she stretched and picked up a tired and grumpy Abra. <br />
<br />
The Cranidos lead the way as they walked through Bane Forest, the morning light doing nothing to lighten the mood of the dead forest. There was a lack of wild Pokemon, but it didn't seem to surprise Alina too much. This forest wasn't a great place to support any kind of life, and yet these Cranidos seemed to be getting along with their lives quite well. Okay, so they were a bit... demented to say the least, but it was still remarkable that they could live here at all.<br />
<br />
Finally, they stopped at the edge of a huge mountain chain, and the Cranidos began their climb. Alina sighed in dismay, wondering how much farther it was to their destination. After a long and uneventful trudge up the mountain, they had finally reached the top of the mountain, overlooking a canyon that showed signs of... life? In this dead place? A huge grassy basin was just below, and she could barely make out what appeared to be a metal dome, and the sun above was smiling-- Wait a minute. <br />
<br />
&quot;No way, this has to be a dream,&quot; Alina said, staring stupidly into the sky. As Alina went into a panicked frenzy of trying to wake herself up, the four Cranidos began to head down toward the grassy plains below, and Alina eventually had no choice but to follow. Once they arrived at the edge of the dome, two sliding doors slid open, and four more demented Pokemon jumped forth. Alina and Prestige gave another cry of dismay and horror as the four new Pokemon introduced themselves. The Cranidos, meanwhile, tried to deliver the berries to them for something called a &quot;Tubby Cust--&quot; but were attacked instead. The Magby had shot a few embers at one of the Cranidos, causing Prestige to clap and cheer for his new savior for attacking the evil singing machine. But that joy was short lived as they were surrounded by four demented and rather angry little Pokemon, ready for a fight. Almost on instinct, Alina ordered &quot;Prestige, you go for the Sandshrew! Use <b>Barrier</b> followed by a <b>Blizzard!</b> <b>Shadow Ball</b> afterward, I suppose.<br />
<br />
As Prestige went to work on his orders, Alina shuffled through her bag to find another Pokeball, and tossed it into the air to release the Flaaffy named Ana. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ana!&quot; she began as she searched her bag for another Pokeball. These berries made it hard to find anything... &quot;Use <b>Reflect</b> first, then attack that Politoed using <b>Thunder Wave</b> then <b>Thunderbolt!</b>&quot;<br />
<br />
Ana bleated in recognition while another ball was tossed into the air, releasing Ignatius the Quilava. &quot;Ignatius, use <b>Howl</b> then go in for a <b>Flame Wheel</b> on that Sableye! <b>Smokescreen</b> afterward!&quot;<br />
<br />
And lastly, in another flash of red light, popped out a small Charmander named Alberta, who Alina ordered &quot;Alberta, attack the Magby! <b>Ancient Power</b> first, then use <b>Swords Dance</b>! <b>Rock Slide</b> to end this round.&quot;</span></span></div>

</i>Not surprised by the <s>escape</s> running away of one of your pokemon you give orders to Pathos who sets out to finish the job it had started earlier, but refreshed.

That was... a strange sight. Pathos is still pretty good for having just been dumped, having taken only mild injury from that attack. <br />
<br />
Having gotten rid of the bullies the Seel and Tortuga begin playing again, but they feel a disturbance, out of the water rises a familiar face. A blue face with a bill and a jem on it. It rushes at you and brings back its right arm to slash you but instead brings a finger to your forehead and a mental connection forms,<i> {You defeated me, Seel's brother and Jessica for that I leave you this.}</i> When he finishes time stops and images rush through your head: A familiar Pidgeots face, a Pink Pearl, and a Nidoran.. <i>{Figure this out and the past will be unlocked:<br />

Your suspicion of this reality is interupted as the pokemon clash. First Prestige pairs up with the Sandshrew and they lock eyes, the yellow rat starts it off by bringing in a barrage of stars at a <b>swift </b>pase, however the attack is stopped in its tracks by a <b>barrier</b> created by Prestige, the swift destroys the barrier, but the little Psychic Type doesn't take any damage. Next up Prestige creates ice energy in the air and shoots it at the Sandsrew, a <b>Blizzard </b>of average proportions, who counters it with a<b> sandstorm</b> attack, this time, however, Prestige's attack overpowers the yellow rat. As she gets thrown back she her eyes begin glowing red &quot;YOU WILL NEVER DEFEAT US!&quot;, but she groans as Prestige hits her with a <b>shadow ball</b> as she speaks. As he celebrates his attack she gets him by suprise as she uses <b>sand tomb</b> to crush him. He escapes right on time, but his foot is trapped in sand. Looks like Prestige is good to go energy and health wise, but the Sandshrew looks like this as well. <br />
<br />
Somewhere alse on the field Ignatius and the Sableye begin battling, the Flaming Porcupine howling at the Sableye and the Ghost leering at the Porcupine. They run and attack, Quilava surrounding itself in<b> flames</b> while rolling in a <b>wheel </b>and Sableye covering its <b>claw</b>s with <b>shadow</b> energy. They meet in the middle and Ignatius' attack overpowers the Sableye, knocking it back. Taking a heavy hit the Sableye backs off for now, and Ignatius surrounds itself in a <b>screen </b>of <b>smoke</b>. &quot;YOU WILL ALL DIE AT OUR HANDS!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nearby Ana and the Politoed stare each other down and the green pokemon starts it off by shooting <b>water</b> at the Electric pokemon like a <b>gun</b>. She takes the hit and uses <b>thunder wave</b> on the Politoed who only dodges then yawns, showing he has <b>swagger</b>. Ana reacts in anger and her <b>Thunderbolt</b> attack is dodged easily as it was predictable. The Politoed begins singing a <b>song</b> about <b>perish</b>ing to the electric pokemon, and if you knew this attack you knew it only meant trouble!<br />
<br />
Latly Alberta and the Magby begin fighting each other. The Charmander starts it off by using a form of <b>ancient power</b> to throw earth at the Magby, who destroys most of it with a <b>flamethrower</b>, but is still injured badly with the earth she doesn't destroy. Retaliating, the Magby creates a thick <b>Smog</b>, filling the fire types' lungs with conbustables. When she finishes this she notices that Alberta has gotten stronger, as she seemss to be able to <b>dance</b> with <b>swords</b>. They colide their attacks , a <b>fire</b>y <b>blast</b> from the Magby and a<b> rock slide</b> from Alberta, who seems to have created the rocks out of the earth from earlier. The attacks collide head on, and the rock slide hits the Magby. It seems as though Alberta is winning here, her energy at 75 percent and perfect health, while the Magby is at 75 percent energy and 75 percent health.<br />
<br />
It seems you will need strategy to overcome this mess. What will you do? </span></span></div>

<br />
Somewhere alse on the field Ignatius and the Sableye begin battling, the Flaming Porcupine howling at the Sableye and the Ghost leering at the Porcupine. They run and attack, Quilava surrounding itself in<b> flames</b> while rolling in a <b>wheel </b>and Sableye covering its <b>claw</b>s with <b>shadow</b> energy. They meet in the middle and Ignatius' attack overpowers the Sableye, knocking it back. Taking a heavy hit the Sableye backs off for now, and Ignatius surrounds itself in a <b>screen </b>of <b>smoke</b>. &quot;YOU WILL ALL DIE AT OUR HANDS!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nearby Ana and the Politoed stare each other down and the green pokemon starts it off by shooting <b>water</b> at the Electric pokemon like a <b>gun</b>. She takes the hit and uses <b>thunder wave</b> on the Politoed who only dodges then yawns, showing he has <b>swagger</b>. Ana reacts in anger and her <b>Thunderbolt</b> attack is dodged easily as it was predictable. The Politoed begins singing a <b>song</b> about <b>perish</b>ing to the electric pokemon, and if you knew this attack you knew it only meant trouble!<br />
<br />
Latly Alberta and the Magby begin fighting each other. The Charmander starts it off by using a form of <b>ancient power</b> to throw earth at the Magby, who destroys most of it with a <b>flamethrower</b>, but is still injured badly with the earth she doesn't destroy. Retaliating, the Magby creates a thick <b>Smog</b>, filling the fire types' lungs with conbustables. When she finishes this she notices that Alberta has gotten stronger, as she seemss to be able to <b>dance</b> with <b>swords</b>. They colide their attacks , a <b>fire</b>y <b>blast</b> from the Magby and a<b> rock slide</b> from Alberta, who seems to have created the rocks out of the earth from earlier. The attacks collide head on, and the rock slide hits the Magby. It seems as though Alberta is winning here, her energy at 75 percent and perfect health, while the Magby is at 75 percent energy and 75 percent health.<br />
<br />
It seems you will need strategy to overcome this mess. What will you do? </span></span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DarkOrchid"><span style="font-size: 9px">As the battles commenced Alina struggled to keep up with each battle. Monitoring 4 Pokemon at once, each in different situations, was no easy task. The round ended with Prestige's foot stuck in the sand, Ignatius as cocky as ever, an incredibly annoyed Ana, and a Charmander without a scratch. <br />
<br />
First, Alina turned her attention to Prestige, who was struggling to get his foot out of the sand while he kept an eye on his opponent. He seemed oddly calm, despite being immobile, as if he already knew what Alina was planning to get him out of the situation. &quot;<b>Teleport</b> to get out of the sand and to take the Sandshrew by surprise,&quot; his trainer began. &quot;<b>Blizzard</b> it again, I know it's getting repetitive.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alina could faintly see the outline of a Quilava dancing about in the screen of smoke, which meant that the smokescreen was beginning to dissipate. She wasn't too worried about this battle, since Ignatius had always been a good fighter. She had always wanted to try a specific combo that she had heard about from another trainer, but had never found a fitting time to try it out. But, since it was early on in the battle, and Ignatius seemed to be pretty healthy... Hell, it couldn't hurt... too much, anyway. She smiled, and ordered (almost hesitantly), &quot;For shits and giggles, <b>Defense Curl</b> then <b>Rollout</b>. Your fiery attacks are getting boring anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the smoke faded away she could see an indignant Ignatius standing on his hind legs, as if insulted by Alina's comments of his fire type moves. He scoffed and turned back to his opponent as Alina focused on Ana, next. She was looking thoroughly pissed off, being toyed with like that, and looked as if she was about to cry. Alina had to admit, she herself had dealt with enough of Perish Song to last a life time, and rolled her eyes as she remembered that the Politoed had cast it. Now, if the bastard would only hold still...<br />
<br />
&quot;Ana, use <b>Fatal Attraction</b>! Try another <b>Thunderbolt</b> afterward!&quot; Alina said, not knowing if this would work or not. Ana shuddered at the thought of her opponent having a crush on her (especially that particular politoed), but took her orders none the less. Lastly, Alberta stood glued to the spot, glaring at the Magby with piercing teal eyes. She was winning so far, but of course, it was just the beginning... the tables could turn at any time. Alina pondered for a moment, then said &quot;<b>Dragon Dance</b>, to help boost your speed. Go in for a <b>Thunderpunch</b>, too.&quot;</span></span></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><div style="text-align: center"><span style="color: DeepSkyBlue">As Pathos was about to begin the mating ritual all over again, Feraligatr made a sudden dash towards him, in an attempt to whisk her lover away to the deeply depths of Pearl Lake. Pathos, being the tease that he is, side-stepped and waggled his thang oh so attractively, only to leaving the Feraligatr wanting more. Sadly the mistake was using Psywave, this just further enraged the beast. Before he could even make a move, Feraligatr gave him a rather nasty Dragon Claw to the chest, leaving with a look of ‘oh torture refusal’ kinda look and stormed off into the Woods. The group stood there stunned. It was like something out of the Twilight Zone. Nonetheless, everyone had successfully completed their battle. Tortuga and Seel went back to their fun and games, Pathos teleported onto Red’s shoulders.<br />
<br />
“Well I’m proud of all of you, great job.” Red said with an air of hope in his voice, and a few moments later, much to everyone surprise, Golduck had risen up from under the water. Before anyone could make move, his body shot forth, arm stretched for a Slash at him. Only, it wasn’t a slash that made contact, rather a gooey finger to the Forhead. Somehow a mental connection forms, “You defeated me, Seel's brother and Jessica for that I leave you this.” When he finishes time stops and images rush through his head: A familiar Pidgeots face, a Pink Pearl, and a Nidoran... <i>{Figure this out and the past will be unlocked:<br />
<br />
In a colony I live,<br />
Though my looks might deceive,<br />
Surrounded far and wide,<br />
We are all the same,<br />
None of us has a name,<br />
Except for one,<br />
I have something special hidden inside.<br />
Near you I am right beside,<br />
For the water is where I reside.}</i><br />
<br />
There is a flash and the Golduck disappears, and a round CD lays at Red’s feet. “What could this riddle mean?” he thought out loud, “I don’t get it.. We are all the same.. but none of us has a name? Hmm… Something right beside me, eh?”<br />
<br />
“It’s Clamperl, fool!” a thundering voice from with his head, Pathos the little scamp, “The Pearl obviously meant Clamperl, it must mean that we have to obtain a pearl from the pokémon. The Nidoran and the Pidgeot are from the past…” His voice was that of a child, one who demands respect from the old folk.<br />
<br />
“I’d really appreciate it if you DIDN’T read my mind constantly, Pathos” he yells, flailing his arms around wildly as though trying to fend off a swarm of wild Beedrill. “They’re everywhere! In every shadow, every crevice, every wall, under the floors, on the ceilings, they’re all around you! You can’t escape them! Horrible, vile eeeevil things!” He suddenly drops to his knees, wildly clawing at his clothing as though trying to brush off an army of bugs. <br />
<br />
Pathos jumped off his trainers shoulders, and reached for the disk, then teleported over to ‘Tuga. He let out a childish giggle before shoving the TM into his oral cavity. Tortuga gagged at first, but it soon disvolved, leaving the Wartortle with the move Dive.<br />
<br />
“Alright you guys,” he said, returning everyone to their pokéball, with the exception of Pathos &amp; Tortuga. “Let’s go catch us a Clamperl, something tells me Golduck knew something we didn’t. As strange as that sounds, we may as well give it a go. I hope you don’t mind going swimming P-Diddy, quite possibly Seel would like to join us on this underwater exploration, eh? Perhaps guide us around whilst we look for a few Pearls…”</span>&#8203;</div></span></div>

Asking the Seel for help it instantly says yes, as a resident of the lake she had enough experience diving that she could be underwater for long periods of time. You all step into the water ready to face whatever might be underneath. As you head underwater you hold onto Tortuga who uses a power to create a bubble around you, you can see and feel the water but you can breathe, and it seems that your pokemon can hear you talk. The Seel leads you into a huge underwater cavern, the inside there are underwater crystals everywhere. you keep your hands to yourself however, as the Seel shows you that they shoot out, the spikes could destroy your bubble!<br />
<br />
You head deeper into the cavern, so far in fact that the light disappears! However there is light, as Chinchow and Lanturn swim around the area. One light grabs your attention as it illuminates above many stones that look like clams. Wait, those rocks are clams! You are so distracted by the pearls that you swim forward and try to grab one. You are so distracted that you dont notice the Huntail lunge at you from a hole in the wall. The Seel however does see this and is quick to react, scaring it away with an aurora beam. Before you notice you are surrounded by two other Huntails, each appearing from its own hole. Looks like before you can find your pearl you must fight the underwater fish. Tortuga can separate from you and hear you,like everyone alse, Pathos probably can fight underwater, and the Seel looks like it will follow your orders.<br />
<br />
What will you do? <br />
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: DarkOrchid"><span style="font-size: 9px">You give your orders to your pokemon and they prepare for a second round of beating the crap out of others. Prestige starts it off by <b>Teleport</b>ing out of the Sand and into random areas around the Sandshrew, looking for an opening. The Sandshrew lays on the sand from earlier with its hands over its head, as if scared of getting hit. Prestige takes a chance and stops behind the Sandshrew preparing an orb of ice energy between his hands, ready to create a <b>blizzard</b>. She has other ideas however and begins <b>spinning</b> very<b> rapidly</b> knocking sand into Prestige. He gets distracted and stops creating ice energy, leaving himself open. The Sandshrew pounces and knocks Prestige back she<b> Slashes</b> his neck with great might, barely missing the windpipe, causing the hit to be very critical. Prestige reacts in pain by shooting the Ice energy he had created knocking the sandshrew back, she lands on her head, causing great pain. Prestige looks really hurt, that slash having brought his health down to half, luckily the Sandshrew took a big hit too, her health being halfed as well. They are pretty even energy-wise as well both at about 75 percent, but Prestige doesn't look like he should be using ice attacks soon. &quot;FOOLISH MORTALS, YOU WILL ALL PERISH UNDER MY MIGHT!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nearby, Ignatius tbegins to <b>curl </b>himself into a ball to raise his<b> defence</b>, inside the smokle he has perfect cover to launch an attack with no problem... or so you think. Inside the <b>shadows</b> is a <b>sneaky</b> little monster who materializes behind Ignatius slashing at his back, the ghost forgets, however, that Ignatius back is on fire and burns his hand. Ignatius <b>rolls out </b>at the Sableye, who is so distracted by his hand that he doesn't see Ignatius coming, taking the hit full force. The Sableye comes back down and creates ghost energy around his hands shooting it at the still rolling Ignatius. The s<b>hadow ball</b> hits Ignatius, speeding him up and causing him to hit a nearby rock. Ignayius uncurls, had it not ben for the Defence curl he would have broken his skull. &quot;YOU WILL ALL DIE, NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY.&quot; It looks like Ignatius took a big hit this round, leaving hit at 45 percent health but pretty okay in all other aspects, the Sableye is at 60 percent health and has a burn, this match could go either way.<br />
<br />
As this happens The angry Ana and overconfident Politoed lock eyes. First off Ana releases toxic pheromones into the air, a <b>fatal</b> concoction to cause <b>attraction</b>, the wind blows, knocking them into the strange green frog. He automatically feels something and his eyes turn expressionless, his love for Ana blinding him. He begins singing about his love for Ana in <b>Hyper Voice</b>, the terrible noise hurting everyones ears, but everyones perfectly okay otherwise. </span></span><span style="color: DarkOrchid"><span style="font-size: 9px">He runs up to hug Ana who lets herself get hugged. This works out perfectly as she uses all the static energy around her to create <b>thunder</b>, causing the upcoming <b>bolt</b> to hit the Politoed really hard knocking him back, the hit being too much. The toad falls back knocked out uttering his last words &quot;I LOVE TO HATE YOU!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alberta prepares to do the orders it is given. She starts it off with a <b>draco</b>nic-like<b> dance</b>, getting her power up for any attacks. On the other hand Magby does a very similar thing making the <b>day sunnier</b>, in order to help all fire attacks. They <b>both</b> begin to create static around their fists, they run towards the center, their fists crashing and <b>static</b> cackling the attack pretty evenly matched. Finally Alberta snaps, letting her attacker <b>punch</b> her stomach. The Magby stays quiet as Alberta stands up, she took some damage as well. Now the Magby and Alberta are pretty even now, but Alberta seems to have more strength because of the Dragon Dance.<br />
<br />
The battle is getting tougher, and the sun's face has turned into a bull's his eyes turning red. Whatever is happening must be serious.</span></span></div>

Asking the Seel for help it instantly says yes, as a resident of the lake she had enough experience diving that she could be underwater for long periods of time. You all step into the water ready to face whatever might be underneath. As you head underwater you hold onto Tortuga who uses a power to create a bubble around you, you can see and feel the water but you can breathe, and it seems that your pokemon can hear you talk. The Seel leads you into a huge underwater cavern, the inside there are underwater crystals everywhere. you keep your hands to yourself however, as the Seel shows you that they shoot out, the spikes could destroy your bubble!<br />
<br />
You head deeper into the cavern, so far in fact that the light disappears! However there is light, as Chinchow and Lanturn swim around the area. One light grabs your attention as it illuminates above many stones that look like clams. Wait, those rocks are clams! You are so distracted by the pearls that you swim forward and try to grab one. You are so distracted that you dont notice the Huntail lunge at you from a hole in the wall. The Seel however does see this and is quick to react, scaring it away with an aurora beam. Before you notice you are surrounded by two other Huntails, each appearing from its own hole. Looks like before you can find your pearl you must fight the underwater fish. Tortuga can separate from you and hear you,like everyone alse, Pathos probably can fight underwater, and the Seel looks like it will follow your orders.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DeepSkyBlue"><div style="text-align: center">Red smiled as he looked cheerfully at the shimmering water peacefully, the sun shiny gently on calm lake top and the general fish Pokémon swimming around without a care in the world. &quot;This is an amazing sight,&quot; Red thought as he chuckled a little. Suddenly water darkened, Seel had lead them to an underwater cavern, this must be where the Pearl’s must be. The further they swam in, the darker and colder if got. Even though he was in Tortuga’s Dive Bubble, the water felt like it was gently stroking his skin Luckily there had been some Chinchou and Lanturn to light lower depths of the cavern. The walls were aligned with pretty rocks, strange shape really, he could’ve swore they looked like Lamps.<br />
<br />
A second glance gave discovery that they were in fact Clams! This mission was turning out easier than first thought, but after a couple of seconds a couple of rather nasty creature emerged from holes with the inner lining, a pair of shadows began to take form as a long angry looking serpent creature. “Huntail,” he spoke quietly, “They must be protecting these Pearl’s from unwanted visitors..”<br />
<br />
&quot;Pathos, I guess we're going to have to battle, eh...&quot; Red murmured as he prepared to order his sultry whore. &quot;Pathos, use a <b>Dark Pulse</b> to ward of the imposing Huntail, then when it gets near use <b>Psywave</b> in an attempt to throw its concentration off! Finish up by <b>Mimic</b>king its last attack!<br />
<br />
&quot;Seel!&quot; he ordered, &quot;When Pathos uses Psywave I want you to give Huntail your most fearsome <b>Headbut</b>! Then when Huntail is affected, I want you to launch a barrage of <b>Ice Shard’s</b> at it's head. Thats all we can manage for now..&quot; Red then looked to Pathos and smiled confidently as he waited for the 2 pokemon to attack.<br />
<br />
Pathos takes a deep breath before putting his special underwater-breathing device on, and dives underwater, and is met by tons two Huntail twins, he can't count them all. He swims to the side of Seel, and is met by a fascinating sight, the glimmer of the light shining off the pearls from the Laturn.&#8203;</div></span></span></div>

<br />
<span style="color: DarkOrchid"><span style="font-size: 9px">You give your orders to your pokemon and they prepare for a second round of beating the crap out of others. Prestige starts it off by <b>Teleport</b>ing out of the Sand and into random areas around the Sandshrew, looking for an opening. The Sandshrew lays on the sand from earlier with its hands over its head, as if scared of getting hit. Prestige takes a chance and stops behind the Sandshrew preparing an orb of ice energy between his hands, ready to create a <b>blizzard</b>. She has other ideas however and begins <b>spinning</b> very<b> rapidly</b> knocking sand into Prestige. He gets distracted and stops creating ice energy, leaving himself open. The Sandshrew pounces and knocks Prestige back she<b> Slashes</b> his neck with great might, barely missing the windpipe, causing the hit to be very critical. Prestige reacts in pain by shooting the Ice energy he had created knocking the sandshrew back, she lands on her head, causing great pain. Prestige looks really hurt, that slash having brought his health down to half, luckily the Sandshrew took a big hit too, her health being halfed as well. They are pretty even energy-wise as well both at about 75 percent, but Prestige doesn't look like he should be using ice attacks soon. &quot;FOOLISH MORTALS, YOU WILL ALL PERISH UNDER MY MIGHT!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nearby, Ignatius tbegins to <b>curl </b>himself into a ball to raise his<b> defence</b>, inside the smokle he has perfect cover to launch an attack with no problem... or so you think. Inside the <b>shadows</b> is a <b>sneaky</b> little monster who materializes behind Ignatius slashing at his back, the ghost forgets, however, that Ignatius back is on fire and burns his hand. Ignatius <b>rolls out </b>at the Sableye, who is so distracted by his hand that he doesn't see Ignatius coming, taking the hit full force. The Sableye comes back down and creates ghost energy around his hands shooting it at the still rolling Ignatius. The s<b>hadow ball</b> hits Ignatius, speeding him up and causing him to hit a nearby rock. Ignayius uncurls, had it not ben for the Defence curl he would have broken his skull. &quot;YOU WILL ALL DIE, NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY.&quot; It looks like Ignatius took a big hit this round, leaving hit at 45 percent health but pretty okay in all other aspects, the Sableye is at 60 percent health and has a burn, this match could go either way.<br />
<br />
As this happens The angry Ana and overconfident Politoed lock eyes. First off Ana releases toxic pheromones into the air, a <b>fatal</b> concoction to cause <b>attraction</b>, the wind blows, knocking them into the strange green frog. He automatically feels something and his eyes turn expressionless, his love for Ana blinding him. He begins singing about his love for Ana in <b>Hyper Voice</b>, the terrible noise hurting everyones ears, but everyones perfectly okay otherwise. </span></span><span style="color: DarkOrchid"><span style="font-size: 9px">He runs up to hug Ana who lets herself get hugged. This works out perfectly as she uses all the static energy around her to create <b>thunder</b>, causing the upcoming <b>bolt</b> to hit the Politoed really hard knocking him back, the hit being too much. The toad falls back knocked out uttering his last words &quot;I LOVE TO HATE YOU!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alberta prepares to do the orders it is given. She starts it off with a <b>draco</b>nic-like<b> dance</b>, getting her power up for any attacks. On the other hand Magby does a very similar thing making the <b>day sunnier</b>, in order to help all fire attacks. They <b>both</b> begin to create static around their fists, they run towards the center, their fists crashing and <b>static</b> cackling the attack pretty evenly matched. Finally Alberta snaps, letting her attacker <b>punch</b> her stomach. The Magby stays quiet as Alberta stands up, she took some damage as well. Now the Magby and Alberta are pretty even now, but Alberta seems to have more strength because of the Dragon Dance.<br />
<br />
The battle is getting tougher, and the sun's face has turned into a bull's his eyes turning red. Whatever is happening must be serious.</span></span></b></u>

</blockquote><u><b><span style="color: DarkOrchid"><span style="font-size: 9px">Alina heard a loud curse booming from within her head. Snapping her neck around, she could see her little Abra, grasping his neck with blood trickling through his claws. Alina winced and was about to call out to make sure he was okay, but Prestige interrupted her by saying &quot;Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. No more Blizzards, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he carefully rubbed his sore neck Alina contemplated on switching him out, but once again, Prestige interrupted her thoughts with a &quot;Don't even think about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
She was torn between returning Prestige to let his throat heal, which would just make him angry, or letting him finish the battle like he wanted. Both Pokemon were in rough shape, and Prestige was more timid than usual after that last attack. He kept his distance from the Sandshrew, staring it down with a wary eye. Alina sighed, making up her mind, and ordered &quot;Use <b>Shadow Ball</b>, keep your distance from it. <b>Teleport</b> away from any danger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nearby was Ignatius, rolling on the ground as he grasped his head, cursing in his Quilava language. After that move, he was lucky he wasn't in a coma. Despite seeing her Quilava's pain, though, Alina couldn't help but smile and scratch the back of her head. Perhaps it wasn't the best choice of moves with this opponent... they would need to practice that combo a bit more before trying it again. Ignatius shook his head slowly, blinking and wincing from the pain in his head as he got back on his four legs. But... he seemed to be shimmering... and growing slightly? Alina couldn't quite figure out why the flames on her Quilava's head and tail had gone out, and why a ring of flames around his neck replaced them. His body grew longer, and larger, and his face more pointed until she realized, Ignatius was evolving into a Typhlosion! As Alina smiled with glee he kept growing to an enormous size, just around 5 inches taller than Alina. When the shimmering had subsided, Ignatius bared his longer and sharper teeth, growling at his opponent, daring the Sableye to even take one swipe at him. As much as Alina wanted to run up and hug her new, gigantic fire ferret, she was afraid that he would take a swipe at her for bringing him such a piercing headache. As he growled he still winced from the aching in his head, but kept his fiery eyes upon the dark Pokemon. &quot;Time to <b>Wish</b>!&quot; Alina began, nearly exploding with joy. &quot;<b>Flamethrower</b>, and keep your distance, of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
As she issued her commands, Ana the Flaaffy came trotting up to her, a malicious smile upon her face. The disgusting hug from the Politoed was definitely worth the trouble, as it gave her the perfect opportunity to absolutely demolish it. She baa'd happily, as she sat down by Alina, feeling extremely proud that her battle had finished before the others. Much to her dismay, however, Ana simply got a &quot;good job&quot; and a pat on the head from Alina, who had now turned her attention to Alberta.<br />
<br />
The Charmander was panting slightly, but still brimming with energy and determination. The Dragon Dance made her feel so much lighter, stronger, and confident, which made her pay no mind to the fact that her and the Magby were pretty even. The Sunny Day also made her feel more comfortable in her surroundings, even though her fire moves weren't fantastic and her opponent was indeed a fire type. Alina wasn't feeling too comfortable with this battle, though, unlike Alberta. Alberta's moves were very limited... and energy consuming. With the Dragon Dance, it would make sense to make the most of Alberta's physical attacks, which limited Alina even more. She faced the problem of being too predictable if she kept using Thunder punch. She had those rocks that she used before, though, and with the boosted strength...<br />
<br />
&quot;Alberta!&quot; she ordered finally. &quot;<b>Rock Slide</b>, and <b>Smokescreen</b> to try to protect yourself!&quot;</span></span></b></u></div>

SilverWind</b></u> – <b>Pearl Lake</b><i>Reply in deepskyblue<br />
</i><br />
Giving orders to the pokemon and putting on your diving gear you look at the ensuing battle. First to react is Pathos, sending a <b>Pulse </b>of dark <b>energy </b>underwater, hitting the biggest looking of the Huntail. It winces and looks at Pathos and <b>Screech</b>es, Causing the two other Huntail to swim forward and cover him. Seems like there is some sort of heirachy in this group. They both <b>growl </b>furiouslyat the pokemon, if they are willing to do this for some Clamperl there must be <i>something </i>important here. Next Seel and Pathos nod and swim forward, the Seel swimming forward as fast as it can possibly swim, knocking the wind out of one of a Huntail with a <b>headbutt</b>. This causes it to float backwards, allowing you to see a scar on its belly. Taking the chance Pathos aims at it and fires a <b>psy</b>chic <b>wave</b>, a perfect shot would defeat it. Before he can cheer however he sees that the second, non-scarred, Huntail takes the hit. They nod to each other and swim forward, their turn.<br />
<br />
They <b>both</b> swim forwards, their jaws opening and shutting enough to<b> crunch </b>through a rock. Pathos tries to <b>mimic</b> this, but to no avail, opening it's mouth underwater wasn't good for an airbreather. Alongside that, it has no teeth sharp enough to do damage! Since it can't actually defend Pathos takes a hit to the face, but reacts fast enough to kick the assailant away. Seel reacts fast enough to hit it with the<b> ice shard </b>attack you told it to do. The Huntail are both raring to go, but they're waiting for your squad's attacks.<br />
<br />
This round seems to have taken a light toll on the two Huntail, as they are both 90 percent healthy. Pathos is starting to turn a light shade of blue, it either needs to find some air or get in it's pokeball, as it probably won't last long here. Seel is okay as well, but it seems like it prefers long range to close combat fighting. Tortuga looks like he wants to get in the match to help his friends.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span></span><br />

<br />
</i>Many things happen at once, your Ignatius becoming a Typhlosion, Ana winning her battle, coming up with a new strategy for Prestige, Figuring out a way to complement Alberta's new-found strength. With a mighty battlecry, your pokemon attack. First off Ignatius attacks, his Sableye enemy preparing for the round. The Sableye closes its eyes and looks at Ignatius having <b>detect</b>ed what it was going to do next. This was going to be a problem, all direct attacks aimed at the Sableye would fail. For the moment Ignatius ignores this and looks at the stars, <b>wish</b>ing for the answer, and a way to cure itself. The cosmos agree with the Typhlosion and it sees a way. The Sableye begins to use <b>shadow</b>s to create a<b> ball</b>, he finishes it in time and prepares to launch it. It never does. The Sableye is sent flying as his attack explodes, compliments of Ignatius and his <b>Flamethrower</b> attack. He had blown up the shadow ball! The Sableye lands with his back to the rock Ignatius had hit earlier, you hear a loud snap, &quot;MOTHERF*CKERS!&quot; That is the last you hear of the ghost pokemon. Another one down.<br />
<br />
Prestige is next on the list of fighters. Prestige watches out for trouble and begins to create <b>shadow </b>energy into a <b>ball</b> in a similar method to the Sableye. The Sandshrew begins to create a metal <b>ball</b> in her arms, she then begins to <b>gyra</b>te the ball in her hands, promptly aiming it at Prestige. He sees this coming and teleports away but she never shoots it. What follows is a series of <b>teleporting</b><s>in a very dragonball-like fashion</s>. Finally she shoots it, missing Prestige who hits her square in with the shadow ball. Looks like your luck has reversed. Now The Sandshrew is at 30 percent health and 60 percent energy, while Prestige is at 50 percent health and energy.<br />
<br />
Lastly, Alberta, who seems ready to go. The Magby runs up and points in a different direction as it runs, trying to distract Alberta, but she doesn't fall for it. As the Magby runs up to hit Alberta with her <b>Faint Attack</b> she is stopped as <b>rocks </b>hit her but not in the usual <b>slide</b>, Alberta was throwing them with her superstrength! The Magby backs up from the pelting of rocks after taking damage and hides in a <b>smog</b>, Alberta does the same, except she hides in her <b>smokescreen</b>. Mixed together they create a poisonous gas ending up in damage to each other, alongside a bad case of poisoning. Looks like the Magby is at 45 percent health and 75 percent energy. Alberta is at 75 percent energy and health while her superstrength is fading. With both pokemon <b>poison</b>ed however the battle could swing either way.<br />
<br />
With only two pokemon you can now elaborate your orders, but before you can begin ending the match something happens. The ground shakes and you and everything in the bowl-like valley are elevated to the skies, where the sun laughs maniacly and the sky turns all sorts of colors. You seem to have a need to defeat you enemies now, or alse something might happen.</span></span></div>

<br />
</i>Many things happen at once, your Ignatius becoming a Typhlosion, Ana winning her battle, coming up with a new strategy for Prestige, Figuring out a way to complement Alberta's new-found strength. With a mighty battlecry, your pokemon attack. First off Ignatius attacks, his Sableye enemy preparing for the round. The Sableye closes its eyes and looks at Ignatius having <b>detect</b>ed what it was going to do next. This was going to be a problem, all direct attacks aimed at the Sableye would fail. For the moment Ignatius ignores this and looks at the stars, <b>wish</b>ing for the answer, and a way to cure itself. The cosmos agree with the Typhlosion and it sees a way. The Sableye begins to use <b>shadow</b>s to create a<b> ball</b>, he finishes it in time and prepares to launch it. It never does. The Sableye is sent flying as his attack explodes, compliments of Ignatius and his <b>Flamethrower</b> attack. He had blown up the shadow ball! The Sableye lands with his back to the rock Ignatius had hit earlier, you hear a loud snap, &quot;MOTHERF*CKERS!&quot; That is the last you hear of the ghost pokemon. Another one down.<br />
<br />
Prestige is next on the list of fighters. Prestige watches out for trouble and begins to create <b>shadow </b>energy into a <b>ball</b> in a similar method to the Sableye. The Sandshrew begins to create a metal <b>ball</b> in her arms, she then begins to <b>gyra</b>te the ball in her hands, promptly aiming it at Prestige. He sees this coming and teleports away but she never shoots it. What follows is a series of <b>teleporting</b><s>in a very dragonball-like fashion</s>. Finally she shoots it, missing Prestige who hits her square in with the shadow ball. Looks like your luck has reversed. Now The Sandshrew is at 30 percent health and 60 percent energy, while Prestige is at 50 percent health and energy.<br />
<br />
Lastly, Alberta, who seems ready to go. The Magby runs up and points in a different direction as it runs, trying to distract Alberta, but she doesn't fall for it. As the Magby runs up to hit Alberta with her <b>Faint Attack</b> she is stopped as <b>rocks </b>hit her but not in the usual <b>slide</b>, Alberta was throwing them with her superstrength! The Magby backs up from the pelting of rocks after taking damage and hides in a <b>smog</b>, Alberta does the same, except she hides in her <b>smokescreen</b>. Mixed together they create a poisonous gas ending up in damage to each other, alongside a bad case of poisoning. Looks like the Magby is at 45 percent health and 75 percent energy. Alberta is at 75 percent energy and health while her superstrength is fading. With both pokemon <b>poison</b>ed however the battle could swing either way.<br />
<br />
With only two pokemon you can now elaborate your orders, but before you can begin ending the match something happens. The ground shakes and you and everything in the bowl-like valley are elevated to the skies, where the sun laughs maniacly and the sky turns all sorts of colors. You seem to have a need to defeat you enemies now, or alse something might happen.</span></span></span>

<br />
<span style="color: darkorchid"><span style="font-size: 9px">After a fiery explosion Ignatius trotted over to Alina, looking sleepy and rather grouchy from his headache. Alina carefully stroked the top of his head, where she felt a huge bump from where he had hit the rock. Ignatius winced as her fingers ran over the injury and pushed her away. He yawned widely as he crawled away, collapsing on the ground and beginning to fall asleep, not really caring about the end result of the other two battles. Ana bleated, which brought Alina back to the battles, where it seemed the luck of the last two Pokemon had flip flopped.<br />
<br />
Prestige, despite his neck injury, was able to still fight, and this time, without a scratch (Or a new one, I should say). The tables had turned for him, it seemed, and the Sandshrew's health was wearing thin. Of course, Prestige was tired as well, having teleported around so much and using moves that were causing his energy to wane. He was still in better shape than his opponent, but Alina still feared that another Teleport would be predictable. &quot;Prestige, let's hurry and end this!&quot; Alina called out. He couldn't agree more, and was showing his impatience by glaring back at her, silently saying 'well, give me your orders already.' The trainer finally said, &quot;Defend yourself with a <b>Barrier</b>! <b>Focus</b> to <b>Blast</b> the Sandshrew away, and for the love of God, don't miss!&quot;<br />
<br />
A thick smog covered the area of Alberta's battle, and Alina could hear choking and gagging from within the the cloud of toxic gas. Alina could faintly see Alberta from within the smog, and she could tell by the sickly look of the Charmander that she was poisoned. At least the Magby was poisoned as well, and just as worn out as Alberta was. The fire lizard didn't appear to be as psyched for the battle now, with her super strength fading away. But, the sun was still shining strong, which did help brighten the mood for Alberta somewhat...<br />
<br />
&quot;Use the last of your super strength in a <b>Thunderpunch</b> attack!&quot; Alina ordered. &quot;Blast it away with an <b>Ancient Power</b>!&quot;<br />
<br />
As she gave her last order, the ground began to quake beneath her feet. Ignatius awoke, fiery eyes darting back and forth and looking to murder whoever or whatever it was that had forced him from his nap. The sun in the sky continued to laugh, which was really starting to creep out Alina to no end, as the ground rose from the... ground. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot; Alina cried out among the chaos as she fell to the ground due to losing her balance. This had to be a dream, despite feeling all too real. Even so, she still didn't want to lose, even if it was in the dream world. She called out one last time &quot;Stay away from the edges, be careful!&quot;</span></span></span></div>
