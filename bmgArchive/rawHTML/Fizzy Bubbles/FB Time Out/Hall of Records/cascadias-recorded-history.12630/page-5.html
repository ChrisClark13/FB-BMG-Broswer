Roaring in pain, the Gyarados looks around wildly for the culprit, charging a Hyper Beam for only a few seconds and letting it fly in Jamie's direction, but a protective white shield Jamie is able to conjure in time protects both it and Tifa from the strike.<br />

Tifa again goes into action, a green aura surrounding it as it begins to leech health and energy from Gyarados, who roars in pain once again. It ducks its head underneath the water to wash out its eyes, and it rises again, its eyes bloodshot with red pupils. As Hayley swoops in to attack with its Thunderpunch, Gyarados stares it down, a blue aura appearing around Flygon and freezing it in midair, the leer attack effectively stopping the attack.

Dunsparce curls up again and begins to roll around Arbok, quickly uncurling and sinking its teeth into the cobra's tail. Arbok raises its tail into the air, bringing it and Dunsparce down hard onto the ground and slightly shaking off Dunsparce who loses its grip. Falling to the ground, Dunsparce decides to improvise, throwing itself up onto Arbok's chestlike area, hitting it rather hard. Arbok shakes its head as it gets back to its figurative feet, the Headbutt attack causing it to flinch. Taking the opportunity for an attack of its own, Dunsparce again jets from the ground to deal a light tackle to Arbok's face, doing slight damage but damage nonetheless. Arbok glares at the small...whatever Dunsparce is, and its fangs begin to turn a deep purple color as it prepares a Poison Fang. Responding to its orders, Lily quite literally jumps into action, standing beside Dunsparce and raising a faint golden dome around them both. Arbok lunges forward with its Poison Fangs of doom, slightly buffeted at the dome and losing power as it bites into Dunsparce, doing half the damage it would normally do. What will you do?</span></span>

Hit it with an Ancientpower to start off, then get the hell out of the way and let Lily attack it for a bit. When Arbok's attention is on Lily dive from the side, and try to Bite it's face off. Finally, if it's face doesn't rip off, use a Rage to it's weird...thing under it's face. The part with the tattoo,&quot; ordered Joe, as he looked around to see Stu and Lily looking at him, waiting for him to finish, so that Stu can get started on his orders. &quot;WE HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE, OMFG!!!&quot; Joe quickly got a tail slap from Dunsparce, and gathered himself, and with a determined look on his face, Dunsparce turned to face Arbok, ready to try and mutilate it.</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Green">Torkoal Stu and Joe: No offense to Dunsparce, but this battle will drag on forever if you don't each use a Pokemon. ._.;<br />
Dunsparce curls up again and begins to roll around Arbok, quickly uncurling and sinking its teeth into the cobra's tail. Arbok raises its tail into the air, bringing it and Dunsparce down hard onto the ground and slightly shaking off Dunsparce who loses its grip. Falling to the ground, Dunsparce decides to improvise, throwing itself up onto Arbok's chestlike area, hitting it rather hard. Arbok shakes its head as it gets back to its figurative feet, the Headbutt attack causing it to flinch. Taking the opportunity for an attack of its own, Dunsparce again jets from the ground to deal a light tackle to Arbok's face, doing slight damage but damage nonetheless. Arbok glares at the small...whatever Dunsparce is, and its fangs begin to turn a deep purple color as it prepares a Poison Fang. Responding to its orders, Lily quite literally jumps into action, standing beside Dunsparce and raising a faint golden dome around them both. Arbok lunges forward with its Poison Fangs of doom, slightly buffeted at the dome and losing power as it bites into Dunsparce, doing half the damage it would normally do. What will you do?</span></span>

Hit it with an Ancientpower to start off, then get the hell out of the way and let Lily attack it for a bit. When Arbok's attention is on Lily dive from the side, and try to Bite it's face off. Finally, if it's face doesn't rip off, use a Rage to it's weird...thing under it's face. The part with the tattoo,&quot; ordered Joe, as he looked around to see Stu and Lily looking at him, waiting for him to finish, so that Stu can get started on his orders. &quot;WE HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE, OMFG!!!&quot; Joe quickly got a tail slap from Dunsparce, and gathered himself, and with a determined look on his face, Dunsparce turned to face Arbok, ready to try and mutilate it.</span></span><br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Green">Stuart knew what he had to do, he had to swiftly order his attacks for this round with exact timings and such so Dunsparce could continue its mauling of Arbok while Lily gets out of the way. He nodded at Joe, the tension was clearly mounting, Joe didn't want to waste anytime with their new cobra foe and Stuart didn't really want stick around the Arbok after it nearly killed him, he glanced at Lily who was current observing her newest battling partner. Stuart smiled at the site of the Ludicolo admiring to some respect Joe's Dunsparce which was ordered to 'mutilate this bitch of an Arbok'.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Lily, listen carefully,&quot; Stuart started, beginning to breath deeply, trying to quickly think up some orders, he knew that Joe was counting on him, so he couldn't fail or it might put them both in danger they weren't prepared for. &quot;Lily....once Dunsparce moves to the side start your attacks, first use Razor Leaf, then Fury Swipes (learned as a Lombre xD), finally use Dynamic Punch, after those jump out of the way so Dunsparce can finish its extreme mauling of Arbok!&quot; Stuart commanded as he pointed menacingly at the Arbok and prepared himself for the battle to unfold before his and Joe's eyes.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorchid"><b>Lonely Wanderer:</b> Heading off of the ferry onto the dock onto Venom Island, you and your Beautifly begin to walk toward the Skull Tunnel. The walk isn't very long, and you soon find yourself at the large white rock that jets from the ground, several indents in the rock causing it to look remarkably like a skull. You slip underneath where the mouth would be, and your Beautifly follows, its wings beginning to glow a bright white as the area is illuminated enough to see. You walk inside, and find yourself in the tunnel, easily high enough to stand up in, with circular tunnels. Walking through your current tunnel, you soon find yourself in a rather high topped area, with a series of 10 tunnels branching off from the circular room. Nothing really makes them different from each other except the very center one, which is bathed in orange light.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote>OOC: I also apologized for not replying. And for giving a crappy reply. &gt;&gt;;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DarkOrchid"><i>Hmm...well, there is nothing else more interesting than the tunnel in the middle, I guess...</i>Andrea's eyes skimmed through the tunnels, the only one actually taking a interest to was the pathway surrounded in the mystical orange aura. Karasa hovered above her, trying to decide on any of the other tunnels...<br />
<br />
But, even without Karasa giving an indication, Andrea knew that they should go through the center tunnel. Whenever it was a spell that was drawing her in once she gazed at it, or her own cells eager for adventure in the Skull Tunnel, Andrea shrugged as she decided. Karasa then poked her on the shoulder, the Beautifly becoming tired for keeping this light on for a while.<br />
<br />
Understanding what she meant, Andrea said, &quot;I really don't see a point using the Flash anymore, that I agree. However, there's a possibility that the light could be just an illusion; however, if it's real, and your Flash attack isn't necessary anymore, then I can otherwise return you to your Pokéball. But first, we'll have to go through the tunnel and see for ourselves...&quot;<br />
<br />
She wasn't amazed that Karasa didn't disagree; after all, they been through a few decent tunnels together. What was different about this tunnel than the rest?<br />
<br />
&quot;C'mon,&quot; Andrea beckoned Karasa, and the two slowly--and slightly catiously--approached the tunnel of the mythical pool of light.</span></span></div>

Ralts is hit by the Leaf Blade rather hard, and she shouts out in a sad voice, &quot;Quit it!

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px">Finally done.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red"><b>Octazooka:</b> You give your orders to Quagsire, and through the roaring sandstorm you hear an affirmative response from the mud fish. You hear a splashing noise, followed by what sounds like a shriek from the Flygon. The sandstorm begins to die down slighly, and you suddenly feel a bit cold, apparently Quagsire's Icy Wind attack. As the sandstorm dies down even more, you can make out the forms of Quagsire and Flygon through the airborne sand. Faint glows appear near each of the two Pokemon's figures, and the Flygon's moves quickly toward Quagsire, who stands its ground.<br />
<br />
As the two Pokemon make contact, the glows quickly fade, with each of the two Pokemon roaring out in pain. As the sand clears even more, the Flygon appears to have been hit by the water from the Water Gun, with the sand coating a lot of its body, causing it to look rather strange. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: green"><b>Alilatias:</b> You give your orders to your Pokemon, you both begin to move into action almost immediately. Saito begins to glow a bright white as a blinding light illuminates the entire area. Shielding your eyes from the brunt of the attack, you lower your hand to see the Electabuzz, Magcargo, and one of the Swellow looking around blindly, apparently having all been blinded by Saito's attack. One of the other Swellow, who had apparently not been blinded, begins to flap its wings in the direction of the Electabuzz, the ensuing Icy Wind causing the Electabuzz to shiver from the cold before it turns to look in Faltzer's direction. <br />
<br />
Electricity again charging up in the Electabuzz's prongs, it quickly lets a series of small tendrils out in the form of a stream toward Faltzer. Managing to fly out of the way, it suddenly moves between several locations, 3 more of the bird Pokemon appearing at its side, a grand total of 3 clones, 1 Substitute, 1 Breloom, and 3 Swellow taking on the Electabuzz and the Magcargo. <br />
<br />
As Saito runs forward to attack the Magcargo with an Ice Punch, the Substitute and the other Swellow - indistinguishable from each other, both jet in to strike Electabuzz from different angles, causing it to roar as its fist begins to crackle with electrical energy, swinging and striking one of the wild Swellow. The Swellow merely fizzles from sight as it is struck, the Substitute fading. Swinging its own fist of ice energy, Saito punches into the Magcargo's shell. The snail merely sits there, doing nothing at all in retaliation. Slightly confused, Saito nonetheless pulls its other fist up, crackling with electrical energy. Swinging it into the side of Magcargo, the rock-fire Pokemon winces considerably, but doesn't make a counter attack.<br />
<br />
As Faltzer begins to glow a bright white, the other two Swellow notice and begin to as well, ready to attack with their Sky Attacks in a single trio of strikes. As though it was waiting for this moment, even though it is blinded, fire begins to surround Magcargo's entire body. Saito takes a few steps backward from the heat as Magcargo opens its mouth wide, a stream of superheated air rushing forward in a Heat Wave attack. The three Swellow fight through the heat (with Faltzer's clones disappearing) while Saito closes its eyes and grits its teeth. However, the Electabuzz is struck as well, and upon its roar of pain the Magcargo immediately stops. The attack gone, the three Swellow strike Electabuzz hard, sending it flying back into a tree. However, after a few seconds, it does manage to get back up, though it is extremely weak. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: green"><b>quilava plush:</b> Releasing your Farfetch'd, Ahiru, outside of the cage, it listens intently as you give your orders, nodding as it flaps its wings a few times and begins to scan the area. Your heart lifts as you hear a slight jingling and Ahiru reappears, the keys at the top of its stick. Taking them, you try them one by one until you manage to find the correct key to the lock, clicking as it opens up. You climb out of the cage, and three of the Pokemon quickly rush out, though the Nidoran F cautiously moves out of the cage, eyeing the area for apparent signs of trouble. <br />
<br />
Looking around, you find that the tent you are in is sort of a storage area - large, unmarked boxes are piled up all around you. You hear a strange, muffled noise behind you, turning around to see that the Nidoran M, Ledyba, and Paras had all fallen asleep on the ground, a pair of Gloom the culprits. They move to attack, small blue powder starting to come from their petals, but Nidoran F, who hadn't fallen asleep, quickly issues a Supersonic attack upon the two Gloom, causing them to become confused, each sending the other to sleep rather than you. Thinking &quot;some guard,&quot; you turn to look at the other Pokemon, and see a Hypno glowing a bright purple as the energy from the sleeping Pokemon is drained into it. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: green"><b>Latias10:</b> Backing away from the Venusaur, you and your Shellgon watch it cautiously to make sure that it doesn't break free and attack. While it clearly is trying with every muscle in its body to break free and attack, it appears the paralysis has taken much too control over its body. Seeing this, you continue to back away, before you realize that the Venusaur isn't going anywhere, so you turn your back on it and begin to walk though the dense forest.<br />
<br />
After a few moments of walking, you ermerge from the brush to find that a worn path had been made through the area in front of you, extending to your left and to your right. Thinking over the area, you can deduce that the left path will lead you somewhere near the dock, based on its direction, while the other will lead you farther inland. While you look between the two, you hear a gentle rustle in the left path. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: green"><b>Centin:</b> Giving your orders to Axtan, his eyes suddenly tint blue, a similarly colored aura surrounding the Machamp for a few seconds. However, before it can get a Night Shade attack off, the Machamp whips around, its right arms looking as though they are engulfed in purple flame as they swing into the Xatu, sending it flying to the left and causing its Night Shade attack to miss its target completely. Apparently unblinded, the Machamp stares the Xatu down, who looks to have taken quite a hit from the strike.<br />
<br />
The Machamp smirks at Axtan, before striking the ground with its left foot. A dome of the same strange purple energy surrounds Axtan, before the dome disappears from view. Wondering what the heck that was supposed to do, Axtan shakes its head, taking to the skies as it would give it an easier time avoiding attacks from the strange Machamp. The two Pokemon stare each other down, Machamp vs. Xatu, Axtan awaiting its next attacking orders.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: green"><b>Dark Fire:</b> Giving your orders to your small fire fox Pokemon, it smirks, beginning to carry out its attacking orders only a moment later. Opening its mouth, the heat from flames causes the air to blur as several Embers are fired from its mouth at the Beedrill, who manages to dodge the attack as it begins to fly toward Drought, smacking it across the face with one of its needles, doing good damage to the fire fox, who cries out in pain as it staggers back a few feet. Realizing that Beedrill's Rage is building as its attacks land, the Vulpix moves quickly to attack again to hopefully finish off its opponent soon, before the Beedrill's attacks became even more powerful.<br />
<br />
Opening its mouth wide, a gust of superheated air rushes forth, aimed directly at the yellow and black bug. The Beedrill cries out in pain as the air rushes over its body, but it still holds on, quickly flying downward at Vulpix, ready to strike. Remembering your commands, Drought waits. The Beedrill swings its needle, striking Vulpix hard and sending it flying sideways a few feet, causing it to miss its attempted strike on Beedrill. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: green"><b>Dark Scizor:</b> Giving your orders to Rakdos to move the log, it nods, flying over to the log as the Growlithe happily sprints over to the fallen tree. Putting its head up against the tree, the Growlithe pushes on the tree as your Scizor does as well, slowly moving little by little before it rolls off of the Paras, who gives a weak cry of joy before making a painful wincing motion. The boy sighs, and walks over to the bug/grass type, pulling out a small, brightly colored bottle and spraying it over the Paras, who stares up at the boy. The boy murmurs something to the Paras, but you can't hear what it is. As the Growlithe looks on with a concerned look on its face, suddenly a flurry of white needles fly past your face, lodging in a nearby tree. Quickly whipping around, you see an Ariados looking with its piercing eyes directly at you, seemingly ready to strike for no reason.<br />
<br />
The boy looks up at the Ariados, and stares at it for a few moments. He then says to you, &quot;You're going to need to take that thing down, I have to take care of this Paras. My Growlithe will help you - it's fully trained, I don't think that there are any moves that it would normally learn that it hasn't already. After you knock it out, I have a net in my pack, we can take it to the Red Forest, then.&quot; What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: green"><b>Joe and Torkoal Stu:</b> You give your orders to your Pokemon, who precede to attack the Arbok who nearly killed Stu, but was saved by the courageous Dunsparce, as well as the no killing people rule. As they move into action, now with Lily the Ludicolo fighting alongside Dunsparce, the Arbok glares them both down. As Lily allows Dunsparce to make the first attack on the Arbok this round, Dunsparce begins to glow a bright white as it lauches itself at its opponent, ready to strike with an Ancient Power attack. Arbok swiftly moves out of the way of the strike, only getting nipped on the side by the strike. Moving to the side rather disheartedly, the Dunsparce watches as Lily begins its assault on its opponent.<br />
<br />
Swiping the air with its left arm, several leaves fly from it toward the Arbok, who gets hit by the majority of them, but doesn't do all that much damage to the Arbok. Moving in for an attack for the first time, the Arbok opens its mouth wide, letting a flurry of needles fly toward Lily, who doesn't manage to dodge the attack and takes a pretty good hit from it. Nonetheless, Lily bounces back, rushing forward and swiping its hands across Arbok, though its lack of claws means that it doesn't do as much damage as it could of. Shrugging it off, Lily's right fist glows white as it punches into the Arbok, causing it to look around wildly, confused.<br />
<br />
Moving back into action, Dunsparce lunges at the Arbok again, attempting to Bite into it. However, Arbok easily dodges this strike, causing Dunsparce to fly past it. Quickly turning around to face Arbok, Dunsparce barely manages to dodge a flurry of needles from Poison Sting before it lunges into the air, giving a light tackle into Arbok's hood. Arbok still seems ready to fight, what will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: deepskyblue"><b>thed3:</b> Dialing the number on the phone, you hold your breath as the phone begins to ring, sighing in relief as a woman's voice sounds in the receiver. &quot;Hello?&quot; she asks, in an almost frightened tone, &quot;Can I help you?&quot; You quickly begin to speak, telling the woman of the Totodile and the Marill and the strange, small red welt which had appeared on each of them. After you finish your summary, the woman's tone instantly changes to a grave, urgent one. &quot;You didn't leave any of your Pokemon near the lake, did you?&quot; Responding with a negative, the woman sighs in relief before she ends the call with a few words. &quot;I am sending help immediately. DO NOT GO NEAR THE LAKE. An explanation of what is happening will be provided to you as soon as we can get there from our base on Brine Island.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman hangs up the phone and ends the call. After a few minutes of waiting and scanning the seas, you finally see a small motorboat rushing toward the island, a Nurse Joy and a few other people both men and woman inside. They dock, and wasting no time they rush over to you. Nurse Joy, whose voice you recognize as the one on the phone, turns to you. &quot;These Pokemon are in need of immediate care, and therefore I will need to attend to them immediately. Aaron will describe what's happening to the best of his ability.&quot; One of the men, with sandy blonde hair, roughly 5' 08&quot;, shrugs. The others all crowd into the elevator, and ascend to the top of the crater.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now then...&quot; he says in a friendly, conversational tone, &quot;I wasn't ever much of a doctor, so they always have me do the explaining. Anywhere, where to start...&quot; He looks up to the sky. &quot;Every year about this time, Pokemon appear on the beach, writhing in inexplicable pain with small welts on their bodies. We haven't been able to figure out what causes this, but there are several theories that people have. The first, foremost, and that makes the most sense is that there is a rare breed of Tentacool which live in the lake, coming out this time of year. The Tentacool sting anything which come near them, the venom rushing through the Pokemon's body instantly. We haven't made a cure for this yet, and to do that, we would need the Tentacool to test it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man sighs, and looks up at the sky again. &quot;I think we should head up there, to see if they need any help. You in?&quot;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorange"><b>Timeless River: </b>Returning your Quagsire, you pull out a Fire Ball, throwing the vibrant orange and red Pokeball onto the ground, bursting open to reveal a brilliant red and orange light which fades to reveal the form of a Torkoal. Smoke billowing from its nose and mouth, and coals burning brightly, the Haunter, looks at its new opponent with interest. As Torkoal is given her attacks, the Haunter stares on at the Pokemon, formulating a strategy to take down your new Pokemon.<br />
<br />
Smokestack quickly moves into action, sending a series of small Embers flying from its mouth at the Haunter, who reacts by sending a small swirling ball of purple and smoky gray energy at Smokestack, a counter attack by way of a Shadow Ball. While it meets several of the Embers halfway, the attack is much too widespread for the Shadow Ball to take them all down. While the Shadow Ball loses considerable amounts of energy, it manages to strike Torkoal, doing slight damage. However, the Embers strike Haunter, doing a bit more damage to it than Torkoal had sustained. Going into its next attack, Torkoal begins to focus its energy into its attacking and defending stats, lowering its speed in the process. The Haunter merely stares on, oblivious to what the Torkoal was doing.<br />
<br />
Moving into action again, Smokestack sends a burst of flames from its mouth, which curl themselves into a large twister of fire energy which surrounds the Haunter completely. As the flames surround the ghost type, its eyes glow a smoky gray for just a moment before a bolt of ghost energy rockets through the flames, hitting Torkoal for some damage. As the flames eventually begin to fade, the Haunter sits on, looking singed, and mad as well, as though game time is over. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorange"><b>Nash MOMO:</b> You give your orders to Malkav, who nods, its eyes glowing a faint blue as it readies its assault on the mysterious opponent. However, after a few seconds, its eyes' glow fades, tilting its head to the side, confused as why its attack didn't work. After only a few moments, though, what its opponent is becomes clear as it dashes from the fog, its mouth filled with dark energy. The Mightyena clamps down onto Malkav's left arm, causing it to cry out in pain. <br />
<br />
As the Mightyena's grip loosens, Malkav suddenly disappears, reappearing behind the Mightyena and slamming into it with a full body tackle, causing it to stagger forward a few steps. The Mightyena turns around and makes to try to ram into the Banette, though it manages to move out of the way of the strike, causing the Mightyena to run past it, turning around with a look of annoyance dawning across its face. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorange"><b>Ichimaru:</b> Giving the Ralts your proposition, it looks at you strangely for a few seconds before it says to you telepathically in an excited voice, &quot;Yes, let's!&quot; As Yuna's arms immediately fall limply to its sides, the Ralts sighs before it looks at you, raising one of its hands to its chin as it begins to ponder its options. &quot;I would like to play Hide and Seek, but that wouldn't be much fun at all, because I can use my psychic to find you. So that wouldn't be much fun...Unless you would like to find me? That would be fun, yes! What do you think of that?<br />
<br />
Or...&quot; the Ralts continues, &quot;We can play Tag! Tag is a fun game to play, I promise not to use my Psychic attack to make you not move if you want to play Tag!&quot; Doing a backflip in midair, the Ralts then looks to you, wondering which of the two choices it had presented to you you will chose.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: yellow"><b>Wayne:</b> Giving your orders to your Bulbasaur, it begins to move into action in order to carry out your attacking orders. Opening its mouth, a flurry of glowing green particles rush forth, flying through the air at the behemoth. The Electabuzz attempts to move out of the way of the strike, but the widespread characteristic of Bullet Seed causes it still to get hit by some of the attack, doing a small amount of damage. The Electabuzz roars in disdain, its fist beginning to crackle with electrical energy as tendrils of electricity wrap around it, the yellow Pokemon preparing a Thunder Punch attack. <br />
<br />
As the electric type runs forward to attack, Bulbasaur watches vigilantly, waiting for the chance to dodge Electabuzz's attack. As it swings its fist at the grass type, Bulbasaur nimbly jumps out of the way, Electabuzz's fist passing through the air where Bulbasaur was just seconds before. Roaring in anger again, the Electabuzz's prongs each begin to crackle with electricity, before the electrical currents join between them, spawning a bolt of electricity which flies downward, aimed at Bulbasaur. Bulbasaur manages to dodge the majority of the strike, though it does still get hit a bit and takes minor damage. Concentrating, Bulbasaur's bulb glows white for a few seconds before it sends a yellow-orange beam of energy up into the skies, which clear of the few clouds that had been overhead, but you do notice that the dark clouds of the infamous Ion Island thunderstorm still remain in the distance, rather curiously due to Bulbasaur's attack. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorchid"><b>Shinjara and Sasuke:</b> Deciding to head into the middle cavern, which is bathed in an intense crystal-blue light, your eyes widen in amazement as you walk though the cavern. A few meters ahead of you is a <i>massive</i> crevice in the earth, the cavern expanding quickly to accomadate such a crevice into a large room, though the ceiling is rather low. In front of you, a Feraligatr, a Blastoise, and a Swampert each send an erratic beam of ice from their mouths to strike the opposite end of the cavern, slowly moving toward themselves to form an ice bridge over the cavern. A man watches over their progress, but does notice you, and immediately moves over to you, beginning to speak to you instantly in a hushed voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have come at an opportune time for yourselves, you will witness the capture of the largest beast on the entire Venom Island. My efforts, they shall finally pay off...They called me a fool, they ridiculed me for believing in legend, but I knew the second I found this Fissure that this Pokemon was real...the giant Nidoking of Venom Isle! If you wish to join me and possibly assist me in my journey you will be rewarded well, what say you?&quot;<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorchid"><b>John's Knight:</b> Impressed by the Ursaring's performance in the battle so far, you decide that a defensive tactic will help you in your effort. Golem closes its eyes for a moment, causing the Ursaring to clench its teeth in anger, and it rushes toward the Golem, its claw glowing a cerulean blue as it smacks the Substitute across the head, what would have done good damage to the real Golem. Almost as though the attack never happened, the substitute immediately thrusts its fist into the Ursaring's stomach, the Rock Smash attack causing the Ursaring to roar in pain as the attack makes contact.<br />
<br />
Eyes filled with fury, the Ursaring's fist begins to glow a bright blue color as it pulls it back, quickly punching into the substitute with a fully powered<br />
Focus Punch attack. Almost immediately upon impact, the substitute shatters into many pieces which fade before they even touch the ground. The Ursaring's eyes grow large in a mixture of surprise and fury before it is struck in the back with several rocks which the real Forte had dislodged from the ground, which pound the normal type and cause some rather large bruises to form. Looking severely beaten, Ursaring could be taken out soon, but it looks like it's ready to rip out Forte's internal organs and then forcefeed them to it. How will you approach this situation?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorchid"><b>Lonely Wanderer:</b> Deciding to head toward the middle tunnel rather than one of the other ones which showed no indication of anything interesting that lied within them. Ducking your head as you enter the tunnel, you find yourself in a room, smaller than the last one. You see a boy, no older than 15, with his Quilava, who appears to be using a barrage of different fire attacks against a Grimer, who winces in pain as the flames make contact with it. Sighing and realizing that the orange light, which had held so much promise for an adventure, was simply a Pokemon.<br />
<br />
The boy looks up at you for a second, before he shakes his head, ordering his Quilava to use a Flamethrower attack on the Grimer. Watching interestedly, you suddenly are surprised as a cold sensation is felt on the back of your leg. Quickly turning around in surprise, you see another Grimer, looking up at you interestedly. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: silver"><b>lilbluecorsola:</b> The man looks at you for a moment, before he shrugs, nodding and taking the book back from you, closing it and putting it back onto the shelf. Michael then follows you as you walk by the people and out the door, stepping into the sun, but you are amazed as what has happened in just the few moments you had stood inside the Pokemon center.<br />
<br />
Even more Tentacool have gathered at the harbor, extending over 20 feet from the shoreline out into the ocean. Along the beach, which is now completely deserted, several Pokemon lay on the sand, a Psyduck and a pair of Poliwhirl to be more precise. Large red marks that look like they were inflicted by tentacles cover a large section of these Pokemon's bodies, who lay motionless on the beach. A voice from behind you startles you as you gaze upon the Pokemon, &quot;Excuse me, could you both assist me?&quot; Turning around, you see Nurse Joy from the Pokemon Center with a Blissey and a stretcher sitting on her left and right respectively. &quot;We need to get any of these stranded Pokemon out of here as soon as possible. The Tentacool will begin to lay their eggs soon and if these Pokemon get caught in high tide...&quot; her voice trails off, but shakes her head and continues to speak in an urgent voice, &quot;We can't handle them. The poison in the Tentacool's stingers will poison anyone who comes into even the slightest amount of contact with it, so we'll need a Pokemon with telekinetic powers - you know, something that can lift things with a psychic attack, such as Confusion or Psychic.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michael pulls a pair of Pokeballs from his belt, but after a few seconds reattaches them. &quot;My Swellow and my Elekid won't be any help, and my other Pokemon are at Professor Oak's lab. I don't know if I have enough time to call on my Golduck, so if you have any Pokemon with psychic powers, could you try to get this one?&quot; What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: silver"><b>P/Arts:</b> You push &quot;Complete Registration&quot; on the screen, and a loading screen comes up, a bar steadily filling with a green coloring from left to right. After the bar fills completely, the screen changes to the following:<br />
<br />
Thank you for completing your registration for the Brine Island Gym Challenge. There are currently <b>0</b> trainers in front of you in the queue to battle this gym leader. When the above counter reaches <b>0</b>, please enter one of the elevators and exit at the field labelled <b>Ruin Island Battling Field - Sub-Level 5.</b> The Gym Leader has received notice and awaits your challenge. <br />
<br />
Scanning the area with your eyes, you see several elevators lined up against a far wall. Walking over to them, you push down arrow button and wait until one of the opaque doors of an elevator opens. Walking in, you wait in the empty elevator as it begins to sink downward, the light above the door switching from G to -1, -2, -3, -4, and finally -5. Stepping out of the elevator, you walk down a short hallway before you walk through a sliding door. <br />
<br />
Before you, a room you estimate at about 50ft x 50ft x75ft completely filled with a light fog stands. You make out a figure on the opposite end of the field and as the door shuts behind you, a harsh voice calls out to you, &quot;I see that you are my only challenger as of now. Very interesting, though not surprising, as you are my first challenger in quite some time...But I digress. My name is Claire, and our battle shall be a 3 on 3 single one, with no switching allowed. I shall send out my Houndoom first.&quot; In a flash of light, the form of a Houndoom appears in the middle of the field. &quot;Who shall you send out, then?&quot;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: teal"><b>Faiyaa:</b> Giving your orders to Scurvy for his first battle, he nods as he moves into action. Teeth bared, the Rattata stares it down, before it calls its name, quickly jetting forward and sinking its teeth into Scurvy's arm. Wincing a bit, Scurvy's right fist glows white as it swings it at the Rattata, striking it hard in the midsection, causing it to shriek in pain as it is thrown from the Aipom's arm, a few feet away into a wall. Shaking the strike off, the Rattata stares Scurvy down, waiting for it to preempt attack, which it does.<br />
<br />
Its fist begins to crackle with electrical energy as yellow tendrils of electricity begin to wrap around it as the purple monkey runs forward, ready to strike the Rattata for a second dose of revenge after its attack. However, at the <i>last</i> possible moment, the Rattata jumps out of the way with the aid of what appears to be a Quick Attack, jumping into the air and landing atop Scurvy's head, holding on for its life onto the opponent purple mammal Pokemon. Shaking its head as hard as it can attempting to get the little rodent off of its head, Scurvy shrieks in frustration as it doesn't manage to. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: teal"><b>Skrusti and Joshua:</b> Giving your orders to your Pokemon, they quickly nod and begin to move into action, seeing that both they and the Gyarados are beginning to wear out from the battle. As Hayley remains suspended motionless in midair, Tifa opens its mouth wide, a flurry of small green particles bursting forth and striking the Gyarados's hide, causing it to roar in pain as it quickly turns its attention from Hayley to Tifa. Hayley drops a few feet before it can regain control of its wings, circling back up to gain altitude. Opening its mouth, several Sludge Bombs begin to float through the air toward the Gyarados, who has its sights set on Tifa and Jamie, sending a gushing stream of water from its mouth in the form of a Hydro Pump at the pair, though they manage to dodge it in <i>just</i> the nick of time. <br />
<br />
The sludge bombs then make contact with the giant Gyarados, exploding across the back of its head. Turning around to face its attacker, it finds that it is nowhere to be found, having Faint Attacked behind its head, causing it to become slightly confused. However, Jamie begins to swim toward the Gyarados as electrical energy begins to gather in one of Tifa's fists, while one of Hayley's fists also begin to glow with crackling yellow electrical energy, both the signs of a Thunder Punch attack. As they move in toward the Gyarados, the Gyarados turns around to find its opponents but it is much too late for it to react, as both Hayley and Tifa unload their Punch attacks on the Gyarados, who roars in pain, shaking its head and gritting its teeth as the electricity courses through the water types body. It falls down into the water, and for a brief moment, it appears as though you had won. However, after a few seconds the Gyarados rises from the water again, looking extremely beaten, having only just Endured the attacks it had sustained. What will you do to finish it off?</span></span></div>

Tetsu snapped, having come up with a good strategy. &quot;Ok, Smokestack. Listen closely! Start by making the <b>Day Sunny</b>! This'll give you a good boost.

<span style="color: green"><b>Alilatias:</b> You give your orders to your Pokemon, you both begin to move into action almost immediately. Saito begins to glow a bright white as a blinding light illuminates the entire area. Shielding your eyes from the brunt of the attack, you lower your hand to see the Electabuzz, Magcargo, and one of the Swellow looking around blindly, apparently having all been blinded by Saito's attack. One of the other Swellow, who had apparently not been blinded, begins to flap its wings in the direction of the Electabuzz, the ensuing Icy Wind causing the Electabuzz to shiver from the cold before it turns to look in Faltzer's direction. <br />
<br />
Electricity again charging up in the Electabuzz's prongs, it quickly lets a series of small tendrils out in the form of a stream toward Faltzer. Managing to fly out of the way, it suddenly moves between several locations, 3 more of the bird Pokemon appearing at its side, a grand total of 3 clones, 1 Substitute, 1 Breloom, and 3 Swellow taking on the Electabuzz and the Magcargo. <br />
<br />
As Saito runs forward to attack the Magcargo with an Ice Punch, the Substitute and the other Swellow - indistinguishable from each other, both jet in to strike Electabuzz from different angles, causing it to roar as its fist begins to crackle with electrical energy, swinging and striking one of the wild Swellow. The Swellow merely fizzles from sight as it is struck, the Substitute fading. Swinging its own fist of ice energy, Saito punches into the Magcargo's shell. The snail merely sits there, doing nothing at all in retaliation. Slightly confused, Saito nonetheless pulls its other fist up, crackling with electrical energy. Swinging it into the side of Magcargo, the rock-fire Pokemon winces considerably, but doesn't make a counter attack.<br />
<br />
As Faltzer begins to glow a bright white, the other two Swellow notice and begin to as well, ready to attack with their Sky Attacks in a single trio of strikes. As though it was waiting for this moment, even though it is blinded, fire begins to surround Magcargo's entire body. Saito takes a few steps backward from the heat as Magcargo opens its mouth wide, a stream of superheated air rushing forward in a Heat Wave attack. The three Swellow fight through the heat (with Faltzer's clones disappearing) while Saito closes its eyes and grits its teeth. However, the Electabuzz is struck as well, and upon its roar of pain the Magcargo immediately stops. The attack gone, the three Swellow strike Electabuzz hard, sending it flying back into a tree. However, after a few seconds, it does manage to get back up, though it is extremely weak. What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Green">&quot;Not giving any commands to your Pokemon, huh? It looks we're about to put a stop to your plans!&quot;<br />
<br />
Soruta may have said that, but she knew that whoever that person was wasn't just about to let both of his Pokemon get defeated that easily. He probably had something else up his sleeve, but regardless, all of her attention needed to be focused on the Marcargo and the Electabuzz. Wiping away the sweat from her forehead that trickled down her face during the Marcargo's Heat Wave attack, she looked up to see the three Swellow flying overhead.<br />
<br />
&quot;...And after all this, I STILL can't figure out which one is Faltzer...&quot;<br />
<br />
The time for action was now. Seeing as the Marcargo's Heat Wave attack struck everything in the area, the next attack might be worse. The best way to defend against such an attack would be to prevent it altogether. But how? Soruta didn't have time to think, for the battle was moving at a very fast pace.<br />
<br />
&quot;Faltzer! The Electabuzz is almost down! Go prepare yourself with your <b>Focus Energy</b>, then release a <b>Shadow Ball</b>! Be careful with the attack if the other two Swellow are about to attack as well! Saito! Let's finish this quick! Power yourself up with a <b>Swords Dance</b>, then slam through the Marcargo's defenses with a <b>Brick Break</b>!&quot;<br />
<br />
As all of the Pokemon moved in to attack, Soruta shouted one final message to her Pokemon and the other two Swellow in the area.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Don't let up with your attacks, and give them hell!&quot;</i></span></span></div>

Teeth bared, the Rattata stares it down, before it calls its name, quickly jetting forward and sinking its teeth into Scurvy's arm. Wincing a bit, Scurvy's right fist glows white as it swings it at the Rattata, striking it hard in the midsection, causing it to shriek in pain as it is thrown from the Aipom's arm, a few feet away into a wall. Shaking the strike off, the Rattata stares Scurvy down, waiting for it to preempt attack, which it does.<br />
<br />
Its fist begins to crackle with electrical energy as yellow tendrils of electricity begin to wrap around it as the purple monkey runs forward, ready to strike the Rattata for a second dose of revenge after its attack. However, at the <i>last</i> possible moment, the Rattata jumps out of the way with the aid of what appears to be a Quick Attack, jumping into the air and landing atop Scurvy's head, holding on for its life onto the opponent purple mammal Pokemon. Shaking its head as hard as it can attempting to get the little rodent off of its head, Scurvy shrieks in frustration as it doesn't manage to. What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: teal">Biting his lip, Gary looked on in shock as the rattata wouldn't let go of Scurvy's head, who was dancing around, shrieking, as he tried to shake it off. However, a smile crept onto his face as a plan popped into Gary's head. &quot;Don't worry about a thing, Scurvy! A nice ol' <b>Counter</b> should be enough to shake the damn bugger off! And if it doesn't, that's gonna do a hella lot damage, right? Then I want you to use a nice <b>Thunder Wave</b> to pin it down, and finish up with a <b>Beat Up</b>!&quot; Gary then checked his other pokeballs, remembering he had a Typhlosion, Mantine, Wartotle, Houndoom, Ninjask, and Stantler on his active team. If all went well, that should be enough to deal a bit of damage to the rat. Still, trying to shake the rattata off, Scurvy eagerly prepared to use Counter.</span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: green"><b>Dark Scizor:</b> Giving your orders to Rakdos to move the log, it nods, flying over to the log as the Growlithe happily sprints over to the fallen tree. Putting its head up against the tree, the Growlithe pushes on the tree as your Scizor does as well, slowly moving little by little before it rolls off of the Paras, who gives a weak cry of joy before making a painful wincing motion. The boy sighs, and walks over to the bug/grass type, pulling out a small, brightly colored bottle and spraying it over the Paras, who stares up at the boy. The boy murmurs something to the Paras, but you can't hear what it is. As the Growlithe looks on with a concerned look on its face, suddenly a flurry of white needles fly past your face, lodging in a nearby tree. Quickly whipping around, you see an Ariados looking with its piercing eyes directly at you, seemingly ready to strike for no reason.<br />
<br />
The boy looks up at the Ariados, and stares at it for a few moments. He then says to you, &quot;You're going to need to take that thing down, I have to take care of this Paras. My Growlithe will help you - it's fully trained, I don't think that there are any moves that it would normally learn that it hasn't already. After you knock it out, I have a net in my pack, we can take it to the Red Forest, then.&quot; What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: Green">Saturn wondered why the boy told him that he was going to need Growlithe. It was a fire type, strong against bugs, but his own Pokémon was resistant to most of the types and has an inmunity to poison. Perhaps he underestimated Ariados. Perhaps it was the devil in the form of a spider. In that case, even with the number and type advantage, it would be a difficult fight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Growlithe, your trainer told me to use you to defeat Ariados so use your Helping Hand on Rakdos, my Scizor, to boost his power and then fire a Flamethrower at your foe. Rakdos, use Focus Energy followed by a Wing Attack on the enemy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Saturn wasn´t sure about Growlithe´s reaction but he knew that Rakdos wasn´t going to disappoint him. Afterall, the red bug was his starter Pokémon.</span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorchid"><b>John's Knight:</b> Impressed by the Ursaring's performance in the battle so far, you decide that a defensive tactic will help you in your effort. Golem closes its eyes for a moment, causing the Ursaring to clench its teeth in anger, and it rushes toward the Golem, its claw glowing a cerulean blue as it smacks the Substitute across the head, what would have done good damage to the real Golem. Almost as though the attack never happened, the substitute immediately thrusts its fist into the Ursaring's stomach, the Rock Smash attack causing the Ursaring to roar in pain as the attack makes contact.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorchid">Eyes filled with fury, the Ursaring's fist begins to glow a bright blue color as it pulls it back, quickly punching into the substitute with a fully powered </span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorchid">Focus Punch attack. Almost immediately upon impact, the substitute shatters into many pieces which fade before they even touch the ground. The Ursaring's eyes grow large in a mixture of surprise and fury before it is struck in the back with several rocks which the real Forte had dislodged from the ground, which pound the normal type and cause some rather large bruises to form. Looking severely beaten, Ursaring could be taken out soon, but it looks like it's ready to rip out Forte's internal organs and then forcefeed them to it. How will you approach this situation?</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #9932cc">Still, he knew that the Ursaring was very powerful, and he bet that all it wanted was to kill them. &quot;We'll have to give it all now...&quot; he thought.</span></span><br />

<span style="color: green"><b>quilava plush:</b> Releasing your Farfetch'd, Ahiru, outside of the cage, it listens intently as you give your orders, nodding as it flaps its wings a few times and begins to scan the area. Your heart lifts as you hear a slight jingling and Ahiru reappears, the keys at the top of its stick. Taking them, you try them one by one until you manage to find the correct key to the lock, clicking as it opens up. You climb out of the cage, and three of the Pokemon quickly rush out, though the Nidoran F cautiously moves out of the cage, eyeing the area for apparent signs of trouble. <br />
<br />
Looking around, you find that the tent you are in is sort of a storage area - large, unmarked boxes are piled up all around you. You hear a strange, muffled noise behind you, turning around to see that the Nidoran M, Ledyba, and Paras had all fallen asleep on the ground, a pair of Gloom the culprits. They move to attack, small blue powder starting to come from their petals, but Nidoran F, who hadn't fallen asleep, quickly issues a Supersonic attack upon the two Gloom, causing them to become confused, each sending the other to sleep rather than you. Thinking &quot;some guard,&quot; you turn to look at the other Pokemon, and see a Hypno glowing a bright purple as the energy from the sleeping Pokemon is drained into it. What will you do?</span><br />

</blockquote><span style="color: Green"><span style="font-size: 9px">The Hypno sapped the energy from the sleeping Pokemon, and Rivka stepped forward, knowing what she needed to do. She didn't want to start another ruckus, but if all else failed, she had to dispose of the psychic tapir quickly. &quot;Ahiru, keep an eye on our Nidoran friend, and once I distract this Hypno, try to wake the others up and escort them to a safe place. Meanwhile, we'll fight this thing off.&quot; With the click of another Pokeball being expanded, Rivka expelled the bright red energy from the orb that soon materialized into her Noctowl, Kagami. With a low hoot, the owl instantly knew how his services were needed and stared the Hypno down. Rivka figured that the yellow monster's psychic affiliation could easily extract the tactics from her head, so she took no heed to whispering her commands and simply told the Noctowl in a soft voice. &quot;Kagami, we need your skills to help us win this. Try to put it to sleep with your own <b>Hypnosis</b> so we can make a break for it, but if that fails then promptly create a <b>Substitute</b> and fire off a <b>Shadow Ball</b>.&quot; </span></span></div>

However, before it can get a Night Shade attack off, the Machamp whips around, its right arms looking as though they are engulfed in purple flame as they swing into the Xatu, sending it flying to the left and causing its Night Shade attack to miss its target completely. Apparently unblinded, the Machamp stares the Xatu down, who looks to have taken quite a hit from the strike.<br />
<br />
The Machamp smirks at Axtan, before striking the ground with its left foot. A dome of the same strange purple energy surrounds Axtan, before the dome disappears from view. Wondering what the heck that was supposed to do, Axtan shakes its head, taking to the skies as it would give it an easier time avoiding attacks from the strange Machamp. The two Pokemon stare each other down, Machamp vs. Xatu, Axtan awaiting its next attacking orders.</span></span>

What pleasantries, and here I am sampling this new anti-cancerious green tea. It is seemingly good for health,&quot; the xatu looked down towards its trainer, wondering what in blazes was he doing. &quot;Hi Axtan, keep it up. You are doing fine,&quot; its trainer then slurped the liquid from the small teacup, then smiled at himself. &quot;Xa, xa, xa,&quot; the xatu seems to be panting, as it has been on the air quite a while now. It needed to land, but was not sure whether to do so or not, as it was awaiting its trainer's next command. &quot;Xa, xa....xa,&quot; the xatu seems to be floating downwards slowly, as well as avoiding the machamp slowly.<br />
<br />
The trainer probably didn't see his xatu, &quot;I wonder what happens if I put this onto my hands, ooh, it would burn, would it not? That might be fun.&quot; &quot;XA!!!&quot; the xatu fell from the skies onto the ground and almost crashed onto its trainer's apparatus. Centin then looked at it, &quot;Oh right, I completely forgotten about you. We were in a battle right?&quot; The crashed xatu just layed down on the ground there. Its trainer then walked towards it, ignoring his apparatus and wanting to stroke that poor little xatu, &quot;Then in that case, let's continue what we started out with. Teleport away then use night shade when it is safe, from a distance. After successfully launching one, fly. I guess you should fly should the next night shade fail too, no? But, you understand yes right?&quot; The xatu stared its trainer in confusion, &quot;Xa?&quot;. Centin then stared back at it, &quot;Then mght I suggest to, um, improvise? I guess?&quot; His xatu then turned back to continue the action.</span></div>

As they move into action, now with Lily the Ludicolo fighting alongside Dunsparce, the Arbok glares them both down. As Lily allows Dunsparce to make the first attack on the Arbok this round, Dunsparce begins to glow a bright white as it lauches itself at its opponent, ready to strike with an Ancient Power attack. Arbok swiftly moves out of the way of the strike, only getting nipped on the side by the strike. Moving to the side rather disheartedly, the Dunsparce watches as Lily begins its assault on its opponent.<br />
<br />
Swiping the air with its left arm, several leaves fly from it toward the Arbok, who gets hit by the majority of them, but doesn't do all that much damage to the Arbok. Moving in for an attack for the first time, the Arbok opens its mouth wide, letting a flurry of needles fly toward Lily, who doesn't manage to dodge the attack and takes a pretty good hit from it. Nonetheless, Lily bounces back, rushing forward and swiping its hands across Arbok, though its lack of claws means that it doesn't do as much damage as it could of. Shrugging it off, Lily's right fist glows white as it punches into the Arbok, causing it to look around wildly, confused.<br />
<br />
Moving back into action, Dunsparce lunges at the Arbok again, attempting to Bite into it. However, Arbok easily dodges this strike, causing Dunsparce to fly past it. Quickly turning around to face Arbok, Dunsparce barely manages to dodge a flurry of needles from Poison Sting before it lunges into the air, giving a light tackle into Arbok's hood. Arbok still seems ready to fight, what will you do?</span></span>

As they move into action, now with Lily the Ludicolo fighting alongside Dunsparce, the Arbok glares them both down. As Lily allows Dunsparce to make the first attack on the Arbok this round, Dunsparce begins to glow a bright white as it lauches itself at its opponent, ready to strike with an Ancient Power attack. Arbok swiftly moves out of the way of the strike, only getting nipped on the side by the strike. Moving to the side rather disheartedly, the Dunsparce watches as Lily begins its assault on its opponent.<br />
<br />
Swiping the air with its left arm, several leaves fly from it toward the Arbok, who gets hit by the majority of them, but doesn't do all that much damage to the Arbok. Moving in for an attack for the first time, the Arbok opens its mouth wide, letting a flurry of needles fly toward Lily, who doesn't manage to dodge the attack and takes a pretty good hit from it. Nonetheless, Lily bounces back, rushing forward and swiping its hands across Arbok, though its lack of claws means that it doesn't do as much damage as it could of. Shrugging it off, Lily's right fist glows white as it punches into the Arbok, causing it to look around wildly, confused.<br />
<br />
Moving back into action, Dunsparce lunges at the Arbok again, attempting to Bite into it. However, Arbok easily dodges this strike, causing Dunsparce to fly past it. Quickly turning around to face Arbok, Dunsparce barely manages to dodge a flurry of needles from Poison Sting before it lunges into the air, giving a light tackle into Arbok's hood. Arbok still seems ready to fight, what will you do?</span></span>

Dunsparce, let's start off by using a Water Pulse at the same time as Razor Leaf, but from a different angle, so as not to deter Lily's attack. Then, fire an Ice Beam at it at the same time as Water Gun, once again from a different angle. Finally, unleash your...HIDDEN POWER PSYCHIC!!!

</blockquote><span style="color: darkorange">Hiroshi had a dilemma on his hands. He was presented with 2 AWESOME games in which he had no idea why they were fun and had no way in picking which one to play. He was confuzzled and stuck. He then decided that playing tag would be more fun that playing hide and go seek because hide and go seek takes too much energy, which Hiroshi seemed to lack these days. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, lets play tag! How about I let out the rest of my Pokemon to make the game even more fun, eh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hiroshi reached into his pockets and let out all his Pokemon: a Sneasel, a Golduck, a Combusken, a Zangoose, and a Phanpy. Yuna was already out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok then! Now, to choose who is it...&quot; Hiroshi decided to take a chance. &quot;Hey Ralts, do you wanna choose who is it? That way, it can be fun for all of us!&quot;</span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: deepskyblue"><b>thed3:</b> Dialing the number on the phone, you hold your breath as the phone begins to ring, sighing in relief as a woman's voice sounds in the receiver. &quot;Hello?&quot; she asks, in an almost frightened tone, &quot;Can I help you?&quot; You quickly begin to speak, telling the woman of the Totodile and the Marill and the strange, small red welt which had appeared on each of them. After you finish your summary, the woman's tone instantly changes to a grave, urgent one. &quot;You didn't leave any of your Pokemon near the lake, did you?&quot; Responding with a negative, the woman sighs in relief before she ends the call with a few words. &quot;I am sending help immediately. DO NOT GO NEAR THE LAKE. An explanation of what is happening will be provided to you as soon as we can get there from our base on Brine Island.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman hangs up the phone and ends the call. After a few minutes of waiting and scanning the seas, you finally see a small motorboat rushing toward the island, a Nurse Joy and a few other people both men and woman inside. They dock, and wasting no time they rush over to you. Nurse Joy, whose voice you recognize as the one on the phone, turns to you. &quot;These Pokemon are in need of immediate care, and therefore I will need to attend to them immediately. Aaron will describe what's happening to the best of his ability.&quot; One of the men, with sandy blonde hair, roughly 5' 08&quot;, shrugs. The others all crowd into the elevator, and ascend to the top of the crater.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now then...&quot; he says in a friendly, conversational tone, &quot;I wasn't ever much of a doctor, so they always have me do the explaining. Anywhere, where to start...&quot; He looks up to the sky. &quot;Every year about this time, Pokemon appear on the beach, writhing in inexplicable pain with small welts on their bodies. We haven't been able to figure out what causes this, but there are several theories that people have. The first, foremost, and that makes the most sense is that there is a rare breed of Tentacool which live in the lake, coming out this time of year. The Tentacool sting anything which come near them, the venom rushing through the Pokemon's body instantly. We haven't made a cure for this yet, and to do that, we would need the Tentacool to test it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man sighs, and looks up at the sky again. &quot;I think we should head up there, to see if they need any help. You in?&quot;</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: DeepSkyBlue">Hearing the man's explanation of what was happening still left Thed a bit puzzled. He asked himself why the other water pokemon didn't notice this pattern and just avoid the Tentacool for the period of time they were here? Why were the tentacool seemingly so vicious as to just attack anything within range? And why were these specific Tentacool's venom so potent? Thed didn't know the answers, but he was sure that he had to do something in order to help the pokemon. Thed then said solemnly, &quot;Let's go then... There's no time to waste.&quot; &quot;Papi!&quot; his little Caterpie chirped aloud. While walking along with Aaron Thed clipped Magneto's Sphere of Seraphim Pokeball onto his board shorts just in case anything happened...</span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px">Finally done.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: teal"><b>Skrusti and Joshua:</b> Giving your orders to your Pokemon, they quickly nod and begin to move into action, seeing that both they and the Gyarados are beginning to wear out from the battle. As Hayley remains suspended motionless in midair, Tifa opens its mouth wide, a flurry of small green particles bursting forth and striking the Gyarados's hide, causing it to roar in pain as it quickly turns its attention from Hayley to Tifa. Hayley drops a few feet before it can regain control of its wings, circling back up to gain altitude. Opening its mouth, several Sludge Bombs begin to float through the air toward the Gyarados, who has its sights set on Tifa and Jamie, sending a gushing stream of water from its mouth in the form of a Hydro Pump at the pair, though they manage to dodge it in <i>just</i> the nick of time. <br />
<br />
The sludge bombs then make contact with the giant Gyarados, exploding across the back of its head. Turning around to face its attacker, it finds that it is nowhere to be found, having Faint Attacked behind its head, causing it to become slightly confused. However, Jamie begins to swim toward the Gyarados as electrical energy begins to gather in one of Tifa's fists, while one of Hayley's fists also begin to glow with crackling yellow electrical energy, both the signs of a Thunder Punch attack. As they move in toward the Gyarados, the Gyarados turns around to find its opponents but it is much too late for it to react, as both Hayley and Tifa unload their Punch attacks on the Gyarados, who roars in pain, shaking its head and gritting its teeth as the electricity courses through the water types body. It falls down into the water, and for a brief moment, it appears as though you had won. However, after a few seconds the Gyarados rises from the water again, looking extremely beaten, having only just Endured the attacks it had sustained. What will you do to finish it off?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: teal">Jeff watched as the trio of Pokemon continued to attack the behemoth Gyarados, who roared in pain as the moves struck their marks again and again. Jeff was a little worried when the Gyarados used its <b>Hydro Pump</b>, but Jamie, and in essence Tifa, evaded the attack at the last second.<br />
<br />
Jeff let out a cheer as Tifa and Hayley assaulted the Gyarados with a double whammy of <b>Thunderpunch</b>, and as the two swam towards him, he thought of something to quickly put the giant down. Strategies raced in his head, and when the two arrived, he held up a hand to show he wasn't ready to give orders yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right...that thing'll probably be dangerous to get close to, so let's stay away from it and barrage it from long range. Tifa, hit it with a few more <b>Bullet Seed</b>s, if you're able, <b>Mega Drain</b>.&quot; Tifa nodded, her breathing still light, not having done much this battle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jamie, concentrate on evading anything it might try to throw at you. Uh...Hit it with a <b>Water Pulse</b> or two if you get the chance. But your job firstly and foremost is to dodge, got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie also nodded, and began to move slowly back towards Gyarados. Jeff looked on, hoping that most of the fight was out of this thing. He also wondered what had caused it to grow in size, and what had caused it to go so berserk...</span></div>
