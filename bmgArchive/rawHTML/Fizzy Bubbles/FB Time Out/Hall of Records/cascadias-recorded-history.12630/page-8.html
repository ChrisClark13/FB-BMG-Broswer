</blockquote><span style="color: darkorange">The waiting had been unbearable, Stu had been travelling for a while but Ruin Island never seemed to get any closer, until now. He was finally there, Ruin Island. It was clearly ancient, eroded buildings, overgrown vegetation and a certain eerie feeling covered the place, however this didn't bother Stu he just thought to himself &quot;Like. Totally. Fine.&quot; trying to reassure himself about his safety. He grabbed the Pokeball with a snazzy bolt of lightning design on it and threw it into the air, releasing his Magneton who went by the names of Lefty, Righty, Downy, Uppy and Felty. Stu smiled as he looked over to the Magneton who seemed to display some confusing emotions ranging from stunned to boredom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Downy....or Uppy...erm Lefty...or Felty....and Righty, we're here at Ruin Island and we're gonna have a great time girlfriends!&quot; Stu shouted staring at the Magneton trying to figure out who exactly was who, as Downy and Uppy where occupied the same magnet, usually Stu's Magneton had Lefty and Righty at the top and Downy at the bottom and when the third magnet was on top was when Uppy was in control, this wasn't too often but Uppy was ruthless and evil unlike Downy who was nothing but a troubled teen who just wanted some alone time away from his brothers. Lefty and Felty on the other hand, where idenical practically, so it was difficult to tell them apart and Righty of course had no other ego but he made it his life’s mission to steal Lefty and Felty's Chocolate Milk, much to the annoyance of Stu. Stu then turned to the guidebook he had of Cascadia and began to wonder what area of Ruin Island to head...they all seemed to ancient and mystic but two stuck in his head. The Amor Temple and the Ordial Shrine....the temple was ancient and overrun with Psychic Types, yet the Ordial Shrine had a dreamy feel to it which could lead to some fun. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I'll go to the temple....maybe meet some interesting Psychic and Dark Pokemon....but hopefully I won't make a wrong step,&quot; Stu murmured to himself as he walked one step forward and looked both ways, already cautious of his choice to go to the temple.</span></div>

</blockquote>Note: Thanks Jeri ^.^ Like totally <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite7" alt=":p" title="Stick Out Tongue    :p" data-shortname=":p" /><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #FF9900">&quot;That BAS-bitch...&quot; Stu spluttered out but quickly corrected his language as he noted Downy was with him and didn't want to spread any language to the trouble teen. The choice was seemingly difficult, the area around him was stone, cold, dark and who knew what else but Stu just sighed as he looked in each direction the path could leave, but also annoyed about the Drowzee and its evil mind games. He looked over at Downy and stuck out his fist. &quot;Rock, Paper, Scissors,&quot; he said calmly because then the person who won could lead them down whichever path they chose. Stu moved his fist up and down once, twice and three then shouted &quot;Shoot!&quot; as he stuck out two fingers to make the sign for scissors but nothing happened, the Magneton and the current three personalities just looked up at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Argh, that plan was a like totally full proof one! Lefty, Righty, Downy why did you guys not play along girlfriends?&quot; he screamed as the Magneton was clearly beginning to get annoyed as Stu quickly turned around to face their paths once again. The Magneton wasn't going to take anymore, there was a strange crackle as Stu looked back around and could see the Magneton pulsing with electricity at this time....Stu's face dropped as there was a surge of pain through his body and he let out a loud scream. After falling to the ground and shutting his eyes to avoid eye contact with Downy he opened them up to see the Magneton floating casually around. Obviously, he hadn't been on the floor for long. &quot;Sorry,&quot; Stu swiftly said to break the silence as Downy and co. just blinked as a symbol of forgiveness for Stu shouting at them. But of course the problem still remained of which way to travel and Rock, Paper, Scissors wasn't going to get them out of this one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Magne....(Spin)&quot; the Magneton's mechanical voice came making Stu wonder for a second, maybe that could work. He pointed directly at the centre, kept one foot on the ground and used the raised one to push him around in a circle. Eventually he stopped, after getting rid of the dizziness, he found himself point right so he nodded at Downy and they decided to head that way.</span></div>

<br />
<span style="color: Orange"><b><u><div style="text-align: center">~Ruin Island~&#8203;</div></u></b>Amor Temple; Torkoal Stu – Deciding to take the path to the right, you head down the corridor, hopefully perusing the Drowzee who knocked you out earlier. Walking for a while with your Magneton at your side, the hall eventually grows in size, getting wider and the ceiling raises and you realize that you’re in a different chamber of the temple. The room is fairly dark save a few shafts of light which seep in through the holes in the ceiling. Looking around, you find the room to be mostly empty other than yourselves. Before you get a chance to go much further though, you espy some writing on the wall that is lit by a ray of light coming from above. Slowly, you approach it, and squint to see what is on the wall. The letters are foreign to you, but seem to resemble the alphabet, and you can pick out the occasional similarity.<br />
<br />
“Are you familiar with Unown writing?” a voice asked from behind.<br />
<br />
A little shocked, you turn and Downy and co. about face to see where the voice came from. You both take a fighting stance, only to see a smiling man behind you, and the Drowzee from earlier.<br />
<br />
“Hey!” you say, “That’s the Drowzee that attacked me earlier!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, him?” the man asked, gesturing towards the snout-nosed Pokémon next to him, “That’s not a surprise. He’s a mischievous creature.” He turns towards the Drowzee as second, and says something to it. Understanding, it nods, and suddenly begins to glow brightly, filling the room with a soft light. Now able to see clearer, you get a good look at the man. He looks to be in his early 30’s, and has a round, youthful face and a head of dirty blond hair. He has his hands in the pockets of his tan hiking vest, and wore khaki colored cargo pants, along with a pair of hiking boots.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I guess I should introduce myself.” The man said at last, “I’m Ray Lithia. I’ve been studying this area for a little while now. Apologies for my Drowzee’s behavior; this isn’t the first time he’s wandered off and spooked a few people. You are?” Ray holds out a kind hand and offers to shake.<br />
<br />
You take it and tell him your identity, as well as introduce your wacky Magneton.<br />
<br />
“Interesting. I didn’t know a Pokémon could have multiple personalities… Well, regardless, would you like me to read you what the wall says?” Ray asks. You think, might as well, and say yes. Approaching the wall to get a better view, he begins.<br />
<br />

“Most say that this refers to the ancient legend of a malicious spirit that once ravaged the land. It tore down crops, destroyed villages, and killed people. However, great beasts sealed away the creature and scattered the pieces needed to summon the spirit again amongst the islands. The statue was moved to this temple and many traps and trials were put in place to protect it. Most people said that it didn’t exist, but I think I’ve found it. I was just on my way there when I ran into you. Would you like to come with me?”<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: DarkOrange">Ricco had heard about the legends of Ruin Island. About how it was once sunken underwater and how many evil and sinister Pokemon inhabit this Island. Still, Ricco wanted to start here before going to the other Islands. The ferry from his hometown drops him off at Ruin Island. From there, he makes his way towards the more haunting areas. He begins at Elegy Field, where fallen humans are now Ghost Pokemon and the dead lives on...maybe.<br />
<br />
Ricco presses onward with thoughts on his mind, especially what he can expect. Ricco wasn't a fan of terror, but this place interested him a lot. He continues onward to the graveyard before him. As he approaches the entrance, he had no clue what he would encounter in there. By that time, he was getting a little scared, and like before, he was never a big fan of spooky places, but this place interested him the most, so it was worth it.<br />

How he had ended up in such a grim and dangerous place, Tetsu didn't know, but he was here now, and he didn't see much of a way out. Not to long ago, the boy was wandering through the woods, trying to find his way to the Diamond River, and, somewhere along the path, he took a wrong turn, putting himself in this situation. Where he was or how to get back was a mystery to Tetsu now, so now, all he could do was rely on his sense of direction to guide himself out of <b>The Red Forest</b>. He could only hope, however, that he could make it out unscathed.</span></div>

<b><span style="color: silver">Salin City </span></b>- The only real city in the entire island chain, Salin City is huge. Taking up the entirety of Brine Island, Salin City has everything-from shopping places, to schools, hospitals, a Pokemon Center, an airport, and a seaport, among other things. There is a small park in the middle, with a fishing pond and a few trees scattered about. Stands line the streets wishing to sell you things, and it'd be pretty hard to not find something to do. But if you would happen to find yourself in such a dilemma, there is a Pokemon Gym in the city which holds eight leaders, one each to symbolize the Cascadian Archipelago. However, only one may be challenged per visit to the gym. </span>

<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: silver"><span style="font-size: 9px">&quot;Finally..I'm here.&quot;<br />
This line was said by a young man standing in the middle of Salin City, on Brine Island. He had just arrived here after a fairly long journey by ship from a faraway region. During the trip, Lee had mostly studied a brochure about Cascadia, about the archipelago and the different islands it was made of. It seemed really hard to believe that such diverse islands could exist so close to each other. Glacier Island, Venom Island..all of them seemed very appealing to Lee. Brine Island normally wouldn't have been his first pick, but as he studied the description of the city closer, he saw one thing that evoked his curiosity, the sole thing that made him make the journey here: there was a gym here.<br />
Ever since Lee started out as a Pokemon trainer, it has been his dream to challengy a gym leader one day. Battling was always the aspect he liked the most about being a trainer, and he has participated in many battles so far - some of them quite challenging, but Lee felt like he and his Pokemon haven't had the need to tap into their full potential yet. A gym leader however would require that, so Lee thought. This was probably going to be a tough and long battle, for both him and his Pokemon - but it was why he came here in the first place, and he was gonna go through with it. He had his strongest partners with him - if he ever had a chance to win a gym badge, it was right here, right now.<br />
And so, without looking back, Lee made a step forward and started walking through Salin City, his destination firmly in mind: the gym.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange"><i><span style="font-size: 12px">Ruin Island</span></i></span><br />
One of the more interesting areas of the archipelago, Ruin Island is also the most mysterious. Giant stone statues and buildings, eroded by time, stand in the overgrowing vegetation of the area, providing a home to many Pokemon, especially those who prefer dark, enclosed spaces. Studies done by researches show that this island was once under water, or flooded, or something. At the very least, they have established that it is the oldest of the areas. An eerie feel of foreboding rushes over one the second they set forth on the land, provoking myths and legends...<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: darkorange">Ordial Shrine </span></b>- Dubbed as so by explorers, the Ordial Shrine is, or was, at least, a stone shrine used by the ancient peoples to honor their gods. The rock is stained red with the blood of those sacrificed for the ancients' rituals.</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: darkorange"><span style="font-size: 9px">The sea was calm, waves lapping up against the beach almost lovingly. A Ferry chugged along slowly, stopping shy of the golden sands, its bold and bright surface glistening with sprayed with droplets of salt water. Steps gently lowered to the ground below and excited trainers rushed off, heading in all directions. One trainer was left standing at the exit to the Ferry. The young woman stared off in one direction, and as she looked up you could see a glazed look over the normally vibrant sapphire eyes. She had received some strange looks from the other trainers aboard the ferry but with the way she was dressed and the way she held herself it wasn’t surprising. The black hood of her short breast-length jacket was pulled over her face with a purple symbol of the ghosts in its centre, the few strands of brown and black hair that escaped were tousled gently by the wind, the same wind that caressed her bare skin. Her grey shorts hugged her legs and her low cut silver top seemed to provide no warmth in the youthful evening. <br />
<br />
Without as much as a word she moved forward, descending the steps with a graceful agility, one you wouldn’t assume of someone with such a look in their eyes. She reached the bottom of the steps, her feet sinking slightly in the warm sand. The Ferry pulled off and she was left on the beach, the gentle waves splashing against her black ¾ length boots, the odd drop landing on her mid thigh-high stockings. A blink, a step, followed by another and she was standing on more stable ground. Her hand reached down to caress a pokeball on her black and silver belt that hung low on her hips. A loud pop echoed as the ball snapped open, the pokemon inside flying out with amazing speed into the ruins. A tilt of the head, and yet more steps heading off the beach and through the buildings and ruins that littered the island. The released pokemon flittered in and out, never in one place for long; a purple blur here and there. <br />
<br />
Soon after a short walk in silence, the only sounds being the beat of leathery wings and the woman’s black half skirt flapping behind her as she walked they arrived at a large stone structure, worn by age. The glazed look in her eyes appeared to diminish for a moment as she looked upon the rock with something akin to recognition. The purple blur reappeared flying above its trainers shoulder. The Zubat looked enthralled and circled the rock squealing in delight at the blood splatter still present on its surface. <br />
<br />
“Oh this place reeks of death. The blood, oh it sings to me of torment and torture. The Gods, the Gods they demand the screams; they demand life rich and tasty. Mommy has brought me to such a wonderful playground.” Drusilla chanted and clucked; an amusing noise for a bat and flittered around the rock. Stacey bent down and ran her fingers along the blood stains, enjoying the feel of the stone beneath her fingertips, tracing the pattern with care.</span></span></div>

You arrive in the Elegy Fields, but despite the creepiness that you feel from first arriving you traverse forward just wanting to find anything interesting. You walk around graves, which lead to large ominous gates that lead to more graves. It becomes quite tiring walking and walking when suddenly a small growl comes from behind you. You turn around and a little Vulpix just sits there staring at you. It growls at you again with little innocent eyes. As you try to approach it the Vulpix cautiously backs away from you, but then stops and sits back down, which kind of surprises you and causes you to stop in your tracks. Its eyes then begin to glow an eerie blue as it stares at you and you hear what sounds like a young boy’s voice in your head. It says, “Please help me find my treasure mister. I really need to find it before it’s too late.” The Vulpix then looks past you and you follow it’s gaze past you and see some lights off in the distance. As you ask what the treasure is you look back to the Vulpix, but it’s gone. You wonder if what you went through just now really happened, but suddenly you hear a loud bang and subsequent screams come from where the lights are. What will you do?</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver"><b>Lee-san - Salin City</b> <i>Reply in silver</i><br />
Knowing full well where you want to go within Salin City you quickly skim over the map and get your bearings and head off toward the gym facility. You pass by the malls, parks, and other attractions that Salin City has to offer without a second doubt in mind. Soon enough you are in front of the Gym; a huge and wide building with the word ‘Gym’ right on the front above the plexiglass sliding doors. You enter the building a walk up to the reception desk where a cute girl in all white sits. She says, “Oh! Why, hello there. I assume you are here to challenge one of our eight gym leaders here at Salin City’s Pokemon Gym. Usually we allow you to choose which gym leader you would like to challenge, but unfortunately seven of the gym leaders are out doing important errands.”<br />
<br />
You give the reception girl a puzzled look, but she flicks her long white hair and continues without hesitation. “Our only gym leader in today battles with Bug type pokemon. His name is Warms, which I always tease him about sounding really close to worms and if you move the ‘S’ in his name to the front that it would spell ‘Swarm’. It’s all very coincidental heehee!” A sweat drop forms on your forehead at the girl’s weird comments and you hope she just gets to the point. “Well Warms is quite the trainer if you ask me and he always gives challengers a hard time despite Bug type pokemon not being considered a tier type. Well… if you feel like battling him all you need to do is go into the bright green door. Oh, yes make sure your first pokemon know what attacks it will do right away since Warms starts the battle off right when you enter the door.” She points at a door to your right side and you see the bright green door. “Also if you don’t mind putting down the stats of the pokemon you plan on using during the battle on this sheet.” You are about to speak up as she hands you the paper when she seemingly answers, “It’s a three-on-three match with single elimination,” and she smiles up at you with light blue gazing eyes, “Good luck if you decide to do battle.”<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: Orange">Ricco walks through the graveyard with thoughts racing through his head, but that wasn't going to stop him, no matter what would happen. Ricco soon hears a growl from behind him, so he turns to see a Vulpix behind him. It's cute little eyes state at him, but Ricco felt a little nervous; who knows what could pop up here. Ricco tries to pet it bit it backs away. All of a sudden, it's eyes begin to glow, causing Ricco to hear something.<br />
<br />
“Please help me find my treasure mister. I really need to find it before it’s too late.”<br />
<br />
Ricco didn't know if it was a hallucination or the Vulpix causing the voice. He looks over to where Vulpix was looking at, a lit area in the distance, causing him to wonder if that's where the treasure is.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me, is it over there?&quot; Ricco asked, still looking at the light and then turning back to him. &quot;And did you just talk to-&quot;<br />
<br />
Once he turns to the Vulpix, it wasn't there anymore. Ricco's fear turned from a slight nervousness to completely freaked out. It only gets worse when he suddenly hears a bang, followed by a few screams. Ricco grabs his Pokeball containing Kaio and holds it in front of him with his hands shaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kaio, I'll need you to protect me, just incase.&quot; he said. &quot;Once things go bad, I'll let you out and you use Water Gun. Hopefully, this won't get any worse than it already has.&quot;<br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver">Lee smiled at the reception girl as he took the sheet from her. &quot;Thank you. Now, let's see..&quot;<br />
Looking at the blank sheet in front of him, Lee's mind raced as he thought about which Pokemon to use in the gym battle. So his opponent was the Bug type leader..as that cute girl said, Bug type Pokemon weren't usually considered the strongest of the bunch. At first, Lee thought of tiny Weedle and Caterpie dwelling in peaceful woodlands..but soon after, he knew that Warms wasn't gonna use weak Pokemon like that. The more Lee thought about it, the more worried he became..there were a plethora of Bug types, and while some of them were weak, others possesed great physical strength or other tricky abilities..yeah, this battle wasn't gonna fight itself, it was gonna be pretty harsh. To counter the great variety of Bug types, Lee needed to choose a strong, versatile team as well..<br />
He knew he couldn't use his starter Pokemon, Ivysaur, because he would be at a disadvantage against almost all Bug types..but practically all of his other Pokemon were viable choices. After a while, Lee had finally made up his mind and made his decision, and thus filled out the sheet like this:<br />
<br />

After taking one last look at the list, he nodded and handed the sheet back to the girl. Remembering that she told him that his first Pokemon needed to know which moves it was gonna use in the first round, Lee reached for a Friend Ball at his belt and pressed the button on it, releasing his Geodude, Guts.<br />
The Rock type greeted his trainer with a loud cry of &quot;Geoo!&quot; and looked up to him expectantly. Kneeling down to his Pokemon, Lee said &quot;Ok Guts, listen up. We're here in the Salin City Pokemon Gym, and we're going up against Warms, the Bug type leader. I choose you as my first Pokemon to use in this battle, because you have the most experience in battling out of all my Pokemon, and your hard skin should help you against Bug types. Now then, the battle's gonna begin right when we step through that door over there, so I'll tell what I want you do to in the first round now. As soon as you're in the arena, go into a <b>Defense Curl</b> position and then go straight into a <b>Rollout</b>. First roll around in the arena a bit to build up speed and possibly avoid some attacks, and then roll straight at your opponent, whatever Pokemon that may be, and crash into it! Okay, do your best, I know you can do this!&quot;<br />
With that, Lee got up to his feet again, and after waving at the reception girl, he and Guts stepped up to the green door and walked through it to their first gym battle..</span></span></div>

Walking toward the source of the light you soon see that it's not just one light, but many lights. You hear more screams and you feel Kaio's pokeball jiggling. You look down at your pokeball and you can see Kaio ushering you to go faster. Getting the message you begin to run towards the lights and the area becomes clear that it is an incomplete carnival. Either it is being built or being taken down, but that at the moment doesn't matter because suddenly you see an Arcanine chasing a group of people and pokemon. You spring into action and send out Kaio. Kaio flips out the ball and immediately Water Guns the Arcanine hitting it's side. The Water Gun pushes the Arcanine into the side of a bumper car and right on impact the Arcanine disappears and a small cloud of leaves explode. You stare in confusion at where the Arcanine was and wonder where it went. Hearing chatter behind you, you turn around and see the group of people who were being chased, all of them covered in sweat.<br />
<br />
A skinny man around his 40's approaches you, &quot;Hey, thanks kiddo you saved our butts just now.&quot;<br />
You say that it was no problem and question him as to what just happened and the man explains.<br />
&quot;Well... I'm not too sure myself what just happened. But, there was another incident a couple of days ago with another wild pokemon just showing up out of nowhere and attacking people. I tried to have my Machoke handle the Arcanine, but the Arcanine was too swift and began chasing us instead. Last time the boss handled the pokemon, but our boss is getting more supplies for us so that we can get the carnival together. We've still got a lot more to do before we're finished. Hey, you wouldn't mind just staying around here and helping us out, would ya? You'd be able to go on all the rides and get all the treats ya want for free because we really need the help and protection.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span><br />

Mulling over which pokemon to use you make your choices that you feel can give you a victory over the Bug gym leader. Entering the green door you see the arena it is dark and yet you are able to see everything in the arena. The atmosphere is damp and the field is completely covered with wet moss and there are a couple of overgrown logs scattered around.<br />
<br />
You hear a sort of deep male voice, &quot;Heh, finally someone is here.&quot;<br />
Looking across the arena is a muscular young man in his mid-20's. Wearing a bright green tank top and the bug-maniac-esque shorts you look at him oddly. His build is much different than most other bug-maniacs, who are usually lean and skinny, he is masculine and it's apparent to his bulging arms and chest. You think to yourself gosh-darnit to stereotypes and stand in your designated platform as you see Guts go into action going into a Defense Curl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rock types, pssshh! Let's see how well your Geodude does. Let's go Surskit!&quot;<br />
Warms tosses out a Net Ball and out comes a cute little Surskit. The Surskit not needing any commands blows out Bubbles out Guts who sits in his defensive curl. Guts begins to spin his body forward and begins to Roll Out avoiding the Bubbles. He rolls around the arena splashing up water as he goes over the moss. Guts soon rolls at Surskit, but Surskit is able to avoid the attack by using an Agility. It glides across the moss in a display of quickness and you notice that it can maneuver itself as if it was skating on water. With the miss Guts uncurls himself and shakes his entire body trying to shake off the water from the moss he just roleld over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmmm... my gym's got your Geodude uncomfortable I see. Surskit Double Team and surround Geodude, then Bubblebeam!&quot;<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver">&quot;Ugh..talk about having a bad start. This might just get pretty troublesome for Guts..let's see what Dex has to say, maybe it'll help.&quot;<br />
While watching Guts uncurl himself, Lee took out his Pokedex and pointed it at Warms' Pokemon. It recited:<br />
<i>Surskit, the Pond Skater Pokemon. From the tip of its head, Surskit secretes an oil that enables it to walk on water as if it were skating.</i><br />
Watching Surskit, Lee got the impression that it didn't have much physical strength, contrary to Guts - it was rather the quick and agile type, and it had the type advantage. Furthermore, it was able to skate on the moss-covered floor. If Lee wanted to win this battle, he had to do..something. Something to turn Surskit's field advantage against it..<br />
But Lee was awakened from his thoughts by Warms' voice calling out to his Pokemon:<br />
&quot;Hmmmm... my gym's got your Geodude uncomfortable I see. Surskit Double Team and surround Geodude, then Bubblebeam!&quot;<br />
<br />
This looked like trouble..Guts couldn't defend against an attack if he didn't know where it was coming from, and it'd be fatal if Bubblebeam hit..this gym battle indeed was no pushover. Quickly, Lee thought of a strategy and, hoping it was gonna work, called out to his Geodude.<br />
&quot;Guts, quickly use <b>Dig</b> to escape underground - dig yourself a path some metres away, and hopefully you won't emerge in the middle of a bunch of Surskit clones. Then build up a <b>Light Screen</b> to block that Bubblebeam attack.&quot;<br />
Lee knew that only avoiding attacks and defending wasn't gonna be enough to win this battle, but it seemed like the best strategy for now - at least till he had a better plan..</span></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: Orange">Ricco didn't know what just happened; one minute the Arcanine was attacked, the next minute it was gone! He looks over at the people being chased within this rusty unbuilt carvinal, but Ricco wondered why they would build one in a place like this. Suddenly a man came up to Ricco and thanked him. He said that the Arcanine chased them around. He also asked for him to help, in exchange for free rides and food. Kaio's eyes glitter in happiness, but Ricco had mixed feelings.<br />
<br />
Ricco was a bit nervous, as well as excited. He wanted to help, if free anything was involved, but the risk of being scared half to death makes him a little worried about doing this. Kaio nudges him, showing that he knew as well that he needed to help them.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right.&quot; he said. &quot;A free Carnival, how can I refuse? Me and Kaio can help out as well, he's a good lifter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Swampert!&quot; Kaio said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Plus, if anything goes wrong, he can use his water attacks to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ricco looked around the carnival while waiting for an answer. It was going to be a little tough trying to protect everyone, but he wondered if he can do it with just Kaio.<br />
<br />
&quot;That and I have my other Pokemon to help me. So what can I do to help, besides act as a guard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ricco waited for a response, but he still couldn't shake off his goosebumps.</span></div>

With a totally different landscape from the first, Lily Island is the second largest of the archipelago. Completely covered with vegetation, this island was also formed by a volcano. However, erosion has taken this island down to almost flat, and giving many homes to all types of grass and bug Pokemon among others. Inside the dense jungle, which takes up about a half of the island, there is a very small lake. There are two different forests on the island, and you can tell when you've gone from one forest to another. Besides being divided by the Diamond River, some strange force causes them to have completely different climates as well...<br />
<b><span style="color: green">The Silver Forest</span></b> - The forest which takes up a bit more than half of the island, Silver Island is named for the silver veins the leaves are adorned with. A deciduous forest, you'll mainly see flying and bug types here, due to the lack of ground vegetation. There is a rest stop somewhere in the forest, helping trainers on their way.

<span style="color: green"> Beka stepped onto the shores of Lily Island, breathing in the fresh air. He released Montag, his Houndour, from his pokeball, and bent down to pet him. &quot;Hey boy, we're here! Lily Island. It's amazing, isn't it?&quot; Montag responded with a few short barks of joy, for he hadn't been out of his pokeball for some time now. &quot;Alright, Montag! Off we go to <b>The Silver Forest</b>!</span><br />

The thought of a free carnival experience has you and Kaio excited and you accept the old man's offer. Pleased with your acceptance the old man introduces himself as Cade and begins to put you to work. You and Kaio screw nuts in and fasten bolts on the different rides of the carnival. Cade then has you and Kaio wash the various life-sized fake pokemon for the Merry-Go-Round. Gee he's really making you earn this free carnival experience. Seems Cade is of high authority around here since you see him organizing and telling a lot of the other workers what to do as well.<br />
<br />
After washing all of the fake pokemon Cade comes up to you and Kaio and says that it is break time. Relieved at the thought of a break you both sigh. He smiles and says, &quot;Hey, since you'll be helping us may as well give you a tour so that you know which rides you'll want to ride first and such.&quot; With that you follow Cade and his Machoke al over the carnival grounds. He shows you a large Wailord ride which he explains people get inside and it swings back and forth, not exactly the most intimidating ride just don't eat anything before riding it he warns. Another ride appears to be an Octillery with at least 10 arms with seats at the tip of the arms, Cade explains the arms move up and down while the body spins around. One of the more interesting looks like a Blastoise shell. Cade shows you inside of the shell are seats along with border of the shell. People sit in the seats and the Blastoise shell spins around, eventually the Blastoise shell raises up and slowly but surely the shell will turn over and you will end up spinning upside down. Cade sure does know a lot about the carnival as you noticed and wonder how long he has been doing this.<br />
<br />
You, Cade, Machoke, and Kaio then come upon a huge tent. Cade smiles and says this tent is one of the main attractions of the carnival since many different shows happen here. You all go inside and the wooden stadium like seats are all empty and the ground is covered with hay. A huge wooden pole is at the center of the tent, obviously the main support of the tent. &quot;It's pretty grand,&quot; Cade says aloud as he looks around. &quot;It's even better when the whole tent is packed with people.&quot; Out of the corner of your eye you see something and look and see a Houndour at the top row of the wooden seats. You wonder how it got there when suddenly Cade gasps making you turn around and at the other side sits a Growlithe. They simultaneousl growl at you and then begin running down the steps of the seats.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span><br />

Not exactly liking how this battle was panning out you give orders to Guts. Just as the Surskit is able to create 4 clones of itself Guts furiously digs at the ground, moss and mud flying in the air. The Surskits surround Guts and blow their Bubblebeams at Guts, but thankfully he jumps into his whole and successfully evades the attack which all converge at the spot where he just was. The Surskits eye the entire arena and look at a specific spot and that is exactly where Guts pops out of the moss. You wonder how they were able to predict where Guts was and Warms speaks up, “Surskit’s feet are ultra sensitive to movement using vibrations in water to successfully evade predators. This little technique really helps it out in battles where the opponent has no way to get off the ground like your Geodude.” Guts concentrates and a golden Light Screen appears in front of him. The Surskits once again blow Bubblebeams at him, but the Light Screen absorbs the attacks. The Surskits glare at Guts behind the Light Screen.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may have evaded damage this time, but it won't be long before we creep past that defense of yours...&quot;<br />
<br />
Guts has used up some energy this round with Light Screen and it has taken a bit of a beating. It should be able to withstand a couple more solid hits before it shatters. Surskit still seems like it has a lot of energy and with 4 clones helping it out it could evade danger quite easily.<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: Orange">After the tough and hard work he had to do to get this free everything, Cade decided to show him around. Seeing the various rides made Kaio excited. It seems even with evolution and his fierce looks, he still had his joyful side. They four of them, including Cade's Machoke, who was with them too, go inside the tent.<br />
<br />
&quot;This looks so cool!&quot; Ricco said. &quot;What kind of performances go on here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Before he can get a response, he sees a Houndour right next to him within the stands. Ricco wondered how he got inside; he never saw it in here before. Cade gasps in shock, making Ricco look at him, wondering what he was surprised about. He suddenly sees a Growlithe along the side of the stands opposite to the Houndour. The two of them growl and start to charge at the four of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cade, you take the Growlithe, I'll take the Houndour! Kaio, fire off a <b>Muddy Water</b> at the Houndour. If that's not enough, then a <b>Mud Shot</b>! If Cade's in danger, switch over to the Growlithe with a <b>Mud Bomb</b>!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ricco wonders if these were illusions like the Arcanine before, or if these were real. Either way, he was prepared for the worst.</span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: silver"><span style="font-size: 9px">Lee made a sigh of relief as he watched the second round of the battle - everything went exactly as he had planned, Guts was able to avoid Surskit's attacks. But he knew very well that it couldn't go on like that forever, he had to attack - and he had to do it now. Still, Surskit was fast, and it would be difficult for a rather slow Pokemon like Guts to hit it in close combat, as it would just skate away. So, Guts had to somehow slow his opponent down or use long-range attacks..or, and Lee grinned while thinking this, both at the same time. It was a long shot, but maybe it'd work..at least it was the best move Lee could think of now. The trainer called out to his Geodude:<br />
&quot;Guts, listen up! You've done well so far, but now it's time this little bugger takes a beating - start off with your mightiest <b>Earthquake</b>! The force of the attack might disrupt the ground of the arena, rendering Surskit's skate-over-water-ability useless or at least making it harder to pull off - I don't know if that'll work, but even if not, hopefully Surskit will get hit by a couple of shockwaves. Afterwards, use your <b>Strength</b> to pick up one of the logs lying around, and throw it at Surskit as hard as you can - or alternatively, if it is close to you, just smack it with the log.&quot;<br />
Hoping that this round was gonna go as good as the last, Lee watched the battle go on..</span></span></div>

<span style="color: #FF9900"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'">Running her fingers across the scarred surface of the stone, Stacey felt the cake of blood which was incorporated into the stone itself. The sensation of the cold stone and the ferrous stain is fascinating, and Drusilla, enthralled by this morbid shrine, flutters about, hissing and mumbling poetic macabre. Suddenly, the rock begins to feel warm. <i>Odd,</i> thinks Stacey, continuing to graze the smooth lithic surface. The weather conditions are fairly mild and clouds hang lightly in the sky, reflecting the harsh solar rays.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #FF9900"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'">Still looking at the pattern left on the now-heated rock by blood spilled in days long passed, Stacey espies a flash out of the corner of her eye. Quickly, she turns to see where it came from, but before she gets a look of what is behind her, Drusilla gives a shriek laced with shock and pleasure. “Oh, Mommy!” she cries, giddily circling the stone, “It is miraculous! The stone! Blood of the dead! It drenches the shrine!” Surely enough, Stacey turns back to see the surface of the stone now soaked in a thick layer of bright red warm liquid. Lifting her hand up, she finds it covered in blood. Small droplets roll off your palm and splatter onto the base of the shrine, which is also wet with fresh blood.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #FF9900"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'">“Girl! Get down from there! You mustn’t be seen!” a woman’s voice yells from behind you. “Come away!” Stacey turns to see a woman ascending the stone steps up to the top where Stacey stands. “You should not be up here! You are violating the sacred shrine!” the woman scolds. Unexpectedly, she grasps Stacey’s smooth, clean and pallor hand in her tanned and rough one, and pulls her down the stairs. A little shocked, she follows, having little other option with the woman gripping so strongly. Drusilla, torn between the fascinating shrine and the ensuing panic, takes a moment to contemplate which is better to stay with. After a quick moment, she follows after her trainer, deciding this sudden alarm could unfold into something even more interesting than a blood-covered slab of rock.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #FF9900"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'">As she is lead down the monument, Stacey examines the woman’s clothes, which look to be from ancient times. The knee-length sundress-like garment she is wearing is made from some sort of burlap-colored leather, and is decorated with a variety of colored beads as well as wool. Her feet are bear and her hair is a dark brown shade, wrapped up neatly in a single thick braid. In a whirlwind moment, she leads Stacey through a crowded market bustling with similarly dressed people, then down a twisting path lined with small grass huts and flabbergasted inhabitants, all wearing clothing reminiscent of ancient Mesoamericans.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #FF9900"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'">The path eventually leads into a verdant environment, lush with tall, vine-covered trees and exotic flowers. As the two young women sprint down the path with your blind bat in tow, the sound of a rumbling waterfall begins to fill Stacey’s ears and crescendos as the group nears its source. Not after long, they come upon the origin of the crash, a towering cascade which drops from a cliff side into a pool of shining rippling water below. The woman deviates from the sandy path and leads Stacey into the exotic thicket, heading towards the falls. Leading you around the falls, she takes Stacey into a cavern behind the waterfall, which resonates with the sound from the cascade hiding its entrance.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #FF9900"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'">Finally, the woman stops and looks at Stacey. “I’m sorry for whisking you away like that, but if you had been there any longer, you could have very well met your end.” The woman paused momentarily, examining Stacey. “You are dressed very strangely. Are you not from these parts?”</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #FF9900"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'">Stacey responds with a simple no, and the woman shakes her head in understanding. “Yes, yes. I see. Well, thank Girtinia I got you off that shrine before the soldiers got to you. For both of our safeties, we should wait here for a while. Oh, I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Ranjona.”</span></span><br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">Thankya very much for the update Jeri ^-^<br />
<br />
<span style="color: orange">As Stacey’s fingers traced the small blood pattern on the stone pillar she felt the rough surface beneath her finger grow warm adding to the pleasant sensations. Lost in a world of her own her vacant gaze held on the stone before it before she saw a flicker out of the corner of her eye, and breaking eye contact she looked over her shoulder, her hand still placed upon the stone. Her gaze scanned her surroundings but found nothing but she was brought right back to her anchor; the stone her hand kept its contact with from a screech of excitement from Drusilla. <br />
<br />
“Oh, Mommy! It is miraculous! The stone! Blood of the dead! It drenches the shrine!” she cried out delirious with excitement as Stacey looked back to the stone seeing thick rivers of dark red blood now drenching its entire surface including her hand. As if pulled from her trance she pulled her hand back and held it before her face, studying the liquid that ran from her digits dripping to the ground below. Her thoughts interrupted by a voice once more, this time an unknown woman yelling from behind her. Turning to face her she notices her approaching quickly chiding her for violating the sacred shrine before reaching out and grasping her wrist in her rough tanned hand. Stacey had only a moment to tilt her head in confusion before she felt herself pulled off her feet and down the steps almost falling over in surprise at the sudden motion. The last thing she noticed before the shrine disappeared from view was her torn Zubat, her gaze flittering between the blood-drenched stone pillar and her trainer being unceremoniously dragged away.<br />
<br />
Stacey felt no danger from the older woman currently steering her down the shrine and into the forest but was silently glad that she could sense Dru following the pair. Looking to the woman’s back she could see that she was dressed strangely, well from her perspective anyway. She wore a knee-length sundress decorated with multi-colored beads and wool, her thickly braided dark brown hair seemed almost static against her back as she ran, her bare feet silently padding over dirt and grass. <br />
<br />
Changing direction she pulled Stacey through a small market bustling with activity, giving the young woman very little time to study her new environment with the speed they maintained. She had enough time to make out several people dressed very similarly to this woman in ancient-style outfits, their bewildered gazes all set on the strange pale individual being led away. Leaving the market behind the pair of them headed into a more lush and verdant environment off tall trees and exotic wild flowers in every colour imaginable. Stacey was beginning to wonder how long they were going to keep running for, her legs and arms aching from her position of being lead rather than leading. Dru by now had caught up to the duo and Stacey cast her a quick glance noticing no blood on her lips, at least she hadn’t stop to eat a villager along the way. A soft roaring began to fill her ears as she returned her focus to her path and not falling flat on her face, Stacey soon discovering that a large waterfall was the source of the noise, its harsh waters pouring from the side of a cliff rippling the pool of water beneath. Her ‘captor’ pulled her towards the waterfall and into a cavern behind it, the roaring echoing throughout making Stacey’s ears feel fuzzy. <br />
<br />
Finally coming to a stop the woman released Stacey’s wrist, the young woman rubbing it to try and cease the ache the hold had generated. Dru flew inside the cavern and shrieked in joy, now this was her kind of hidey hole, all dark and wet … perfect.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry for whisking you away like that, but if you had been there any longer, you could have very well met your end.” The woman said, Stacey tilting her head in contemplation, something that she did unawares when she was thinking. The woman before her studied her, taking in her very different style of dress.<br />
<br />
“You are dressed very strangely. Are you not from these parts?” she asked with intrigue. Stacey paused a moment before a soft “No” left her lips, her face still covered by her black hood. <br />
<br />
“Yes, yes. I see. Well, thank Giratina I got you off that shrine before the soldiers got to you. For both of our safeties, we should wait here for a while. Oh, I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Ranjona.” She spoke politely waiting a response from her new companion. Stacey merely looked down to her hand, it was still caked with the dark red blood. Turning from the woman she now knew as Ranjona she approached the waterfall at the entrance to the cavern and placed her hand beneath watching as the red liquid left her palm and intermingled with the water there leaving her hand clean once more. Turning to face Ranjona once more Stacey approached her pulling her hood off to reveal her face, her brown hair reached down to her breasts and was layered so her fringe was chin length, black streaks running throughout. Her dark blue eyes met Ranjona’s her pale pink lips opened to address her ‘companion’.<br />
<br />
“My name is Stacey and my Zubat named Drusilla. We traveled here from somewhere … quite far away.” She said rather vaguely pausing as if thinking over her next words. “There was something at that shrine I felt it draw me to it, why is that?” she said as a manner of explanation for her presence there, the question more posed to herself than to Ranjona. “What is that shrine in honor of?” she asked directing this question to Ranjona in a surprising manner. Going silent once more she thought over what the woman had said.<br />
<br />
… “Soliders? Who are these soldiers that you ‘saved’ us from?” she asked feeling as if she had unwillingly wandered into a world so deep and afar from her own.</span></span></div>
