<br />
<b><u>Amor Temple</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Charminions</u>:</b> <i>((Hey there Charm, welcome aboard! Hope you enjoy your adventure in Cascadia and the depths of Amor Temple. Hope you’re prepared!<br />
<b>Record marker: 4 of 6</b> on-hand Pokemon declared: Combusken, Honchkrow, Houndour, Magmortar))</i><br />
<br />
Guided by your trusty Honchkrow Don, you walk towards the abandoned-looking building. This is Amor Temple, located in the heart of Ruin Island; the Gods worshipped here have long been forgotten, but the structure has endured the test of time and stands proudly as one of Cascadia’s oldest <i>ex-libris</i>.<br />
<br />
After climbing precisely 500 steps, you finally reach the entrance, legs hurting and heart thumping. The front gate, massive and imposing, made of once-finely sculpted rock, is covered in vines and foliage, indicating nobody has opened it likely in hundreds of years. And yet, all it takes is a simple tap on the stony surface for the entire structure to start rumbling loudly while the doors spread apart, allowing you to pass through!<br />
<br />
Confused, you decide to step inside nonetheless. After all, it’s why you came here in the first place. But it makes no sense for the gate to open itself that easily when it showed clear signs of having remained untouched for centuries! You decide it’s best to let it go for now and focus on your new surroundings. The entrance hall is a massive room kept alit by three chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, each housing several slumbering Litwick. Their flames reveal the entirety of the area, from the elaborate stone walls to the two doors on the far end of the room. The gravures on the walls have faded with time, giving you no hints about the history of this place, but something does catch your eye and only serves to add to your lingering questions…<br />
<br />
A dead body!<br />
<br />
In the center of the room is the corpse of what you can only assume was another adventurer. And on closer inspection, he barely shows signs of decomposition, as if… he’d passed away only recently! But in that case, why did it seem as if the Temple hadn’t been entered in ages?!<br />
You force yourself to look at the man a bit more carefully, in case it could provide any clues as to what happened. He looked to be roughly your age, light on possessions for someone risking his life in an abandoned temple; his pants are darker from the knee down, with traces of dried mud, as if he’d crossed a lake of some sort; his shirt bears numerous cuts and tears, along with minor traces of blood; and the cause of death soon becomes apparent when you inspect his neck and arm – several black needles have pierced his skin, likely containing fatal poison. A classic trap…<br />
<br />
You notice he carried a backpack, but unfortunately it seems empty; he must have spent all of his provisions during the adventure, so there’s nothing left to salvage. Looking ahead, you inspect the two doors on the far wall a bit more carefully, as they seem to be the only way forward if you still want to explore the temple after this terrible discovery. The gates are identical and much like the images on the other walls, whatever used to be portrayed on these doors has long been eroded by time. Seemingly nothing sets them apart, until you notice that a small puddle of water beneath the gate on the left, and thin vines emerging from beneath the one on the right.<br />
<br />
With so little to go on, which door do you choose to pass through?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Charm lumbered up hundreds of steps to reach the entrance. He panted when he finally reached the top, his heart pounding after that cardio workout. Apollo looked completely fine by his side, the Fighting-type's endurance clearly outclassing his trainer's. <br />
<br />
The trainer looks ahead, seeing a large gate which would've looked far more imposing if it weren't for the vines and foliage that aged around it. &quot;It doesn't look like anyone has been here in centuries, <i>mon seigneur</i>,&quot; the Murkrow still perched on the trainer's shoulder spoke. Charm remained silent as he studied the gate. He reaches out an arm, tapping the surface when the entire gate starts rumbling and opening for its visitors.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was pretty simple way to open an entrance that hasn't been opened for centuries,&quot; the trainer laughed, his tone getting more cautious as he stepped inside. He looks around the entrance hall, noticing that it's staying alit by chandeliers filled with Litwick. The walls were faded, but showed hints of rich and elaborate architecture that was once there. At the other side of the room were two doors, but what really caught Charm's attention was the dead body laying in the center of the room. <br />
<br />
The trainer and his Pokemon quickly approach the body to examine it. The body showed little signs of decay. &quot;Why does the entrance look like we're the first ones in ages to come here when this man only died recently?&quot; An eerie feeling went up the trainer's spine, but Charm stayed alert as he examined the body closer. The man held little belongings, and his pants from the knee down were darker and covered in mud as if he went through water. Cuts shredded across the man's shirt, with small amounts of blood tracing from them. His neck and arm bore several black needles- likely filled with poison that finished him off. The backpack beside him was empty, perhaps used up during his adventure. <br />
<br />
The trainer was appalled by the unsightly body, but he gathered his courage as he faced the two doors. &quot;Welp, we just walked into a temple that could potentially kill us. We have to be extremely careful from here on out, okay guys?&quot; the swept his dark hair back as he calmed himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Combusken!&quot; &quot;Yes, <i>Monsieur!</i>&quot; his Pokemon shout. <br />
<br />
Charm glimpses back to the doors when his eyes catch some water trickling beneath the left gate and vines protruding beneath the right. The trainer turns back to the dead body and eyes his pants once more. &quot;This man must've gone through the left gate considering the bottom part of his pants are wet and muddy, and this is what came of his decision... Let's take the right!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good choice, <i>Monsieur</i>!&quot; Don grinned as Apollo pumped himself up with a few air kicks. Within a few moments the trio take off towards the right gate.</span></span></div>

<br />
<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> Despite the unexpected encounter, you refuse to play the Great One's game. He wants you to duke it out with your only friend in this accursed mountain, having taken advantage of Kyle's much weaker willpower to struck a bargain with the reporter. Neither Kyle nor Doduo seem eager to carry out their part of the agreement, but both realize they have to if they want to stay alive. You, however, decide to appeal to the man's kindness rather then engage him.<br />
<br />
For a while Kyle just stands there in absolute silence, while Doduo struggles with whether to carry out its Trainer's orders or not. Seizing the moment, Meowth locks eyes with the conflicted bird - at least, with one of the heads. It goes into a trance under the cat's paranormal gaze before falling into a deep slumber, but the second head is quicker to realize what's happening and quickly starts pecking its twin to wake it up.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Kyle is clearly torn between your words and his promise. His heart and his mind are pulling in opposite directions, leaving the weak-willed reporter to do absolutely nothing but blurt out in despair.<br />
<br />
- Y-you don't get it! He controls this <i>whole freaking place</i>, you've seen it yourself! I couldn't care less if you think He's scared of us, <i>I'm</i> sure as hell scared of Him!! He wiped out half of your group just like that, and He could've just as easily killed me the same way he disposed of that Magmar. Dude... I'd do the right thing if I could. If I had any shred of hope that would still get me out of here. But I've seen what this creature can do and... man I can't take that chance. I got a radio station to go back to!<br />
<br />
Kyle is shivering from head to toe, overwhelmed by fear, guilt and doubt all at once. He knows he's only made it this far with your help, but at the same time, he wouldn't be in this mess right now if he didn't tag along with you. He wanted to get to the bottom of Aduro's mystery, but had he known it'd lead to this, he probably would have left the Isle a heck of a lot sooner. Now, he was at the mercy of a God's whims.<br />
<br />
- I can't let you go Keith, I'm sorry! I wanna make it out of this place, it's all I want right now... screw the scoop, and quite frankly, with the number of Heatmor you have left... screw them too. They're doomed as it is, we're fighting a losing battle here! You can't stop natural selection man... not when the one selecting is this freaking monster! Dude, I really wanted you to go through and beat this &quot;Great One&quot;, but you've seen His power, what chance do you have? Please man, just... call it quits. The Heatmor can't be helped, but we can still make it out alive if we stop messing with the laws of this place. If... if you insist on going ahead with this, I'll have to hurt you! <br />
<br />
As expected, he doesn't sound the least bit confident in his ability to actually do so, but he's not budging. Meowth has his hands on his forehead, ready to unleash his Flash, but hesitates before Kyle's struggle - torn between his morality and his survival instinct, he can go either way at this point, either cave in completely and attack you or break down into a nervous wreck. Either way, the choice falls on you: Kyle probably won't be much of a foe, but should you really come to blows if he doesn't budge? On the ther hand, do you have a choice? You already appealed to his honor, his journalistic pride and neither did the trick...<br />
<br />
And all the while, one last doubt lingers in the back of your mind: what will the Great One do to Kyle if he fails to stop you? </span></span> <br />

<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u> Electric Blue Eye</u>:</b> It all comes down to this. You and Sean have now revealed your third Pokemon, ironically neither of which fully evolved. You had half-expected the Water Gym Leader to own a Starter Pokemon, but not quite this one, which raises a number of questions in your mind.<br />
<br />
Be that as it may, you know that standing idly against a master tactician is a terrible idea; as such, you try to predict Dewott's movements while at the same time adapt to the sudden lack of support moves James likes to use. The ability to turn brute force into strategic advantage is a tough skill to acquire, especially in a pinch, but right now, it's the only choice you have. Reasoning that Dewott will likely look to go underwater, you base your orders around that hypothesis to cover your bases.<br />
And indeed, Dewott suddenly makes a run for the hole in the icy floor, only to be met by a timely Thunderbolt by the wary James; however, at the last second, the otter makes a sharp turn to the side and dashes <i>around</i> the lightning, straight at your partner! In an impressive display of skill and agility it picks up both its scalchops, runs the blades along the frozen ground and slashes upwards at blinding speed - a perfect samurai-like <i>Tsubame Gaeshi</i> , the Swallow Return technique, known as <b>Aerial Ace</b> in the western parts of the Pokemon World.<br />
<br />
- Hanzo is the most agile and nimble Pokemon I own. Had he evolved into a Samurott, there was no way his bulky frame could have evaded that Thunderbolt; his style revolves around the swiftness of his strikes and dodges, and we're just getting started!<br />
<br />
Annoyed by the turn of events, James prepares to unleash a much stronger move thanks to the item in his possession; a glimmering Grass Gem that had remained concealed until now, but soon starts to shine an emerald green before shattering into a million pieces. The Gastly growls as he gathers energy and lets loose a huge sphere of Grass-Type energy straight at his foe, who stands idly all the while. Then, in lightning-fast motion, Dewott slices the air in front of him, sending a massive blade of wind straight at the Giga Drain pulse!<br />
<br />
The two moves collide half-way between each Pokemon; despite its considerably larger size, the grass orb is suddenly halted by the Flying-Type move. The [b}Air Slash[/b] cuts through Giga Drain, splitting the sphere in half and causing it to explode before making contact with Dewott! However, the blast disrupts the wind blade and also causes it to vanish - essentially, both moves cancelled each other out! And your Grass Gem is gone regardless...<br />
<br />
- Don't feel bad about yourself. This is the absolute best I have to offer; mere type advantage won't be enough to beat Hanzo. The two of us have an agreement that he won't be used unless I'm fighting Trainers with seven badges, or in special situations such as these. Consider this a proof of respect from me to you, and don't hold anything back!<br />
<br />
James is naturally frustrated; his efforts are being foiled time and again by Hanzo's superior skills, and the longer this goes on the more aggravated he feels. Intent on getting some manner of retribution, the living miasma floats toward the Dewott and envelops one of his arms, covering it with the black mass that forms his entire body; Hanzo struggles to break free, while James painfully tightens his grip on the arm and shoulder. The Water-Type finally manages to break free, and although he had no Held Item to be taken, it seems one of his scalchops is missing!<br />
<br />
Angered by the humiliation of having his single most prized possession taken away, Hanzo immediately retaliates. In unexpected fashion, electricity starts to crackle around his remaining blade, and with a piercing motion, Hanzo unleashes a stream of Electric-Type orbs at James, striking him for frightening damage due to the Water typing forced on him by the earlier Soak!<br />
<br />
- Make him mad and feel the wrath of his <b>Hidden Power</b>! He has learned to tame lightning despite his type's usual lack of affinity, keep that in mind going forward! Although I commend you on taking away one of his weapons, that won't be working twice, and Hanzo is just as effective with one scalchop... difference is, now he's getting serious.<br />
<br />
As he said it, the sea otter suddenly multiplied into <i>six</i> clones in an incredible display of <b>Double Team</b> mastery. All six Dewott have their eyes locked on Hanzo, almost urging him to come at them all, mocking him silently.<br />
<br />
No doubt some of Sean's interventions are meant only to spite you, but one thing's for sure - this Dewott is a terrifying opponent. James isn't going to give up attacking any time soon, the Taunt and this unfavorable round way too fresh in his mind for now.<br />
<br />
Now that you got a taste of what Sean and Hanzo can do, what's your response? </span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> Frustration reaches boiling point when the handsome stranger picks up your Snubbull and asks the bothersome questions. As if witnessing the elderly couple's breakdown and letting the likely perpetrators get away wasn't enough.<br />
<br />
The Fairy-Type barks menacingly along with your outburst, but the man doesn't seem all that fazed. He smiles and gently puts Snubbull back down, pats him on the back and turns his attention back to you while his expression becomes somber again.<br />
<br />
- That temper is going to get you in trouble. Like I said, all I know is you messed with the wrong people. I can't risk telling you anything else out in the open, the city has ears everywhere.<br />
<br />
He takes out a small notebook and a pen from the inside of his coat, scribbles something down and discreetly hands you a piece of paper.<br />
<br />
- You might want to put those to use in the near future. See you around girly.<br />
<br />
You glance at the paper and find two lines of text in it. At first, neither of the two lines of text seems to make sense.<br />
<br />
&quot;1-2237405<br />
I AM A VOICE OF UNREST&quot;<br />
<br />
The first thing that comes to mind, mostly from visual memory, is that the digits resemble those of many Fizzy Bubbles-region phone numbers. But why the sentence beneath it? Is he talking about you, or himself? Is he mocking you for your outburst?!<br />
<br />
When you turn to confront him on the meaning of all this... the man is gone. Snub restlessly sniffs the ground around him and looks at you in confusion. How could he have evaded <i>both</i> of you in that fraction of a second?!<br />
<br />
You're stumped for answers. All you have to go on is a piece of paper with an incomprehensible message and the knowledge that someone is out to get you.<br />
You turn your attention back to the message that stranger gave you, trying to figure it out. People are forced to walk <i>around</i> you to get inside the Pokemon Center while you absent-mindedly try to solve this conundrum...<br />
<br />
Should you ask around for help? You'll risk talking to the wrong people, but someone might help piece everything together for you... Or is there anything you want to try out on your own with this new lead? </span></span><br />

<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Treepandaone</u>:</b> Trying your very hardest to put your personal convictions aside temporarily, you prepare to engage the Piloswine herd. Death is as natural a process in the Pokemon world as it is in the human one, but <i>killing</i> is something very few Trainers are ever actually forced to do. Pokemon in general seem endowed with remarkable longevity, able to train and battle their entire lives without succumbing to sustained injuries. If anything, they seem more prone to fainting than anything, which is easily remedied at any Pokemon Center. But this... this is a whole different game.<br />
<br />
Despite their obvious lack of fighting skills, it's clear that the group is more than accustomed to this routine. They move flawlessly across the snow like a pack of wolves closing in on their prey, which denotes two things: one, they have transcended their existence as mere researchers and became full-fledged survivors in this frozen hell; two, and much more frightening a realization... they have all killed before.<br />
<br />
Shieldon eyes you with apprehension but seems to understand your predicament. Armed with a rather innocent-looking Heart Container, he looks to charge into battle alongside his allies, but the best he can muster is a couple of steps across the nose-high snow to realize the ordeal won't be paying off. Be that as it may, the herd has already been alerted to the presence of the close-range fighters, namely Stoutland and Jacob's Blaziken, and while five Piloswine hold their ground, they make way for the other three to start fleeing - you assume those to be the females, whose survival bears more relevance to the preservation of the herd.<br />
<br />
One of the hunters has his Grumpig psychically lift a Piloswine in the air, while Daryl's Magneton blasts it repeatedly with <b>Mirror Shot</b>. Meanwhile the Stoutland, Gligar and Blaziken each tackle their own prey, leaving one last valiant Ice-Type to contend with. Hesitating briefly at first, the much smaller Shieldon finally makes up his mind and targets that final Piloswine, unleashing a silver beam of metal energy straight at the lumbering foe. The attack finds its mark, pelting the enemy for considerable damage, evident even from such a distance; Piloswine roars in pain and twists around uncomfortably as the Flash Cannon pulse drills into his flesh.<br />
<br />
- Keep it up Matthew, we have this under control!<br />
<br />
Jacob's words of encouragement come just as his Blaziken delivers a crushing <b>Blaze Kick</b> that causes its victim to wobble precariously, about to pass out. A Pokemon with such a massive advantage over its opponents is the ideal partner to have in these situations, and it comes as no surprise that Jacob's only remaining partner would be exceptionally fit to handle the land's adversities.<br />
<br />
The Piloswine you attacked soon finds the culprit behind the long-range sucker punch, and charges straight at you and Shieldon in a blood rage. For such a heavy creature, it moves surprisingly fast in the snow, contrary to your partner, who can do little more than stand there and brace himself for impact in his panic... until he remembers your instructions again just in time! Four boulders materialize around the prehistoric Pokemon and are released just as Piloswine is about to ram into him; each rock finds its mark right on the opponent's forehead, four shots of such force that they're enough stop the creature in its tracks! Dizzy from the consecutive impacts, Piloswine seems to temporarily lose his bearings, before quickly regaining composure.<br />
A wild Pokemon with no sense strategy, and a stranger to Steel-Types in his usual habitat, it resorts to its usual offense by coating his tusks with ice and driving them straight against your partner's impenetrable iron skull for negligible damage. The lack of substantial damage seems to fill Shieldon with renewed confidence, and it swiftly Counters Piloswine's ineffective <b>Ice Fang</b> with a twice as powerful headbutt for good measure!<br />
<br />
So far, this has been a fairly standard fight for a veteran such as yourself. The foe, despite being in its natural habitat, doesn't seem used to the kind of Pokemon it's facing, and you have the definite upper hand as far as tactical awareness goes. Still, Piloswine is bigger and potentially stronger than Shieldon, and it has yet to resort to the dreaded Ground-Type moves its species can use... You know you should tread lightly but, above all, you can't afford to forget your ultimate goal - you're not out here to win.<br />
<br />
The rest of the group seems to be doing fairly well on their own, and you have your hands full with an angry Piloswine looking to crush you and your Pokemon for the sake of its family - a powerful motivation.<br />
With all this in mind, what is your next step? </span></span> <br />

<br />
<b><u>Amor Temple</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Charminions</u>:</b> Despite the unsettling circumstances you find yourself in, facing an adventurer's corpse inside an otherwise barren room, you keep your wits about you just enough to reason where the deceased came from, and by extension, which path you should avoid. Rallying your army of two, you head to the gate on the right behind which vines appear to be growing, in detriment of the one with water seeping out from beneath.<br />
If you expected brute force to be necessary, it proves not to be the case; the stone door seems to react to your presence and opens by itself with thunderous noise. Makes you wonder why there's even a door in the first place, or if you just happen to be special for whatever reason; but judging by the dead body at the entrance, perhaps the second option should be ruled out.<br />
<br />
In front of you is a large sprawling corridor, filled with vines from top to bottom, covering the walls, ceiling and floor. There's a distinct lack of flowers amidst all the vegetation, making for a rather monotonous green tunnel, poorly lit and so humid you can feel water seeping into your bones. The air is heavy and stagnant, much like in a swamp, making it hard to breathe. The vines are soaked as well, making the ground slippery and hard to walk on, but you press onward spotting no obvious obstacles. Apollo is notoriously uncomfortable in this environment, bothered by the excessive humidity, but follows nonetheless as does Don.<br />
<br />
The atmosphere is oppressive. Not even your own steps make a sound, muffled by the vineyard underneath, to the point where silence feels deafening - the overused cliché applies in this particular setting as sound of any nature would be much more welcoming than the ominous void you traverse.<br />
<br />
A thought lingers in the back of your mind: what could have happened to that adventurer at the entrance? Your guess is that he died after crossing the other corridor, which lead you to choose the one you're currently in, but why should this one be any better? What kind of secrets are worth protecting to the point of setting up measures that can <i>kill</i> a man? That is what so many Trainers often forget; the life of an adventurer is much more than the clean-cut Pokemon Battles shown on TV. A true traveler is always in as much danger as his Pokemon, if not more, making most journeys a lot more bittersweet than they imagined when they left home.<br />
But you are a seasoned Trainer by now. You've grown accustomed to the quirky nature of the Fizzy Bubbles, the treacherous lands and fickle roads. No newcomer would dare explore the lost temples of the Cascadian Archipelago, but trust your long-time partners to keep you safe throughout the ordeal. <br />
<br />
After a while of walking, with no proverbial light at the end of the tunnel to speak of, the Temple once again seems to come to life - reacting to your presence in a much different way than before! Rather than invite you to move further in, thick vines suddenly wrap around your ankles and all the way up to your knees, rendering you unable to walk! You quickly glance over at Apollo to find himself in the exact same predicament, while Don has become trapped by vines on the ceiling which bind his wings!<br />
<br />
A few steps ahead, more vines begin to coalesce and interwine, slowly taking a familiar form - cold eyes glimmer behind the swirling vegetation, and soon after a massive <b>Tangrowth</b> stands before you! It's formed out of the hundreds of vines that cover the tunnel, as if it were one with the structure itself. The creature eyes you with malicious intent and you feel the vines that wrap you progressively climb up your body while tightening their grip - and it's pretty obvious it's only going to get tighter as time goes by!<br />

<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> Despite the unexpected encounter, you refuse to play the Great One's game. He wants you to duke it out with your only friend in this accursed mountain, having taken advantage of Kyle's much weaker willpower to struck a bargain with the reporter. Neither Kyle nor Doduo seem eager to carry out their part of the agreement, but both realize they have to if they want to stay alive. You, however, decide to appeal to the man's kindness rather then engage him.<br />
<br />
For a while Kyle just stands there in absolute silence, while Doduo struggles with whether to carry out its Trainer's orders or not. Seizing the moment, Meowth locks eyes with the conflicted bird - at least, with one of the heads. It goes into a trance under the cat's paranormal gaze before falling into a deep slumber, but the second head is quicker to realize what's happening and quickly starts pecking its twin to wake it up.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Kyle is clearly torn between your words and his promise. His heart and his mind are pulling in opposite directions, leaving the weak-willed reporter to do absolutely nothing but blurt out in despair.<br />
<br />
- Y-you don't get it! He controls this <i>whole freaking place</i>, you've seen it yourself! I couldn't care less if you think He's scared of us, <i>I'm</i> sure as hell scared of Him!! He wiped out half of your group just like that, and He could've just as easily killed me the same way he disposed of that Magmar. Dude... I'd do the right thing if I could. If I had any shred of hope that would still get me out of here. But I've seen what this creature can do and... man I can't take that chance. I got a radio station to go back to!<br />
<br />
Kyle is shivering from head to toe, overwhelmed by fear, guilt and doubt all at once. He knows he's only made it this far with your help, but at the same time, he wouldn't be in this mess right now if he didn't tag along with you. He wanted to get to the bottom of Aduro's mystery, but had he known it'd lead to this, he probably would have left the Isle a heck of a lot sooner. Now, he was at the mercy of a God's whims.<br />
<br />
- I can't let you go Keith, I'm sorry! I wanna make it out of this place, it's all I want right now... screw the scoop, and quite frankly, with the number of Heatmor you have left... screw them too. They're doomed as it is, we're fighting a losing battle here! You can't stop natural selection man... not when the one selecting is this freaking monster! Dude, I really wanted you to go through and beat this &quot;Great One&quot;, but you've seen His power, what chance do you have? Please man, just... call it quits. The Heatmor can't be helped, but we can still make it out alive if we stop messing with the laws of this place. If... if you insist on going ahead with this, I'll have to hurt you! <br />
<br />
As expected, he doesn't sound the least bit confident in his ability to actually do so, but he's not budging. Meowth has his hands on his forehead, ready to unleash his Flash, but hesitates before Kyle's struggle - torn between his morality and his survival instinct, he can go either way at this point, either cave in completely and attack you or break down into a nervous wreck. Either way, the choice falls on you: Kyle probably won't be much of a foe, but should you really come to blows if he doesn't budge? On the ther hand, do you have a choice? You already appealed to his honor, his journalistic pride and neither did the trick...<br />
<br />
And all the while, one last doubt lingers in the back of your mind: what will the Great One do to Kyle if he fails to stop you?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">As Keith spoke to Kyle, the reporter stood still and silent, while his Doduo seemed to struggle with the idea of attacking Keith and Meowth. Meowth was quick to notice this, and seized the opportunity by locking eyes with... one of the heads. They did not think this through. The afflicted head went into a trance, and then fell asleep, but not for long- as Meowth had started to fear, the second head realized what was happening and pecked at the other head to snap it out of the trance. &quot;Aw, crap,&quot; Meowth muttered.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, it was clear that Kyle was torn between what was right and what was easy. He blurted out to Keith in despair, reminding him that the Great One controls the entire mountain, as Keith had seen for himself, and even if He was scared of them, Kyle was sure as hell scared of Him. He reminded Keith that the Great One wiped out half the Heatmor in one go, and that He could just as easily wipe out the reporter. He asserted that he'd do the right thing if he could, but he just saw no reason to believe that doing the right thing would end well for him. Keith listened in silence, able to appreciate Kyle's fears, feeling similar fears deep down himself. Kyle then went on to state that he just wanted out at this point, and that he wasn't interested in the scoop, or the fate of the Heatmor. He asserted that the Heatmor were doomed, and that while he wanted Keith to make it through and beat the Great One, he didn't think Keith had a chance, finishing by begging him to call it quits and telling him that while the Heatmor were beyond help, the humans weren't if they just stopped.<br />
<br />
Keith did not respond right away. Kyle's words had gotten him thinking about just how tempting the idea of dropping it and running away for his own safety sounded. Little though he liked the idea of doing so, he did not immediately refuse to do what Kyle was saying. And just then, a voice sounded in Keith's head.<br />
<br />
<i>We know it sounds tempting, but it's not who you are. What would Nagini think of you if you abandoned the Heatmor?</i><br />
<br />
Keith knew that telepathic voice well- Gemini and Mustard were reminding Keith of what he already knew- sure, he could just turn tail and escape the mountain unscathed, but that wasn't him at all, and Gemini in particular, Keith's first Pokémon and oldest friend, knew that better than anyone. And more to the point, they were right about something else. Nagini, Keith's Arbok, whom Keith first met in a secret underground lab under Team Rocket's control. A self-destruct mechanism had triggered, and the place only had minutes until it exploded, but Keith had encountered a wild Ekans they had been keeping with intent to experiment upon. The Ekans, enraged and confused by the chaos, was just blindly attacking, instead of trying to escape. Keith could've run from the Ekans and saved his own ass, but instead, he opted to stay behind, weaken the Ekans with Lily, then still a young and hyperactive Venonat, and catch her in a Poké Ball. And he still managed to escape (thank Arceus for Lily being so hyperactive back then- her Tackle attacks were delivered at mind-blowing speeds). Nagini remained grateful to Keith for his bravery, and was loyal to him from day one as a result of it, and if she heard that Keith just abandoned these Heatmor in their time of need, she'd lose respect for him. Hell, Keith knew he'd lose respect for himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle,&quot; said Keith. &quot;I get it. I get that the Great One scares you, and I get that agreeing to flee the place with you would spare both of us from His wrath. But...&quot; At this point, he took a moment to glance back at the Heatmor. &quot;...I can't do that to the Heatmor, man,&quot; he said. &quot;I promised them I'd help them, I promised I'd do everything I could to help them survive. And when Keith Golbatson Masters makes a promise, he keeps it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He ain't kiddin', either,&quot; Meowth added. &quot;Believe me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you're right,&quot; Keith continued. &quot;Maybe the Heatmor are doomed. But until I can be sure of that, I'm gonna keep helping them. It wouldn't be the first time I've defied the odds and saved lives, either. Years ago, I found myself in an underground lab that was experimenting on wild Ekans, and some Team Rocket goons had set off the self-destruct system. The place was set to blow up in minutes, and an Ekans was attacking me. I could've ran and left it to die, but instead I stayed and tried to help the Ekans. As you can clearly see, I got out of that alive, and you know what? So did the Ekans. She's now an Arbok, one of my strongest Pokémon, and she wouldn't have lived to be anywhere near what she is today had I not risked my life to save her. And yeah, the Great One is powerful, but again, it wouldn't be the first time I've defied the odds. I restored the legendary Celebi's faith in humanity. I went up against an Arceusdamn Missingno. in battle and came out on top. Even if there's a good chance the Great One can defeat me, I'm still gonna take that chance,&quot; he said firmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weezing weez!&quot; Gemini and Mustard chimed in, both of the Weezing's heads nodding in agreement with their Trainer. This was their Trainer as they knew and loved him, and they were gonna back him up with this. Though Mustard still kept an eye on the Heatmor, lest they fall victim to another of the Great One's tricks. The Weezing's second head intended to warn the others if anything so much as threatened to happen, and protect the Heatmor any way he could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fight me if you must,&quot; Keith said to Kyle. &quot;But I don't want to hurt you or Doduo. After how you guys saved me back when that tunnel was collapsing, I think hurting you would be a pretty poor way of repaying you. And Doduo couldn't even hold up against one of those Magmar, so I shudder to think what Gemini and Mustard here are capable of doing to it.&quot; Keith sighed. &quot;Look, you're not gonna convince me to give up, and a battle just isn't going to end well, so from where I stand, coming with me is the best option you got for getting out of here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meowth nodded in agreement, then spoke to the Doduo. &quot;Just so ya know, I know how ta use <b>Thunderbolt</b>. Youse saved us back dere in dat tunnel, and I'm grateful fer dat, so I really don't wanna hafta use it, OK?&quot; he said.</span></span><br />

<br />
As it turns out, you're not going to budge either. True to your convictions, you're determined to see this through to the end and protect however few Heatmor are left. Kyle looks dejected upon realizing the strength of your resolve, and after contemplating his situation... he falls to his knees.<br />
<br />
- Damn you man! You ain't hurting Doduo. You're going to get us all killed... Just go, the exit's up ahead; I can't face that monster, I just can't. I'm dead either way so... I need a moment with Doduo. Leave me alone, go be a hero.<br />
<br />
He stares blankly at the ground, a shell of his former self, too broken to go into his usual panic. This journey damaged him, and your refusal to play by the Great One's rules essentially means Kyle is forced to break his part of the deal with the mountain God... with likely terrible consequences. You realize nothing you say will get him to tag along, likely due to his intense fear of confronting the creature face-to-face; instead, he has already decided to spend his remaining time inside the Volcano in company of his lifelong friend... and can you really blame him?<br />
<br />
The Heatmor leader nudges you on the leg and urges you to keep going; he seems to understand your dilemma, but Kyle is beyond convincing at this point - that you managed to avoid fighting him is good enough, but leaving the man behind is the price to pay. Not inclined to wait for you, he urges the remaining anteater survivors to follow him down the tunnel, and as the group marches for the exit you're pretty much forced to tag along, in order to keep them safe. Meowth waves a final goodbye at the heartbroken Doduo, who sits by Kyle's side in silence as they await their judgment.<br />
<br />
You catch up to the Heatmor just as an opening on the far wall comes into view. Determined to see this ordeal through, you boldly exit the tunnel into the next chamber... where a sudden, unexpected hot breeze is blowing. Confused by the air current inside the mountain, you look around for an explanation. The room you find yourself in is by far the largest you've encountered since entering the volcano; a large central rock platform is surrounded by boiling magma all around it; the chamber itself is circular and about as wide as a football field. So huge is the area that it seems to extend upwards indefinitely too, as if it didn't have a ceiling... which it actually doesn't! Looking all the way up, you're astonished to find you can see the night sky in the distance, as if you were staring straight up a chimney... this is Mt. Aduro's main chamber! You've reached the heart of the volcano!<br />
<br />
<b><i>STUBBORN MAGGOT. WELCOME TO MY THRONE ROOM.</i></b><br />
<br />
The familiar voice booms across the room signaling the ominous proximity of the Great One. However, looking around, the place seems deserted - the only noteworthy structures are three massive, unadorned stone pillars on the opposite end of the platform. But just as you begin to wonder what to do next, a yellow claw bursts out of the magma edge and holds on the to the rock platform, followed by a second claw, and then the whole frame of a huge fire demon - the biggest <b>Magmortar</b> you've ever seen! The fire titan takes its place at the center of the room, flames escaping its arm cannons as it eyes you with obvious cruelty and an unsettling grin.<br />
<br />
<b><i>I GROW TIRED OF YOUR DEFIANCE. MY CHAMPION WILL DISPOSE OF THE LOT OF YOU!</i></b><br />
<br />
If His word is to be taken seriously, this gargantuan enemy is the last obstacle between you and the Great One himself... you're closer than ever, but can you handle this deadly foe?<br />
What will you do? </span></span> <br />

<br />
As it turns out, you're not going to budge either. True to your convictions, you're determined to see this through to the end and protect however few Heatmor are left. Kyle looks dejected upon realizing the strength of your resolve, and after contemplating his situation... he falls to his knees.<br />
<br />
- Damn you man! You ain't hurting Doduo. You're going to get us all killed... Just go, the exit's up ahead; I can't face that monster, I just can't. I'm dead either way so... I need a moment with Doduo. Leave me alone, go be a hero.<br />
<br />
He stares blankly at the ground, a shell of his former self, too broken to go into his usual panic. This journey damaged him, and your refusal to play by the Great One's rules essentially means Kyle is forced to break his part of the deal with the mountain God... with likely terrible consequences. You realize nothing you say will get him to tag along, likely due to his intense fear of confronting the creature face-to-face; instead, he has already decided to spend his remaining time inside the Volcano in company of his lifelong friend... and can you really blame him?<br />
<br />
The Heatmor leader nudges you on the leg and urges you to keep going; he seems to understand your dilemma, but Kyle is beyond convincing at this point - that you managed to avoid fighting him is good enough, but leaving the man behind is the price to pay. Not inclined to wait for you, he urges the remaining anteater survivors to follow him down the tunnel, and as the group marches for the exit you're pretty much forced to tag along, in order to keep them safe. Meowth waves a final goodbye at the heartbroken Doduo, who sits by Kyle's side in silence as they await their judgment.<br />
<br />
You catch up to the Heatmor just as an opening on the far wall comes into view. Determined to see this ordeal through, you boldly exit the tunnel into the next chamber... where a sudden, unexpected hot breeze is blowing. Confused by the air current inside the mountain, you look around for an explanation. The room you find yourself in is by far the largest you've encountered since entering the volcano; a large central rock platform is surrounded by boiling magma all around it; the chamber itself is circular and about as wide as a football field. So huge is the area that it seems to extend upwards indefinitely too, as if it didn't have a ceiling... which it actually doesn't! Looking all the way up, you're astonished to find you can see the night sky in the distance, as if you were staring straight up a chimney... this is Mt. Aduro's main chamber! You've reached the heart of the volcano!<br />
<br />
<b><i>STUBBORN MAGGOT. WELCOME TO MY THRONE ROOM.</i></b><br />
<br />
The familiar voice booms across the room signaling the ominous proximity of the Great One. However, looking around, the place seems deserted - the only noteworthy structures are three massive, unadorned stone pillars on the opposite end of the platform. But just as you begin to wonder what to do next, a yellow claw bursts out of the magma edge and holds on the to the rock platform, followed by a second claw, and then the whole frame of a huge fire demon - the biggest <b>Magmortar</b> you've ever seen! The fire titan takes its place at the center of the room, flames escaping its arm cannons as it eyes you with obvious cruelty and an unsettling grin.<br />
<br />
<b><i>I GROW TIRED OF YOUR DEFIANCE. MY CHAMPION WILL DISPOSE OF THE LOT OF YOU!</i></b><br />
<br />
If His word is to be taken seriously, this gargantuan enemy is the last obstacle between you and the Great One himself... you're closer than ever, but can you handle this deadly foe?<br />
What will you do? </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">Kyle fell to his knees as it sank in that he wasn't going to change Keith's mind. He asserted that Keith would not hurt Doduo, and told him to just go, that he wanted a minute alone with Doduo before the Great One would... well, Keith didn't really want to think about that. He still recalled, with unnerving vividness, what fate befell the last thing to outlive its usefulness to the Great One. Keith looked at them, sorry for having to leave them like this, struggling to think of something to say to them, when the Heatmor leader nudged Keith, urging him to go on. By the look in his eye, the Heatmor leader understood what Keith was going through right now, but Keith understood, too- Kyle just couldn't be swayed. His fear of the Great One outweighed any bravery he might have had left in him, and all he asked now was to spend what were sure to be his final minutes alone with his friend.<br />
<br />
The remnants of the Heatmor pack started down the tunnel, and though Keith was still torn, he knew they needed him to come with him, and so he ran after the Heatmor. Meowth, having climbed back onto Keith's shoulder, waved a final goodbye at Doduo, and Gemini and Mustard, as they floated along after them, sent a telepathic message to Kyle and Doduo;<br />
<br />
<i>For what it's worth, even if you had forced him, he wouldn't have hurt Doduo. He'd have found a way to end things without hurting it, that's how he is. Good luck.</i><br />
<br />
Keith caught up with the Heatmor, just as an exit came into sight. Frightened though he was at what horrors might await him next, Keith knew he had to see this through, and he exited the tunnel. The first thing he noticed was a hot breeze, which he didn't see coming at all. He looked around at the enormous room, easily the biggest one he'd been in since entering Mt. Aduro in the first place, bigger even than the chamber in which the pair of Magmar attacked them. A huge rock platform surrounded on all sides by magma, the room itself circular and huge. And as he looked up, Keith gasped- he could see the night sky in the distance! This was surely the main chamber of the mountain- the heart of the volcano!<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa,&quot; Meowth murmured. Keith opened his mouth to say something in response, when-<br />
<br />
<b><i>STUBBORN MAGGOT. WELCOME TO MY THRONE ROOM.</i></b><br />
<br />
That voice- the Great One was surely close by. And yet, as Keith looked around the room, he could see nothing, save for a trio of huge stone pillars on the other side of the platform- until some sort of yellow claw shot out of the magma and grabbed onto the platform. This was followed by a second one, and they pulled up that which they were attached to- it was a fiery Pokémon, immensely large, with cannons for arms and flames adorning its head and shoulders. Even more flames escaped from its arm cannons as it eyed Keith with a most unsettling look.<br />
<br />
<b><i>I GROW TIRED OF YOUR DEFIANCE. MY CHAMPION WILL DISPOSE OF THE LOT OF YOU!</i></b><br />
<br />
Astonished by this sight, Keith took out his Pokédex and aimed it at the creature.<br />
<br />
&quot;Magmortar, a Blast Pokémon. An evolved form of the Magmar,&quot; droned the device. &quot;Lives in volcanic craters. The cannons on its arms can launch fireballs of over 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ho, boy,&quot; Keith murmured. He reviewed his options mentally. He could already see Meowth shaking his head vehemently, and not without good reason- this Magmortar would surely be more than a match for him. Vernon wasn't strong enough to tackle an enemy like this, either. James would be at a horrific type disadvantage, and Godric was likely still exhausted from levitating the Heatmor across that pool of lava. This left only two of the Pokémon he had brought along with him, and as he thought of this, Gemini's voice sounded in his head.<br />
<br />
<i>It might be best to save us for taking on the Great One,</i> the Weezing advised him. <i>Besides, when has she ever let you down?</i><br />
<br />
Keith nodded. Gemini didn't specify what he meant by &quot;she&quot;, but Keith didn't need him to. He produced a Poké Ball from his belt and brought it to full size. Gemini was quite right- inside that ball was a Pokémon who had never disappointed Keith thus far, a Pokémon who would give every battle all she had, and that was unmistakably a lot. Whether she was powerful enough to tackle this Magmortar was unclear, but if Keith had learned one thing in his years of training, it's that sometimes a Trainer's just gotta have faith in their Pokémon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Helga, let's go!&quot; Keith exclaimed, throwing the ball, from which a Hariyama emerged on the rock platform. She had been resting in her ball ever since she saved Keith from the rocks that had fallen on him earlier. Moving those rocks wasn't much of a chore for her, nor was shattering that one rock that had threatened to fall on Keith, but now she had quite a challenge before her. As Helga sized up her sizable opponent, she realized this herself- this Magmortar would be a formidable opponent. She glanced back at Keith, who gave her a confident nod. Helga smiled, nodded back, then turned back to face Magmortar. She would give this battle everything she could and then some.<br />
<br />
And Keith knew this, too. Therefore it was with a confident grin that he gave the orders. &quot;Alright, Helga, use <b>Fake Out</b>!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Then let's use <b>Focus Energy</b>, and follow it up with <b>Arm Thrust!</b>&quot;</span></span><br />

<span style="color: silver"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>Brine Island</i></span><br />
<br />
<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u> Electric Blue Eye</u>:</b> It all comes down to this. You and Sean have now revealed your third Pokemon, ironically neither of which fully evolved. You had half-expected the Water Gym Leader to own a Starter Pokemon, but not quite this one, which raises a number of questions in your mind.<br />
<br />
Be that as it may, you know that standing idly against a master tactician is a terrible idea; as such, you try to predict Dewott's movements while at the same time adapt to the sudden lack of support moves James likes to use. The ability to turn brute force into strategic advantage is a tough skill to acquire, especially in a pinch, but right now, it's the only choice you have. Reasoning that Dewott will likely look to go underwater, you base your orders around that hypothesis to cover your bases.<br />
And indeed, Dewott suddenly makes a run for the hole in the icy floor, only to be met by a timely Thunderbolt by the wary James; however, at the last second, the otter makes a sharp turn to the side and dashes <i>around</i> the lightning, straight at your partner! In an impressive display of skill and agility it picks up both its scalchops, runs the blades along the frozen ground and slashes upwards at blinding speed - a perfect samurai-like <i>Tsubame Gaeshi</i> , the Swallow Return technique, known as <b>Aerial Ace</b> in the western parts of the Pokemon World.<br />
<br />
- Hanzo is the most agile and nimble Pokemon I own. Had he evolved into a Samurott, there was no way his bulky frame could have evaded that Thunderbolt; his style revolves around the swiftness of his strikes and dodges, and we're just getting started!<br />
<br />
Annoyed by the turn of events, James prepares to unleash a much stronger move thanks to the item in his possession; a glimmering Grass Gem that had remained concealed until now, but soon starts to shine an emerald green before shattering into a million pieces. The Gastly growls as he gathers energy and lets loose a huge sphere of Grass-Type energy straight at his foe, who stands idly all the while. Then, in lightning-fast motion, Dewott slices the air in front of him, sending a massive blade of wind straight at the Giga Drain pulse!<br />
<br />
The two moves collide half-way between each Pokemon; despite its considerably larger size, the grass orb is suddenly halted by the Flying-Type move. The [b}Air Slash[/b] cuts through Giga Drain, splitting the sphere in half and causing it to explode before making contact with Dewott! However, the blast disrupts the wind blade and also causes it to vanish - essentially, both moves cancelled each other out! And your Grass Gem is gone regardless...<br />
<br />
- Don't feel bad about yourself. This is the absolute best I have to offer; mere type advantage won't be enough to beat Hanzo. The two of us have an agreement that he won't be used unless I'm fighting Trainers with seven badges, or in special situations such as these. Consider this a proof of respect from me to you, and don't hold anything back!<br />
<br />
James is naturally frustrated; his efforts are being foiled time and again by Hanzo's superior skills, and the longer this goes on the more aggravated he feels. Intent on getting some manner of retribution, the living miasma floats toward the Dewott and envelops one of his arms, covering it with the black mass that forms his entire body; Hanzo struggles to break free, while James painfully tightens his grip on the arm and shoulder. The Water-Type finally manages to break free, and although he had no Held Item to be taken, it seems one of his scalchops is missing!<br />
<br />
Angered by the humiliation of having his single most prized possession taken away, Hanzo immediately retaliates. In unexpected fashion, electricity starts to crackle around his remaining blade, and with a piercing motion, Hanzo unleashes a stream of Electric-Type orbs at James, striking him for frightening damage due to the Water typing forced on him by the earlier Soak!<br />
<br />
- Make him mad and feel the wrath of his <b>Hidden Power</b>! He has learned to tame lightning despite his type's usual lack of affinity, keep that in mind going forward! Although I commend you on taking away one of his weapons, that won't be working twice, and Hanzo is just as effective with one scalchop... difference is, now he's getting serious.<br />
<br />
As he said it, the sea otter suddenly multiplied into <i>six</i> clones in an incredible display of <b>Double Team</b> mastery. All six Dewott have their eyes locked on Hanzo, almost urging him to come at them all, mocking him silently.<br />
<br />
No doubt some of Sean's interventions are meant only to spite you, but one thing's for sure - this Dewott is a terrifying opponent. James isn't going to give up attacking any time soon, the Taunt and this unfavorable round way too fresh in his mind for now.<br />
<br />
Now that you got a taste of what Sean and Hanzo can do, what's your response? </span></span>

Watching as his ghost combated a naturally skilled Samurai on the battle field. Ethan was sure the power displayed just now wasn't all raw talent, he could only imagine the fights Hanzo and Sean had gone through in their lives, the time and dedication it took to get where they are now...<br />
<br />
<i>This battle, this fight against his Dewott is like nothing I’ve ever faced before...Was he just toying with me earlier?

Which by the way I hope we can keep as a souvenir to remember this day...is anything I'm saying to you making sense?'</i></span><br />
<br />
<i>Yea, it is...</i> the trainer smiled. &quot;We might still got a long way to ago to be able to do what you and your Partner do, Sean. But thinking outside the box, that's something we do.&quot; <br />
<br />
Reaching into his backpack Ethan pulled out a <b><a href="http://bmgf.bulbagarden.net/f252/cascadia-124768/index20.html#post5124387" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fbmgf.bulbagarden.net%2Ff252%2Fcascadia-124768%2Findex20.html%23post5124387&amp;hash=4f2601641b16f069cf754d42a342fcb6" rel="nofollow noopener">Fresh Water</a></b> Bottle, the same one given to him by...&quot;Clyde gave me this before coming here, it might sound foolish but I feel like it's a sign, a sign that I can do this. That we can beat you and stand here with the cheering crowd chanting our name.&quot; He took a pitcher's stance tossing the bottle to his Gastly who caught it in mid air, uncapped it and downed the whole thing.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #9933ff">&quot;Ahhhhh~!&quot;</span> the ghost moaned whipping his mouth with his ghostly hand, throwing the empty bottle to the side.<br />
<br />
With a limited pool of moves, Ethan couldn't be afraid to take some chances, after all, whats life without risking something- you don't gain anything from doing absolutely nothing.<br />

<br />
<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> Frustration reaches boiling point when the handsome stranger picks up your Snubbull and asks the bothersome questions. As if witnessing the elderly couple's breakdown and letting the likely perpetrators get away wasn't enough.<br />
<br />
The Fairy-Type barks menacingly along with your outburst, but the man doesn't seem all that fazed. He smiles and gently puts Snubbull back down, pats him on the back and turns his attention back to you while his expression becomes somber again.<br />
<br />
- That temper is going to get you in trouble. Like I said, all I know is you messed with the wrong people. I can't risk telling you anything else out in the open, the city has ears everywhere.<br />
<br />
He takes out a small notebook and a pen from the inside of his coat, scribbles something down and discreetly hands you a piece of paper.<br />
<br />
- You might want to put those to use in the near future. See you around girly.<br />
<br />
You glance at the paper and find two lines of text in it. At first, neither of the two lines of text seems to make sense.<br />
<br />
&quot;1-2237405<br />
I AM A VOICE OF UNREST&quot;<br />
<br />
The first thing that comes to mind, mostly from visual memory, is that the digits resemble those of many Fizzy Bubbles-region phone numbers. But why the sentence beneath it? Is he talking about you, or himself? Is he mocking you for your outburst?!<br />
<br />
When you turn to confront him on the meaning of all this... the man is gone. Snub restlessly sniffs the ground around him and looks at you in confusion. How could he have evaded <i>both</i> of you in that fraction of a second?!<br />
<br />
You're stumped for answers. All you have to go on is a piece of paper with an incomprehensible message and the knowledge that someone is out to get you.<br />
You turn your attention back to the message that stranger gave you, trying to figure it out. People are forced to walk <i>around</i> you to get inside the Pokemon Center while you absent-mindedly try to solve this conundrum...<br />
<br />
Should you ask around for help? You'll risk talking to the wrong people, but someone might help piece everything together for you... Or is there anything you want to try out on your own with this new lead? </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver"><i>I AM A VOICE OF UNREST...</i> the words seemed to echo inside Liza's head as she stared blankly at the piece of paper the mysterious man had given to her before vanishing away. <i>But what does it all mean?</i> she wondered to herself, <i>Does it mean that there are others? Other victims like Oscar and Dana? That there could possibly be a resistance hiding in the shadows? And what about the mysterious man?</i> she just couldn't be sure of anything at this point.<br />
<br />
“Snub?” The cute pink polka dot Pokemon barked at her on the ground disrupting her thoughts as he gave her an inquiring look to why he couldn't seem to track the mysterious man's scent.<br />
<br />
“I don't get it either, Snub” she said kneeling to the ground before she proceeded to pet Snub the Snubbull behind the right ear affectionately, which he loved and automatically caused him to tap his foot rapidly. The lass trainer smiled for all that barking earlier it was hard to believe how sweet natured her Pokemon was but at the same time how brave he could be, “You did an amazing job, thank you sweet heart~” she complimented him before taking out his Pokeball “Now rest darling.” and retrieved him back inside.<br />
<br />
Picking herself up, she dusted her knees of any dirt and tried thinking of what should she do next. If she tried to talk to anyone, she would risk coming face to face with people working against her. Her identity has already been compromised as well...<br />
<br />
She had very little to go on, the only lead she had was the number given to her by a stranger. <i>What if it's a trap?</i> she thought before giving herself a firm respond back, “But it's all I got.” She whispered it to herself like saying it any louder would cause some kind of bad luck. <br />
<br />
With a firm resolve she stood tall and turned toward the red bricked building, passing through the sliding doors of the Pokemon Center once again, the lass trainer headed straight toward the Nurse Joy behind the counter, “Excuse me, while I wait for my Litwick to be let out, do you think you could direct me to a private room? I need to make a very important video-call.”<br />
<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px">OoC: I wasn’t sure if asking for Nurse Joy for something might be considered self updating, but considering the games, anime, and the fact my character’s Litwick is still in the nurse’s care...I went with this option. Let me know of course if it is self updating. Cheers!</span><br />

Running for the lake is fine, making it there is alright but successfully dragging along an NPC into the water while a foe is targeting you is pushing it a little…))</i><br />
<br />
<b>Stacey:</b> The Hydreigon roars as it makes its way down, making the very earth tremble in its wake. You struggle to keep your footing, while the old man seems unfazed and continues to swing his blade randomly in the air, as if you weren’t there, lost in apathy. He seems to be under some kind of outside influence as opposed to being the cause of all this as it first seemed…<br />
<br />
You realize you’re helpless against a raging dragon on your own; besides, you’ve had enough pain to last you a lifetime. You vow that things will be different this time as you summon your faithful partner Dwemer once more. However, this is no wild Stantler…<br />
<br />
The Golett emerges from his Cyberball and faces up at the massive hydra with an unreadable expression, as always. He must know he’s outmatched, both in size and type, but if he’s in any way apprehensive he doesn’t let it shine through. The Hydreigon, in turn, doesn’t seem to even acknowledge the ghost’s presence, its six eyes firmly locked on you with murderous intent as it continues to dive down, looking to bite your head off in one fell swoop!<br />
<br />
Dwemer brings his hands together at the last minute, and suddenly the dragon changes trajectory to a much steeper angle; overpowered by the sudden increase in gravity, it collapses to the floor with a thud so powerful it actually knocks you off your feet and onto your back! Stone shards fly all over the place from the crater left by Hydreigon, who struggles to break free of the intense force pulling him down. Seizing the opportunity, Dwemer concentrates and erects a transparent dome around both him and the foe. Suddenly, it’s as if Hydreigon is moving in slow motion and Dwemer at double speed! The ground beneath you begins to rumble and shake slightly, and just as Dwemer is about to unleash his Earth Power, a sphere of pure darkness expands from the dragon’s body and everything turns black…<br />
<br />
<i>Wake up…</i><br />
<br />
You open your eyes, feeling exhausted. It’d been another nightmare. You wake up in an icy cave, yet another one, as a man that somehow feels familiar is preparing a meal by the bonfire. Connor, the celebrated Hero, looks at you with a smile and cracks a joke to calm you down.<br />
<br />
-	Another sleepless night? Poor child, those nightmares will be the end of you some day…<br />
<br />
<i>But you don’t know Connor, do you?...</i><br />
<br />
You nod and try to put the bad dream behind you. But you can’t forget about it; after all, the nightmares come back every night. You haven’t had a decent night’s sleep since the day the Beast destroyed your village. Since then, as if possessed by some dark entity, all your dreams end in violence in death…<br />
<br />
<i>But you’ve never seen the Beast before, have you?...</i><br />
<br />
Connor’s victory over the Beast had been the most important moment in the history of Fizzy Bubbles, and you witnessed it firsthand. The joy of such a momentous occasion should have been enough to lay your worries to rest, but every time you close your eyes, memories of your family burning to ash come back to haunt you, as if you’re trapped in a “dark void” that always envelops you when you fall asleep…<br />
<br />
<i>But Hydreigon can’t trap souls in <b>Dark Void</b>s, can they?...</i><br />
<br />
Hydreigon?... That’s right! You don’t belong here... you don’t know this man, these memories aren’t yours! But you know who they belong to… you can feel it – these are Felicia’s father’s memories!<br />
<br />
A cry of pain suddenly fills your ears and the ice cave fades from view. When you next blink, you find yourself back in the room and witness Hydreigon holding Dwemer in its enormous fangs, threatening to crush it if it keeps increasing the pressure! Unnatural shadows swirl around the three-headed beast and coalesce to vaguely remember a creature riding the dragon’s head…<br />
<br />
<i>Break its hold, weaken its curse!</i><br />
<br />
Something suddenly begins to glow in your hand; you open it to find the <b>Green Feather</b> from before, and watch as its shine grows stronger. The feather starts floating and a familiar voice echoes in the back of your mind.<br />
<br />
<i> Reach for the truth, the light to pierce these shadows…<br />
The old man isn’t who you think, as someone else is about to discover. But is he truly to blame for all this? Or is he too trapped in a dark void of neverending despair? Can a mere human do such a thing?<br />
<b>What is truly responsible for these nightmares</b>?!</i></span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">I'm so very sorry about the mega lateness of this reply. Thank you for agreeing to continue my adventure as a solo run. I hope that I can continue to reply with a little more speed =p<br />
<br />
<span style="color: silver">Despite the overwhelming odds Dwemer stood tall before his trainer, prepared to stop any force that may bring harm upon her. The Hydreigon was large and intimidating and flying right towards Stacey, its three mouths open wide each prepared to fight the other for the first taste, they didn't notice the small ghost in front of her. Dwemer raised his arm above his hand before dropping it just as quickly and Stacey felt the Gravity increase significantly as did Hydreigon who's dive suddenly took a several angle. It crashed into the ground with such force that Stacey yelped as she was thrown to the ground, throwing her arms around her head to protect herself. She removed her shield to see Dwemer standing still as if the intense Gravity was nothing and the mighty dragon was felled. It lay in a large crater struggling against its own weight to move and Dwemer was quick to act on his advantage. A bright energy erupted from his body and formed a dome around him and his foe and he felt light, like he could move much faster than before and Hydreigon appeared to be having an even greater difficulty moving than before. Stacey lay on the cold ground feeling it begin to quake as Dwemer fused his Ground energies below Hydreigon preparing to strike the beast hard before it recover when darkness erupted from the dragon. Stacey saw the darkness and soon after it was all she knew...<br />
<br />
<i>'Wake Up'</i> …. ughh seriously, couldn't she have another 5 minutes, she was really tired. The voice seemed to resound throughout her mind and she groaned in protest opening her eyes which felt heavy from the lack of sleep. She pushed herself up into a sitting postion and rubbed her face sighing as she recalled the dream, no, the nightmare she just had. No wonder she was tired with dreams like that plaguing her mind at night. Her eyes were suddenly drawn to the fire sending out its warmth and light illuminating the icy cave she found herself in. Damn she hated being cold and so she shuffled towards the heat and she noticed a familiar looking man sat close by. <br />
<br />
“Another sleepless night? Poor child, those nightmares will be the end of you some day…” He joked, Connor the celebrated hero joked. Stacey gave a shy smile and nodded but her mind was whirring, she knew of Connor but had never met him … he was long dead before she heard of him yet here he was and she knew him. She rubbed her arms as she thought back to that night, the night the beast destroyed her village. She hadn't slept right ever since that day, the nightmares plagued her every night … wait?? Another voice called out to her, was it the voice of reason?<br />
<br />
<i>But you’ve never seen the Beast before, have you?...</i><br />
<br />
“No,” she whispered, “This can't be right.” She shook her head trying to remove the foreign memories. She could recall Connor and that terrible night so clearly but she had lived in Lilycove City all those years ago. Her family, mother, father and brother had all died in a fire but it was no beast that caused that, no it was humans that killed them … She tried to remember what <i>she</i> recalled of Connor, he had been a hero and defeated the beast all those years ago. She had celebrated along with everyone else only a few years ago but every time she closed her eyes she saw the destruction, she heard the screams and cries of pain and she felt the fear pierce her heart. It was almost as if when she closed her eyes a Nightmare was cast upon her, a Dark Void from which she couldn't escape.<br />
<i>But Hydreigon can’t trap souls in <b>Dark Void</b>s, can they?...</i><br />
<br />
She suddenly remembered Hydreigon, the battle that had been real hadn't it?<br />
<br />
“Dwemer” she exclaimed, her breath misting before her, he was real, she didn't doubt that and here she was stuck in this nightmare. She had to wake up, she had to get out this memory. She was sure it was a memory now, the details were too vivid to be a part of her psyche. She concentrated hard and saw Felicia's father's face before her eyes, these were his memories! How had he achieved this? How was she stuck in his memories?<br />
<br />
A cry of pain filled her ears and her heart began a gallop as she recognised the voice. The memory suddenly melted away to leave her back in the ruins and as she blinked she saw Dwemer within the massive jaws of Hydreigon as it continued to apply pressure to his body. She saw the pain etched on his normally passive features, how had things gotten this out of hand? Suddenly a movement above the dragon's three heads drew her attention away from her suffering Pokemon for a moment. Shadows appears to swirl and take form before her eyes and it resembled something from memory. Something she was sure she had never seen and was the stuff of legends but the fear she felt at the sight of it was real. <br />
<br />
<i>Break its hold, weaken its curse!</i><br />
<br />
Something felt warm in her hand and she opened it to reveal the Green Feather and it glowed with a brilliance that was almost too bright to look directly into but it was too mesmerising to look away. It floated before her and a familiar voice echoed in her mind. <br />
<br />
<i> Reach for the truth, the light to pierce these shadows…</i><br />
<br />
The voice spoke only the truth she felt that and it was full of sense and reason. She turned to look at Felicia's father who continued to swing his sword back and forth, as if in a dream of his own, lost in his own dark void. If he wasn't to blame for this then who was.<br />
<br />
“Or what?” Stacey whispered as if on instinct and she turned to look back at Hydreigon and the swirl of darkness above its heads. Something was there something was controlling it, riding it like a pony. She pieced the information together and her eyes widened as she realised, there was only one creature she knew capable of summoning a Dark Void.<br />
<br />
“Darkrai,” she whispered and shivered as an unknown mirror assaulted her again, was she right? She rose to her feet and locked eyes with Dwemer who was beginning to flail in the dragon's mouth, the pressure from the darkness almost too much for him.<br />
<br />
“Dwemer,” she yelled almost startling herself with the loudness of her voice. He stopped struggling panting in pain as he reached out an arm to her. She reached out one of her own knowing that she would never reach him.<br />
<br />
“I need you, I need my knight,” she yelled and Dwemer's eyes hardened, his mistress needed him. He couldn't be defeated by a dragon. He needed to serve her, to protect her … always. He used his other arm to push against Hydreigon's mouth, determined to free himself. <br />
<br />
“Don't give up, fight against the darkness, I believe in you,” and she truly did despite the situation. She had never felt so strongly about something before but her heart was swelling with pride as she saw him fight. He was strong, he was her champion. Dwemer gave a grunt of effort and suddenly burst into white light and Stacey gasped as he illuminated the entire room, even Hydreigon look uncomfortable by the flash.<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Stacey whispered as he began to grow in size to almost treble the size he was before. His arms lengthened and began to stretch Hydreigon's jaw open to breaking. His weight also shot up to over 300kg and as the light subsidded her mighty Golurk rested not so comfortably in the dragon's jaws, surely it would struggle to hold such a mighty load now?<br />
<br />
“My knight, I knew you could do it” Stacey said with pride nearly choking her voice. Dwemer looked impassive as ever but she swore she saw pride shine in his eyes too. <br />
<br />
“Dwemer I believe our real foe is not Hydreigon but something controlling. Shadows ripple over its head, I believe its Darkrai!” she said not quite believing her own words. “If you target the shadows and aim your attacks there you can get free, we can all be free from this nightmare.”<br />
<br />
Dwemer nodded his much large head and turned back to focus on that point above the head holding him captive.<br />
<br />
“<b>Quash</b> Darkrai to hold it still then illuminate it with a <b>Signal Beam</b>. If that's not enough to bring it into existence or get free lets try a new move, <b>Hammer Arm</b> right to the skulls of all of them!” she yelled feeling her adrenaline pumping ready to see her mighty knight get to work.</span></span><br />

<span style="color: darkorchid"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>Venom Isle</i></span><br />
<br />
<b><u>Plague Swamp</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>DaveTheFishGuy</u>:</b> <i>((Welcome to Cascadia Dave! Hope you enjoy your time in the archipelago, though with your choice of island, it’s pretty clear you didn’t come here for the sightseeing ^^;<br />
<b>Record marker: 1 of 6</b> on-hand Pokemon declared: Croagunk))</i><br />
<br />
One of the goals for any Trainer worth his salt is self-improvement. And tired as you are of sand and heat, you could have chosen a cozier destination for your next adventure, but of all the wonderful places to visit in Cascadia, you chose… the Plague Swamp.<br />
In a way, it reminds you of the Great Marsh you knew so well as a child, but you aren’t delusional – this place is lifeless, dangerous and unforgiving. Jason the Croagunk seems to be taking it fairly well, being naturally conditioned to survive in this sort of environments, but have no such biological advantage.<br />
<br />
With no particular destination in mind, as is often the case of Trainers who seek only to get stronger and face the hardships as they come, you set off on your trip across the swamp, taking care not to breathe too deeply or step on any acid pool. And even then, you’re fully aware that a hundred other natural hazards may threaten your well-being simply for daring to cross this place on foot.<br />
<br />
Despite your best efforts, the foul stench and the humidity in the air start getting to you. Breathing alone is enough make you nauseous, your eyes water when wandering too close to some of the warmer pools of toxic mud and your legs begin to hurt after a while of pulling your feet out of the swampy terrain each time they bury too deep. You’d expected to be met with resistance of some sort, but rather from the local wildlife, not the wilderness itself. The only things getting stronger at this rate are going to be your thighs in their continued effort to keep you from sinking.<br />
<br />
However, after a while, a disconcerting sound not too far away catches your attention. Looking over to a nearby tree (long dead from the toxic waste it absorbed over the years), you spot a pair of Grimer pinning down and preparing to feed on a severely malnourished-looking Tranquill. You doubt the bird would even be strong enough to take flight on its own in its current state, let alone with the two Poison-Types ganging up on it.<br />
<br />
Do you do something about it, or will you let natural selection run its course?</span></span>

<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: DarkOrchid"><span style="font-size: 9px">The further he got into the wetland, the more he wish he'd brought some scuba gear along. Not that he planned on diving into any of the poisonous pools, rather that it would ensure he was breathing clean air. The choking heat and dry air of the Desert of Illusion was bad enough, but this was something else entirely. As he focused on where he was planting his booted feet, he had to ensure that his tendency to breathe far too deeply didn't do him in. A lungful of the wrong gas here could lead to... unpleasant outcomes.<br />
<br />
Jason was fine, the Croagunk hopping from mudbank to poison pile, his rhythmic croaking showing that he was unfettered by the fumes hanging in the air. But his trainer was a different story. After only a few minutes, he began to retch, fighting the urge to take a deep gasp. He would get no fresh air here, such a reaction could make his situation far worse. Instead he took short, shallow breaths, trying to get in as much oxygen as possible with minimal toxic air.<br />
<br />
Eventually he felt like he could continue, only for another challenge to present itself - the clinging mud. The Great Marsh was a picnic compared to this place, the lack of fresh air only adding to his problems. He couldn't get the energy needed to pull himself out of the bog with every footstep without further exhausting himself. At least he could always have Jason pull him out if he got too stuck, but eventually he found a more solid bit of land amid the sea of sewage, where he could catch his breath. &quot;Remind me to pack a rebreather next time.&quot; he spluttered, Jason simply staring at him with his usual stoicism.<br />
<br />
Before he could set off again, he heard a strange noise, almost like the mud he'd just been squelching through. Looking around, he spotted a tree, stout and strong as ones that lived in the middle of wetland needed to be. Aside from being dead. Its trunk stood up like a pillar of rock, the poisons native to the area having extinguished any chance of greenery sprouting from it. Glancing down to its base, he spotted what had drawn his attention. Two living piles of sludge were moving with alarming pace toward a battered bird, before sprouting arms and faces and pinning it down, the avian having no chance to get away.<br />
<br />
None of the Pokémon seemed to have spotted him. As he took a closer look, he noted that the attackers were obviously Grimer, this sort of environment being perfect for them. But the bird, he couldn't place, though it looked... familiar. Suddenly, realisation dawned. It was a Tranquill! The middle stage of the Pidove line on its way through to the adult form of Unfezant. He had half-considered leaving the Grimer to their feast, but knowing what it was... &quot;What would Walter say?&quot; he muttered, thinking back to the little Pidove he'd traded away to someone who could take a little more care of birds.<br />
<br />
Reminding himself of his old friend sealed his decision. He had to intervene, if only to give the Tranquill a scant chance of escape. &quot;Jason, we're going to help out. Dart in and slap one of the Grimer with <b>Fake Out</b>, then heft it away with <b>Strength</b>.&quot; he ordered, the Fighting-type croaking in affirmation, while the fisherman's hand went to his belt, grasping a PokéBall and throwing it skyward. &quot;Let's tip the scales. Nobby, give us some air support!&quot;<br />
<br />
The device split open to release its contents, a stream of light coalescing into a lumpy, purple orb, covered in vents that slowly spewed noxious gasses, but hardly made the swamp any less bearable. A skull and crossbones symbol adorned its front, set below a wide grin and mischievous eyes. The Koffing spun in the air, jovially smiling at his trainer, before spotting the situation at hand, his smirk fading in place of a grimace. &quot;Good to see you're on the same page as us, buddy.&quot; Dave muttered. &quot;Help us out, lance a <b>Psybeam</b> at the Grimer Jason leaves alone to knock it away from Tranquill, then let it bathe in a <b>Flamethrower</b>.&quot; he commanded. The Poison Gas Pokémon nodded, ready to take on his fellow pollution-based creatures. Hopefully the combined forces of two trained Poison-types would be more than a match for the wild Grimer...</span></span><br />

<span style="color: darkorchid"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>Venom Isle</i></span><br />
<br />
<b><u>Bane Forest</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>Ex-Admiral Insane</u>:</u></b> The decision was unexpected to say the least – even for you. With a mind that turns to profit wherever it can be found, suddenly deciding to abandon the promise of considerable wealth in exchange for… what, exactly? For all you know, there may be absolutely nothing waiting for you out in the wilderness of Venom Island. You try to ignore the part of you screaming about how you might not even make it back at all, and gear up to leave the encampment. That nightmare better have meant something.<br />
<br />
You step outside. The air is chilly, the atmosphere as noxious and uninviting as you remember it. You look around, the last thing you need right now is to attract unwanted attention… but there’s nobody around, it seems. Makes sense, considering it’s the dead of the night; on the other hand, not having somebody keep watch over the camp probably isn’t a great idea, considering this is one of the most inhospitable places in all of Cascadia. Oh well, at least it works to your benefit.<br />
<br />
You tiptoe your way toward the main entrance, push open the wooden gate and walk outside… away from the comfort of the encampment’s wall, and into the bleak, dark unknown. You remember what happened just hours before in the quicksand pit, and tell yourself you need to be extra careful now that visibility has diminished even more. Each step may be your last, but you’re determined to get to the bottom of this.<br />
<br />
You brave the darkness as carefully as you can, but mindful of keeping a steady pace throughout; after all, the longer you stay out here, the bigger the odds of running into something nasty and dangerous. Rags follows close behind, which gives you a measure of confidence in a land that is probably overflowing with Poison-Types. You struggle to remember the path toward the mark on the map; even straight lines are hard to follow in these conditions. Still, all you can do now is move forward.<br />
<br />
After what feels like an hour of walking, you start to wonder whether you’re lost, you should be there by now… but the landscape remains the same, silent, barren and hopefully lifeless. Just as you’re about to turn to Rags, the mist surrounding you grows thicker and thicker at an alarming pace, unnatural even, and before you know it, everything around you is a hazy purple. It’s hard to even make out Rags through the fog, and he’s supposed to be no more than a foot away! What the hell’s going on?! Wait…<br />
<br />
You’ve seen this before. In your dream, everything went purple then too! Except then you were floating, thankfully you’re on solid ground now, but if your theory is correct, there should be something else about to…<br />
<br />
<i>You’ve come.</i><br />
<br />
The familiar amalgam of voices is heard, and the spiraling shadows from the dream begin to swirl and coalesce in front of you much like you were expecting. You instinctively take a step back and call for Rags, who doesn’t answer back. Instead, it’s the voices that speak once more.<br />
<br />
<i>I did not expect you to make this choice, Lucas. To my recollection, humans were always much more attached to wealth than reason...</i><br />
<br />
Wait, “<u>my</u> recollection”? The voices spoke in the plural in your dream… The shadows form a sphere, which grows until it reaches about the size of your own head, and a pair of large, ice-cold eyes spread open. It’s… a Gastly!<br />
<br />
<i>Your presence here Lucas… why did you come? I can reach into the deepest recesses of your mind, and see a strong desire for fortune, not unlike many of your kind and once my own. But I cannot read a person’s heart… so, human, why do you risk losing the coin you were promised? Indulge me in this, and I will share the reason why I summoned you here.</i><br />
<br />
You have so many questions swirling around in your head right now that having to <i>answer</i> one of Gastly’s is the last thing you intended. But it seems the mysterious Pokémon will tell you nothing until you humour him…<br />
<br />
What do you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">Well it's certainly been a while hasn't it? Sorry to say that my RP'ing has slightly rusted over the years. But I'm sure I can dig up a new one somewhere in this dreary forest.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorchid">“Ugh,” Lucas sighed as his boot sank one more time through the mud. The cold earth had damped his trousers multiple times by now. The poisonous aura of the place did little to ease him each time he stepped in something wet. He thought back to the last time he and Rags were wading through the forest. It ended up with the two of them sinking through quicksand. Had Rags not been there with a Teleport it may not have ended as well. The two were going to have to stick close together for safety. Especially now that it was night and the two had trouble making out the path ahead of them. There was a mist out that obscured their vision. It’s purple haze reminded Lucas of the fog from his nightmare. <i>’That dream had better meant something’</i> he kept telling himself as he splotched into another puddle of mud.<br />
<br />
He looked back to see if Rags was still following behind. He yelled out into the darkness. “Rags, hurry up.”<br />
<br />
His Pokémon didn’t answer back though.<br />
<br />
Lucas stopped and looked worried back through the mist and dark. “Rags?” There was still no answer. A small pit formed in the trainer’s stomach as the fog surrounded him. He suddenly realized he couldn’t see anything anymore. There weren’t any trees in the distance or even slabs of rock to be seen. The purple haze had become so thick he could barely find his own hands.<br />
<br />
“Rags!” he shouted to nowhere. The mist was getting thicker still. Lucas started feeling it with every breath he took as well. It was just like his dream with nothing but purple mist. The only difference was the solid ground beneath him for support. Then came the voices.<br />
<br />
<i>You’ve come</i><br />
<br />
It was as if they came out of nowhere but then the shadows emerged and bopped around through the fog. “Rags!” Lucas tried shouting one more time. <i>’Where was he?’</i> The collection of voices continued talking to him undisturbed.<br />
<br />
<i>I did not expect you to make this choice, Lucas. To my recollection, humans were always much more attached to wealth than reason...</i><br />
<br />
<i>’My recollection?’</i> Lucas thought. There was more than one voice in the fog he thought. And the shades from his dream were talking of ‘we’ and ‘us’. The shadows started dancing around him, swirling in front of him to coalesce into one, larger orb. The pit in Lucas stomach grew. He had researched the fog and shadows beforehand on his Pokédex when at camp and he had a gut feeling he knew what was coming. Even so, he felt unprepared when the two ice-cold eyes opened up out of nothing and a gap with two fangs emerged to speak to him. It was a Gastly.<br />

</blockquote>Gastlies were also of the Ghost-type Lucas knew. That in combination with its other Poison typing would have made any person frightened to run into one. And even though most trainers expect to run into wild Pokémon, Lucas was shocked to find a spectre talking to him. Lucas looked around, trying to keep a stern face. The mist was all around him and Rags was still nowhere to be seen. He felt very much alone and unprepared. The ghost Pokémon continued talking.<br />
<br />
<i>Your presence here Lucas… why did you come? I can reach into the deepest recesses of your mind, and see a strong desire for fortune, not unlike many of your kind and once my own. But I cannot read a person’s heart… so, human, why do you risk losing the coin you were promised? Indulge me in this, and I will share the reason why I summoned you here</i><br />
<br />
The Gastly probably didn’t know that he had kept the Relic Coppers for now. Lucas didn't know what to say. He was hoping to get answers, not questions from the shades. He still wanted to know why a talking Pokémon dragged him out of his wake. Though shaken by what was happening, he tried to keep his act together. He reached for the inside of his jacket for his cigarettes to light one up. Had someone looked closer, they might have noticed a small shake in his hand as he tried to ignite the lighter.<br />
<br />
Once lit, Lucas took a deep breath of poisonous smoke. Not that he didn't get enough of that from his surroundings already but this was slightly different, to him at least. The lack of oxygen in his breath did the trick as he felt slightly calmer and the questions and uncertainties slipped away from his mind one by one. In his hand the lighter remained lit. He held the lighter closer to the Gastly. As if wondering whether the gas Pokémon might be ignitable. He clicked the lighter off and decided against it.<br />
<br />
Breathing out the smoke, Lucas went back to Gastly's question and gave a stupid grin as he came up with an answer. He was decidedly less scared now. “Why would I make this choice when human spirit goes for wealth? Well because of the human spirit for curiosity of course?” He immediately followed his answer with a laugh, making it doubtful whether Lucas was sincere with his answer in the first place. In his hand he was still twirling the lighter. He clicked it on and held it up, hoping to add some light to his surroundings. He was curious to see if he could scare the gas Pokémon with the fire. “So you tell me, Gastly, what truth is there that I don’t know?”</span></span><br />

<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> The continuous attempts by the Great One to stop you on your journey to the heart of the mountain have rendered most of your team exhausted. Expecting them to hold their own against an oversized Magmortar would be foolish, and Gemini seems to agree. He remains at practically full strength, but advises you to save him for the Great One, should you be fortunate – or perhaps foolish – enough to challenge Him. His reasoning is sound, especially when you remember there is someone else you can rely on to take down the Mountain God’s champion…<br />
<br />
Helga takes her place on the battlefield, facing the giant foe with unwavering determination. It’s not often she finds herself dwarfed by another Pokemon, but if the unexpected reality troubles her, she doesn’t show any signs of it. No hint of fatigue either, despite her earlier intervention in the crumbling tunnel, another testament to her impressive stamina. But will it be enough to stop the Blast Pokemon that towers over her?<br />
<br />
Once more, flames emanate from the creature’s arm cannons, fleeting embers hinting at the raging inferno that burns inside Magmortar’s body. It chuckles ominously at the sight of his opponent, not fazed in the least by the smaller Hariyama, and goes as far as to spread his arms wide and invite Helga to land the first hit for free!<br />
Enraged at the boisterous display, the Fighting-Type complies, and claps her hands vigorously in the blink of an eye, sending a shockwave straight at the opponent which makes it flinch briefly, stunned. It’s not long before it grins again and leaves himself wide open for another attack, easily brushing off the minimal damage from the earlier Fake Out… it’s toying with you!<br />
<br />
Helga sees no reason not to strike again and tightens her focus, determined to topple the overconfident titan. She runs up to the enemy as fast as her bulky build allows and repeatedly rams her huge hands into its chest, over and over again, but Magmortar seems to endure every palm thrust with ease, barely feeling them! To make matters worse, Helga suddenly stops and steps back, wincing in pain much to your confusion… until you see the smoke emanating from her hands and everything becomes clear – the consecutive Arm Thrusts have allowed Magmortar’s <i>Flame Body</i> to leave Helga’s palms <b>Burned</b>!<br />
<br />
You panic for a moment, knowing full well how detrimental an early Burn can be in a match. But Helga’s reaction is vastly different from that of most burned Pokemon… she seems twice as pumped up and determined to slay the giant now! Her <i>Guts</i> cause her to shut her mind off from the pain, even though it’s still there, and adopt another attacking stance, raring to go.<br />
But Magmortar decides to finally have some fun of its own, and raises its arm cannon, releasing a massive fireball straight at the Hariyama! The <b>Flame Burst</b> explodes violently on contact and sends her rolling across the rocky platform until she finally stops dangerously close to the edge…. What terrifying power!<br />
<br />
The odds are definitely not in your favor, but Helga’s resolve is stronger than ever. Can you turn this around?!</span></span> <br />

<span style="color: silver"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>Brine Island</i></span><br />
<br />
<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>Arc_Angel</u>:</u></b> <i>((Welcome back Arc! It’s been a while and we lost a partner along the way, so please forgive any inconsistencies going forward; it’s tough to remember everything so let me know if there are any glaring plot holes I’m overlooking <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite7" alt=":p" title="Stick Out Tongue    :p" data-shortname=":p" />))</i><br />
<br />
You start to piece everything together. Most of it anyway; this is a nightmare, an unnatural one, like all the others you had so far since meeting Felicia and her father – your endless deaths at Lyanazia, the meeting with Connor, even this scenario with Hydreigon and the old man clad in a suit of armor, brandishing a sword and a massive shield, might all be constructs of your slumber… if your assumptions are correct, poisoned by the influence of a mythical Pokemon. And if that’s the case… just what the hell have you gotten yourself into?!<br />
<br />
You try to think rationally, taking comfort in the wise, soothing words in the back of your head that speak as long as the Green Feather glows. The voice is right – you <i>can</i> pierce the darkness and wake up!! Fueled by that belief, your ghostly automaton seems to glimmer with newfound emotion of its own, echoing and amplifying your faith a thousand fold as it grows to gigantic proportions right before your eyes! Dwemer transforms into an imposing Golurk whose size surpasses even that of the shadow-controlled Hydreigon, forcing it to release its hold on the living armor. Dwemer rises to its feet in all its splendor, and now the odds seem to be even!<br />
<br />
<i><span style="color: black">Fool.</span></i><br />
<br />
A new voice, entirely unfamiliar, rings in your head. This one is cold, filled with death, a seducing yet terrifying whisper all in one. It’s soothing and chilling at the same time; it doesn’t need to be loud – the weight of the words alone exudes power and absolute control. You find yourself frozen in place, shivers running madly down your spine under the influence of the devilish voice.<br />
Dwemer, however, seems less fazed, though you can tell he heard it also. The giant leaps towards Hydreigon, looking to pin its dark rider down, but just as it’s about to make contact, both the dragon and the shadowy figure atop its head fade in a cloud of pure darkness, dispersing into the air, only to reform immediately afterwards behind the Golurk.<br />
<br />
<i><span style="color: black">This is my realm.</span></i><br />
<br />
Again the voice – calm, collected, as if stating nothing but the undeniable truth. If it does belong to Darkrai, you’d never had expected Nightmare Incarnate to sound like this. And yet, your conviction is unwavering – only that creature could cause chaos such as this! Dwemer fights back, this time forsaking physical power in favor of a blast of rainbow light. It brings its immense palms forward and shoots a multicolored wave at the darkness surrounding the hydra, and this time, the move seems to hit its mark! It pierces through the shapeless black rider, and with the sound of a gentle breeze, the shadows release their grip on Hydreigon and vanish into nothingness!<br />
<br />
<i>It cannot exist where there is light. Shine your hope on this endless nightmare!</i><br />
<br />
You watch as the massive dragon’s body starts to crack as if made of glass, fissures spreading all over. Soon, the creature crumbles down loudly in a pile of shards like a broken mirror, which in turn dissolve into a mass of shadows that also fades into thin air… Hydreigon is gone!<br />
<br />
-	Is… is it over?<br />
<br />
Felicia’s father is making his way toward you, heavily burdened by the weight of his gear. He´s visibly exhausted but not confused as you’d have expected. He seems to be fully aware of his surroundings and your collective predicament.<br />
Now that no dragon is actively trying to murder you, you take your time to look at the old man once more – in a way, the one responsible for all this, but apparently also a victim at the same time. His pitch-black armor, without a trace of color, is unlike anything you’ve ever seen; each shoulder plate was forged to resemble a young woman’s face – the right plate a bearing a striking resemblance to his own daughter Felicia, leaving you to wonder if the girl portrayed in the left plate could be the sister she kept talking about. It’s an unsettling view, especially when you realize that the chest plate is also crafted to portray the outlines of a human face, and one you’ve seen just recently - no doubt about it, it’s the man from your previous dream… it’s Connor!<br />
The sword he carries in his right hand also catches your eye - on closer inspection, it’s a claymore that was meant to be wielded with two hands; as it is, it’s little more than a burden for the elder, which may in itself be symbolic as well. And finally, the equipment on his left hand: a huge unadorned oval black shield, as tall as the man himself, which Felicia’s father is nowhere near strong enough to carry properly and instead drags along the ground, much like he does the greatsword.<br />
<br />
-	No… we’re still here. Still dreaming. Not even your giant was enough to snap us out of this nightmare…<br />
<br />
Resigned with his apparent fate, the elder sighs and draws closer, intending to place an apologetic hand on your shoulder but finds he can’t so much as raise his arms anymore with everything he’s carrying.<br />
<br />
-	Oh dear, I am so sorry you were dragged into this. No… that <i>I</i> dragged you into this. You must have guessed it by now, but all of this, the mess we’re in, it was my fault. It’s been my fault all along…<br />
<br />
He sits down on the floor, looking dejected. With nothing more to lose, the old man finally decides to come clean.<br />
<br />
-	I never did get around to telling you who I am, though you might have guessed most of my story already. You saw the pictures of the Hero Festival back home, and I know of your brief dream with Connor – those heartwrenching memories you experienced weren’t yours… they were mine. I was there the day the Beast first attacked, the day Connor saved me – and I was there the day it reawakened, on the day of the Festival held in the Hero’s honor. I don’t blame you for not remembering in detail, but I gave a speech that day, on the big stage at the center of Fizzytopia. I believe your friend Jess might have thought of me as Mayor Thompson, but she was mistaken. My name is <a href="http://www.serebiiforums.com/showthread.php?324473-The-Hero-of-Legend-Battle-of-Liberty&amp;p=8069737#post8069737" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.serebiiforums.com%2Fshowthread.php%3F324473-The-Hero-of-Legend-Battle-of-Liberty%26p%3D8069737%23post8069737&amp;hash=ee935b38bbdfae677327ef5ee58b6df2" rel="nofollow noopener">Charles Higginbotham</a>, the child Connor saved and raised since the day he sealed the Beast. You can call me Charlie… that’s what everyone used to call me.<br />
<br />
He stops briefly, takes a deep breath and continues his confessions.<br />
<br />
-	Connor protected me from all physical harm and I owe him my life several times over. But I’ve been cursed since that terrible day… You see dear, I saw my parents die that day. They were burned alive along with the rest of the village while I watched. And that vision haunted my dreams, the memory was there, clear as day, every time I fell asleep. Not a night went by that I didn’t have the same nightmare, even after joining Connor – and I suspect… my terror and anguish, my sorrow and grief, the darkness of my dreams lured <i>it</i>.<br />
I tried to move on, I really did; I moved to Fizzytopia to start a new life, but every time I went to bed, it was there, waiting to feed on my despair. Decades went by and I barely kept my sanity, until I decided I wouldn’t give the creature the privilege of feasting on my pain any longer. I began actively fighting to stay awake for as long as I could, days on end, but it did a number on me. Until the creature reached out to me, begging me to go back to sleep, seducing me with the promise of dreamless nights… It was lying, and I knew it. I hung on as long as I could, until the creature made an unexpected offer…<br />
<br />
This time, he was overwhelmed by emotion, and it seemed as if Mr. Higginbotham was about to burst into tears, but he regained his gentlemanly composure quickly.<br />
<br />
-	It was growing hungry, but tired of tasting the exact same nightmares over and over again… if I found new dreamers for it to feed on, it’d stop haunting me entirely. And, reason twisted by sleep deprivation, I granted its wish… And since I did, I committed countless atrocities to keep appeasing the monster. All I wanted was to sleep peacefully again!...<br />
<br />
He can’t hold it in any more, and finally starts crying inconsolably, decades of pent-up guilt and shame finally overpowering him. And despite his willingness to tell you everything, you now find him too lost in his own anguish to actually tell you the crimes he committed since the first time he gave in to the demon’s will…<br />
<br />
-	I… I can’t believe I… Dear Arceus, what would Connor say!... Everything I’ve done, all the <span style="color: black">terror</span>… I’m so sorry! Felicia, Serena… sorry for all the <span style="color: black">pain</span>, the years of <span style="color: black">torment</span>! I wish… I wish this could all be over, that I could wake up to find out it was all a <span style="color: black">gruesome nightmare</span>. Why… why can’t it end? <span style="color: black"><i>Why don’t we all just die?</i></span><br />
<br />
His voice goes from that of a sobbing old man to a familiarly calm, soothing, terrifying whisper – at the same time that Higginbotham’s eyes turn completely black and his right arm, surrounded by shadows, suddenly gains inhuman strength and swings the massive greatsword straight at your neck!<br />
<br />
Quick, what do you do?!</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u> Electric Blue Eye</u>:</b> Limited to offensive moves against a remarkably crafty foe, you and James are forced to think outside the box while struggling to remain level-headed under the pressure of being watched by such a huge crowd and Gottfried himself.<br />
<br />
You decide to put Clyde’s gift to use, giving James the Fresh Water from before to replenish his energy, something he greatly appreciates – but the six Hanzo clones don’t stay idle either, waving their single scalchop in the air in an elegant pattern you easily recognize as <b>Swords Dance</b>. James might have gotten some health back, but Hanzo has just gotten stronger at the same time…<br />
Determined to lure out the real Dewott, James lets loose a blast of darkness rings right at the clones’ feet; one by one they vanish into thin air, until the last three hop in the air simultaneously, dodging the incoming Pulse – something you and James did anticipate, to which the Gastly quickly replies by dashing forward to try and Lick the real Hanzo! James is forced to choose one clone on the spot while all air airborne… and hits the right one, running his tongue right across Hanzo’s face and causing the last two copies to vanish as well! The Dewott is left stunned by the odd move and the ease with which you saw through his plan – so much so that his muscles seem to lock up while he struggles to regain composure!<br />
<br />
This is the break you’ve been waiting for, and James follows through with your plan by shooting his unique move at the foe – a jelly-like orb that clings to Hanzo’s chest like glue, threatening to go off at any moment! But unlike previous uses of the move, this Gummi Bomb isn’t the usual purple tone… it’s deep blue!<br />
<br />
-	That was a nice plan Ethan. But I’ve seen that last move a couple of times, and as I’m sure you know, it takes the user’s Type as its own… and Gastly’s Type just happens to be Water right now. How much damage to you plan to inflict on Hanzo with that Gummi Bomb again?<br />
<br />
He speaks with a smirk, but you realize it’s a playful tease rather than an arrogant grin. Sean does have a point – Gummi Bomb takes a while to go off, but when it does, will it do any good?...<br />
As you ponder on the matter, Hanzo makes his move. Barely hampered by the time bomb strapped to his chest, and doing no effort at all to remove it, he bolts forward at the incredible speed you’ve grown accustomed to by now and slashes James twice in a a cross motion, again dealing great damage, this time with a <b>X-Scissor</b> twice as powerful as usual after the Swords Dance from before! James tumbles to the ground in pain, and one thing is perfectly clear to you: if you hadn’t used that Fresh Water just now, James would be out for the count at this point!<br />
<br />
Instead of following up with another hit, Hanzo suddenly stops; he smiles at James and reattaches his remaining scalchop to his fur, putting the blade away. The Dewott nods at the foe who’s earned his respect, seemingly inviting the Gastly for a final stand-off. The Gummi Bomb is about to blow too, but perhaps due to Sean’s explanation, the Discipline Pokemon doesn’t seem too bothered with trying to remove it. As dangerous an opponent as Hanzo is, it seems he regards James as a worthy opponent – why else would he risk everything in this next round when he’s been firmly in control for most of the bout? Have he and Sean forgotten you still have Chris in case James goes down? Hanzo’s behavior doesn’t make any sense…<br />
<br />
What do you do?</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> <i>((Every Pokemon Center ever has a Nurse Joy so you can take that for granted, especially since you already interacted with her in this adventure <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite7" alt=":p" title="Stick Out Tongue    :p" data-shortname=":p" />))</i><br />
<br />
Nurse Joy looks confused as she sees you return, after having left so hastily with your Snubbull just minutes before. She looks all the more intrigued when you ask for a private room for a video call – not that the request itself is anything new to her, but more so the fact that it’s made by such a young girl with such a sense of urgency.<br />
<br />
-	Well, I… yes, of course dear! Anyway, your Litwick is almost ready, so you can pick her up when you return. Take this cardkey and head to your left, up the stairs and open the second door on the far wall on the upper floor. First one’s being used and each key’s unique, don’t want people walking in on private conversations right?<br />
<br />
She smiles as she says it but her eyes denote concern and apprehension. She doesn’t have a clue what’s going on but at least she’s cooperating, which is more than you can say for the people you’ve met so far since leaving Oscar and Dana…<br />
You make your way up to the first floor and find the doors on the far wall as instructed. The cardkey slides effortlessly across its designated slot and the video conference room opens before you. Nobody seems to be paying you any attention so you walk inside and let the door close behind you.<br />
<br />
One can never be too cautious, you find yourself thinking. Who can you really trust in this whole ordeal? Oscar and Dana seem to be the victims and there’s very little reason to assume they mean you any harm; if anything, they depend on you. But other than that, who can you truly rely on? The man outside the Pokemon Center looked extremely suspicious, with all his secrecy and the fact that he seemed to know a <i>lot</i> more than he let on. For all you know, even Nurse Joy could be in cahoots with the people responsible for threatening you earlier… what if you just walked into a trap by coming into this room all by yourself? What if they’re monitoring you or keeping tabs on the video-calls? The thoughts alone make you uneasy, but you’re already inside – might as well make that phone call and hope for the best.<br />
<br />
It might be in your best interest to get things done quickly. Will you call someone you know and ask for help? If so, who? Or do you have other plans in mind?</span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Ex-Admiral Insane</u>:</b> <i>((Well, it’s been a really long time hasn’t it? Let’s see if I can remember where I was going with this story without skipping over any details. ^^))</i><br />
<br />
You suggest that human curiosity might trump Man’s hunger for wealth, towhich the Gastly doesn’t respond immediately. It looks at the flame of your lighter longingly, as if overwhelmed by memories of a distant past, and any hopes you might have had of the tiny flame scaring the ghost are quickly crushed.<br />
<br />
-	I wish I could still feel the warmth of that flame... But I digress; my time in your world came and gone a long time ago. I’m with <i>them</i> now, fighting a common enemy… Humanity.<br />
<br />
The Gastly speaks fluently, clearly and without malice despite the contents of his speech.<br />
<br />
-	The humans that came to this Island claim to wish to stop its growth, stating it is detrimental for the neighboring regions. Do you share such a sentiment, Lucas? Or have you found a sudden new interest in matters of ecology once those Coppers lined your pockets?<br />
<br />
So it knew… Then what is this all about after all?<br />
<br />
-	Venom Island is our home. We are many, and will fight to defend it no matter what. It is the will of Arceus to see this Isle grow and prosper until It deems it proper to stop… it is not our place to question the ways of God. Venom Isle will continue to expand naturally, and if Arceus decides that it should consume the rest of Cascadia, then it shall. The humans that took you in seek to stop that process, failing to realize that tampering with it will mean the death of most of us. I am their guardian, their will and this is my plea to you – open the other humans’ eyes… before it’s too late. Before we’re forced to move against them.<br />
<br />
A sudden migraine, more intense than anything you’ve ever felt, makes your eyes water; Gastly’s smoke envelops you ,and the last thing you see is a purple veil before everything fades to black.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
-	Lucas? Lucas, come one, wake up! We got you, come on!<br />
<br />
Your head’s killing you. Everything around you is a blurry mess at first, but when your eyesight adjusts, you find yourself looking up at a familiar face – EPAL member Ria, the girl who recruited you with 3 Relic Coppers and the promise of more to come at the end of a successful mission to prevent Venom Isle’s uncontrolled expansion.<br />
<br />
-	We found you just outside the camp gate, passed out… what the hell happened? Are you alright? Look, we have to head out before night falls – Arceus knows it’s always dark around here even at noon, and we won’t get any recon done at night. If you’re still feeling woozy better get some rest, otherwise we need all the men we can spare in case we get jumped by anything hostile. We need to find out the source of this isle’s continuous growth, but the swamps are pretty much uncharted territory…<br />
<br />
She takes a nearby backpack, straps a single Pokeball to her belt and heads for the group already waiting by the camp’s exit. She turns around briefly, concern clearly visible across her face, and her voice gives away her apprehension.<br />
<br />
-	Lucas… I need to be able to trust you. We’re already in enough danger as it is… you sneaking out in the middle of the night doesn’t exactly fill me with confidence.<br />
<br />
She turns back and prepares to leave; if you mean to follow and join the expedition you better hurry up. Otherwise you can stay at the camp and look around until they return, although people are growing weary of you already, so snooping around might get you in trouble…<br />
<br />
What do you do?</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>Plague Swamp</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>DaveTheFishGuy</u>:</b> Seeing Grimer move about in the venomous swamps doesn’t come as a surprise; if anything, they belong here more than anywhere else, as much a as a living pile of slime can belong somewhere at all. And you even consider letting nature run its course when it comes to them feasting on a solitary Tranquill; after all, the bird in question probably lacked the survival instincts to run away from its predators from the start. But the memory of a former partner, Walter the Pidove, stirs unrest in you, and conflicting feelings start to emerge. You reassess the situation and decide to intervene after all, out of respect for your former companion. And besides, that looks like a terrible way to die…<br />
<br />
Jason heeds your commands and lunges forward at impressive speed, him too perfectly comfortable in this environment. He slaps one of the unaware Grimer, stunning it briefly, and immediately rams into it with all his Strength – unfortunately the Pokemon is mostly made of liquid, so picking it up and hurling it away would be harder to achieve and the Croagunk understands that, being innately familiar with the Type he’s facing. The second Grimer turns around to see what all the commotion is about, while keeping the helpless Tranquill pinned under it. It prepares to retaliate until a rainbow-colored beam strikes it from behind, causing most of its body to dissolve from the powerful hit! Nobby has joined your ranks and evened the playing field, and in doing so, provided ample time for the Flying-Type to escape and take to the skies in a hurry!<br />
But Nobby isn’t done, and the smart Jason sees what’s coming a mile away, running back towards you just in time: the Koffing lets loose a stream of flames from its body, aiming it at the two Grimer… but the gases in the area prove to be highly flammable, causing the Flamethrower to explode in a massive blast of fire that sends embers flying in all directions! The two foes scurry away, retreating into the darkness of the swamp frightened by your power… but after such a display of strength, you watch as the long-dead trees in front of you light up in flames from the previous explosion, threatening to start a rampant wildfire!<br />
<br />
The smell of burnt wood mixes with the already intense odors of the swamp to create an even more nauseating scent. Several branches have caught fire already, but before you can (or even need to) do something about it, rainclouds suddenly gather up above and a heavy downpour quickly puts out the would-be inferno and kicks up a cloud of noxious vapors… while soaking you to the bone in the process.<br />
<br />
-	What the <i>hell</i> do you think you’re doing?!<br />
<br />
A middle-aged woman sudden emerges from the smoke, accompanied by a large Ludicolo. She’s clad in a strange green and brown outfit, like a custom-made tracksuit, her red hair caught up in a ponytail and an angry expression on her face.<br />
<br />
-	Setting fire to what little plantlife could still be salvaged from this desecrated land, is that how low you’ve stooped? You Keepers are nothing more than filthy murderers, you want this wretched Isle to keep growing and growing until it engulfs everything, and Cascadia becomes as dead as your empty hearts! We won’t let you, we’ll bring life back to this land if it’s the last we do!!<br />
<br />
Suddenly, something whistles just past your ear, the sound of a needle flying dangerously close to the side of your head that makes you instinctively turn your confused gaze away from the enraged woman and towards whatever it was that just tried to kill you!<br />
<br />
-	One more step and you’re gone, filthy Healer! What gave you the right to deprive those Grimer of their food? You won’t rest until you’ve completely disrupted the natural balance of this Island, will you? Bad day to get lost, pretentious crusader; Venom Isle’s prosperity will not be disturbed, not by you or any of your blinded, self-important, so-called “nature lovers”.<br />
<br />
Behind you stands a tall, black-haired man with a scar across his left eye; his features are stern and more collected than the woman’s, but it’s pretty clear he’s just as mad at you for what just happened. The man is clad in similarly unusual attire, mostly black and purple, and a huge Arbok coils itself around him – no doubt that needle just now was a Poison Sting… <br />
Both of them stare coldly at one another, then straight at you, and angrily ask you almost in unison:<br />
<br />
-	You’re with <i>them</i>, aren’t you?!</span> </span><br />

<br />
<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> The continuous attempts by the Great One to stop you on your journey to the heart of the mountain have rendered most of your team exhausted. Expecting them to hold their own against an oversized Magmortar would be foolish, and Gemini seems to agree. He remains at practically full strength, but advises you to save him for the Great One, should you be fortunate – or perhaps foolish – enough to challenge Him. His reasoning is sound, especially when you remember there is someone else you can rely on to take down the Mountain God’s champion…<br />
<br />
Helga takes her place on the battlefield, facing the giant foe with unwavering determination. It’s not often she finds herself dwarfed by another Pokemon, but if the unexpected reality troubles her, she doesn’t show any signs of it. No hint of fatigue either, despite her earlier intervention in the crumbling tunnel, another testament to her impressive stamina. But will it be enough to stop the Blast Pokemon that towers over her?<br />
<br />
Once more, flames emanate from the creature’s arm cannons, fleeting embers hinting at the raging inferno that burns inside Magmortar’s body. It chuckles ominously at the sight of his opponent, not fazed in the least by the smaller Hariyama, and goes as far as to spread his arms wide and invite Helga to land the first hit for free!<br />
Enraged at the boisterous display, the Fighting-Type complies, and claps her hands vigorously in the blink of an eye, sending a shockwave straight at the opponent which makes it flinch briefly, stunned. It’s not long before it grins again and leaves himself wide open for another attack, easily brushing off the minimal damage from the earlier Fake Out… it’s toying with you!<br />
<br />
Helga sees no reason not to strike again and tightens her focus, determined to topple the overconfident titan. She runs up to the enemy as fast as her bulky build allows and repeatedly rams her huge hands into its chest, over and over again, but Magmortar seems to endure every palm thrust with ease, barely feeling them! To make matters worse, Helga suddenly stops and steps back, wincing in pain much to your confusion… until you see the smoke emanating from her hands and everything becomes clear – the consecutive Arm Thrusts have allowed Magmortar’s <i>Flame Body</i> to leave Helga’s palms <b>Burned</b>!<br />
<br />
You panic for a moment, knowing full well how detrimental an early Burn can be in a match. But Helga’s reaction is vastly different from that of most burned Pokemon… she seems twice as pumped up and determined to slay the giant now! Her <i>Guts</i> cause her to shut her mind off from the pain, even though it’s still there, and adopt another attacking stance, raring to go.<br />
But Magmortar decides to finally have some fun of its own, and raises its arm cannon, releasing a massive fireball straight at the Hariyama! The <b>Flame Burst</b> explodes violently on contact and sends her rolling across the rocky platform until she finally stops dangerously close to the edge…. What terrifying power!<br />
<br />
The odds are definitely not in your favor, but Helga’s resolve is stronger than ever. Can you turn this around?!</span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">It's said that Pokémon take on the characteristics of their Trainers, and right now, it was clear to see that Helga was no exception. Her Trainer, Keith Masters, continually defied the Great One, the god of Mt. Aduro, despite anything and everything that happened along the way, his stubbornness and determination overpowering any sort of fear of the insurmountable odds he faced. And the same could be said for Helga- the Hariyama was, most unusually for her, looking <i>up</i> at her adversary, rather than down. The Magmortar was huge, even for its own species, but this wasn't gonna stop Helga, not by a long shot.<br />
<br />
Of course, this bravery only seemed to amuse the Magmortar, who chuckled at the sight of its smaller opponent. It spread its arms wide, daring Helga to make the first move. Incensed by this, Helga clapped her massive hands together, resulting in a shockwave which made the massive Magmortar flinch. Once the flinching wore off, however, Magmortar... merely left itself open to another attack! It was toying with Helga, and seemed to not have felt the Fake Out at all!<br />
<br />
&quot;Dang, dat Magmortar's tough,&quot; remarked Meowth.<br />
<br />
&quot;I expected nothing less,&quot; Keith replied, as Helga tightened her focus. &quot;Helga, Arm Thrust!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yama!&quot; Helga grunted, as she charged forward as best as she could, considering her considerable bulk, and rammed her massive hands into the Magmortar's chest, again, and again, and again. Despite the power she was putting into these strikes, Magmortar didn't seem fazed in the slightest- in fact, if Keith didn't know any better, he'd guess it wasn't harmed by the move at all! But he didn't jump to that conclusion- no, he knew the move had to be having an effect on Magmortar, even if it wasn't showing any outward signs of said effect. Helga was a strong Pokémon, Keith knew. But then, Helga staggered backward, wincing in pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Helga?!&quot; Keith exclaimed. &quot;What the-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hari...&quot; grunted Helga, as she glanced at her hands- they were smoking, they had been burned. Desperate for an explanation, Keith turned his Pokédex on Magmortar and pressed a button.<br />
<br />
&quot;Flame Body- Magmortar's Ability,&quot; droned the device. &quot;Physical contact with Magmortar may result in burns.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arceus damn it!&quot; Keith grunted. &quot;I didn't know Magmortar had Flame Body...&quot;<br />
<br />
But as Keith was starting to panic at this most unexpected development, Helga was reacting quite differently. She looked down at her burnt, smoking palms, and far from feeling weakened by the burns, as would be the case for most any Pokémon, it only seemed to be strengthening her resolve. No. No way in hell was she gonna let this hold her back. Not this, not anything. Even though she didn't know the full extent of the situation's severity, she did know that Keith was counting on her to take out this formidable Magmortar, and she was pretty sure it wasn't some mere friendly competition, either, that something very big was at stake here.<br />
<br />
Helga thought back to her youth, when she was first traded to Keith as an eager-to-please Makuhita, perpetually worried about being traded away for yet another rock-bottom price, like with Levin and James. It took a long time for Keith to finally get it through to her that she was a permanent fixture of the team, a part of the family, but once he did, the two had been closer than ever before. As it finally sank in, as she finally evolved into her formidable Hariyama form and proceeded to kick the Tauros's ass just as Keith believed she could, she resolved to never let her Trainer down. For all the kindness he showed her, for seeing in her the potential nobody else saw, and for bringing out said potential in her, she owed it to him to do her very best. And she'd be damned if she'd let a stupid little burn get in her way.<br />
<br />
&quot;HariYAAMAAAAAAA!!!&quot; Helga bellowed, her cries echoing around the tremendous room. This got Keith's attention, and he looked back up at his Hariyama, who, far from looking weakened by her burnt palms, looked more resolute and determined than usual. She seemed to be radiating an aura of power, and was glaring up at the Magmortar, silently guaranteeing its utter defeat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Helga?&quot; Keith murmured. &quot;Wha- is this what I think it is?&quot; In response, his Pokédex chimed in yet again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guts- Hariyama's Ability,&quot; droned the device. &quot;When Hariyama is affected by a status condition such as poisoning or a burn, its attack power goes up, and a burn will not reduce its attack power at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hah... yeah!&quot; Keith exclaimed, a grin growing wider on his face by the second. &quot;That's right- Helga's Ability is Guts! That burn's just gonna make her even stronger! You got this, Helga!&quot; he exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Magmortar, however, seemed to think different, and finally went on the offensive. Raising an arm cannon, it fired off a huge fireball- a Flame Burst! It exploded violently upon contact with the Hariyama, and sent her skidding back. Keith held his breath, his hand scrambling for Helga's Poké Ball, for she was coming dangerously close to the edge! But thankfully, she managed to stop herself, and she still looked ready to go.<br />
<br />
Breathing a sigh of relief at the fact that she wasn't falling to her doom, Keith began to piece together a strategy in his mind. &quot;OK, Helga,&quot; he said. &quot;You can do this, so let's get moving! Give it a taste of your <b>Force Palm</b> attack, then try and weaken it with a <b>Rock Smash</b>, followed by another <b>Force Palm</b>!&quot;</span></span><br />

<br />
<b><u>Salin City</u></b><u><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u> Electric Blue Eye</u>:</b> Limited to offensive moves against a remarkably crafty foe, you and James are forced to think outside the box while struggling to remain level-headed under the pressure of being watched by such a huge crowd and Gottfried himself.<br />
<br />
You decide to put Clyde’s gift to use, giving James the Fresh Water from before to replenish his energy, something he greatly appreciates – but the six Hanzo clones don’t stay idle either, waving their single scalchop in the air in an elegant pattern you easily recognize as <b>Swords Dance</b>. James might have gotten some health back, but Hanzo has just gotten stronger at the same time…<br />
Determined to lure out the real Dewott, James lets loose a blast of darkness rings right at the clones’ feet; one by one they vanish into thin air, until the last three hop in the air simultaneously, dodging the incoming Pulse – something you and James did anticipate, to which the Gastly quickly replies by dashing forward to try and Lick the real Hanzo! James is forced to choose one clone on the spot while all air airborne… and hits the right one, running his tongue right across Hanzo’s face and causing the last two copies to vanish as well! The Dewott is left stunned by the odd move and the ease with which you saw through his plan – so much so that his muscles seem to lock up while he struggles to regain composure!<br />
<br />
This is the break you’ve been waiting for, and James follows through with your plan by shooting his unique move at the foe – a jelly-like orb that clings to Hanzo’s chest like glue, threatening to go off at any moment! But unlike previous uses of the move, this Gummi Bomb isn’t the usual purple tone… it’s deep blue!<br />
<br />
-	That was a nice plan Ethan. But I’ve seen that last move a couple of times, and as I’m sure you know, it takes the user’s Type as its own… and Gastly’s Type just happens to be Water right now. How much damage to you plan to inflict on Hanzo with that Gummi Bomb again?<br />
<br />
He speaks with a smirk, but you realize it’s a playful tease rather than an arrogant grin. Sean does have a point – Gummi Bomb takes a while to go off, but when it does, will it do any good?...<br />
As you ponder on the matter, Hanzo makes his move. Barely hampered by the time bomb strapped to his chest, and doing no effort at all to remove it, he bolts forward at the incredible speed you’ve grown accustomed to by now and slashes James twice in a a cross motion, again dealing great damage, this time with a <b>X-Scissor</b> twice as powerful as usual after the Swords Dance from before! James tumbles to the ground in pain, and one thing is perfectly clear to you: if you hadn’t used that Fresh Water just now, James would be out for the count at this point!<br />
<br />
Instead of following up with another hit, Hanzo suddenly stops; he smiles at James and reattaches his remaining scalchop to his fur, putting the blade away. The Dewott nods at the foe who’s earned his respect, seemingly inviting the Gastly for a final stand-off. The Gummi Bomb is about to blow too, but perhaps due to Sean’s explanation, the Discipline Pokemon doesn’t seem too bothered with trying to remove it. As dangerous an opponent as Hanzo is, it seems he regards James as a worthy opponent – why else would he risk everything in this next round when he’s been firmly in control for most of the bout? Have he and Sean forgotten you still have Chris in case James goes down? Hanzo’s behavior doesn’t make any sense…<br />
<br />

<span style="color: silver">Ethan tried not to let the pressure get to him, with what having to battle in front of what could of easily have been the biggest audience he had ever seen, and proving that he deserved to be on this stage. He was bond to make a few mistakes, but he might've just made the biggest one of his career. He had completely forgotten that his Pokemon's type had changed from <i>Ghost/Poison</i> to <i>Water</i>. <br />
<br />
He tried to conceal his Poker face, pretending that every thing was just going as planned...when he realized something, maybe things weren't as bad as Ethan was making them out to be...<br />
<br />
The blast of the Gummi Bomb didn't need to be large to amount to be useful, though it might of helped....it did however allow a small window of opportunity when set off for explosion, they would have one good chance to strike when the enemy would be too stunned after the blast to react fast enough.<br />
<br />
Yes this could work to their advantage...but something changed in the Dewott's behavior that made Ethan question everything. From the beginning the water starter had shone great swordsmonship, none like he had ever seen before; except maybe his Scyther Razor....So when he saw that Hanzo, instead of maneuvering far away from them, was just standing there, egging them on to fight one on one, no more tricks, just brute force and skill. Ethan had to question if he should risk everything they had accomplished till now for this one chance...<br />
<br />
<i>Could this be a plan in the works? They did just power up severely...Are they just looking to see if we will lower our guard? Did they forget I still have Snivy in my court? Or is this a sign that they were impressed enough to face us on toe to toe?</i><br />
<br />
Ethan wasn't too sure, part of him told him to <i>approach with caution</i> but another part of him screamed to <i>go for it!</i><br />
<br />
If anything were go wrong however he had a back up plan in place, he always did. Something he had learned long ago as a traveling trainer was to always be prepared, for anything! <br />
<br />
But at the end of the day, he had to admit that this battle was one for the history books. He was just happy James was able to gain some experience by fighting a Pokemon of the 2nd stage variety. Hoping that it would allow them to grow, if only to be able to catch one one day.<br />
<br />
<i>James...I can feel it, the end is drawing near. I want you, my dear friend to do your best and finish this.</i><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #9933ff"><i>'What about Chris?'</i></span><br />
<br />
<i>I want you to do this, you are my starter. Just like Hanzo is Sean's. It'd mean so much more if you were to deliver the decisive final blow.</i><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #9933ff"><i>'That's a lot of pressure you're putting on me...'</i></span><br />
<br />
<i>No pressure, just faith. I believe in you.</i><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #9933ff"><i>'Alright...let's do this!!'</i></span> Gastly prepared himself.<br />
<br />
<i>James, I remember you telling me once you used to be a boxer back in the day...</i> the boy grinned.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #9933ff"><i>'Ahhh, I see where you're going with this!'</i></span><br />
<br />
<i>A one, two knock out punch! Go for a <b>x2 Thunder Punch</b> back to back, but remember to keep your distance we don't know what they have planned and I don't want you to be caught up in the blast when the Gummi finally does go off. Use <b>Sucker Punch</b> if the times calls for it, otherwise a <b>Giga Drain</b> will do nicely! And James...</i><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #9933ff"><i>'Yea?'</i></span><br />
<br />
<i>You got this!</i></span></span><br />

<span style="color: darkorchid"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>Venom Isle</i></span><br />
<br />
<b><u>Plague Swamp</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>DaveTheFishGuy</u>:</b> Seeing Grimer move about in the venomous swamps doesn’t come as a surprise; if anything, they belong here more than anywhere else, as much a as a living pile of slime can belong somewhere at all. And you even consider letting nature run its course when it comes to them feasting on a solitary Tranquill; after all, the bird in question probably lacked the survival instincts to run away from its predators from the start. But the memory of a former partner, Walter the Pidove, stirs unrest in you, and conflicting feelings start to emerge. You reassess the situation and decide to intervene after all, out of respect for your former companion. And besides, that looks like a terrible way to die…<br />
<br />
Jason heeds your commands and lunges forward at impressive speed, him too perfectly comfortable in this environment. He slaps one of the unaware Grimer, stunning it briefly, and immediately rams into it with all his Strength – unfortunately the Pokemon is mostly made of liquid, so picking it up and hurling it away would be harder to achieve and the Croagunk understands that, being innately familiar with the Type he’s facing. The second Grimer turns around to see what all the commotion is about, while keeping the helpless Tranquill pinned under it. It prepares to retaliate until a rainbow-colored beam strikes it from behind, causing most of its body to dissolve from the powerful hit! Nobby has joined your ranks and evened the playing field, and in doing so, provided ample time for the Flying-Type to escape and take to the skies in a hurry!<br />
But Nobby isn’t done, and the smart Jason sees what’s coming a mile away, running back towards you just in time: the Koffing lets loose a stream of flames from its body, aiming it at the two Grimer… but the gases in the area prove to be highly flammable, causing the Flamethrower to explode in a massive blast of fire that sends embers flying in all directions! The two foes scurry away, retreating into the darkness of the swamp frightened by your power… but after such a display of strength, you watch as the long-dead trees in front of you light up in flames from the previous explosion, threatening to start a rampant wildfire!<br />
<br />
The smell of burnt wood mixes with the already intense odors of the swamp to create an even more nauseating scent. Several branches have caught fire already, but before you can (or even need to) do something about it, rainclouds suddenly gather up above and a heavy downpour quickly puts out the would-be inferno and kicks up a cloud of noxious vapors… while soaking you to the bone in the process.<br />
<br />
-	What the <i>hell</i> do you think you’re doing?!<br />
<br />
A middle-aged woman sudden emerges from the smoke, accompanied by a large Ludicolo. She’s clad in a strange green and brown outfit, like a custom-made tracksuit, her red hair caught up in a ponytail and an angry expression on her face.<br />
<br />
-	Setting fire to what little plantlife could still be salvaged from this desecrated land, is that how low you’ve stooped? You Keepers are nothing more than filthy murderers, you want this wretched Isle to keep growing and growing until it engulfs everything, and Cascadia becomes as dead as your empty hearts! We won’t let you, we’ll bring life back to this land if it’s the last we do!!<br />
<br />
Suddenly, something whistles just past your ear, the sound of a needle flying dangerously close to the side of your head that makes you instinctively turn your confused gaze away from the enraged woman and towards whatever it was that just tried to kill you!<br />
<br />
-	One more step and you’re gone, filthy Healer! What gave you the right to deprive those Grimer of their food? You won’t rest until you’ve completely disrupted the natural balance of this Island, will you? Bad day to get lost, pretentious crusader; Venom Isle’s prosperity will not be disturbed, not by you or any of your blinded, self-important, so-called “nature lovers”.<br />
<br />
Behind you stands a tall, black-haired man with a scar across his left eye; his features are stern and more collected than the woman’s, but it’s pretty clear he’s just as mad at you for what just happened. The man is clad in similarly unusual attire, mostly black and purple, and a huge Arbok coils itself around him – no doubt that needle just now was a Poison Sting… <br />
Both of them stare coldly at one another, then straight at you, and angrily ask you almost in unison:<br />
<br />
-	You’re with <i>them</i>, aren’t you?!</span> </span>

</blockquote><span style="color: DarkOrchid"><span style="font-size: 9px">As the scene played out, Dave grew more confident in his actions. He may not have owned Walter for long, but the Pidove had left a lasting impression on the fisherman. He couldn't consign the poor Tranquill to such a gruesome end, not while he could do something about it.<br />
<br />
Jason proved that all his training and meditation had been for some benefit, darting forward at blinding speed across the swamp, smacking his hands into one of the Grimer and sending it reeling, before shoving it away. The move could shift boulders, why not a pile of living goo? As for the other Poison-type, it's attention was drawn by Jason's manhandling of its colleague, leaving an opening for Nobby to launch a mental attack. Dave grinned slightly as the multicoloured Psybeam caused the Grimer to almost dissolve into a shapeless pile of slime, releasing its hold on the the Tranquill. The avian took its chance, flapping into the air and away from the death-ridden swamp.<br />
<br />
His task done, Nobby didn't stop there, inflating his spherical body as he prepared his next move. Jason quickly got out of the way, the Croagunk's Anticipatory nature perhaps helping him realise what was coming as he hopped back to his trainer, Dave's brow creasing in slight confusion as the Koffing released a firestream from his maw. What was there to be scared of? Unless... &quot;Oh, shi--&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Whoomph.</i><br />
<br />
The sound was almost gentle, until the shockwave threatened to blow him off his feet. Ironically, the stickiness of the swamp was the only thing keeping him upright, working to his benefit for once. The trainer gritted his teeth at his own stupidity. Even in a normal marsh, there were the scents of decay if you stirred up the wrong bits of soggy soil, releasing noxious and potentially flammable gases to the surface. In such a toxic, deadly place, the effect could only be multiplied!<br />
<br />
Still, the attack seemed to have the desired effect, Dave just about seeing the two Grimer squelching away beyond the firestorm... but also an undesired one. The trees he'd thought completely petrified caught alight from the spread embers. The stench was awful as the dead wood burned, causing the trainer to cover his mouth again, looking around for his Pokémon. Jason was still at his side, having hunkered down by his leg for the blast, while Nobby was quickly floating toward him, the explosion having blown his lightweight body back a fair way. But he was safe, for now. But of course there was now the threat of an imminent wildfire!<br />
<br />
Fumbling at his belt, the fisherman tried to scramble for a Pokémon to help - almost half of his entire team were Water-type, for Arceus' sake! Detaching one, he made to lob it forth, but before he could he noticed the weather take a turn for the worse. Thick rainclouds materialised from nowhere, issuing a torrent of water that almost instantly doused the fires... and left him drenched. &quot;Why'd I leave Fred behind?&quot; he muttered to himself, wanting nothing more than to spread out on the Torkoal's warm shell right about now.<br />
<br />
But there was something... off about the clouds. They didn't seem natural... Before he could figure it out, his attention was grabbed by an angry-sounding voice. Turning, he observed movement in the smoke left by the extinguished fire, an older woman dressed in green and brown stepping forth, along with a Pokémon that was undoubtedly the source of the rainstorm - a Ludicolo. He recognised it easily, having seen Crasher Wake's own specimen in action as part of the team he used against more advanced trainers.<br />
<br />
However, this was no time to get lost in thinking of his mentor. The woman was clearly angry with him for inadvertently starting the fire, but... there was something else at work here. <i>'Keepers?'</i> he thought to himself, wondering what on earth she meant. He certainly didn't want the filth of this island to spread any further - if much more toxic waste got into the ocean it could affect the entire Fizzytopia region!<br />
<br />
Before he could protest his innocence, he flinched to the side as the piercing whistle of something sharp and <i>far</i> too close blew past his ear. Catching himself, he whipped around, spotting another trainer and Pokémon duo, this one slightly more at home in the poisonous pit. A gigantic serpent, hood flared and jaws agape, coiled around a man clad in black and purple. He was similarly enraged, but instead because he'd dared to save the Tranquill from the Grimer.<br />
<br />
He steadied his breathing, noticing that it had become erratic at the near-miss. He'd had Poison Stings fired at him before, mostly from Carcer, his psychopathic Qwilfish, but he'd always seen them coming. The creature he recognised as an Arbok could have hit him dead-on had it wanted to, but had purposefully fired a warning shot. The sight of the reptile caused his thoughts to shift to one of the PokéBalls at his belt for a minute before snapping back to the here and now. Each party thought that he was with the other, these 'Keepers' and 'Healers' clearly being rival factions. Some kind of turf war for the Island's ecology... and he was caught in the middle.<br />
<br />
Slowly, he turned so that he could see both of them, raising one hand to each in a peaceful gesture. His Pokémon reacted differently - Nobby began to orbit him, his features turning from the Ludicolo to the Arbok in turn, while Jason didn't take kindly to the attempt on his trainer's life, stepping between Dave and the man with the Arbok, fists raised in a fighting stance, making plain his intentions if the snake were to try again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not <i>with</i> anyone aside from my Pokémon here.&quot; he stated, loud and clear to both sides. &quot;Obviously I've stumbled into something I wasn't meant to here, but I have no allegiances to anyone, my Pokémon excepted.&quot; He looked from one to the other. If he was quick enough to summon his four other Pokémon, there was a chance he could take both of them, but he'd rather it not come to that. &quot;Just what in Arceus' name is going on here, anyway? You,&quot; he turned to the woman in green, &quot;clearly want to try to reverse the damage done to this island, while you,&quot; and now he glanced at the purple-dressed man, &quot;don't, for whatever reason. And for the record, I didn't much want to see an innocent Tranquill die right in front of me. I'm all for the balance of nature, but I have to draw the line somewhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
His eyes darted between both of them. This could all get very messy very quickly, he just had to hope they believed him. Why did things have to be so complicated...</span></span><br />

<span style="color: silver"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>Brine Island</i></span><br />
<br />
<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> <i>((Every Pokemon Center ever has a Nurse Joy so you can take that for granted, especially since you already interacted with her in this adventure <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite7" alt=":p" title="Stick Out Tongue    :p" data-shortname=":p" />))</i><br />
<br />
Nurse Joy looks confused as she sees you return, after having left so hastily with your Snubbull just minutes before. She looks all the more intrigued when you ask for a private room for a video call – not that the request itself is anything new to her, but more so the fact that it’s made by such a young girl with such a sense of urgency.<br />
<br />
-	Well, I… yes, of course dear! Anyway, your Litwick is almost ready, so you can pick her up when you return. Take this cardkey and head to your left, up the stairs and open the second door on the far wall on the upper floor. First one’s being used and each key’s unique, don’t want people walking in on private conversations right?<br />
<br />
She smiles as she says it but her eyes denote concern and apprehension. She doesn’t have a clue what’s going on but at least she’s cooperating, which is more than you can say for the people you’ve met so far since leaving Oscar and Dana…<br />
You make your way up to the first floor and find the doors on the far wall as instructed. The cardkey slides effortlessly across its designated slot and the video conference room opens before you. Nobody seems to be paying you any attention so you walk inside and let the door close behind you.<br />
<br />
One can never be too cautious, you find yourself thinking. Who can you really trust in this whole ordeal? Oscar and Dana seem to be the victims and there’s very little reason to assume they mean you any harm; if anything, they depend on you. But other than that, who can you truly rely on? The man outside the Pokemon Center looked extremely suspicious, with all his secrecy and the fact that he seemed to know a <i>lot</i> more than he let on. For all you know, even Nurse Joy could be in cahoots with the people responsible for threatening you earlier… what if you just walked into a trap by coming into this room all by yourself? What if they’re monitoring you or keeping tabs on the video-calls? The thoughts alone make you uneasy, but you’re already inside – might as well make that phone call and hope for the best.<br />
<br />
It might be in your best interest to get things done quickly. Will you call someone you know and ask for help? If so, who? Or do you have other plans in mind?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver">A sigh of relief fell over the young women when the door finally shut behind her. Though she kept expecting someone or something to jump out of the darkness and attack, when nothing did however she could finally take it easy knowing that no one else could get into her room without a keycard, which brought a rather welcoming feeling.<br />
<br />
She was beginning to realize now however, that she was becoming easily agitated and paranoid at every little thing she did. Looking closer to who was around her, and was ready to fight if someone so much as tried to approach her...<br />
<br />
She began to shake slightly, as she grabbed her left arm with her right hand, trying to calm herself down a bit. Her feelings of bravery were quickly being replaced with a much stronger feeling of fear. With thoughts she didn't want to admit or was ready to face...<br />
<br />
<i>What if that black van had gotten me...?</i> she asked herself, having had the thought at the back of her mind since the mysterious gentlemen had stopped her from pursing the individual/s that had sent her the threatening note.<br />
<br />
<i>What if they had gotten me? And I fought, scratched and screamed only to lose...would anyone even notice? Would anyone even try to help? Would anyone even know that I was taken? Would anyone even care...?</i> Feelings of dread began to take over as she slinked her back against the door. <i>If only I had someone I could trust, someone I knew in the city. But with everyone I've met so far being too suspicious or having been too distraught to help, who could I even possibly turn to?</i> that's when it hit, “Ethan!” she shouted as if he were right in front of her. He was also in the city! <i>But...</i> She said to herself, <i>If I asked for his help now...wouldn't that get in the way of his dream?</i> she sighed, <i>I couldn't do that to him...but who else could I ask? Nurse Joy?</i><br />
<br />
She thought about it for a second before she dug inside her sweater pocket coming out with a small light weight device. Opened it and scrolled down through its contains to the only number on her Pokegear that mattered. <i>I can't call him...he's still busy battling in his debut, the last I glanced at the television screen downstairs, so I'll just send him a message and hope for the best.</i><br />
<br />
In her message she explained everything that had happened to her since her arrival to the city...to the reason she was standing inside this very room. “I need you.” Is how she finished it, and somehow that statement was more true then ever before.<br />
<br />
She sighed heavily after she had hit send. She didn't want to wait for a response. Dana and Oscar had waited long enough to get some answers and there was nothing else to do then why she came here for. <br />
<br />
She pushed herself off of the wall and walked over to the modern-day telephone and dialed in the number written on the piece of paper that was given to her<br />
<br />
She took in a long breath as she wanted for it to connect, she didn't want to look weak to whoever was on the other line. She needed to look strong and threatening, show whoever it was on the other line that she wasn't messing around!<br />
<br />
It was time to see who this person was behind the mysterious number.<br />

<span style="color: lightblue"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>Glacier Island</i></span><br />
<br />
<b><u>Boreal Wastelands</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Treepandaone</u>:</b> Trying your very hardest to put your personal convictions aside temporarily, you prepare to engage the Piloswine herd. Death is as natural a process in the Pokemon world as it is in the human one, but <i>killing</i> is something very few Trainers are ever actually forced to do. Pokemon in general seem endowed with remarkable longevity, able to train and battle their entire lives without succumbing to sustained injuries. If anything, they seem more prone to fainting than anything, which is easily remedied at any Pokemon Center. But this... this is a whole different game.<br />
<br />
Despite their obvious lack of fighting skills, it's clear that the group is more than accustomed to this routine. They move flawlessly across the snow like a pack of wolves closing in on their prey, which denotes two things: one, they have transcended their existence as mere researchers and became full-fledged survivors in this frozen hell; two, and much more frightening a realization... they have all killed before.<br />
<br />
Shieldon eyes you with apprehension but seems to understand your predicament. Armed with a rather innocent-looking Heart Container, he looks to charge into battle alongside his allies, but the best he can muster is a couple of steps across the nose-high snow to realize the ordeal won't be paying off. Be that as it may, the herd has already been alerted to the presence of the close-range fighters, namely Stoutland and Jacob's Blaziken, and while five Piloswine hold their ground, they make way for the other three to start fleeing - you assume those to be the females, whose survival bears more relevance to the preservation of the herd.<br />
<br />
One of the hunters has his Grumpig psychically lift a Piloswine in the air, while Daryl's Magneton blasts it repeatedly with <b>Mirror Shot</b>. Meanwhile the Stoutland, Gligar and Blaziken each tackle their own prey, leaving one last valiant Ice-Type to contend with. Hesitating briefly at first, the much smaller Shieldon finally makes up his mind and targets that final Piloswine, unleashing a silver beam of metal energy straight at the lumbering foe. The attack finds its mark, pelting the enemy for considerable damage, evident even from such a distance; Piloswine roars in pain and twists around uncomfortably as the Flash Cannon pulse drills into his flesh.<br />
<br />
- Keep it up Matthew, we have this under control!<br />
<br />
Jacob's words of encouragement come just as his Blaziken delivers a crushing <b>Blaze Kick</b> that causes its victim to wobble precariously, about to pass out. A Pokemon with such a massive advantage over its opponents is the ideal partner to have in these situations, and it comes as no surprise that Jacob's only remaining partner would be exceptionally fit to handle the land's adversities.<br />
<br />
The Piloswine you attacked soon finds the culprit behind the long-range sucker punch, and charges straight at you and Shieldon in a blood rage. For such a heavy creature, it moves surprisingly fast in the snow, contrary to your partner, who can do little more than stand there and brace himself for impact in his panic... until he remembers your instructions again just in time! Four boulders materialize around the prehistoric Pokemon and are released just as Piloswine is about to ram into him; each rock finds its mark right on the opponent's forehead, four shots of such force that they're enough stop the creature in its tracks! Dizzy from the consecutive impacts, Piloswine seems to temporarily lose his bearings, before quickly regaining composure.<br />
A wild Pokemon with no sense strategy, and a stranger to Steel-Types in his usual habitat, it resorts to its usual offense by coating his tusks with ice and driving them straight against your partner's impenetrable iron skull for negligible damage. The lack of substantial damage seems to fill Shieldon with renewed confidence, and it swiftly Counters Piloswine's ineffective <b>Ice Fang</b> with a twice as powerful headbutt for good measure!<br />
<br />
So far, this has been a fairly standard fight for a veteran such as yourself. The foe, despite being in its natural habitat, doesn't seem used to the kind of Pokemon it's facing, and you have the definite upper hand as far as tactical awareness goes. Still, Piloswine is bigger and potentially stronger than Shieldon, and it has yet to resort to the dreaded Ground-Type moves its species can use... You know you should tread lightly but, above all, you can't afford to forget your ultimate goal - you're not out here to win.<br />
<br />
The rest of the group seems to be doing fairly well on their own, and you have your hands full with an angry Piloswine looking to crush you and your Pokemon for the sake of its family - a powerful motivation.<br />
With all this in mind, what is your next step? </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">OoC: Sorry for the late reply. Just wanted to say the first paragraph isn't a dig against you or other updater, just a bit of character development. Also in the last update I changed Shieldon's Heart Container for the Heat Rock Drummond gave me.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: lightblue">Tiresome. Both in action and attitude, the shining glean Pokémon battles once had was waning fast over the multiple years trainer Matthew Brown had adventured in the zones of Fizzy Bubbles. His strongest and battle-hungry were now at the top of their level; his starter, Rhyperior, claiming the title of <a href="http://forums.upnetwork.net/showpost.php?p=397574&amp;postcount=17" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.upnetwork.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D397574%26postcount%3D17&amp;hash=5c9e3c33674ff5635fe6ab0dcab0b30d" rel="nofollow noopener">Fizzy Bubbles alpha male</a> via the skin of his teeth against Jessica, but with new challengers gradually climbing up the ladder he was sure the old Pokémon's dominance would soon be called into question, and battles would become the main focus once more. Never-the-less, Matthew Brown had come to hold a certain apathy against the necessities of battle, and a lack of sleep and doom-and-gloom scenario had only increased the distaste he felt for the art of conflict. There was nothing personal against those who entertained the idea, no crazed idea to join organisations like Team Plasma, whom solemnly swore against any and all trainers who held Pokémon in their possession, just a gradual depreciation for the repetitiveness fighting had come to. Like comparing 3rd and 4th edition D&amp;D, the struggle with crusades often hinged on the balance of storytelling vs combat, the veteran Pokémon trainer now seeking a richer chronology as the clocked ticked ever closer towards any potential retirement, or worse, inevitable death. <br />
<br />
His mind wandered to what the future held as he approached the big 3-0, if his continence in Fizzy Bubbles was the conclusion of his destiny. He stared at the landscape around him as the sound faded to a low hum, blanking out the carnage as Pokémon since released from his comrades begun to pick their enemies on the battlefield. His fate lay in the balance, and he was surrounded by life yet still somehow alone. Perhaps it was time for adventure away from the chaos, to search for the diamonds in the sea; items hidden in caverns by people long gone, guarded only by ghostly shadow and fearful superstition. Shieldon's hesitation brought the trainer crashing back down to earth, reminding him of the lack of future should he not survive the day out here in the arctic tundra. Daydreams of far of places meant nothing, but his Pokémon's presence made him he was not alone, not while he still breathed life into shaping his young team into the adults they were destined to become.<br />
<br />
The sounds of scuffles quickly returned as his sharpness came rushing back, like a rusty blade edged on a ceramic wheel or rock. The trainers on his flanks had killed before as they eclipsed their former professions, putting Matthew at ease and on edge all at the same time. A Stoutland and Blaziken charged into the fight with ease, prompting Shieldon to attempt the same but its heavy weight and lack of footholds shut the delusion of grandeur down before it had even started. He had identified this as a problem from the very beginning, but was confident his little Pokémon could keep up with the savages he called his allies.<br />
<br />
His inclination was right as Shieldon's first attack landed against one of the male Piloswine protecting the herd; the roar of discomfort making him cringe far more than a usual battle would. The pain seemed extra poignant, extra pronounced, as if the victims knew that a loss on this battlefield would mean an end to life. Words of encouragement from Jacob bore no real meaning as he felt the discomfort of continuing, the pack's male population slowly taking more damage than they were dishing out. He knew that if push came to shove he could kill, but if it wasn't necessary could he swallow his pride and leave a few males alive to repopulate the species or would his position be compromised if he showed any sign of weakness to the group of strangers so hell bent on killing for survival be a indication for exile. <br />
<br />
His discomfort was confounded as Shieldon continued the onslaught he had laid out just a few seconds prior, pulling four large from the ground and slamming them into the face of the charging mammoth Pokémon. His realization of how one-sided each and every encounter was was confirmed as the Piloswine attempted an Ice Fang, the move bouncing off Shieldon's massive defensive shell before the Counter smashed it back. Here was a Pokémon fighting for its life too, as unaware of strategy and its foe as he was to the Shards. The parallels ran deep, each side being one step up in the food chain of life, vulnerable to the mysteries of the universe and the unknown. <br />
<br />
“Good job Shieldon, turn it up with a <b>Toxic</b> to the eyes then while he's blinded shed some of your weight with a <b>Rock Polish<b>. If you get hit, reply with a <b>Metal Burst</b> but if you don't finish the round with an <b>Ancient Power</b>”</b></b></span><b><b><br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>PikaGod</u>:</u></b> You decide to stand up to the POLT officer, arguing that you’re no stranger to danger and have seen enough in your travels to handle this situation, whatever that may be.<br />
<br />
The stern-looking man raises an eyebrow and reaches for his belt, picks a Pokeball and releases its contents. A Marowak materializes and raises its bone high in the air as a sign of warning, keeping its eyes firmly locked on you. The officer prepares to speak when a second flash fills the whole area, blindingly strong this time, forcing all of you to cover your eyes. After it fades, you start to feel a terrible numbness in your feet, progressively spreading to your legs and stopping around your waist; immobilized, you lose your balance and fall on your knees, unable to stand, as does the POLT; even Marowak seems to be having a hard time staying on its feet, despite its supposed immunity to electricity!<br />
Fortunately, the feeling of paralysis washes away almost as quickly as it appeared, allowing you to stand back up after only a short while. The officer does the same, curses under his breath and looks over to the lake; you instinctively do the same, just in time to see most of the shapes in the distance tumble to the side by the margin; they, however, don’t make it back up…<br />
<br />
-	Last warning; get out, or I’ll take you out.<br />
<br />
He doesn’t sound half as professional as before; clearly, having to deal with this mess <i>and</i> the occasional perpetrator is getting on the man’s nerves, and you get the feeling that arresting you isn’t the first thing on his mind – he just wants you gone so he can focus on the problem at hand, and seems to have no qualms about using force.<br />
<br />
Your legs are still tingly, although you can move them just fine. Whatever this was it seems to have come from the lake, and it was a pulse powerful enough to travel though <i>sand</i> and even affect a Ground-Type. Whichever the cause, it must have incredible power, especially judging by what it did to those closer to the margin… you wonder if those Pokemon are all dead, or just paralyzed worse than you were. Either way, what hopes could you have of getting closer unharmed? Was it even worth it, or should you just obey the POLT officer and seek the safety of other zones? You know he’s only looking out for you, but your curiosity still hasn’t been satisfied…<br />
<br />
You take one last look around while you plan your next course of action, and spot someone else nearby that you hand’t noticed before. An old man is watching the lake with a melancholic smile, not far from where you stand, seemingly oblivious to your presence and, more importantly, unaffected by the recent energy wave. He is skinny, with a thick white beard, wears a light-blue short-sleeved shirt, an old-looking pair of shorts, a straw hat and a weird pair of black, heavy-looking boots like you’ve never seen before, and which stand out like a sore thumb given the rest of his outfit. His eyes are locked on the lake, and he seems lost in thought…<br />
<br />
-	What’s it going to be, then?<br />
<br />
The Marowak takes a step forward and holds its bone like a sword at its master’s question; it’s ready to strike at the first sign of struggle. Should you engage the POLT officer? If you beat him, you’d have a clear path to the lake… or will you stand down and leave as instructed after all?</span></span>

<br />
<span style="color: yellow">&quot;I told you before, I'm not going anywhere,&quot; said Karmas, &quot;Something happened to those pokemon, and I'm not going to leave until I can get to the bottom of it!&quot;<br />
<br />
He didn't want to give up, that's not what he did. But did he want to go against the POLT officer? He took a step back, pins and needles running up his legs as he adjusted his weight. Karmas was quite willing to stand his ground against the officer, but there was one small thing that made him feel a little uneasy. The officer's Marowak. Without a doubt, he would have to fight his way through to the lake and, with Claptrap being pretty unexperienced, he wasn't too sure if he wanted to risk it.<br />
<br />
Karmas looked at the Marowak, and by the looks of it, it seemed pretty strong. Even though Claptrap was a grass type, and thus had the type advantage, he didn't have a huge amount of battle experience and Karmas wasn't too sure if he was going to be able to take it on. He briefly glanced at his Carnivine, the grass type not giving any indication whether or not. Karmas didn't want to back down from the officer, he hated it it when people with power abused. However, once again, he wasn't sure if Claptrap would be up to it. Now if he had Zoran or Dot, that would be a different story, but they were both back at the base and very much not here. He needed to make a decision on what to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; Karmas finally said, deciding that he didn't want to risk Claptrap getting hurt. &quot;I'll back done, this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trying to save face and not show his embarrassment over acting like he was going to fight and then immediately changing his mind, Karmas turned around and walked away. As he walked away he saw the old man again, seeing him reminding Karmas that the old man didn't seem to have been affected by whatever it was that had happened before. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, maybe he knows something about what happened?&quot; Karmas said to Claptrap, before the pair of them started walking over to him.</span></span><br />

<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> Despite Magmortar’s unusually large frame and overwhelming power, it turns out one of its strengths – its searing Flame Body – actually worked out in Helga’s favor. Her fists still fuming, her resolve burns hotter than ever, fueled by her Guts to topple the giant!<br />
<br />
She wills herself back to her feet and steps away from the edge of the central platform; one slip-up would spell certain doom to her! The fully evolved magma demon stares eagerly at its foe, its mere grin taunting her to strike again. The Hariyama welcomes the chance to prove herself and lunges forward; she drive her huge open palm into Magmortar’s chest, unfazed by the heat, and a pulse of pure energy is released on contact, sending the Fire-Type back several steps from the intensity of the blow! Magmortar staggers briefly, astonished by the display of power, before returning to its customary grin, growing excited at the prospect of facing an actual challenge! It raises one of its arm-cannons one more time, this time dousing Helga with a stream of flames that engulfs her and makes her cry out in pain from the intense <b>Flamethrower</b>!<br />
<br />
<b><i>FOOLISH, DEFIANT HUMAN…</i></b><br />
<br />
The booming voice rings in your head again. You try your best to block it out and focus on the battle instead. You see Helga muscle onwards, even against the steady stream of fire being launched at her, overpowering the barrage of flames and once again coming close enough to attack the enemy, this time with a closed-fist punch that seems to hit a particularly vulnerable spot! The Rock Smash connecting interrupts Magmortar’s Flamethrower and causes the beast to bend over from the pain in its gut, effectively lowering its defense! And with yet another opportunity presenting itself, your gutsy Hariyama slams a second open palm strike against Magmortar’s shoulder, unleashing another shockwave in the process! This time, the Fire-Type loses its balance, falls over and is sent rolling precariously close to the edge of the platform, mirroring Helga’s earlier predicament – even if the lava should have no effect on the Great One’s champion… It gets back up, visibly in pain although suffering no other visible side effects from either Force Palm. Its grin is wider than ever, relishing every moment of the unexpectedly-even fight, and adopts an attacking stance once more by aiming <i>both</i> cannons at Helga!<br />
<br />
<b><i>YOUR BLIND DESIRE TO REACH ME AT ALL COSTS… IT’S TIME YOU WITNESS THE PRICE OF YOUR STUBBORNESS.</i></b><br />
<br />
A loud rumbling sound behind you forces you to take the eyes off the match and look to the origin of the noise. And it’s in shock that you see the tunnel you just came in from collapse and crumble into a pile of boulders, one more cave-in caused by the mountain God… with Kyle and his Doduo still inside, right where you left them! You knew that failing to fulfill his end of the bargain would cost Kyle… but to see it actually happen before your eyes is heartwrenching, all the more so when you know you played a role in the reporter’s ultimate fate…<br />

<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u> Electric Blue Eye</u>:</b> This is it, you can feel it - the grand finale is here! If you can surpass Dewott, you'll have beaten Sean with a Pokemon to spare, and what a start to your gauntlet that would be!<br />
<br />
Hanzo stares James dead in the eye, empty-handed and unmoving. It's impossible to predict what his move's going to be, but you try to cover all your bases: in a move that surprise both Sean and the Dewott, you order the limbless Gastly to use Thunderpunch - twice!<br />
The Ghost-Type charges electricity within its miasma, then shapes the swirling shadows that surround him into a pair of gaseous fists. The darkness extends all the way toward Hanzo, who is caught off-guard by the unconventional move, allowing the first Thunderpunch to hit home! Lightning courses through Hanzo's body, making him growl in pain, but the impact of the move itself is considerably low, seeing as Gastly's smoke isn't a solid surface.<br />
<br />
With just enough time to recover, Hanzo, being the tactical mastermind you've come to realize, telegraphs the combo and nimbly dodges the second strike by kneeling down at the last second. Sean smiles at his partner's resilience and outs his own plan into motion.<br />
<br />
- That's it! Now close the distance with <b>Aqua Jet[]/b] and ready the Flowing River Stance!<br />
<br />
The technique's name is entirely foreign to you, and you're not eager to find out what it is. It's bad enough that Hanzo's speed suddenly allows him to essentially become a bullet of water, travelling all the way toward James in a split second! However, just as your partner prepares to meet his foe with a timely Sucker Punch... Hanzo stops an inch before contact, standing idly <i>right in front</i> of the Gastly, as if mocking him! Temporarily stunned by the lack of impact, James instead decides to follow your orders and channels Grass energy into an orb that will hopefully put the Dewott away... which is when Hanzo's mysterious technique reveals itself!<br />
<br />
The Dewott lighlty taps on the icy floor with one foot, causing a rising <b>Waterfall</b> to emerge from the frozen pool, shattering the frost layer and, instead of hitting James as expected... propels Hanzo himself upwards! Aided by the pillar of water, the Dewott executes a perfect somersault over James, who widely misses the Giga Drain as a result, and gracefully lands right behind your partner!<br />
<br />
- Well done Hanzo! Now, <b>Copycat</b> that Giga Drain to allow for the finale you've had in mind for a while now...<br />
<br />
Instead of triumphant, Sean's voice sounds resigned - as if he's known for a while that Hanzo is going to finish this battle on his own terms. Hanzo, panting heavily and on the brink of collapse after the beating he's taken, smiles in gratitude. He channels a green orb similar to James and blasts his unprotected back with a <b>Giga Drain</b> of his own! The glowing particles left floating after the explosion return to Hanzo, partially restoring his energy, while James writhes on the floor in pain from the highly effective hit (courtesy of having been turned to a Water-Type before). And then, you realize what Hanzo's &quot;finale&quot; is...<br />
<br />
The Dewott, still breathing heavily, bows respectfully to his injured opponent, before kneeling down next to James and placing a hand on his gaseous body. The Gummi Bomb in his chest glows brighter and brighter, and a massive explosion ensues, shattering most of the remaining ice floor with its powerful shockwave! When the mist cleared, the two Pokemon, James and Hanzo, are floating motionlessly - each of them knocked out cold and unable to continue. It's a draw!!<br />
<br />
- Dewott and Gastly are both unable to battle. With one Pokemon left... the winner is Ethan!<br />
<br />
The crowd, who'd been in silent suspense for the last moves of the incredible match, suddenly erupts into cheers, chanting your name over and over again, evidently sold on your battling skills!<br />
Sean recalls Hanzo, smiles and claps at you while the arena is lowered back to the depths of the earth and replaced by the usual concrete surface. He descends from his pod and walks over to yours. His words are barely perceptible amidst the crowd's roars, but you get the feeling it's completely intentional...<br />
<br />
- That was a phenomenal match. Thanks for giving it your all and making me go all out as well; it's been a while. Here, take this... but show it to nobody, for your own sake.<br />
<br />
He walks up to you and gives you a handshake and a hug, during which he slips something wrapped in a piece of cloth into your hand. He whispers something into your ear as he hands you the mysterious item.<br />
<br />
- Someone's after these. Please keep them safe, whatever the cost; I don't really know who I can trust, but something's very wrong with this tournament.<br />
<br />
He steps back and raises his voice once again, this time clearly intending to be heard.<br />
<br />
- Well done Ethan! Maybe you do have the makings of a Champion. I'm sure Gottfried himself was entertained, and I look forward to seeing how far you can go in this gauntlet! Oh, and you can keep that scalchop you took from Hanzo; he can always craft another, and I'm sure he'll want you to keep it as a souvenir.<br />
<br />

1x Splash Plate</b> carefully concealed that Sean fears might fall into the wrong hands...<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the crowd's cheers die down. The Champion Gottfried is on his feet and has approached the balcony; it seems he's about to address you and Sean, and the sight of him alone commands respect, as if an elder titan stood before your eyes - how can one ordinary man exude such a mighty aura of power and reverence? Just as the retiring Champion is about to speak, a voice to his left cuts him short - a voice filled with urgency and concern.<br />
<br />
- The gauntlet cannot continue!<br />
<br />
You instinctively turn to the origin of the fearful voice; in one of the Leaders' seats next to Gottfried's throne, one man has stood up as well and faces the Champion. A slender, sharply-dressed man with black hair, thin-rimmed glasses, several rings on each finger and a gold necklace, the embodiment of style. His expression is one of worry, and his accent is decidedly foreign.<br />
<br />
- I have just learned that Trevor, who was scheduled to face that Trainer in the afternoon round, was found unconscious just now in the corridor leading to the restrooms! His medical condition is uncertain, but we cannot continue under these circumstances!<br />
<br />
Gottfried's stare pierces the soul, but he doesn't answer the nervous man. Instead, another Gym Leader answers.<br />
<br />
- Settle down Pietro. The tournament must proceed.<br />
<br />
Next to the man in expensive garments stands a much taller figure, dressed in an elaborate black robe with silver embroideries; his face is pale as moonlight and his hair, kept past shoulder length, is half black and half white The man's voice is calm, soothing, as if inviting those who listen to let go of their worries and embrace sleep...<br />
<br />
- These people paid good money to attend this ceremony. And war does not cease on the first casualty...<br />
<br />
- Luther! A man might be gravely ill and you want to continue the spectacle? Besides, he was scheduled to face that very Trainer in the arena right now! Do you not find that highly suspicious? What if <i>he</i> is responsible for what happened to Trevor? Man can go to great lengths to reach fame and fortune!<br />
<br />
The strange Luther approaches the balcony and glares at you with interest - an unsettling stare that fills you with apprehension, even if he seems to be on your side.<br />
<br />
- That man has done no harm. We witnessed his grand battle from start to finish, not once did he leave our sight. Do not hold him accountable with no proof. Besides... don't you wish to see how far this one can go? Good Trevor is in capable hands. The show must go on... right, Champion Gottfried?<br />
<br />
The elder remains silent throughout the entire exchange, and also when directly confronted. He seems to ponder on the two sides - Pietro, who asks that the tournament be suspended to find out what happened to Trevor, despite not knowing the actual seriousness of the man's condition, or Luther, the shady figure who wants to see the gauntlet resumed and seems to have taken an unnatural amount of interest in you...<br />
<br />
Pleading your own case might help right now - after all, you've been accused of something terrible! And in the middle of all this, what do <i>you</i> want Gottfried to decide? It's time to speak up! </b></span><b><br />

You try your very best to sound determined; after all, a lot is hinging on this next call! The phone number you got from that stranger is all you have to go on, and even if it means exposing yourself here, you're willing to take that chance.<br />
<br />
The deafening silence of the private video room is pierced regularly by the beeping of the call in transit. It seems to go on forever, adding to your state of already high tension, and for a moment it seems as if nobody's picking up; maybe the man was playing a prank on you? Maybe those guys in the black van are using this call to trace your movements and corner you...<br />
<br />
<i>*click*</i><br />
<br />
Suddenly, the monitor display goes from pitch black to a vivid image - someone answered the call!! However... there doesn't seem to be anyone on the other side. The camera is pointed to what seems like a huge bookcase, filled with ancient-looking tomes you can't quite identify. The room being broadcast is poorly lit, reminding you of something like an abandoned library, and nobody steps in front of the camera for even a second - but somebody <i>must</i> be there, or else why would the call be going through?<br />
<br />
Nothing happens for a good while, and you're about to give up. Whoever's on the other side is either mocking you, picked up by mistake or maybe the whole system is jsut bugged and there isn't really anyone on the other side of the line...<br />
<br />
<i>- You have the wrong number. Get off this line!</i><br />
<br />
The sudden words startle you; the voice on the other side sounds heavily distorted, probably due to interference, and whoever is speaking sounds awfully wary of your intentions, which is strange if you actually did call a &quot;wrong number&quot;...<br />
<br />
Maybe there's something you can say that'll prevent them from hanging up... Do you have any clue? Quickly!</span></b></span><b><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>PikaGod</u>:</b> You decide to drop out of this confrontantion; the man is a trained officer, and even if some of your other partners could probably take him and his Marowak on, you don't want to risk Claptrap's well-being. You turn back around, embarassed for having to comply with the man's orders after all, and leave the scene with the officer smirking.<br />
<br />
You'd spotted an old man nearby, gazing at the lake, and figure it might be a good idea to find out what he knows. For what it's worth, he seems completely unfazed by the intense electricity emanating from the lake - how does he do it, especially with his advanced age? Your legs feel heavier with each step, numbness spreading to your knees. It takes a great deal of effort just to walk a straight line, as if the electricity built up inside the sand (a physical impossibility as far as you thought you knew) is invading your body; walking over to the elder proves a strenuous task, but you keep going.<br />
<br />
It isn't until you're standing three feet away that the old man notices your presence, and greets you with an almost toothless smile.<br />
<br />
- Oh hi there sonny! Quite the pickle over there, ain't it? Looks like you picked a bad place for your vacation m'boy! Unless.....<br />
<br />
The last word is heavy with intention. He draws out that second syllable as if tempting you to ask the question he wants to hear, but then proceeds you to explain either way.<br />
<br />
- Unless you wanna go fishin'! Yeah, those sharp-dressed officers over there are way in over their corporate heads with this... The problem is <i>inside</i> that lake, and they ain't got what's needed to get the job done, lemme tell you! No man or Pokemon can get close enough to see the real problem without being roasted by one of those shockwaves. Unless.....<br />
<br />
You fight your hardest not to roll your eyes as he clearly tries to bait interest out of you. He swiftly points to his boots - quite frankly, oversized and out of place with the rest of his attire - and grins.<br />
<br />
- Unless you got a pair of these! Come on sonny... help an old man out, will ya? Been after that one for over a year, the little runt, and now it's gone and made all sorts of racket - at this rate someone's gonna reel it in 'fore I do!<br />
<br />
Where there once was cockiness now remains nothing but a heartfelt plea for help. It seems this old man knows what's wrong with the lake and how to get there, but can't do much of anything on his own...<br />
<br />
Will you help him out, crazy as he may seem, or do you try to get to the bottom of this through your own means? </span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Treepandaone</u>:</b> After years of travelling and struggling, such a thing as &quot;the thrill of battle&quot; is quick to lose meaning; this might be a rare instance of a fight to the death, but even then it's still a battle with a twist at the end - you just have to keep hitting until it stops breathing. And if the concept feels in any way foreign, the one-sided clash only serves to blur the insecurities of someone who, such as yourself, is unaccustomed to slaughter - it all plays out like a regular fight, to the point where the ease of it all dulls any sense of urgency.<br />
<br />
Shieldon seems to be having little trouble standing up to the larger foe, having been carefully raised as opposed to the wild opponent - who lives by instinct alone, and right now, all it knows is that there is a looming threat on its life and that of its pack. But even wild Pokemon are not without innate intelligence, and Piloswine seems to slowly pick up on the fact that its current offense is ineffective; it looks ready to switch things up, taking a couple of steps back to create distance between itself and your living fossil, but before it can strike Shieldon, the prehistoric herbivore shoots a glob of poison at its eyes looking to blind it! However, the mammoth's eyes are perpetually covered in thick fur, and while it prevents the venomous substance from damaging its eyesight, the poison is slowly absorbed through the follicles. It causes no immediate effects but you know it's just a matter of time... While the creature flails about, trying in vain to prevent the venom from seeping inside its system, Shieldon focuses and sheds away the imperfect edges of its head armor, making it slightly lighter and considerably more agile.<br />
<br />
Now looking to take advantage of the distance it created, Piloswine takes aim and spits out a massive sphere of liquid clay, the <b>Mud Bomb</b> finding its mark and exploding violently upon contact with your partner! The unfortunate type combination of Shieldon causes the attack to be extremely effective, and it sends the small dinosaur flying back several steps despite its immense weight. The viciousness of the blast and its repercussions concern you, but it's with relief that you see Shieldon fight back to its feet with little more than an annoyed expression behind its iron armor. It spreads its paws to establish a wide base, charges up as much Steel energy as it can and shapes it into a sphere <i>twice</i> as large as Piloswine's Mud Bomb. The foe can do little more than watch as the enormous Metal Burst makes its way toward it, and once it touches Piloswine, the resulting explosion is huge enough to cause the ice around it to crack and fissures to spread from the point of detonation all around the battlefield! When the snow and frost settle, Piloswine is laying on its back, unmoving, its breathing shallow and faint.<br />
<br />
The poison running through the mammoth's body then finishes the job, causing the beast to finally succumb, relieved of all the pain you caused it; the outcome was expected, but perhaps not this soon, giving you little time to prepare for the reality of the fact... that you just killed a Pokemon. Even if it was for the greater good, the nourishment of a group of men forsaken by Arceus Itself...<br />
Just then, a sudden realization quickly sets in - although you've caught your prey, is it alright to feed its poisoned flesh to the camp? Was Toxic a good idea to begin with? But on the other hand... can you afford to return empty-handed to that starving community, especially with the trust Jacob placed in you to get this job done despite Daryl's protests?<br />
<br />
Looking around the battlefield, it looks like almost everyone has successfully hunted down a Piloswine and the struggle is nearing its end. Jacob and his Blaziken seem to be making their way over to you, the latter dragging the lifeless corpse of one of the mammoths through the snow, to check up on how you're doing.<br />
And what will you tell him?... </span></span> <br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>DaveTheFishGuy</u>:</b> Both the Healer and the Keeper stay silent as you try to talk yourself out of this mess. The woman's eyes shift repeatedly between you, Nobby and Jason, letting a trace of nervousness shine through, while the man keeps staring straight at you only, with an unreadable expression. It's him who speaks first while the Arbok coils ominously around him.<br />
<br />
- You say this woman wants to &quot;reverse the damage&quot; done to this island whereas I do not? Such ignorance. This isle is only damaged by the so called &quot;Healers&quot;' presence. Look around you boy... <i>this]/i] is Venom Island! It is as it's always been, a safe haven for the poisonous creatures the rest of this world despises. It is in no way damaged - if anything, it thrives as its borders grow by the day. You share that Healer's mentality that this isle is broken and in need of saving... failing to realize this is simply what it was meant to be! Change it, tamper with the natural balance, and all of these Pokemon die. You'd like that perhaps, even though you're accompanied by two Poison-Types yourself. Countless others just like yours would lose their home if the Healers have their way. You say you couldn't let an &quot;innocent&quot; Tranquill die - but does that mean the Grimer are &quot;guilty&quot; for seeking food? This is nature boy... and it's supremely arrogant to try and change it to match your preferences.<br />
<br />
He turns his back to you and starts walking away, leaving you with one final message.<br />
<br />
- If your eyes can still be opened to the truth, you will be welcome amongst us in our settlement to the South. We are the Keepers of this Isle's balance, protectors of that which the rest of the world would see erased from the map.<br />
<br />
He disappears into the mist, leaving you and your partners alone with the woman and her Ludicolo. She seems visibly enraged at the Keeper's words and is quick to answer back, even though the man is too far to hear her by now.<br />
<br />
- You idiot! You'd have this whole Archipelago condemned because you prefer to let nature run its course without even trying to do something about it?<br />
<br />
She takes a deep breath, trying to regain her composure, but turns to you with still visibly irritated.<br />
<br />
- As much as he tries to convince himself otherwise, Venom Island can't continue to exist. It's not a case of stopping its expansion... growing and invading its surroundings is part of this Isle's essence. &quot;Tampering&quot; with this balance he holds so precious is the only way to preserve the rest of Cascadia - something he refuses to acknowledge! My team and I are here to try and purify Venom Isle, to stop it from expanding its borders into nearby islands, and the only way to do that is to clear out the poison. If we let things progress, if Venom Isle's growth goes unchecked, it'll contaminate and swallow Aduro in no time, and from there every other land in the Archipelago. There's no way around it... this wretched Isle has to be purged for all the others to survive. The native Pokemon might have to be weeded out, but we'll save ten times as many lives!<br />
<br />
She recalls Ludicolo, turns back around and leaves you with a plea of her own.<br />
<br />
- If you haven't been poisoned by that man's words, I'd welcome your help in cleansing this island; just meet me back at our Sanctum to the North. We are the Healers of this Archipelago, preservers of that which others would qlet die rather than oppose the whims of nature.<br />
<br />
Soon, you're all alone again. Nobby and Jason look to you, expectant and worried. It seems you can either make a choice now, or keep roaming this island aimlessly - and while that might not come as a problem for neither the Croagunk nor the Koffing, how long can <i>you</i> realistically last in such a noxious atmosphere, surrounded by starving venomous Pokemon?<br />
<br />
What will you do? </i></span> </span><i><br />

<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> Despite Magmortar’s unusually large frame and overwhelming power, it turns out one of its strengths – its searing Flame Body – actually worked out in Helga’s favor. Her fists still fuming, her resolve burns hotter than ever, fueled by her Guts to topple the giant!<br />
<br />
She wills herself back to her feet and steps away from the edge of the central platform; one slip-up would spell certain doom to her! The fully evolved magma demon stares eagerly at its foe, its mere grin taunting her to strike again. The Hariyama welcomes the chance to prove herself and lunges forward; she drive her huge open palm into Magmortar’s chest, unfazed by the heat, and a pulse of pure energy is released on contact, sending the Fire-Type back several steps from the intensity of the blow! Magmortar staggers briefly, astonished by the display of power, before returning to its customary grin, growing excited at the prospect of facing an actual challenge! It raises one of its arm-cannons one more time, this time dousing Helga with a stream of flames that engulfs her and makes her cry out in pain from the intense <b>Flamethrower</b>!<br />
<br />
<b><i>FOOLISH, DEFIANT HUMAN…</i></b><br />
<br />
The booming voice rings in your head again. You try your best to block it out and focus on the battle instead. You see Helga muscle onwards, even against the steady stream of fire being launched at her, overpowering the barrage of flames and once again coming close enough to attack the enemy, this time with a closed-fist punch that seems to hit a particularly vulnerable spot! The Rock Smash connecting interrupts Magmortar’s Flamethrower and causes the beast to bend over from the pain in its gut, effectively lowering its defense! And with yet another opportunity presenting itself, your gutsy Hariyama slams a second open palm strike against Magmortar’s shoulder, unleashing another shockwave in the process! This time, the Fire-Type loses its balance, falls over and is sent rolling precariously close to the edge of the platform, mirroring Helga’s earlier predicament – even if the lava should have no effect on the Great One’s champion… It gets back up, visibly in pain although suffering no other visible side effects from either Force Palm. Its grin is wider than ever, relishing every moment of the unexpectedly-even fight, and adopts an attacking stance once more by aiming <i>both</i> cannons at Helga!<br />
<br />
<b><i>YOUR BLIND DESIRE TO REACH ME AT ALL COSTS… IT’S TIME YOU WITNESS THE PRICE OF YOUR STUBBORNESS.</i></b><br />
<br />
A loud rumbling sound behind you forces you to take the eyes off the match and look to the origin of the noise. And it’s in shock that you see the tunnel you just came in from collapse and crumble into a pile of boulders, one more cave-in caused by the mountain God… with Kyle and his Doduo still inside, right where you left them! You knew that failing to fulfill his end of the bargain would cost Kyle… but to see it actually happen before your eyes is heartwrenching, all the more so when you know you played a role in the reporter’s ultimate fate…<br />
<br />
<b><i>NOW, DEFY ME AGAIN... SEE WHAT HAPPENS THEN!</i></b></span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">Full of determination, Helga climbed back to her feet and charged forward. The Magmortar was giving that grin, that infuriating grin once more, inciting the Fighting-type to attack once again, and Helga was only too happy to oblige. Her Force Palm was perfectly executed, the energy forcing Magmortar to stagger backwards somewhat. The Blast Pokémon seemed nothing short of shocked that Helga was actually posing a challenge, but just as quickly, it started grinning again. And yet, Keith could've sworn he saw something different about the grin this time, some kind of quality he recognized- eagerness, he realized. Magmortar was getting excited by the battle, excited at an actual challenge. And as high as the stakes were, as serious as the situation was, Keith couldn't help but realize that he and this Magmortar weren't so different- he, too, was never one to shy away from a challenge, and if it was a challenge this Magmortar wanted, it was a challenge it would get!<br />
<br />
And then, Magmortar raised its cannons again, this time unleashing a powerful Flamethrower attack, a move Helga took the full force of. &quot;Yamaaaa...&quot; she grunted, unable to hold back her cry of pain...<br />
<br />
<b><i>FOOLISH, DEFIANT HUMAN...</i></b><br />
<br />
The Great One. Again. Keith tried his best to ignore the booming voice echoing throughout his head, trying to focus on the battle instead. &quot;Helga, Rock Smash!&quot; he cried out.<br />
<br />
Helga marched forward, forcing her way through the stream of flames, through the agonizing, searing pain, and landed a powerful punch on Magmortar. And judging by the way it bent over and stopped attacking, Keith had the feeling that it had struck a weak spot. As Rock Smash was so apt to do, it appeared to lower Magmortar's Defense, exactly what Keith was hoping it'd do! &quot;Yes!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Now follow it up with Force Palm!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hariiiiyama!&quot; bellowed Helga. She too saw the opportunity and was not about to pass it up! She slammed her hand into Magmortar's shoulder, this time creating a shockwave so powerful that it actually knocked Magmortar over, actually caused it to roll precariously close to the end of the rock platform! Of course, the lava wouldn't do a damn thing to Magmortar, but still, the fact that Helga's attack had done that to such a huge beast, Keith couldn't help but be proud of his Pokémon. But Magmortar was far from done- it stood back up, and now aimed both of its cannons at Helga! Keith opened his mouth-<br />
<br />
<b><i>YOUR BLIND DESIRE TO REACH ME AT ALL COSTS... IT'S TIME YOU WITNESS THE PRICE OF YOUR STUBBORNNESS.</i></b><br />
<br />
Before Keith could wonder just what the Great One meant by that, the answer came to him all too quickly, in the form of a loud rumbling sound right behind him. Knowing that this could be nothing good, he turned around and saw a horrible sight- the tunnel they had come through, it was caving in! Which in and of itself wouldn't have been so bad, except Keith realized with a horrible jolt that Kyle and Doduo <i>were STILL INSIDE!</i><br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; Keith gasped, but he knew already there was nothing he could do. The reporter and his Doduo were almost certainly dead by now. But more than that... Keith realized that this was his fault. Had he not just caved in himself and agreed to leave, they wouldn't have- wait, what was he thinking?! Keith turned and looked at the Heatmor- they still needed him. He had made them a promise, and there was no way in hell he was gonna break that promise. He owed it to those Heatmor to see this through, for even if he did concede defeat and leave, the Heatmor would definitely die, and how would he live with that knowledge? No. No, he couldn't give up on them. He had to stick to his convictions and do what he knew was right.<br />
<br />
Keith exchanged glances with Meowth. &quot;It weren't yer fault,&quot; he said to Keith, though his voice still shook. &quot;Ya told him ta come wit youse, if he'd only listened he wouldn't'a been in dere.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Meowth's right,</i> Gemini's voice echoed in Keith's head. <i>You've been doing everything you could do for those Heatmor. None of the deaths that have happened are your fault. You did what Mustard and I knew you would do in the end, and we can give you no higher praise than that.</i><br />
<br />
Keith knew that his Weezing was right. He knew that Meowth was right. He wouldn't be Keith if he didn't do everything he did up to this point. And then, another point of view occurred to Keith- this happened just after Helga had landed some particularly powerful hits against Magmortar. The Great One knew that his champion was losing, didn't he? He was trying to intimidate Keith out of following through just because he had a shot of winning, didn't he? And if there was even the slightest chance that Keith could save the remaining Heatmor from the fate they would otherwise be doomed to, he had to take it. Even if he was wrong, even if he was doomed to lose, then damn it, he would go out fighting!<br />
<br />
<b><i>NOW, DEFY ME AGAIN... SEE WHAT HAPPENS THEN!</i></b><br />
<br />
Keith opened his eyes and looked at his Pokémon. Meowth, Gemini, Mustard, and Helga all gave small grins as they saw the look in their Trainer's eyes, the fiery determination he was known to possess. They knew in that instant that Keith wasn't about to call it quits. &quot;Helga, let's do this,&quot; Keith said quietly. &quot;For Kyle. For Doduo. For those Heatmor back there. For all those mutilated Koffing and Weezing back in that tunnel-&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>WHAT?!</i><br />
<br />
Two voices rang simultaneously in Keith's head. He turned, and sure enough, his Weezing's two heads registered identical appalled looks. It was then that Keith realized- Gemini and Mustard had not yet been filled in on the tunnel of Koffing and Weezing corpses. &quot;I'm afraid so,&quot; he muttered to them. &quot;Hundreds of them, maybe thousands, lining the walls of a tunnel, still giving off Poison Gas and Smog, being used in this sick, twisted version of Home Alone as a trap.&quot; The Weezing looked sickened- both heads did, and Keith couldn't blame either one of them. &quot;And I swore to avenge them all,&quot; he continued. Gemini and Mustard nodded their approval simultaneously, still looking sickened.<br />
<br />
&quot;...For Kyle. For Doduo. For the Heatmor. For the Koffing and Weezing. Hell, even for that one Magmar that was getting ready to surrender,&quot; Keith continued, addressing Helga once again. &quot;For each and every needless fatality at the hands of the sick, twisted Great One... Helga, use your <b>Force Palm</b> once more, then use your <b>Smelling Salts</b> attack... and follow it up with <b>Brine</b>.&quot; He had hoped to save the order for Smelling Salts until Force Palm had actually induced paralysis, but he knew that he had to get this battle finished before the Great One could do any more damage, end any more lives. He didn't know for sure that this would work, but he had to hope it would.</span></span><br />

<br />
<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> The Mountain God’s threats aren’t empty after all. Sure, He’d shown little remorse in disposing of his own minions, and tried to do the same to you on multiple occasions so far, being foiled at every turn. But to actually see Him carry out his word, remorselessly killing the good-hearted Kyle Styles and his clumsy Doduo, who’d shared most of the trials with you… it brings His cruelty to a new level. The Great One yet again orders you to stand down and surrender, lest you want to suffer the same fate as the reporter, and is intent on taking the small group of rebel of Heatmor with you.<br />
<br />
As if making good on his Master’s promise, the Magmortar unleashes a violent burst of fire that takes the shape of the oriental <i>Daimonji</i>, a wicked <b>Fire Blast</b> that explodes on contact with Helga; the shockwave itself is so severe, it tosses you and the entire group of Heatmor to the ground, while the Hariyama, having taken the full brunt of the blow, is sent flying across the arena! You watch helplessly as Helga’s body flies through the air, quickly realizing she’ll fall into the lava pit that circles the central chamber if she keeps going!<br />
But just as hope beings to fade (how could you possibly grab such a huge Pokemon?), you catch a glimpse of something beginning to move through the corner of your eye – faster than you thought possible, the Heatmor leader gets back to his feet and dashes toward Helga! The anteater leaps and tackles the Hariyama from behind, stopping her momentum and causing the two Pokemon to fall back down before the edge of the platform!<br />
<br />
Helga struggles back to her feet, mutters her thanks to Heatmor in her native tongue and switches her attention back to the giant Magmortar, her Guts fueling an unprecedented rage. She readies herself and lunges forward with her palm glowing, while Magmortar again chuckles in amusement and leaves itself wide open, curious to find out the true extent of its persistent little foe. This time, letting out a bone-chilling battle cry, the Hariyama rams her open hand into the magma Pokemon’s torso and the ensuing energy blast effortlessly topples the giant, who collapses backwards! Furthermore, it seems this time the aftereffect of Force Palm has taken effect – Magmortar’s limbs lock up during its attempt to get back up! Unwilling to let up, Helga gets on top of the fallen titan and repeatedly slaps it across the face, over and over again as if trying to wake an unconscious person up, but dealing heavy damage instead!<br />
<br />
When she’s had enough, the heavyweight Pokemon steps away from her battered opponent, but the fire in her eyes remains. Stunned and hurting all over, Magmortar gets to one knee, gasping for air, wondering how could such a weakling be manhandling it this way… but before it can even think of mounting an offense of its own, Helga has already decided to wrap things up! She brings her hands forward, creating a blue orb between them, and releases a torrent of saltwater at the Fire-Type!<br />
<br />
The water stream crashes into Magmortar and this time, thanks to the high pressure of the jet, it’s the enemy who goes flying back! Doused in seawater, the Magmortar collides with the rock wall at the edge of the huge circular arena, and when the Brine subsides, the creature’s massive frame detaches from the wall and tumbles into the magma surrounding the main chamber! For a while, nothing seems to happen, and you would imagine Magmortar to be relatively at ease inside the active volcano but… something surfaces, and it’s not the foe as you knew it just now! Helga bends over the edge and pulls out the incapacitated enemy – revealing that Magmortar’s body has been encased in a layer of pitch-black stone! Meowth is quick to explain that the water blast that drenched Magmortar must have caused the lava to solidify around the creature’s body, and because Helga was quick enough to pull it out, it never got to melt back over… Magmortar is unable to battle anymore, having been turned into a harmless statue! <b>Helga gains 1 Level!</b><br />
<br />
Your celebration, if any, is short-lived. While Helga helps the Heatmor leader back to his feet, thanking him again for essentially saving her life, another terrible quake makes the volcano’s main chamber shake wildly, the wide platform you all stand on trembling violently before a huge portion of the volcano throat’s wall falls off with a loud rumbling noise. You all instinctively look up to find…<br />

<b>I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU ALL. I WILL PUT AN END TO THIS NUISANCE MYSELF!</b><br />
<br />
He didn’t need to speak for you to have known – you’re finally standing face to face with the Great One, the Mountain God and heart of Mt. Aduro! This is the one behind it all – not just Aduro’s continued existence, but the abhorrent “natural selection” imposed on the island, that has doomed so many Pokemon considered “unfit” to perish!<br />
<br />
The gigantic creature, several times that of Magmortar, lets go of the wall and crashes down on the platform, causing half of it to crumble under His weight, allowing his legs to sink into the lava with no repercussions! The area you’re all standind on has just become twice as small, and the final foe has finally revealed Himself! But… can you hope to topple such a mythical being?<br />
<br />
<b>PUNY HUMAN. YOU DO NOT BELONG HERE, YET SEE FIT TO MEDDLE IN MY AFFAIRS – ADURO’S AFFAIRS! THE HEATMOR ARE NOT WORTHY OF DWELLING IN MY PARADISE. THEY ARE <i>FATED</i> TO DIE! BEHOLD!</b><br />
<br />
With a deafening roar, the Great One causes a stream of lava to rise from the depths of the pit, as if controlling it mentally; the magma tendril wraps itself around one of the remaining Heatmor, and much to the leader’s despair… drags it into the boiling lava near the God’s feet, instantly incinerating the poor thing!<br />
<br />
<b>REMEMBER MY WORDS – “DEFY ME AGAIN, SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT!” THIS IS THE RESULT OF YOUR CONTINUED DEFIANCE! YOU WILL WATCH THEM <i>ALL</i> DIE, NOW THAT YOU’VE LURED THEM TO ME... AND YOU WILL BE THE LAST ONE TO MELT AWAY!</b><br />
<br />
The final battle begins now! What will you do?!</span></span> <br />
