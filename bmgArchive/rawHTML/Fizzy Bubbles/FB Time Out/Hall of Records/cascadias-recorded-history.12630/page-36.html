<br />
Realizing the foes are only interested in targeting Bette, for whatever reason, you switch up your strategy and have Porter take charge of the battle. Getting your precious Leafeon to safety is your top priority!<br />
<br />
Retrieving the empty Leaf Ball from your belt, you make a run for it in an attempt to get closer to the fallen Bette so you can recall her to safety. At the same time, Porter jumps at one of the gray Leafeon and sinks his fangs into the foe’s torso, making it cry in pain!<br />
However, the second opponent tracks your movement and leaps in front of you, blocking the path to Bette! The Leafeon’s black tail straightens and sharpens while the creature stares at you with danger-filled eyes… and jumps straight at you! It’s trying to hit you with <b>Leaf Blade</b>!<br />
<br />
Porter turns around in alarm but is much too late to react; the sword-like leaf spins in the air and just as the edge approaches your neck… a blast of wind pushes the enemy back, making its tail miss you by mere inches! What just happened?<br />
<br />
You turn to face your savior but see nobody at first… until a shadow from <i>above</i> passes through the clearing. Looking up your eyes widen in surprise as they spot one of the Braviary that attacked you earlier circling the battlefield! When the large bird starts descending however, you realize it carries a rider this time. Braviary lands next to you and from its back leaps a dark-skinned man, dressed with animal pelts around his waste and wearing a bone necklace. Barefooted and sporting red facepaint with a tribal design, you can only assume him to be a local, probably an inhabitant from a nearby village. But if he owns this Braviary, does this mean he was responsible for attacking and almost killing you earlier?!<br />
<br />
-	You cannot face them alone. Many have tried, all have failed. – he says in a deep voice, pointing at his necklace.<br />
<br />
Braviary takes to the sky again and releases an <b>Air Slash</b> at the Leafeon who nearly beheaded you, sending it tumbling back several feet and almost knocking it out! Its partner looks on in concern, and Porter takes the opportunity to blast it with another Icy Wind at point-blank range, dealing heavy damage!<br />
<br />
The two gray Leafeon step back and regroup, assessing the situation after the unexpected developments. Their eyes remain locked on the hurt Bette, but they seem to realize how hard it will be to get to her now… <br />
Still, can you trust this man? After all, if your assumption is correct, he was responsible for assaulting you before and severely injuring Tim! Can you rely on him?<br />
<br />
What do you do now?</span></span>

<span style="color: green"><br />
Time seemed to tick slowly as Zak lunged himself forwards into the centre of the battle. With Bette's Leaf Ball in hand, he knew he could make it to her in time and get her bundled safely inside... provided the enemy threat subsided for long enough. This was far from the case, though Porter managed to keep one of the greying Leafeon from continuing its tirade upon Bette by utilising his teeth, the other has no qualms in bringing the trainer into the firing line.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get back, go on...&quot; Zak flailed his arms to no avail, the Leafeon had already began to hone its tail into a leafed blade with every intention of slicing right through the trainer standing in its way. The world slows once more, the seconds turning into minutes as the Verdant Pokémon leaps towards Zak's throat, a distressed cry from Porter lingering in the background. It is only in the final second that the fox loses its course thanks to what seems like a very fateful gust of wind. That is until Zak locates the source of this unlikely gust.<br />
<br />
Above the scene, a shadow passes overhead. Such a well-timed wind could have only come from a master of the sky and it transpired that that was indeed the source. A Braviary begins his descent, having circled the clearing above the trainer and his Pokémon. The sight of such a majestic bird would have normally excited Zak to no end, but not after their arrival. This could very well be one of the avians who had left Tim so gravely wounded as the two had flown to Lily Island. This time, however, the eagle is not alone. Straddled upon his back is an unfamiliar and tattooed face, a dark-skinned man garbed in bones and furs. With a lack of knowledge about the locals of Cascadia, Zak could only assume that this man was one such person. If that was the case and he had been part of the aerial assault as the trainer and his Pidgeot had landed, Zak did not want to provoke the man further.<br />
<br />
&quot;You cannot face them alone. Many have tried, all have failed.&quot; The man speaks in dulcit tones, motioning his hand upwards from his winged steed to emphasise the necklace about his throat. Before Zak even has a chance to reply to the man's strange words, the Braviary beats his wings and returns upwards to launch a proper attack upon the manic Leafeon who had attempted to slice the trainer's throat only moments prior. As the bird begins its attack, so too does Porter, focusing a second icy wind upon the second Leafeon. With both attacks hitting their targets well, Zak lets out a sigh. The worst appeared to be over.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd like to disagree but I really can't, there's no denying that you saved me from that Leaf Blade. Does this mean you're going to help me to vanquish these... things once and for all?&quot; Zak spoke confidently but kept his wits about him nonetheless. He did not want to put his trust in this man before he had truly gauged his personality, his motives, all of it. If he was indeed behind the assault, Zak wanted to be able to have the upper hand and would not be afraid to offer more than a dash of retribution.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you're with me, help me to protect Bette.&quot; Zak kept her Leaf Ball in his hand, if he had an opening he would return her to it as soon as he could, &quot;Porter, you've done great so far. Produce a <b>team</b> of <b>double</b>s to throw both of the Leafeon off. As soon as you have a decent opening, use the speed from a <b>quick attack</b> to launch yourself at the foe for a <b>skull bash</b>.&quot;<br />
<br />
With orders issued, Zak squinted upwards to meet the eye of the man atop the Braviary, awaiting the stranger's decision and attempting to weigh him up at the same time...</span><br />

<br />
<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u> Electric Blue Eye</u>:</b> Sean smiles at your bold statement. You’re certain he has heard his fair share of promises and vows during his tenure as Gym Leader, each eager challenger shouting to the world how they would one day become Champion. And yet, in his old age, Gottfried has remained undefeated, signifying the failure of every single one of them.<br />
<br />
-	Believe me, I would love to see you try. But a match with Gottfried isn’t what’s at stake… not in his current state.<br />
<br />
The last part of his sentence is almost a whisper that only you can hear. The Leader quickly regains focus and prepares to counter your orders, while Diego charges up for its first move.<br />
<br />
-	Take that Ominous Wind. Then <b>Agility</b> around the Ice Beam, get some <b>Payback</b> and finish with an <b>Ominous Wind</b> of your own!<br />
<br />
The undead pirate captain summons a gust of dark wind that strikes Pelliper, but the bird shakes off the hit with little concern in an impressive display of endurance. Diego tries to follow up with a pinpoint Ice Beam, but Pelliper becomes a hard target to hit in the tumultuous winds that kicked up, and the overzealous instructions make aiming at the wings much harder. Spotting its opportunity, the Water-Type flies up gaining a serious boost of speed, and the Ice Beam misses by a wide margin when it is finally fired. Looking to get retribution for the earlier Ominous Wind, the pelican surrounds itself with evil energy and slams right into your Jellicent with a powered-up Payback, dealing a frightening amount of damage!<br />
<br />
-	Having trust in your Pokemon’s resilience allows you to plan accordingly; sometimes you don’t have to dodge everything, and taking a minor hit can even turn into an advantage later on, as you can see.<br />
<br />
Sean’s right; if Pelliper had evaded that Ominous Wind his Payback wouldn’t be half as powerful…<br />
The Water-Type gains altitude again and flaps its wings vigorously, just as Diego recovers and shoots a blast of pure darkness at the foe! Dark Pulse passes through the shadow gale and finds its mark, hitting Pelliper hard, but the latter’s Ominous Wind engulfs Diego at the same time and blows him back several feet, again dealing lots of damage!<br />
<br />
The crowd is going nuts; they chant for Pelliper, then Diego with equal passion. Before you know it, half the people in the audience are cheering for Sean and the other half… is chanting your name! The feeling is indescribable, but it feels you with motivation to push forward and defeat the Gym Leader once and for all!<br />
<br />
Both Pokemon got two hits in, but Diego is in <i>much</i> worse condition… Lacking effective moves to damage the bulky Water-Type, how much longer will the Jellicent hold on?</span></span>

After hearing Sean’s words, Gottfried’s voice echoed in young Ethan’s mind from earlier in the day,
<blockquote class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">
<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandContent ">
<span style="font-size: 9px">…a dying legacy…</span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote> that’s when he realized it, Ethan looked up into the stands…his heart a bit saddened but his mind still unsure, <i>You’re lying…Gottfried. You aren't stepping down because you no longer have the heart to battle, you’re stepping down because…you’re dying.</i> Ethan’s eyes were suddenly overwhelmed with tears…trying his best to hold them back, still he shook his head as if casting the feeling away <i>I’m probably just…over thinking it.</i> Death was honestly, the trainer's greatest fear and was probably why he loved ghost Pokémon so much…because like his Jellicent people could come back to life, a second chance at living.<br />
<br />
The battle proceeded as normal but this time, it seemed Ethan was in for it. Without much to choose from move wise, Ethan had to rely on his creativity above everything else. Unfortunately it wasn't going exactly as planned.<br />
<br />
As a trainer, Ethan wasn't merely a coach to his Pokémon, it was his job that he took very seriously, winning this didn't mean something just to him, it meant something to all of them. And his Pokémon put their faith in him, that he could solve any problem they would be faced with and come out on top.<br />
<br />
But at this critical juncture, was Ethan going to have to switch? <br />
<br />
It seemed the trainer wasn't the only one wondering the same thing as Diego gave him a look from the corner of his eye. The roaring crowd screaming Ethan’s name, it was an honor to serve underneath his guidance… <br />
<br />
<span style="color: deepskyblue">&quot;Don’t worry lade,&quot;</span> Diego said, his voice a bit hard of breathing due to the beat down that was just handed to him but still trying to keep his usually modest tone of voice from fading, <span style="color: deepskyblue">&quot;I've dealt with seagulls all my life sailing the seas…I even remember this one time on my ship when one had the [gull] to challenge me to a fight after trying to take a [peck] out of my majestic mustache.&quot;</span> He laughed his <i>Spaniard</i> accent showing through his words. <span style="color: deepskyblue">&quot;There's an answer to everything, you just got to find it.&quot;</span><br />
<br />
<i>If you aren't giving up despite our odds, then neither am I old friend.</i> That’s when he caught something Sean had said to him…

You decide to accept the old man’s bread and company. After all, it was the first semblance of kindness you’ve encountered since entering the camp. That, and the desolate atmosphere of the canteen is stirring up all kinds of uncomfortable, confusing thoughts about your past that you only wish were clearer...<br />
<br />
-	Matthew heh? Jacob’s always had an eye for people… although at this point, he pretty much has to take what he finds.<br />
<br />
The old man tries to chew another piece of bread with some difficulty, while pointing to the TV nearby.<br />
<br />
-	Some people have it much easier than they know. D’you think any of them over at that Tournament could survive out here, in the “real” world? I’d wager not. But you’re here, so you gotta be a survivor, and that’s what Jacob needs the most right now. He’s a fine kid with a good head on his shoulders, that one… As for me, I’m Drummond. Oldest worker on camp, and supposedly the wisest if you ask Jacob.<br />
<br />
You try to picture the elder in front of you in a lab coat, working on top secret research material, and it proves exceedingly difficult. Then again, he seems a lot more cheerful than most people you’ve come across so far, so maybe you’re underestimating Drummond.<br />
<br />
-	I was the overseer for most of the research conducted here regarding climate changes on this island. The aurora seemed to play a crucial role in the circadian rhythm of most Pokemon on Glacier Island. Now the sky is pitch-black and I, of all people, have no idea what’s going on. Some scientist I am, eh?...<br />
<br />
He reaches for the inner pocket of his dusty old coat, and pulls out something wrapped in a white piece of cloth. He places the cloth on your hand and it’s warm to the touch… You unwrap the object and it immediately starts emitting a faint glow… it’s a

<b>1x Heat Rock</b>!<br />
<br />
-	Make no mistake about it; Jacob brought you in because you can fight. There’s no place for charity in a world like this, you’ll be expected to contribute to this community as long as you take shelter within these walls. I’m sure you’ll be going on the hunt tomorrow… you’ll need that in case things go sour. Shards hate light and heat. That thing has kept me safe every time we go out, but something tells me you’ll need it more than I do.<br />
<br />
Drummond yawns and gets up, ready to turn in for the night. He waves goodbye and leaves you with one last statement.<br />
<br />
-	See you out there tomorrow kid. Yeah, I’m coming too. I can’t fight worth jack but I know that wasteland better than anybody; I’ll find us some food alright. Be seeing you!<br />
<br />
You’re left by yourself again, and you find yourself unable to hold back a yawn as well. Seems that move works on humans too… The canteen is empty by now, and you’re feeling exhausted; compelled as you might be to continue exploring the camp, you don’t want to break curfew on your first night (if it exists), and you need to get some rest for tomorrow’s risky endeavor.<br />
<br />
Recalling the way to the dormitory, you make your way over to the bland building. Everything looks the same at this time of night, but more disturbingly, night and day don’t feel different at all. The constant darkness in the sky is unsettling, as if something was missing… as if someone went and stole all the colors that were meant to be there. The entire camp seems to have fallen asleep, not a single sound to be heard. So this is what complete nothingness feels like…<br />
<br />
There are no assigned rooms. Some are taken as you peak inside, but a handful remains vacant. You pick one at random and walk inside to find an old mattress on the floor, a dusty PC by the wall and a single lamp hanging from the ceiling. You try to switch on the light and it flickers, barely illuminating the room but meaning that there is indeed some electrical power fueling the dormitory.<br />
<br />
You’ll be going on a dangerous mission tomorrow, and tired as you are, preparations are essential. You recall how both Psyduck and Deckard are undergoing treatment, but you can’t afford to go back into the wilderness empty-handed. The PC probably won’t remain turned on for several transfers, but you might keep it running long enough for a withdrawal in case you brought nobody else along…<br />
<br />
Before you go to sleep, how will you prepare?</span></span>

<br />
<span style="color: lightblue">The old man's actions where kind, but his voice echoed anger and bitterness; an understandable side-effect from the desolate atmosphere, and for any mind trapped in a cage with no means of recovery of escape. The old man had avoided total parsimoniousness but his attitude towards the outside world was unwarranted, an unnecessary evil that grew inside and dragged his soul towards a darker path of crab in a bucket mentality. For Matthew, his entire life had been on “team people”, the idea that celebration of life and accomplishment far outweighed the misery, burden and hindrance of jealousy. Look inwards and be satisfied or change until you are. <br />
<br />
The example, of which the old man callously criticized those living outside, participating in such a tournament, was of no use to anyone. It provided an escape of the mind, a lack of action that kept the individual stuck in a place of hatred and imprisonment without moving forward. What energy he was using to compare the “us and them” mentality or the “real world” was a concept that made no sense. The people battling in that tournament probably had no idea that this world was even a reality. Matthew sure didn't before this experience. He wasn't an exception or faux pas who “survived” but an ordinary man, just as the battlers on the flickering TV show, who stumbled into this microcosm and survived through the help of others, namely Jacob and Daryl. <br />
<br />
Desolation had driven many a great man to insanity and beyond, a chemical imbalance which fascinated the trainer to study psychosis in its totality. Matthew kept his mouth shut as the man, now introduced as Drummond, continued to introduce himself and his background. There was a hypocrisy in his words too, before this disturbing disaster Drummond was nought but a man with a job, a lab-coated entity working a “normal” job away from the multitude of fucked up things in the universe. How could one so “wise” cast judgement when he belonged to that society not so long ago. And what is the real world anyway? There's no fake world. There is only one, and the distorted Orwellian/Lord of the Flies attitude had no application if its inhabitants didn't let it. <br />
<br />
Matthew attempted to de-crumple and de-cringe his face, though he would have suspected to little avail, as Drummond kept going, talking of the importance of the aurora and its effect on the world, speaking as a overseer on climate change. Matthew knew very little about the subject, if any at all, and his concern grew at Drummond's admittance that they didn't know either. <br />
<br />
<i>“At least they're not lying about it”</i>, he thought to himself, silently listening to the scientist's qualms. <br />
<br />
Matthew's thoughts were interrupted by Drummond's actions. The old man withdrew an cloaked item from his inside pocket, sliding it across the table. Carefully unwrapping it, Matthew found himself face to face with a Heat Rock, an item he knew boosted the quality and elongated the time of the Pokémon move Sunny Day. Matthew had never owned or seen one, and begun to run his fingers over the powerstone's exterior, slightly jumping at its pulsating heat and faint glow. <br />
<br />
Drummond told of the group's expectation to uphold contribution to the group, gripping Matthew's mind to ask of what happens to anyone who didn't. He held his nerve, thanking the scientist for the gift and quickly stashing it away with his personal belongings. Drummond followed by yawning, forcing Matthew to indulge in the contagious act. Drummond parted, leaving with a comment that he would be joining the team, despite his age and fighting ability, because of his ability to navigate the wasteland. <br />
<br />
Matthew smiled weakly as he begun to feel the effects of fatigue. With the canteen empty for all except himself, the Pokémon trainer found himself once again in the enamoured arms of silence. It was strange, he had travelled to Cascadia for the invaluable ability to move away from the usual hustle and bustle of a big city. Left in nothing the stillness, Matthew couldn't help but crave the busyness. Maybe he was scared. Scared of being left alone with his thoughts. <br />
<br />
Standing up and tucking his chair back into the table, Matthew cast aside any doubt and headed for the exit and back out to the dormitory. Another bland building under the guise of darkness; the forever black filling the sky in a depressing never-ending cycle of bleakness. Perhaps now he knew why Drummond had developed such an attitude. Without the colour and the beauty of the sky, the semblance of life drifts away like …. <br />
<br />
Matthew didn't finish the thought as he rolled up on an untaken room. His eyes, nearly glued shut from lack of sleep, managed to see a mattress on the floor and a PC in the corner. He groaned, throwing his backpack at the foot of the bed before falling onto the bedding, the small lamp barely illuminating the room. His eyes clamped shut.<br />
<br />
…<br />
<br />
…<br />
<br />
“fuck”<br />
<br />
He was tired and yet his mind wouldn't rest. It raced with ideas, thoughts, songs, nothingness. He opened one eye, staring at the room once more. Matthew sighed, getting lazily to his feet to turn the light off, saving whatever small amount of power his dysfunctional lamp used to illuminate the box. He stared at the PC, then back at the bed. He was tired, but his mind wouldn't let him sleep without proper preperation.<br />
<br />
He unbuckled his now-empty Pokémon belt and threw it on the ground next to his bag, his soul missing his Pokémon, worrying about their safety. Would they have recovered by morning? His eyes fixated on the bed as he rationalized their recovery, but his head told him to withdraw another. How could he show up to the hunt without a Pokémon, expecting them to return Porygon and Psyduck within less than 12 hours? <br />
<br />
He couldn't. Finding the on switch Matthew quickly begun to tap on the computer keys, his head bobbing as he nodded off, only to be awakened by the old PC's low hum and screen brightness. <br />
<br />
<i>*withdraw Shieldon*</i><br />
<br />
A small popping sound indicated his success as he left the Pokéball on the in-built holder, shutting off the PC before literally collapsing onto the mattress to the side, falling asleep within mere seconds of his head hitting the soft canvas...</span><br />

<br />
Smoke fills the garden as Lucy’s Pokeball springs open. A single purple flame flickers through the mist like a small beacon of hope, and when the cloud disperses the tiny Litwick is ready to put on a show. You know you have to make this count or lose Dana’s interest for good, so you create the prettiest scenario you can imagine your head and try to have Lucy bring it to life!<br />
<br />
-	Go on little one… remind my precious Dana what it’s like to amaze a crowd!<br />
<br />
Lucy pauses briefly after your orders, trying to envision the big picture in her mind before getting to work. It’s clear that she lacks experience, taking her time to position herself properly and going over all the motions in her head before she actually gets started. The Litwick’s inexperience and fear of failing her first public display are showing… can she pull it off?...<br />
<br />
The Ghost-Type starts to spin in place, releasing countless purple and orange embers into the sky. Swirling in the air, the flames dance elegantly and flicker brightly; some fade in the wind, while others soon begin to rain down on the garden like a swarm of fireflies. Oscar looks on in silence with a smile on his wrinkly face, while Dana’s expression remains unreadable on the other side of the window. For better or worse, she still hasn’t looked away…<br />
<br />
Just as the tiny embers are about to touch the carefully-trimmed blades of grass, Lucy’s eyes glow blue and time seems to pause; the sparks float just barely above the ground, while a thin layer of haze begins to cover the garden floor. The real-life painting comes together to create the illusion of a fantasy land of mist and fireflies, but it requires too much focus for Lucy to maintain and soon the illusion dispels as the exhausted Litwick catches her breath, looking anxiously at you for approval.<br />
<br />
You don’t care what Dana or anyone else might have thought of that – to you, the display was magical, brief as it may have been. Lucy managed to put together your vision perfectly, creating a utopic scenario out of a common backyard. But the purpose of the appeal was to please the old lady, and you find yourself instinctively looking at the window… only to find out Dana is gone!<br />
<br />
Oscar rushes inside and you follow; when did she decide to leave? Did you fail to impress her so badly that she lost interest midway? That was the best you could do, if that wasn’t good enough…<br />
<br />
-Oh my… Dear, are you alright? What happened?!<br />
<br />
You arrive at the living room to find Dana back in her couch, crying and sobbing uncontrollably. Oscar is by her side, concerned and at a loss for words, all in all a heartbreaking scene… You walk up to the woman, shocked by her sudden change of behavior – she seemed to be made of ice when you first introduced yourself, but now she has clearly broken… why?<br />
Suddenly she gets back up, trembling as she does, and walks over to you. She pulls you in for a hug, saying nothing for a moment, but finally whispering in your ear in between tears. <br />
<br />
-	That… That was beautiful beyond words, dear… but it can never be real again. The art is dead, it is forbidden, no matter how bright you shine. They will take that shine, the beauty and joy away, lock you up if they have to… Please, for your sake, never do this again. Contests are dead… dead!<br />
<br />
She continues to cry as she lets go and falls to her knees, covering her face with her hands. It seems she had all this sadness piled up inside of her, poorly repressed, and your wonderful appeal only served to stir up unwanted memories. Moved to tears, Dana can’t bring herself to speak another word, and Oscar sighs as he makes a revelation…<br />
<br />
-	I never wanted this to happen… I only wanted her to feel happy again. But all I did was force the wrong memories out of her! Please forgive me Liza, you shouldn’t have to witness this. The truth is… Contests in Cascadia didn’t simply fade out of fashion. They were… forbidden.<br />
<br />
Oscar helps his wife up and lovingly encourages her to sit on the couch again to regain her composure. Your stunned silence serves as incentive for the elder to elaborate on his statement, although with obvious reluctance.<br />
<br />
-	The more you know about this, the more endangered you will be. Promise me you won’t act on this knowledge, or nothing good will come to you!<br />
<br />
He clears his throat and ignores Dana’s pleading eyes. She doesn’t want you to know the truth, but Oscar feels he owes it to you after what he put you through.<br />
<br />
-	Some thirty years ago, Contests were at the height of their popularity in Salin City. They were government-sponsored events, much like the Pokemon League and other Battle competitions. But even at their peak, Contests were never half as profitable as Battles. They were a novelty, a side show at best, compared to the traditional spectacle that people had grown used to for generations. And so, despite their fervent fanbase, Cascadia’s Government declared Contests a non-profitable endeavor and shut down any official support to the activity.<br />
<br />
Dana sobs again and Oscar holds her hand, but keeps going.<br />
<br />
-	The decision didn’t sit well with the general public; even though Battles were much more popular, casual fans still enjoyed the alternative. The Government’s adamant position only served to increase Contests’ fanbase, who demanded that the events be reinstated and funded on equal footing with Pokemon Battles. It wasn’t long until unofficial Contest Halls were erected and underground competitions popped up all over Salin and Cascadia in general. Contests went from simply being abandoned to becoming an illegal activity… Those who insisted on performing without permission would be tracked down and arrested, until finally all pockets of resistance were crushed.<br />
<br />
He stops briefly, looks at a dejected Dana and whispers <i>”I’m sorry”</i> before concluding his tale.<br />
<br />
-	Dana was the most famous and successful coordinator in Cascadia, perhaps all of Fizzy Bubbles. She was one of the last symbols of hope for Contest enthusiasts, and performed to the end on any and all venues. And for that, she was punished the hardest… POLT agents crashed an illegal event and arrested her, as well as the other participants. She was only in custody for a few hours though, before the Minister of Internal Affairs himself realized that he could use her to deal the final blow to the Contest revolution. Under his orders, her lifelong partner Arcanine was apprehended, and portrayed in the media as if Dana had voluntarily handed it over, admitting defeat.<br />
<br />
Dana bursts out in tears yet again, and Oscar almost does as well. His voice swelling with emotion, he apologizes to her yet again and turns to you one final time.<br />
<br />
-	Since Arcanine was taken, Dana was never happy again. That Pokemon, and Contests in general, meant the world to her. I’ve stayed by her side the whole time, and quit my Battling career shortly thereafter; it wasn’t fair that I got to live my dream while she withered away at home… I turned to you for help because nothing I’ve done for the past thirty years have ever cheered her up. I was desperate and tired, unfairly so, but my judgment was clouded and I involved you in all of this. I am so sorry Liza. Your appeal was glorious and Dana loved it, but it also forced her to relive all of this…<br />
<br />
Suddenly Dana interrupts him, her voice faint but determined as she wipes her tears.<br />
<br />
-	What happened to me was a lesson. I endangered my Pokemon out of stubbornness, believing I could somehow overcome the machine… The system always wins. Remember that, and stay as far away from Contests as possible in Cascadia if you prize your Pokemon friends. Don’t be selfish like I was… or you’ll end up like me. I thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for showing me true love for Contests after all this time… but for your own sake, don’t ever do it again!<br />
<br />
Oscar walks over to you and again holds out his ticket for the Grad Farewell tournament where Ethan is competing.<br />
<br />
-	That Pink Scarf is yours to keep, but we have nothing else to give you. To be honest, it might be better if you forget us and never mention this to anyone… Dana no longer poses a threat, but the anti-Contest mentality remains. If you want to keep travelling Fizzy Bubbles without fear of repression, you should choose a different path... like that boy you fancy, for example?<br />
<br />
He winks and musters a smile as he waves the ticket in front of you. It seems both elders want you to move on with your life, grateful as they are for everything you did for them. Maybe leaving them behind and forgetting all of this is in your best interest…<br />
<br />
What will you do now?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver">Liza had been watching the performance on the side lines, like any loving mother would at their child’s first school residual or play, she couldn’t be prouder. <i>You can do it sweetheart!</i> The fireworks were speculator worthy of any amusement parks show and the way Lucy had controlled the flames was beyond breath taking, of course she had learned the way fireflies would move at night watching Volbeat and Illumise dance in the late summer nights outside a Pokémon Center’s window overlooking the forest.. <br />
<br />
Everything seemed like it was going to go just as planned but towards the end Lucy couldn’t control the fire and the haze effectively enough, allowing the audience to see only a bit of was to be their finale.<br />
<br />
With Lucy coughing from a bit of fatigue Liza ran over to her Litwick, hugging her even though the flame on top of her candle like head was a bit draining of the young women’s life force. <br />
<br />
<i>Mama…I’m sorry, we failed, I couldn’t *cough* hold the illusion *cough**cough* long enough…</i><br />
<br />
Liza shock her head, “No it was beautiful, and don’t worry about what anyone else thinks, I thought you were Magnificent!”<br />
<br />
<i>*cough* Really Mama? *cough*</i><br />
<br />
“You were the star!” Liza exclaimed.<br />
<br />
<i>Thank yo-</i> Lucy said as she looked as though she was about to faint. “Oh dear, Lucy darling take a long rest in your pokeball, you deserved it.”<br />
<br />
Returning her Litwick back into her ghostball, the trainer remembered that this was no practice performance, this was a performance meant for Dana and she knew Lucy worked extra hard to show the old women what Contests meant to them. When the young lass looked up from where she stood however, Dana was gone. Her mind abuzz with thoughts <i>Did she even watch our performances? When did she stop watching, I’d been so focused on Lucy…</i> Liza then turned to Oscar who looked like all the color from his skin had run dry. Rushing inside Liza followed Oscar where they both found Dana laying on the couch crying. <br />
<br />
It was shocking to say the least, looking at her now she wasn’t the Ice Queen Liza figured the women to be, she seemed frail now, somehow a bit smaller, she was a person with an emotion and feelings not an automatic robot. But why was she crying?<br />
<br />
That was when Dana picked herself up and gave Liza a hug and held her tightly for a while, the young women didn’t know what to do but felt an incredible pain coming from the elderly women’s heart that Liza just hugged her back. “What was that for…?”<br />
<br />
“That… That was beautiful beyond words, dear… but it can never be real again. The art is dead, it is forbidden, no matter how bright you shine. They will take that shine, the beauty and joy away; lock you up if they have to… Please, for your sake, never do this again. Contests are dead… dead!”<br />
<br />
“They?” Liza inquired remembering from earlier that it wasn’t the first time Dana had mentioned…‘They’ before. She turned to look at Oscar, the man that had originally asked to bring her here. “What’s going on…?”<br />
<br />
That was when Oscar told her the horrible truth, despite Dana’s wishes…how contests had been banned, how they even became an illegal event and though they were revolutionaries like Dana, the supports failed to reach the minds of the government…they even took Dana’s prized Pokémon captive to make their point clear.<br />
<br />
“How can people just take self expression and ban it. It isn’t fair…” Liza looked at the elderly couple, it was difficult to see them in the eye and not be able to say, <i>I can help you.</i> when the damage had already been done, the suffering and years lost just because of a heartless and cold government that only cared about money and power. Shutting down anyone that tried to have a voice, it was insufferable and Liza couldn’t stand for it! But- knowing everything she knew now…she couldn’t right let them know what she had in mind; after all, Oscar and Dana wanted her to move on. She would have to do this alone, without their help…she had came her for one reason and it was for contests. It was a wonderful surprise when she learned Ethan was in the city too, but it wouldn’t feel right that she got to live happily ever after if these people couldn’t.<br />
<br />
Looking at the ticket presented to her Liza slowly reached for it, grasping it in her hand. “Thank you.” Her words grateful but still a bit sadden after everything she had heard. “I must apologize if I had offended you Dana, had I known…no. Even knowing it was an honor to have performed in front of such a legendary coordinator as you. But I am sorry if my performance had brought back bad memories, it wasn’t my intention. I can’t even begin to imagine the pain you must’ve felt when your Pokémon was taken from you. If someone would do that to Samantha or Lucy or anyone of them I’d-” she said choking on her words, and trying her best not to cry as she whipped a tear away from her eye <i>Why do I have to be such a cry baby *sniffle*</i><br />
<br />
“While I don’t agree with it, I won’t get myself into any trouble acting on the knowledge I know.” Liza said as she placed a hand behind her back crossing her two fingers. <i>I will try my best to save your Arcanine…</i> she could feel it in her chest that what she had in mind was a suicide mission. This might’ve been a big city, but there must’ve some kind of information in a library somewhere of the history of Contests, maybe if Dana’s Arcanine had made another appearance after she had to give it up. Of course history is usually written by the victors there might not have been any record of Contests anywhere in town. But that just meant that Liza would have her work cut out for her. If she couldn’t find anything, nothing, the tiniest of clues to help her on her crusade she’d finally admit defeat and go see Ethan at the coliseum.<br />
<br />
Liza then motioned to pick up Dana from off of the floor, “Dana, I’m going to miss you, you too Oscar.” Hugging the both of them before waving goodbye, her heart feeling a bit heavy as she made her way out of the house and out the garden with the unfinished swing, broken dreams and promises. Deciding to go to the Pokémon Center to heal her Litwick a little before setting off again…there was no telling what kind of danger she would be placing herself and her Pokémon in.</span><br />

<br />
OoC: Because of the way the story had unfolded, I thought leaving Dana and Oscar behind and allowing my character to go at it alone felt like the best option. They had struggled so much that asking them to help in what would be Liza's crusade would feel, selfish. But if for some reason this wasn't what you had in mind as far as options went then let me know and I'll change it.</span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>jolteonjak</u>:</u></b> <i>((Welcome back JJ, and congrats on graduating from the AR! ^^))</i><br />
<br />
Baro and Excadrill again prove they are a formidable pair, effectively countering your strategies at every turn. You scramble your head for a way to surprise the seemingly omniscient opponents, but the pressure isn’t helping. Excadrill is about to unleash a deadly Earth Power that will definitely leave a dent in your tiny Cyndaquil, possibly knock him out clean!<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a memory springs up. A forest fire caused by you and Cyndaquil in a previous adventure, reminding you that using the woods for cover would only further infuriate the already fuming Baro… but that didn’t mean you couldn’t use fire <i>at all</i>!<br />
<br />
The Fire Mouse’s expression lights up the second your orders reach his ears. It’s a risky tactic, but it’s all you have to go on! You can only hope that Cyndaquil’s already strong enough to propel his own body upwards with his Flamethrower… otherwise he’s a sitting duck! The Fire-Type arcs his head back and unleashes a massive stream of flames against the ground directly beneath it. For a while, nothing happens, and the floor starts to crack and crumble as Excadrill finishes charging up… Just as you’re about to lose all hope, Cyndaquil’s body is suddenly propelled upwards by the fire pillar, narrowly dodging five deadly earthen spike that sprout moments later from the rocky soil! You did it!<br />
<br />
Baro looks shocked for the first time in the entire match, watching in disbelief as Cyndaquil reaches an incredible height. High up in the air, he takes aim and dives down, homing in on the foe who is still stunned for missing. Golden stars surround the mouse’s body, and explode on contact immediately after Cyndaquil lands hard on top of Excadrill’s head!<br />
<br />
-	It… can’t be!<br />
<br />
You realize why Baro looks so shocked: Excadrill begins to flail its head incessantly, looking to drive its iron horn into Cyndaquil, but somehow the tiny Fire-Type is… holding on to the mole’s head! The more Excadrill struggles, the harder Cyndaquil tries to keep its grasp, knowing that the consequences will be terrible if he falls off and tumbles right in front of the massive opponent!<br />
<br />
You have effectively closed the distance between Cyndaquil and his foe, surprising both Baro and Excadrill into temporary confusion. You need to find a way to capitalize before the Ground-Type shoves your partner off, because it <i>will</i> pummel Cyndaquil into a pulp the second it falls to the ground!<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: green">With the powerful Earth Power attack making its way towards Cyndaquil, Chad had to act fast. He remembered reading stories growing up of a trainer who once ordered his Cyndaquil to use Flamethrower to propel itself out of harm’s way during a gym battle. Excadrill had proven to be an almost insurmountable opponent already, so he thought he would give it a try.<br />
<br />
Chad watched white-knuckled while his Fire Mouse blew his flames on the ground desperately hoping he could escape this potentially destructive attack. ‘Please be ok buddy,’ Chad thought to himself, wiping sweat off his brow. Since the Flamethrower attack commenced things got a little warm. It must have been a combination of the heat and Chad’s nerves at this risky move. Then, the unexpected happened, the flames began to push Cyndaquil upwards. It worked! Cyndaquil was able to escape the devastating Earth Power from Excadrill. He looked up to the sky to see Cyndaquil looking down at everyone, and when he was high enough, he ceased the flames.<br />
<br />
Cyndaquil began to descend now, and as he did, he surrounded himself with Swift attack. He watched him fall, stars orbiting him and collide with Excadrill on his head. The Swift stars all pelted Excadrill. While the damage wasn’t great, at least it was damage. <br />
<br />
Now looking eye level, Chad noticed Baro had finally changed expressions, no longer full of bravado. Baro was actually surprised! Could it be that he thought he may lose?<br />
<br />
Looking back at the brawling Pokémon, Chad discovered why. Excadrill was trying knock Cyndaquil off by flailing about, but Cyndaquil was holding on hard. Maybe it was the risk they took earlier. Maybe it was just the fact that Cyndaquil was now on top of Excadrill. Whatever it was, Chad decided he needed to exploit this lapse in Baro’s seemingly unfaltering courage. “Cyndaquil, hang on tight! Use <b>Double Kick</b>,” Chad thought this was the time to take advantage of the Steel-type’s weakness to Fighting-type attacks. He wondered if Cyndaquil had any Fire left in him after avoiding that Earth Power. But, he thought he would give it a try, “Give Excadrill a <b>Fire Blast</b> while in close proximity. If at any point you happen to get thrown off, immediately use <b>Defense Curl</b>.”<br />
<br />
Chad thought it was strange how one attack seemed to be turning the tide of this battle. He was really getting into it too.<br />

<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> Realistically, trying to make it across the lava pool through the seemingly random platforms that popped up looked nearly impossible for the group, at least in your eyes. Figuring you don't <i>have</i> to play the enemy's game, you put together an alternative plan, thinking back to a similar strategy once employed by Lily.<br />
<br />
Godric emerges from his Ball, wincing in pain from the burn on his back, but James is there for his friend. Worn out but willing to help, he musters the last of his healing spores and scatters them across the Nidoking's wounds. Immediately, the skin is repaired and the pain gone, much to Godric's relief. James has done his best, and now it's his turn.<br />
<br />
It's an unorthodox plan, in all fairness. Confusion is mostly used to inflict mental damage on foes, like many other Psychic moves. But the fundamentals do allow for a Pokemon to move objects and creatures with the power of its mind, so in theory it could work... However, Nidoking is not a Psychic-Type. In fact, Psychic is one of its inherent weaknesses! This is the gamble of all gambles...<br />
<br />
Godric, feeling refreshed, closes his eyes and focuses as hard as he can. The move itself doesn't possess significant telekinetic force, and not being versed in Psychic maneuvers makes it that much harder to get the job done. There is no way Godric can get you all across the massive lake at the same time, and realizing his own limitations, he opts to transport one creature at a time. Reasoning that the Heatmor are your priority, he targets the leader of the pack first; a blue aura surrounds the anteater and soon he finds himself floating in the air. Godric motions forward with his arms and Heatmor is sent hovering just above the pool of liquid fire... you hold your breath as you watch the events unfold, and breathe a sigh of relief when the Pokemon's feet touch the ground on the far end of the lake safely. Godric did it!<br />
<br />
However, glancing back at the Nidoking, the strain this strategy is putting on him is already obvious. Poison-Types aren't mean to endure this particular kind of strain, and already it seems that Godric is overexerting himself. Relentless nonetheless, he repeats the plan on a second Heatmor, then a third, one by one until only a single malnourished anteater remains on your side of the pool. Godric is gasping for air and tormented by a massive headache; his vision is starting to blur as his mind begins to give in to the pressure of the psychic hold.<br />
Tapping into his remaining energy, he manages to lift the last Heatmor as well, and it floats slowly across the lake like the others, wobbling all the way, just barely staying above the lava; one minor breach of concentration is all it takes for the Fire-Type to fall to its doom!<br />
Godric gives it his all, closing its eyes as hard as it can to sharpen its remaining mental power... and after what feels like an eternity, the final member of the pack touches solid ground on the other side of the liquid deathtrap, much to your relief!<br />
<br />
The Nidoking's effort was remarkable, but one thing is painfully obvious - as the Poison-Type falls to its knees, tormented by a massive headache, you realize he's all out of Psychic energy. The strain of carrying across so many Pokemon has all but drained Godric of his strength; his vision is blurry and he's gasping for air, and it's a foregone conclusion that he won't be able to transport anyone else... leaving you and Meowth separated from the Heatmor group!<br />
<br />
You have to find a new way across for yourself and your partner. Rocky platforms continue to emerge randomly for a few seconds before being swallowed by the lava, but how reliable are they? Your plan was a success but Godric, despite his best efforts, was unable to carry it to completion.<br />
<br />
With no way to rely on Confusion anymore, how will you make it across? </span></span> <br />
<br />

<br />
<b><u>The Silver Forest</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>jolteonjak</u>:</b> This is it - the time to finally go on the offensive! Baro's Excadrill held the advantage for most of the match with its bulk, strength and incredible link to his partner. But thanks to some quick thinking on your part, Cyndaquil has managed to even the odds and holds a strategic advantage!<br />
<br />
- Your parlor tricks merely delay the inevitable! You will <i>not</i> defeat us!<br />
<br />
Again Excadrill moves to attack without any explicit instructions from Baro. Its claw glows silver, and it's obvious the foe intends to rip Cyndaquil in two! However, your instructions couldn't have better timing; the Fire-Type charges energy in his feet and drives hem hard into Excadrill's steel helmet, leaving two massive dents in it while propelling himself upwards and away from the enemy! The mole's claw finds nothing on its way up, with Cyndaquil high up in the air; refusing to back down, Excadrill jumps up and covers its head with both claws, taking the shape of a massive drill as it starts to spin!<br />
<br />
- It's all over for you, foreigner! I will prove Saint's trust was misplaced after all!<br />
<br />
the <b>Drill Run</b> flies straight at the airborne Cyndaquil... but he's ready! Arching his head back, the fire mouse gathers every ounce of Fire energy within him and breathes out a huge <i>Daimonji</i>-shaped Fire Blast at point-blanks range! A split second before Exacrill makes contact with Cyndaquil, the blazing attack explodes against the Steel-Type, creating massive burst of flames that almost sets fire to the forest around you!<br />
<br />
- You fool... what have you done?!<br />
<br />
A bright orange light fills the clearing, and when it finally subsides... Cyndaquil and Excadrill are both lying on their backs! Both Pokemon are breathing heavily, but each of them turns around and struggles to its feet at exactly the same time, eyeing one another with a burning drive to win. This last turn of events has effectively left both sides on equal footing, so drained of strength they could collapse at any moment, but neither opponent is willing to give up!<br />
<br />
- I refuse to lose to you... Excadrill, we finish this now!<br />
<br />
With both Pokemon on the brink of exhaustion, it's painfully obvious that one last move is all either of them can muster. Whoever strikes first, or hardest, will win... it's all riding on this one! You've seen how Baro and Excadrill fight, can you find a way to outlast the foe on what is sure to be the last round?<br />
<br />
What will you do?! </span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Pearl’s Perap</u>:</b> Porter assumes an offensive stance, glaring at both Leafeon, who don't exactly look back at the Glaceon - their eyes are still locked on Bette, almost obsessively, which is awkward considering their position. Faced with a Flying-Type and an Ice-Type, one would imagine their survival instinct to kick in at some point and urge them to run, but neither appear willing to back down!<br />
<br />
- You have brought a Grass-Type to this place... You are either a fool or a talented deceiver.<br />
<br />
The Braviary takes to the sky, flaps its wings and sends a wave of burning-hot wind against the foes, blowing them away before they can dodge. Crying in pain, both fall to the floor feeling the effects of the high-temperature gust; one of the Leafeon struggles back to its feet, but the second - the one attack by Braviary's Air Slash before - erupts into flames in a horrifying sight. Its colorless skin catches fire like paper and burns away, ash carried by the wind, leaving behind... the corpse of a regular-colored Leafeon!<br />
<br />
Riding the massive eagle, you notice the man staring straight at you, as if gauging you the same way you're trying to gauge him. It seems he's trying to judge your expression based on the events that just happened...<br />
<br />
- It seems... this is foreign to you. You do not look indifferent. Perhaps you really are just a lost fool.<br />
<br />
Porter takes advantage of the opening and multiplies into four copies of itself, one of the illusions standing directly between Bette and the remaining foe. The enemy looks lost and confused as it loses sight of your fallen partner, and before it can assess the situation the real Porter lunges straight at it! Catching speed as it dashes, reaching incredible speed, it tucks its head in and propels it forward, ramming its skull into the opponent's torso. The ghostly Leafeon is sent flying back several steps and crashes into a nearby tree, and as it does, its pale skin breaks apart in a cloud of dust. Behind remains another regular Leafeon, lying motionlessly against the trunk... dead. <b>Porter gains 1 Level!</b><br />
<br />
The man makes the Braviary land and leaps off of its back. He walks over to you, a towering figure with a stern look. He stands in silence for a few moments, looks over at Bette and finally bows stiffly.<br />
<br />
- You did well. My kin call me Rogo. I ordered the assault on your Pidgeot.<br />
<br />
You're left temporarily speechless by the man's blunt, seemingly remorseless confession. How can he say that with a straight face? You're left conflicted; on one hand, he was responsible for almost killing you and severely injuring Tim. On the other hand, he came to your assistance and effectively saved your life by stopping the Leafeon's Leaf Blade earlier...<br />
<br />
After this turn of events, what will you do? </span></span><br />

<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u> Electric Blue Eye</u>:</b> You wonder if the Champion's true reason for retiring lies in his impending death, even if the massive elder appears to the embodiment of health. Dwelling on it now won't do you any good, so you quickly refocus on the match, which has taken a turn for the worse...<br />
<br />
Pelliper eyes Diego with confidence, having barely felt its offense. The pelican is bulky and easily endured the Jellicent's Ominous Wind, and you quickly realize that brute force alone won't get you the win here. Taking Sean's words to heart, you change your strategy up and decide to make the most of your current disadvantage: with Diego barely conscious and Pelliper at practically full health, now is the perfect time to turn even the odds!<br />
<br />
Diego seems to agree and summons a ghostly purple chain that extends from its own body and wraps itself aroudn one of Pelliper's wings. Sean's expression remains unchanged even when the chain turns red and the health of each Pokemon evens out, with a large amount being transferred from the bird to your own Pokemon. Diego looks refreshed, having regained practically half his strength, whereas Pelliper suddenly looks short of breath and is forced to land to regain its bearings.<br />
<br />
- Glad to see you've taught your Jellicent such a move. When used at the right time, it can completely change the flow of battle, but it requires a competent Trainer to make the most of.<br />
<br />
As Sean praises you, one doubt surfaces in your head. Pelliper used Agility before; why didn't it try to dodge Pain Split at all?...<br />
<br />
- My turn. <b>Roost</b> to heal the damage, <b>Seed Bomb</b> and <b>Shock Wave</b>.<br />
<br />
Instantly Pelliper tucks its wings in and relaxes its body; Not willing to let that happen, Diego brings its fins together and charges up Dark energy into a sphere... but before he can fire the blast Pelliper unleashes a blistering-fast barrage of seeds, courtesy of the previous Agility, which pelt the Water-Type and explode on contact for heavy damage!<br />
Diego falls, staggered, and manages to fight back with a pulse of shadows which take the Jellicent's shape before connecting with the Roosting Pelliper. The attack, albeit not very powerful, has the valuable property of ignoring the foe's defense, causing obvious discomfort to the bird but not nearly enough to defeat it... especially after the Roost.<br />
With Diego still feeling the effect of Seed Bomb, Pelliper raises its wings and gathers static between them, before hurling a sphere of electricity which unfailingly homes in on the ghost. With a loud crackling sound, lighting bursts around your partner, and when it subsides... Diego lies on the ground, defeated.<br />
<br />
- A valiant effort, and your strategy was sound, but this one was decided from the start. You did an impressive job raising Diego, but I'm not going to go easy on you. Any more tricks up your sleeve Ethan? </span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> <i>((I liked your approach there, don't worry about thinking outside the box! You don't have to bend to the updater's &quot;expectations&quot;, part of the fun of updating is seeing what you guys come up with! ^^))</i><br />
<br />
Involving Oscar and Dana in a struggle they can't win isn't right. But not pursuing this matter further, in your mind, is even worse! You lie to tranquilize the elderly couple, but fully intend to look into this tremendous injustice and, if possible, fix it...<br />
<br />
Your priority is returning to the Pokemon Center, seeing as your Litwick exhausted herself in that spectacular performance. But where do you go from there? If there really is a higher power behind this whole story, no doubt they'll have covered their tracks. Finding Dana's Arcanine, or any proof of the Government's involvement for that matter, will no doubt be next to impossible...<br />
<br />
You arrive once again at the Center, where several people of all ages remain, waiting for their partners to be healed, changing up their teams at the PC, trading Pokemon to various corners of the world or simply hanging out. As you approach the counter, Nurse Joy seems to remember your face and greets you warmly, before taking Litwick's Pokeball for healing. While you wait, you find yourself absent-mindedly looking at the TV again, only to see Ethan's Jellicent Diego fall before his opponent's Pelliper. An ill omen, or a simple coincidence?...<br />
<br />
Suddenly, someone tugs at your leg, snapping you from your trance. Looking down you see a young boy holding out a piece of paper. You take it from him, puzzled...<br />
<br />
- A grown-up outside told me to give this to you! Bye!<br />
<br />
Before you can even reply, the boy runs out the door giggling, clearly amused by whatever game he seems to be playing. You look at the single sheet he gave you and find something hastily written in black marker...<br />
<br />
<b><i>&quot;DON'T TRY.&quot;</i></b><br />
<br />
What is the meaning of this? Is someone watching you? Is someone... <i>aware</i> of what you're planning to do? But how?! Still, there's no way this can be a mere coincidence... You look around in alarm, trying to spot anyone suspicious, but everyone seems to be minding their own business...<br />
<br />
Nurse Joy still hasn't returned with your partner. In the meantime, will you do anything? Should you even dare?... </span></span><br />

<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Treepandaone</u>:</b> Fighting through exhaustion, you manage to collect a single partner to make up for the loss of Deckard and Psyduck. Shieldon's Pokeball is successfully retrieved, just in time before your body gives out completely. You don't know how long you'll be allowed to sleep, but you'll take whatever you can get...<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
A grip around your left arm, tight enough that it snaps you out of your slumber... You jolt up, startled, and look around in alarm. What you find, fortunately, is a familiar face - Jacob. The camp leader smiles at you and holds out a heavy-looking brown coat.<br />
<br />
- Sorry to wake you up, but it's time to go hunting. Show'em what you can do.<br />
<br />
Groggily, you take the coat from Jacob's hands and put it on; you get up, grab Shieldon's Ball and follow the other man outside. You squint instinctively, expecting your still-sleepy eyes to be burned by the morning sunlight, but... there's no sun at all. Of course... the sky is still jet-black and lifeless. You wonder what it feels like to live in a place like this for months on end, with barely any notion of time, with nothing around you but a handful of other hopeless people... and Shards. Perhaps that soul-crushing reality is what warped Drummond's views of the world; perhaps this is the &quot;real world&quot; to him because all other realities seem distant as a dream. With nothing to hold on to, when maddening silence is the lesser of two evils, it's bound to tamper with anyone's sanity, let alone an older man's.<br />
<br />
- Really bringin' that one along then? I'm not saving his ass again. That's on you today.<br />
<br />
You don't even have to look to know who that voice belongs to. Daryl, the one that was with Jacob yesterday... the one who hit you and has been against your presence in the camp from the start. But also the owner of a Magneton and no doubt an invaluable member of this hunting party...<br />
<br />
- You've seen what he can do. He's coming along, no questions asked; we're undermanned as it is. Drummond, ready to go?<br />
<br />
You didn't notice him at first, but there he is - the old man from the canteen, wrapped in a large hooded blue coat. He sticks out like a sore thumb in the pristine white fields of the boreal Wasteland, but then again, you never want to lose track of your scout. Besides, you're all dressed in brown, is that really any better?<br />
<br />
- Ready when you are, boys. There's been some movement down west, and I reckon I spotted Piloswine trails the last time we went out there. Short of a Mamoswine herd, it doesn't get any better than that!<br />
<br />
Jacob nodded and motioned for the group to head for the snowmobiles by the front gate. After a quick check, you count seven of you in total: Yourself, Jacob, Daryl, Drummond and three others you've never seen before. Seven people responsible for the livelihood of the entire camp...<br />
<br />
- We're ready. Guys, you know what to do. Matthew, you ride with me.<br />
<br />
Drummond hops on a vehicle of his own, and the other split off into pairs. You wonder how wise it is to have the old man ride all alone, but you figure they've been doing this for long enough to know what works. Jacob jumps on one of the snowmobiles and you sit right behind him; shortly afterwards the gate opens, and the party rides off into the frozen wasteland.<br />
<br />
For some reason, it doesn't feel anywhere as inhospitable as it did just yesterday. The wind is just as cold and the landscape is just as desolate, lifeless and silent, but this time you're not alone, and that makes all the difference in the world. You have your reservations about these people, as anyone would, but there's no denying that without Jacob and Daryl you might not have survived the encounter with those Shards, and their company is at least more reassuring than being by yourself. Even if Daryl in particular would have left you to die, if it was up to him.<br />
<br />
- This might be something you're not used to. If we find those Piloswine, it won't be a regular battle... we'll fight to kill. It's the only way we can provide enough food for everyone. When the time comes, I beg that you don't hesitate; it might go against your morals, just like it went against mine, but sustenance is hard enough to ensure as it is.<br />
<br />
You ponder on Jacob's words while catching a glimpse of a single Pokeball attached to his belt, beneath the brown overcoat. He might be the leader, but it seems even he is short on Pokemon to lead the camp with. You can't help but wonder if his other partners fell to the Shards... becoming Shards themselves.<br />
<br />
- Psyduck and Porygon had to remain monitored. The whole thing's a slow process, we can't take any risks. If either of them was infected in that struggle, we... we can't risk having a Shard forming inside Hiel. With all the untrained people we're housing, it'd be a massacre. I promise you'll be reunited with your partners as soon as we're done.<br />
<br />
You've been riding for a while now. In the distance, you spot Drummond's snowmobile coming to a halt and the old man waving at the group following him. The entire party gets off their vehicles and silently walk over to the designated scout. Drummond points to what seem to be tiny brown speckles on the horizon; squinting, you realize it's actually a herd of Piloswine, seemingly eight in total.<br />
<br />
- Hah, what did I tell you boys?! And it seems we'll have it easier on our conscience - there are no Swinub among them!<br />
<br />
All five men in brown coats reach for a Pokeball; Drummond seems to be the only one lacking a partner. The three hunters you don't know call out a Grumpig, Gligar and Stoutland. Daryl calls out his Magneton, as expected... and lastly Jacob calls out his only Pokemon: an imposing Blaziken.<br />
<br />
- Please remember what I told you. It's for the good of the camp. We don't need to slaughter the whole pack, but we can't come back empty-handed.<br />
<br />
Jacob turns to his crew and gives the signal to strike. Perfectly coordinated, Trainers and their Pokemon prepare to engage the eight Piloswine...<br />
<br />
What do you do? </span></span> <br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> Realistically, trying to make it across the lava pool through the seemingly random platforms that popped up looked nearly impossible for the group, at least in your eyes. Figuring you don't <i>have</i> to play the enemy's game, you put together an alternative plan, thinking back to a similar strategy once employed by Lily.<br />
<br />
Godric emerges from his Ball, wincing in pain from the burn on his back, but James is there for his friend. Worn out but willing to help, he musters the last of his healing spores and scatters them across the Nidoking's wounds. Immediately, the skin is repaired and the pain gone, much to Godric's relief. James has done his best, and now it's his turn.<br />
<br />
It's an unorthodox plan, in all fairness. Confusion is mostly used to inflict mental damage on foes, like many other Psychic moves. But the fundamentals do allow for a Pokemon to move objects and creatures with the power of its mind, so in theory it could work... However, Nidoking is not a Psychic-Type. In fact, Psychic is one of its inherent weaknesses! This is the gamble of all gambles...<br />
<br />
Godric, feeling refreshed, closes his eyes and focuses as hard as he can. The move itself doesn't possess significant telekinetic force, and not being versed in Psychic maneuvers makes it that much harder to get the job done. There is no way Godric can get you all across the massive lake at the same time, and realizing his own limitations, he opts to transport one creature at a time. Reasoning that the Heatmor are your priority, he targets the leader of the pack first; a blue aura surrounds the anteater and soon he finds himself floating in the air. Godric motions forward with his arms and Heatmor is sent hovering just above the pool of liquid fire... you hold your breath as you watch the events unfold, and breathe a sigh of relief when the Pokemon's feet touch the ground on the far end of the lake safely. Godric did it!<br />
<br />
However, glancing back at the Nidoking, the strain this strategy is putting on him is already obvious. Poison-Types aren't mean to endure this particular kind of strain, and already it seems that Godric is overexerting himself. Relentless nonetheless, he repeats the plan on a second Heatmor, then a third, one by one until only a single malnourished anteater remains on your side of the pool. Godric is gasping for air and tormented by a massive headache; his vision is starting to blur as his mind begins to give in to the pressure of the psychic hold.<br />
Tapping into his remaining energy, he manages to lift the last Heatmor as well, and it floats slowly across the lake like the others, wobbling all the way, just barely staying above the lava; one minor breach of concentration is all it takes for the Fire-Type to fall to its doom!<br />
Godric gives it his all, closing its eyes as hard as it can to sharpen its remaining mental power... and after what feels like an eternity, the final member of the pack touches solid ground on the other side of the liquid deathtrap, much to your relief!<br />
<br />
The Nidoking's effort was remarkable, but one thing is painfully obvious - as the Poison-Type falls to its knees, tormented by a massive headache, you realize he's all out of Psychic energy. The strain of carrying across so many Pokemon has all but drained Godric of his strength; his vision is blurry and he's gasping for air, and it's a foregone conclusion that he won't be able to transport anyone else... leaving you and Meowth separated from the Heatmor group!<br />
<br />
You have to find a new way across for yourself and your partner. Rocky platforms continue to emerge randomly for a few seconds before being swallowed by the lava, but how reliable are they? Your plan was a success but Godric, despite his best efforts, was unable to carry it to completion.<br />
<br />
With no way to rely on Confusion anymore, how will you make it across? </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">Though still tired, James did his best, mustering up one last Aromatherapy, healing Godric of his burn. &quot;Nice work, James,&quot; Keith grinned. &quot;Take a good rest now, you've more than earned it.&quot; With that, he returned the Vileplume to his Poké Ball, and turned to the Nidoking- it was all up to Godric now. Keith would be lying if he said he wasn't nervous about this- a Poison-type using a Psychic move was not the best of ideas, but Keith kept remembering when he tried this same sort of strategy with Lily- a Venomoth, also a Poison-type. It worked then...<br />
<br />
Godric focused hard, and the leader of the Heatmor pack rose up into the air- clearly, Godric was opting to move one at a time. The Nidoking knew that moving everyone at once would be too much of a strain on him, and so he knew this would be the easier path. Of course, that seemed to be given a very liberal definition of the term &quot;easier&quot;- after Godric got the first Heatmor across the lake, Keith could tell this was already putting a strain on him. &quot;Godric, you OK?&quot; Keith asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nidoooh,&quot; Godric grunted in response, giving a single nod before determinedly lifting a second Heatmor into the air. This continued, with the Nidoking looking worse and worse off with each Heatmor safely transported across the lava. Once all five Heatmor were safely across, however, the Nidoking fell to his knees.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, Godric, that's enough,&quot; Keith said firmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nii... Niidoooh...&quot; panted Godric, shaking his head- still he wanted to try, he had no intention of giving up. He tried focusing again, but nothing happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Godric, you've run out of Psychic energy, and you're exhausted,&quot; Keith said. &quot;Look, you did a great job, alright? Considering how ill-adapted your kind is to using Psychic moves, you were fantastic. Take a good rest now. I insist. Me and Meowth will figure something else out to get us across.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dohhhh,&quot; sighed Godric, finally relenting. He nodded in response to his Trainer's words, and Keith withdrew his Nidoking.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how's we gonna get across?&quot; Meowth asked nervously.<br />
<br />
Keith did not answer right away. The platforms were still rising and falling across the lava pool at maddeningly random rates. There truly was no method to their madness, at least none that Keith could see. He thought about what else he had on hand- Godric and James both needed their rest, and James didn't exactly have anything to get them across anyways. He briefly entertained the notion of Helga throwing him across, but shook that thought out of his head almost immediately upon realizing the only options for his landing was hard rocks or burning lava. Besides, what if she wasn't strong enough to throw him all the way across? If Keith was gonna die here, he had no intention of putting the death on his Hariyama's shoulders- she had self-esteem issues as it is already, the last thing she'd need is to feel responsible for her Trainer's death. Would Vernon be able to help? Keith liked the idea of his Tauros building a makeshift bridge with Ice Beam... until he realized that the heat from the lava would melt it almost instantaneously. Meowth had no tricks up his proverbial sleeves that would be of any use here... Keith then recalled his sixth Pokémon, but shook his head. <i>No,</i> he thought to himself. <i>Not yet. I want that one to stay fresh and ready for action for when we confront the Great One.</i> At last, the one and only solution came to him, as he turned to face the Meowth on his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I don't like it, but from where I stand, it's our best chance,&quot; Keith stated. &quot;Even if it's playing right into this Great One's hands, we gotta try and make it across those platforms. And you know what? We can work together,&quot; he added. &quot;You keep a tight grip on my shoulder, and you look behind me. If you see the next platform popping up behind me, say the word and I'll turn around to jump on it. Between the two of us, we should be able to spot the next platform and jump in time every time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meowth was shaking. &quot;I ain't got a good feelin' about dis,&quot; he confided to Keith.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nor do I,&quot; Keith agreed. &quot;But we've got to try.&quot; With that, Meowth shifted his position on Keith's shoulder so he was facing backwards, wrapping all four of his legs around Keith's arm to anchor himself in place. He nodded to Keith, signifying that he was in position. Keith nodded back, and then, as a platform popped up close enough to him, he took a deep breath, and jumped.</span></span></div>

<br />
<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> The Heatmor pack looks at you expectantly from across the lake. Godric has ensured their safety, but they can’t go on without you; if they were strong enough to take matters into their own hands, they would have by now.<br />
<br />
Racking your brain for any alternative plan that doesn’t involve playing the mountain god’s game doesn’t yield any new results; the Nidoking’s psychic aptitude was your only card. Or rather, you’re not willing to reveal your whole hand just yet, just in case the Great One really is watching you as intently as it appears. You decide against calling out your sixth Pokemon, instead opting to take your chances on the random platforms… much to Meowth’s concern.<br />
<br />
The room is so unbearably hot that you feel lightheaded, short of breath… eager as all hell to get out. You’ll take any chance you can get to escape this part of the mountain, and with Meowth’s help you might just have a chance. You reason that your best bet at making it across is having, or emulating, a 360º eyesight radius so that no platforms emerge unnoticed. Your partner seems to agree with the plan and perches himself on your shoulder, facing the opposite direction from you. Given the seemingly random manner these rocky structures seem to appear, you’re forced to wait until one emerges close enough for you to jump…. And sure enough, after a while one pops up within range!<br />
<br />
You leap forward as far as you can… and manage to land right on the middle of the solid surface! The stone beneath your feet is hot to the point where your soles soon grow afflicted by a burning-like pain that forces you to tiptoe until another reachable platform comes afloat. The second the next perch appears, you jump forward and to the right, just in time to see the previous rock be engulfed by lava and vanish… that was close!<br />
Meowth quickly alerts you to the presence of a nearby structure to the left, which you immediately occupy with yet another nimble leap.<br />
<br />
This goes on for a while, the burning sensation in your feet growing harder and harder to endure. Little by little you progress across the magma pool, jumping backwards when necessary at Meowth’s signal, and before you know, you’ve already crossed two-thirds of the lake! It’s then that something happens... or stops happening! For some reason, no more platforms emerge, leaving you stranded where you are with no visible means to keep going!<br />
<br />
<i><b>PERSISTENT WORM. I COULD END YOUR LIFE WHERE YOU STAND.</b></i><br />
<br />
The same voice from before, deep, booming, echoes throughout the cave. The Great One. And he’s right… with complete control over the mountain, it was likely his doing that the platforms stopped appearing. And just as easily, he can remove the one you’re standing on…<br />
<br />
<i><b>HEED MY DEMANS: FEED THE FIRES AROUND YOU SOMETHING OF VALUE, AS TRIBUTE TO ME. THEN, LEAVE THE HEATMOR TO THEIR FATE. ACCEPT THESE TERMS, AND LIVE. I HAVE SHOWN THE OTHER HUMAN EQUAL COMPASSION.</b></i><br />
<br />
“The other human”… Kyle?! But he and Doduo are nowhere in sight! Then again, if Kyle accepted whatever the Great One proposed to him, he’s likely deeper into the mountain already. And if he refused…<br />
<br />
<i><b>TIME TO CHOOSE. FIVE… FOUR… THREE… TWO… </b></i></span></span> <br />

<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> The Heatmor pack looks at you expectantly from across the lake. Godric has ensured their safety, but they can’t go on without you; if they were strong enough to take matters into their own hands, they would have by now.<br />
<br />
Racking your brain for any alternative plan that doesn’t involve playing the mountain god’s game doesn’t yield any new results; the Nidoking’s psychic aptitude was your only card. Or rather, you’re not willing to reveal your whole hand just yet, just in case the Great One really is watching you as intently as it appears. You decide against calling out your sixth Pokemon, instead opting to take your chances on the random platforms… much to Meowth’s concern.<br />
<br />
The room is so unbearably hot that you feel lightheaded, short of breath… eager as all hell to get out. You’ll take any chance you can get to escape this part of the mountain, and with Meowth’s help you might just have a chance. You reason that your best bet at making it across is having, or emulating, a 360º eyesight radius so that no platforms emerge unnoticed. Your partner seems to agree with the plan and perches himself on your shoulder, facing the opposite direction from you. Given the seemingly random manner these rocky structures seem to appear, you’re forced to wait until one emerges close enough for you to jump…. And sure enough, after a while one pops up within range!<br />
<br />
You leap forward as far as you can… and manage to land right on the middle of the solid surface! The stone beneath your feet is hot to the point where your soles soon grow afflicted by a burning-like pain that forces you to tiptoe until another reachable platform comes afloat. The second the next perch appears, you jump forward and to the right, just in time to see the previous rock be engulfed by lava and vanish… that was close!<br />
Meowth quickly alerts you to the presence of a nearby structure to the left, which you immediately occupy with yet another nimble leap.<br />
<br />
This goes on for a while, the burning sensation in your feet growing harder and harder to endure. Little by little you progress across the magma pool, jumping backwards when necessary at Meowth’s signal, and before you know, you’ve already crossed two-thirds of the lake! It’s then that something happens... or stops happening! For some reason, no more platforms emerge, leaving you stranded where you are with no visible means to keep going!<br />
<br />
<i><b>PERSISTENT WORM. I COULD END YOUR LIFE WHERE YOU STAND.</b></i><br />
<br />
The same voice from before, deep, booming, echoes throughout the cave. The Great One. And he’s right… with complete control over the mountain, it was likely his doing that the platforms stopped appearing. And just as easily, he can remove the one you’re standing on…<br />
<br />
<i><b>HEED MY DEMANS: FEED THE FIRES AROUND YOU SOMETHING OF VALUE, AS TRIBUTE TO ME. THEN, LEAVE THE HEATMOR TO THEIR FATE. ACCEPT THESE TERMS, AND LIVE. I HAVE SHOWN THE OTHER HUMAN EQUAL COMPASSION.</b></i><br />
<br />
“The other human”… Kyle?! But he and Doduo are nowhere in sight! Then again, if Kyle accepted whatever the Great One proposed to him, he’s likely deeper into the mountain already. And if he refused…<br />
<br />
<i><b>TIME TO CHOOSE. FIVE… FOUR… THREE… TWO… </b></i></span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">The unbearable heat in the room was starting to get to Keith, making him all the more eager to get out. After no other feasible options presented themselves, he decided to play along with the obvious option. Keith jumped as soon as a stone platform rose up close enough, and though he landed successfully, he quickly found that the hot rock was hurting his feet. As a native of Lavaridge Town, this was not altogether unexpected by him, but all the same, accustomed to this sort of terrain though he was, he still had to get across it as quickly as possible!<br />
<br />
Fortunately, Meowth and Keith proved to work extremely well together, and between the two, no opening went unnoticed, with Keith nimbly jumping from stone to stone, responding promptly to Meowth's signals, narrowly avoiding a fiery demise on several occasions. The burning stone beneath him was getting harder to endure, but he kept himself going, having already gotten past two thirds of the pool of lava. And then, just as that realization came to him, everything stopped. No more platforms rose to meet them, and though Keith and Meowth both panicked briefly, they soon realized that their own platform was not falling. Keith started to calm down ever so slightly-<br />
<br />
<b><i>PERSISTENT WORM. I COULD END YOUR LIFE WHERE YOU STAND.</i></b><br />
<br />
There it was, that voice again! Keith and Meowth tensed up as the deep, booming voice echoed all around- it was the Great One again, and Keith knew that there was truth to these words- it was obviously his doing what that stopped the platforms from rising, and it would be only too easy for him to remove the one that remained. The voice continued on, demanding a tribute, something of value to be thrown into the fires around him, and then demanding that he leave the Heatmor to their fate. In exchange, the Great One would reward Keith with his continued existence. But it was the last part that caught Keith's attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;The other human?&quot; Keith muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle!&quot; Meowth gasped, just before the voice boomed once more.<br />
<br />
<b><i>TIME TO CHOOSE.</i></b><br />
<br />
<i>Time to choose?!</i> Keith thought. This was not looking good! He had to make a decision and make it fast, but... leave the Heatmor to their fates?<br />
<br />
<b><i>FIVE...</i></b><br />
<br />
Keith looked across the lava pool at the pack of Heatmor. They put their trust in him, they helped him out at every turn, and he helped them whenever he was able to. The leader of the pack in particular- he saved Keith from being incinerated, he provided Vernon with a temporary yet extremely helpful immunity to Fire attacks.<br />
<br />
<b><i>FOUR...</i></b><br />
<br />
Keith's face still bore a look of fright, of panic, but it was mixed with determination. No, he realized. They had come this far, there was no way he was going to just leave these Heatmor to their fates. But in order to defy the Great One and live to tell the tale, especially in this precarious position, Keith knew there was only one course of action.<br />
<br />
<b><i>THREE...</i></b><br />
<br />
Meowth, Nidoking, Hariyama, Tauros, Vileplume... the Great One very likely knew about five of the Pokémon Keith had brought with him. But there was still one more. Keith had brought with him a sixth Pokémon, one of his strongest partners, his oldest friend. But ever since he had decided to pursue and take down the Great One, Keith decided to keep this one in his Poké Ball, keep him safe, so that he would be at full strength for the inevitable fight that awaited them, a decision only bolstered by the horrific sight Keith was forced to bear witness to in the tunnel behind him. And yet, keeping him in his ball any longer didn't seem such an appealing option anymore, considering the alternative was a fiery death for them all. No, it was now or never, in the most literal sense possible...<br />
<br />
<b><i>TWO...</i></b><br />
<br />
Meowth missed what happened next because he had to blink. Keith swiped the ball off his belt and pressed the button to enlarge it. &quot;We need you now, Gemini!&quot; he exclaimed. As the ball opened up and unleashed the light which would form into the Trainer's Weezing, Keith made ready to grab onto the Poison Gas Pokémon, made ready to instruct him to carry him and Meowth the rest of the way across the lava. It was true that Weezing were not built for supporting humans in flight, but Gemini was strong, and Keith not a heavy man at all. If there was any hope here, any hope at all, it lied in what was in the process of coming out of Keith's Poké Ball right now.</span></span></div>

<br />
<b><u>The Silver Forest</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Pearl’s Perap</u>:</b> Porter assumes an offensive stance, glaring at both Leafeon, who don't exactly look back at the Glaceon - their eyes are still locked on Bette, almost obsessively, which is awkward considering their position. Faced with a Flying-Type and an Ice-Type, one would imagine their survival instinct to kick in at some point and urge them to run, but neither appear willing to back down!<br />
<br />
- You have brought a Grass-Type to this place... You are either a fool or a talented deceiver.<br />
<br />
The Braviary takes to the sky, flaps its wings and sends a wave of burning-hot wind against the foes, blowing them away before they can dodge. Crying in pain, both fall to the floor feeling the effects of the high-temperature gust; one of the Leafeon struggles back to its feet, but the second - the one attack by Braviary's Air Slash before - erupts into flames in a horrifying sight. Its colorless skin catches fire like paper and burns away, ash carried by the wind, leaving behind... the corpse of a regular-colored Leafeon!<br />
<br />
Riding the massive eagle, you notice the man staring straight at you, as if gauging you the same way you're trying to gauge him. It seems he's trying to judge your expression based on the events that just happened...<br />
<br />
- It seems... this is foreign to you. You do not look indifferent. Perhaps you really are just a lost fool.<br />
<br />
Porter takes advantage of the opening and multiplies into four copies of itself, one of the illusions standing directly between Bette and the remaining foe. The enemy looks lost and confused as it loses sight of your fallen partner, and before it can assess the situation the real Porter lunges straight at it! Catching speed as it dashes, reaching incredible speed, it tucks its head in and propels it forward, ramming its skull into the opponent's torso. The ghostly Leafeon is sent flying back several steps and crashes into a nearby tree, and as it does, its pale skin breaks apart in a cloud of dust. Behind remains another regular Leafeon, lying motionlessly against the trunk... dead. <b>Porter gains 1 Level!</b><br />
<br />
The man makes the Braviary land and leaps off of its back. He walks over to you, a towering figure with a stern look. He stands in silence for a few moments, looks over at Bette and finally bows stiffly.<br />
<br />
- You did well. My kin call me Rogo. I ordered the assault on your Pidgeot.<br />
<br />
You're left temporarily speechless by the man's blunt, seemingly remorseless confession. How can he say that with a straight face? You're left conflicted; on one hand, he was responsible for almost killing you and severely injuring Tim. On the other hand, he came to your assistance and effectively saved your life by stopping the Leafeon's Leaf Blade earlier...<br />
<br />
After this turn of events, what will you do? </span></span>

<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: green">With attack orders issued, it isn't long before Porter readies himself for the next assault. Even with the Glaceon and Braviary before them, both of the strange wild Leafeon still focus all of their attentions on the fatigued Bette. As Zak looks to the strange man for his reaction, his voice booms down.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have brought a Grass-Type to this place... You are either a fool or a talented deceiver.&quot;<br />
<br />
The battle that had ensued since his time within Lily Forest had already left the trainer feeling somewhat perplexed so he found the man's statement hard to comprehend. A forest was the first place Zak would think to enjoy some time with one of his grass type Pokémon and he couldn't recall anything from the guidebooks he had perused before deciding on his trip to Cascadia. Before Zak has time to question the man, the Braviary begins his own assault. In a matter of moments, the huge eagle takes to the sky and begins to flap his wings to formulate a searing hot gust to send directly at the Leafeon foes. Whilst one manages to resist, the one who had already taken a previous attack from the Braviary appears to spontaneously combust. In the wake of the attack lay a lifeless form, the Leafeon's true colours had returned but its lifeforce appeared to have depleted.<br />
<br />
&quot;What in the...&quot; Zak was almost speechless. He had fully expected that they could handle this threat but he hadn't forseen death of any kind. It took all of his will to not pace right over to the Pokémon who had been causing them such trouble before, scoop it up and cradle it. It was as he pushed these thoughts from his mind that he noticed the native man had been watching him the entire time. In an instant, he tried to regain as much composure as possible, not knowing if it would be any use.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems... this is foreign to you. You do not look indifferent. Perhaps you really are just a lost fool.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man before him had read him alright. This guy didn't need any guidebook, that was clear to see. Even so, Zak had no time to retaliate as Porter had spotted his opening and was making his way towards the second and only remaining Leafeon. In a split second Porter creates several illusionary copies of himself to protect his friend and ally and defeat his foe as quickly as possible. With the last opening before him, the Glaceon dashes towards the foe, skull down and sends the beast hurtling into a nearby tree. As the force of the impact shakes the Leafeon, it too loses its ghostly pale exterior and reverts to its original colouration before slumping to the roots in a lifeless thud. Another life extinguished. This was beginning to get a bit too much. <br />
<br />
<span style="color: royalblue">[Porter leveled up!]</span><br />
<br />
With the threats vanquished in their entirety, the man alights his Braviary and begins to pace easily towards Zak. As he does so, he acknowledges Bette with what appears to be the most humble of bows.<br />
<br />
&quot;You did well. My kin call me Rogo. I ordered the assault on your Pidgeot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Confusion hit Zak like a jackhammer. He wanted to scream and shout and lunge right for the throat of the man who had put both him and Tim in such great danger. Something stopped, him, though. This man had quite blatantly helped him since the two had crossed paths on the island, but that didn't negate the fact he could have had him killed previously. In the end, Zak turned his back on the man, he couldn't look at him after such a blunt confession. It was true that he preferred a person to be honest, but this had thrown him off on an enormous scale. With the moment as behind him as he could make it, the trainer walked towards his Pokémon.<br />
<br />
&quot;You guys did great, but I think it's time for a rest. We'll talk about all of... this... later.&quot; Zak began to trail off, he knew that his Pokémon would be able to comprehend what had occured and the danger that both them and their trainer could potentially be in. However, it wasn't their call this time and the Leafeon and Glaceon sidled before their trainer to be recalled into their respective Pokéballs. With the pair returned to the safety of their capture spheres, Zak gathered himself and turned to face Rogo.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you always so quick to confess your crimes? I could have died falling from such a height into this forest...&quot; Zak waved at the verdant surroundings as his voice began to grow in volume, &quot;Now a guilty consience would explain you helping me out, but I'm sure there's more to that. What is going on here?&quot; As he spoke, he found his eyes trailing towards the corpses of the Leafeon they had, for lack of a better word, slain. <br />
<br />
&quot;Something isn't right in this forest and I need you to start talking.&quot;<br />
<br />
With adrenaline coursing through his veins, Zak stood defiant before the man in front of him. In that moment, he felt no fear. After all, he really was just a lost fool.</span><br />

<b><u>The Silver Forest</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>jolteonjak</u>:</b> This is it - the time to finally go on the offensive! Baro's Excadrill held the advantage for most of the match with its bulk, strength and incredible link to his partner. But thanks to some quick thinking on your part, Cyndaquil has managed to even the odds and holds a strategic advantage!<br />
<br />
- Your parlor tricks merely delay the inevitable! You will <i>not</i> defeat us!<br />
<br />
Again Excadrill moves to attack without any explicit instructions from Baro. Its claw glows silver, and it's obvious the foe intends to rip Cyndaquil in two! However, your instructions couldn't have better timing; the Fire-Type charges energy in his feet and drives hem hard into Excadrill's steel helmet, leaving two massive dents in it while propelling himself upwards and away from the enemy! The mole's claw finds nothing on its way up, with Cyndaquil high up in the air; refusing to back down, Excadrill jumps up and covers its head with both claws, taking the shape of a massive drill as it starts to spin!<br />
<br />
- It's all over for you, foreigner! I will prove Saint's trust was misplaced after all!<br />
<br />
The <b>Drill Run</b> flies straight at the airborne Cyndaquil... but he's ready! Arching his head back, the fire mouse gathers every ounce of Fire energy within him and breathes out a huge <i>Daimonji</i>-shaped Fire Blast at point-blanks range! A split second before Exacrill makes contact with Cyndaquil, the blazing attack explodes against the Steel-Type, creating massive burst of flames that almost sets fire to the forest around you!<br />
<br />
- You fool... what have you done?!<br />
<br />
A bright orange light fills the clearing, and when it finally subsides... Cyndaquil and Excadrill are both lying on their backs! Both Pokémon are breathing heavily, but each of them turns around and struggles to its feet at exactly the same time, eyeing one another with a burning drive to win. This last turn of events has effectively left both sides on equal footing, so drained of strength they could collapse at any moment, but neither opponent is willing to give up!<br />
<br />
- I refuse to lose to you... Excadrill, we finish this now!<br />
<br />
With both Pokémon on the brink of exhaustion, it's painfully obvious that one last move is all either of them can muster. Whoever strikes first, or hardest, will win... it's all riding on this one! You've seen how Baro and Excadrill fight, can you find a way to outlast the foe on what is sure to be the last round?<br />
<br />
What will you do?!<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: green">When retelling this story to anyone who wants to hear it, Chad thought to himself that he would certainly be proud of Cyndaquil’s battling thus far. He wouldn’t even be sorry for admitting he smiled at this point of the battle. Excadrill had proven to be an extremely difficult opponent, and the fact that it attacks without orders from Baro only made it that much more of an obstacle. Being able to not only land on Excadrill’s back but land an attack on the Subterrene Pokémon really impressed Chad.<br />
<br />
“Your parlor tricks merely delay the inevitable! You will <i>not</i> defeat us!” Chad could hear Baro as he left his brief replay to return to the battle. Cyndaquil was standing on Excadrill, preparing to give it a Double Kick. Excadrill, of course, did not remain idle. It was preparing an attack of its own against Cyndaquil. It slashed at Cyndaquil with its metallic claws, but luckily for the Fire Mouse he had used the momentum of the Double Kick to bounce off Excadrill.<br />
<br />
Excadrill was quick to react. He leapt in the air, extending its arms covering its head; so that its claws and helmet formed a large drill. “Drill Run,” Chad was shocked to see the attack. Cyndaquil, though, had already begun preparing for his next attack. Just as Excadrill was about to strike, Cyndaquil blew out a Fire Blast attack.<br />
<br />
The proximity of the attack caused an explosion that almost caused the surrounding forest to catch fire. “You fool,” Chad could hear Baro yell amidst the explosion, “what have you done?!” Chad wondered if Baro had the same problem seeing what was going on because of it.<br />
<br />
Once the explosion dissipated, Chad could finally see. Cyndaquil and Excadrill were both on the ground lying on their backs. That last exchange took its toll on each of them. Both Pokémon got to their feet, but they struggled. Whatever the outcome, this battle was nearing its end. Cyndaquil and Excadrill both eyed each other intensely.<br />
<br />
“You’re doing so well Cyndaquil,” Chad called out to his Fire Mouse Pokémon. “No matter what happens now, I’m so proud of you buddy.” Chad’s heart was racing, and his breathing matched Cyndaquil’s. He felt like he was really in the battle, like he was by Cyndaquil’s side throughout the battle.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, Cyndaquil began to glow with a faint blue light. Chad couldn’t see what was happening, but what was happening was Cyndaquil’s body expanding in size, getting longer. Taller. The flame spots on his back relocated as well. The glowing ended, and a new Pokémon remained in Cyndaquil’s place. <br />

“What the?” Chad was astonished. “Cyndaquil, what happened?” He took out his Pokedex to scan:<br />

“I refuse to lose to you… Excadrill, we finish this now!”<br />
<br />
Chad wondered how this evolution would change things in battle. Both Pokémon were previously on the verge of fainting. While he’s sure Quilava wasn’t restored to full energy, he thought maybe evolution would have given a boost of some kind. “Cyn, oops, Quilava, can you still continue?” Chad called out. “We might only have one chance at this.

<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u> Electric Blue Eye</u>:</b> You wonder if the Champion's true reason for retiring lies in his impending death, even if the massive elder appears to the embodiment of health. Dwelling on it now won't do you any good, so you quickly refocus on the match, which has taken a turn for the worse...<br />
<br />
Pelliper eyes Diego with confidence, having barely felt its offense. The pelican is bulky and easily endured the Jellicent's Ominous Wind, and you quickly realize that brute force alone won't get you the win here. Taking Sean's words to heart, you change your strategy up and decide to make the most of your current disadvantage: with Diego barely conscious and Pelliper at practically full health, now is the perfect time to turn even the odds!<br />
<br />
Diego seems to agree and summons a ghostly purple chain that extends from its own body and wraps itself aroudn one of Pelliper's wings. Sean's expression remains unchanged even when the chain turns red and the health of each Pokemon evens out, with a large amount being transferred from the bird to your own Pokemon. Diego looks refreshed, having regained practically half his strength, whereas Pelliper suddenly looks short of breath and is forced to land to regain its bearings.<br />
<br />
- Glad to see you've taught your Jellicent such a move. When used at the right time, it can completely change the flow of battle, but it requires a competent Trainer to make the most of.<br />
<br />
As Sean praises you, one doubt surfaces in your head. Pelliper used Agility before; why didn't it try to dodge Pain Split at all?...<br />
<br />
- My turn. <b>Roost</b> to heal the damage, <b>Seed Bomb</b> and <b>Shock Wave</b>.<br />
<br />
Instantly Pelliper tucks its wings in and relaxes its body; Not willing to let that happen, Diego brings its fins together and charges up Dark energy into a sphere... but before he can fire the blast Pelliper unleashes a blistering-fast barrage of seeds, courtesy of the previous Agility, which pelt the Water-Type and explode on contact for heavy damage!<br />
Diego falls, staggered, and manages to fight back with a pulse of shadows which take the Jellicent's shape before connecting with the Roosting Pelliper. The attack, albeit not very powerful, has the valuable property of ignoring the foe's defense, causing obvious discomfort to the bird but not nearly enough to defeat it... especially after the Roost.<br />
With Diego still feeling the effect of Seed Bomb, Pelliper raises its wings and gathers static between them, before hurling a sphere of electricity which unfailingly homes in on the ghost. With a loud crackling sound, lighting bursts around your partner, and when it subsides... Diego lies on the ground, defeated.<br />
<br />
- A valiant effort, and your strategy was sound, but this one was decided from the start. You did an impressive job raising Diego, but I'm not going to go easy on you. Any more tricks up your sleeve Ethan? </span></span>

<br />
<span style="color: silver">Ethan watched in disbelief as his Jellicent laid out unconscious on the ground. Call it arrogance or whatever you want but he hadn't expected to lose such a vital member of his team so fast, not now, not ever. But it happened and he needed to except that. <i>So much for thinking that I could win my first gym battle 3 to nothing,</i> he thought.<br />
<br />
With a gloom look on his face Ethan reached for his dive ball, holding it in his palm for a second recalling the day he had met the then Frillish snorkeling in the beautiful beach that lay around his secret base. If he closed his eyes he could still feel like he did then, like he hadn't just caught a Pokemon he had made a connection with a drifting spirit that had somehow throughout all odds lived on to fulfill his dreams. <br />
<br />
During the time they had been together Diego has consulted Ethan on different matters, lending him his ear or ideas and telling the boy stories of when he was a Pirate at sea. Having been a wanted criminal Diego and Ethan had shared a bond different then anyone else on the team, they would talk about their run ins with the law and laugh about their narrow escape from death or worse, inprisonment. But more then anything else the blue Jellicent had come to respect the boys decision to having left the life of crime behind him to follow his dreams. Something Diego had himself wish he had done.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, I've let you down Diego. I promise I won't lose.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan eyed his opponent, it was true Sean had complimented him but the trainer didn't see it that way, all he could see was his failure. <i>How could I have been so stupid, of course Sean had it all planned out, I was the first one to send out my Pokemon. He had probably planned out exactly how he would play his pieces but this wasn't checkmate not for a long shot, you might how taken the Pirate but I've taken your Wall. It's now high time to take out your Scout.</i><br />
<br />
If their opponent wasn't such a bad match up against his Snivy, maybe he could've kept his last choice a secret for a little longer, but he definitely didn't want to risk losing 2 in a row.<br />
<br />
&quot;James, I'm sure you've been watching this whole time, you think you can handle our current opponent?&quot; Ethan said as a dark smooth voice resonated from behind the boy that said, &quot;I thought you would never ask...&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly from behind Ethan's back a black eerie shadow out stretched from his own. The shadow forming a purple ball of gas onto the field, first it's vampire teeth appearing with a great big grin, finally it's wolf like eyes popping out with a hint of revenge inside of them entered the scene bringing the whole picture to life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sean meet James, my Gastly. We've been together for as long as I can remember, tell me have you ever faced a Pokemon that can communicate with his trainer using a psychic link?&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>James, I made a giant error in judgement. I should have taken his seagull out sooner then this using some more super effective moves, I won't make the same mistake twice. Use the widest <b>Confuse Ray</b> you got. Shoot him down with a <b>Thunderbolt</b>, I'm sure he'll try to use the same attack on you that he did with Diego so if he tries to go for an Ominous Wind dodge! finish with a <b>Night Shade</b>!</i></span></span></div>

<br />
Involving Oscar and Dana in a struggle they can't win isn't right. But not pursuing this matter further, in your mind, is even worse! You lie to tranquilize the elderly couple, but fully intend to look into this tremendous injustice and, if possible, fix it...<br />
<br />
Your priority is returning to the Pokemon Center, seeing as your Litwick exhausted herself in that spectacular performance. But where do you go from there? If there really is a higher power behind this whole story, no doubt they'll have covered their tracks. Finding Dana's Arcanine, or any proof of the Government's involvement for that matter, will no doubt be next to impossible...<br />
<br />
You arrive once again at the Center, where several people of all ages remain, waiting for their partners to be healed, changing up their teams at the PC, trading Pokemon to various corners of the world or simply hanging out. As you approach the counter, Nurse Joy seems to remember your face and greets you warmly, before taking Litwick's Pokeball for healing. While you wait, you find yourself absent-mindedly looking at the TV again, only to see Ethan's Jellicent Diego fall before his opponent's Pelliper. An ill omen, or a simple coincidence?...<br />
<br />
Suddenly, someone tugs at your leg, snapping you from your trance. Looking down you see a young boy holding out a piece of paper. You take it from him, puzzled...<br />
<br />
- A grown-up outside told me to give this to you! Bye!<br />
<br />
Before you can even reply, the boy runs out the door giggling, clearly amused by whatever game he seems to be playing. You look at the single sheet he gave you and find something hastily written in black marker...<br />
<br />
<b><i>&quot;DON'T TRY.&quot;</i></b><br />
<br />
What is the meaning of this? Is someone watching you? Is someone... <i>aware</i> of what you're planning to do? But how?! Still, there's no way this can be a mere coincidence... You look around in alarm, trying to spot anyone suspicious, but everyone seems to be minding their own business...<br />
<br />
Nurse Joy still hasn't returned with your partner. In the meantime, will you do anything? Should you even dare?... </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver">Walking through the double doors of the Center Liza's eyes instantly zero in on the TV screen playing the live match that Ethan was participating in. It had seemed from the gloom expression and the fact that his Jellicent had been laying down in defeat things weren't going great for her beloved but rather then let bad feeling enter in her mind she tried to look at the up side. The match wasn't over. This becoming clear as he released his Gastly James on the field. ‘If only Lucy was awake’ she thought. Just like she and him were something of an item certain Pokemon from each other's team had paired off with each other. Lucy and James, both of their Teddiursa's Honey and Caleb, and though Samantha had hated admitting it even her Starter had strong feelings for the boy's Garchomp.<br />
<br />
A sigh escaped her lips, thinking of the happy ending that always seemed to be pushed because of fate. It was true she had a ticket to go watch the match in person but she had made herself a pormise and she meant to keep it. It was times like these though when he was so gloom she wished she had a way to make him know that she was here, she was watching and rooting for him.<br />
<br />
Having returned to the Pokemon Center Liza was greeted by Nurse Joy before the lass trainer had asked her to heal her Litwick, who had over exerted itself to bring Dana back to her senses. But during the performance the only thing the duo had accomplished was making the old lady cry and relive some bad memories.<br />
<br />
Waiting around until Lucy's check up was done, Liza's eyes wandered a bit looking at the different trainers of all ages in the facility her attention was however brought to a little boy pulling at her leg with a note in his hand. <br />
<br />
“For me?” She giggled half expecting it to be a letter from a secret admirer. “A grown-up outside told me to give this to you! Bye!” the boy said before the little one ran off outside.<br />
<br />
When Liza had opened it and read its contents she quickly froze in fear. <br />
<br />
‘How could anyone know what I was planning I swear I've only been in this city for about an hour- unless, someone's been keeping Dana and Oscar under surveillance!’<br />
<br />
She turned around to see if anyone suspicious had been watching her. She was ready to run outside and track down the boy that had originally given her the note when she had a better idea, suddenly she wasn't afraid anymore. ‘They are messing with the wrong girl!’ Reaching for a red and white sphere Liza called out her Snubbull who was wearing a Yellow Scarf around its neck. “Snub!” it barked at its trainer.<br />
<br />
Bending down Liza showed the dog Pokemon the note, “I need your help sweety, I need you to sniff this note and lead me to the person that has written it, you think you can do that for me?”<br />
<br />
“Snubbull, Snub!” It exclaimed before giving her a salute and starting to sniff the piece of paper that had <b><i>&quot;DON'T TRY.&quot;</i></b> written on it.<br />
<br />
<b><i>‘Watch me.’</i></b><br />

<i><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: darkorchid">Venom Island</span></span></i><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px">Quite possibly the least attractive area of the entire island chain if you don't have a specific purpose, Venom Island is the epitome of all things putrid. The ground itself is saturated with poisonous substances. Also, all of the garbage from Salin City is transported here, but it is hardly noticed, as the acidic ground eats away at anything at a very quick pace. However, that means that not many things can live in this desolate area, with only a dead tree forest, a poisonous swamp, and a large skull tunnel interupting the landscape. The rest of the island is just plain dirt, but a good amount of poison types inhabit the area. The water surrounding the island is so poisonous that Pokemon cannot swim in it-therefore, unless it is a poison type, it cannot Surf to this area.<br />
<b><span style="color: darkorchid">Plague Swamp </span></b>- Taking up a good amount of the island, the Plague Swamp is...a swamp. However, the water is extremely poisonous, making only some Pokemon even able to live here. However, not many even choose to that can, because the entire thing is covered in a thick fog, and most people that venture in don't ever come back out. Pokemon are said to lure travelers into deep areas of the swamp, and they get stuck, before drowning.</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: MediumTurquoise"><i>Thanks for updating me again, MZ! Well then, here goes nothing...</i></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: DarkOrchid"><span style="font-size: 9px">&quot;Not exactly home, is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
The low voice broke the silence that hung over the Plague Swamp, as if the fog had some kind of muting property. Though given the stench that hung over the entirety of Venom Island, its owner wouldn't be surprised if there was nothing else here to make any sound. Dave stood at the edge of the wetland, clad in gear appropriate to a marshland, with thick waders stretching from halfway up his torso to rubber boots around his feet. His usual sleeveless fishing jacket adorned his chest, though he would be heavily surprised if there was anything to fish here.<br />
<br />
Why had he come here? After getting through <a href="http://www.serebiiforums.com/showthread.php?593375-The-Arcane-Realm-FB-Training-Zone&amp;p=17437927#post17437927" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.serebiiforums.com%2Fshowthread.php%3F593375-The-Arcane-Realm-FB-Training-Zone%26p%3D17437927%23post17437927&amp;hash=f15532bb71749eb83d3ad8d970761d19" rel="nofollow noopener">his adventure in the Arcane Realm</a> he thought he should go somewhere a bit quieter, and having saved possibly that whole region from destruction at the hands of a giant, mutant Tyranitar he'd had his fill of the desert. He'd desired something more like home, but this place... it was like a black mirror. While superficially it resembled the Great Marsh of his native Pastoria City, it was still fundamentally different, almost a toxic wasteland. He'd only brought one of his signature fish with him, for fear the water would dissolve their gills should he let them swim around. Though the one he had brought... they had a lot to work on. Maybe this would give them a chance.<br />
<br />
So far only one of his partners was at his side, mostly because he hated being confined to his PokéBall. Jason stood at his side, seemingly unfazed by the poisonous environment. The Croagunk added to Dave's reminder of the Great Marsh, the species being his hometown's mascot. Hopefully he could handle any threats the swamp threw at them, but he had backup if that proved to be incorrect. The Fighting-type's rhythmic, croaking breathing provided the only noise across the deadly swamp.<br />
<br />
The trainer glanced down at his friend. &quot;Well, no point in standing around here. Let's get stuck in, eh?&quot; he asked, Jason simply returning the glance with his usual stoicism. Trying not to breathe too deeply, Dave raised one foot and took a very squelchy, foul-smelling footstep forward into the mire.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px">One of the more interesting areas of the archipelago, Ruin Island is also the most mysterious. Giant stone statues and buildings, eroded by time, stand in the overgrowing vegetation of the area, providing a home to many Pokemon, especially those who prefer dark, enclosed spaces. Studies done by researches show that this island was once under water, or flooded, or something. At the very least, they have established that it is the oldest of the areas. An eerie feel of foreboding rushes over one the second they set forth on the land, provoking myths and legends...<br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">OOC: Thanks in advance, MZ! I look forward to this adventure!<br />
<br />
Charm traverses the ancient grounds, passing through stones, trees, and ruins alike as a smile met his face. He wore black jeans, a white tee, and his usual black leather jacket, his most comforting adventure apparel. The uncertainty of what he would come across in this strange land brought endless excitement in him. He looks back to see his Combusken keeping pace quite easily. &quot;How you doing back there, Apollo?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Busken!&quot; the Young Fowl Pokemon proudly spouts.<br />
<br />
Overhead a dark bird soars towards the trainer. He lands on the trainer's shoulder. &quot;<i>Monsieur</i> Charm, there is a temple up ahead. What shall we do?&quot; the Murkrow spoke in perfect English with hints of a French accent. <br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent work, Don. I was hoping we'd find something cool like that. We're gonna go explore it, of course!&quot; the trainer responds.<br />
<br />
The Murkrow nods, taking off once again as the party continues to travel until seeing the temple before them. The ancient temple looked ominous and run down, with overgrown plants coming out from all sorts of crevices.<br />
<br />
Don lands back on his trainer's shoulder as Apollo stands next to them. The trainer quickly scans the outer region before checking his party. Aside from Apollo and Don, he brought along Sheba the Houndour and Ignatius the Magmorter. He figured Sheba's nose could prove useful, and despite not having full control over Ignatius yet, he figured his firepower could help as well. &quot;I don't suppose anyone is inside,&quot; he guesses, &quot;let's check it out.&quot; He decidedly marches up the steps, his trusty Pokemon beside him.</span></span></div>

<br />
Option C. It’s one any adventurer must always keep in the back of his mind, but more importantly, one he must know when to use. In your mind, this is the time to do it, as you refuse to give in to the creature’s demands and aren’t quite in the mood to die either. You only see one way out of this, and it regrettably involves calling out your last Pokemon, one you’d been saving for later… now this “God of Mountain” knows everything you might throw at him, but given the circumstances, that’s far from your greatest concern at the moment.<br />
<br />
You cling on to Gemini as hard as you can, hoping to Arceus he can somehow muster the strength to carry you over the lava pit safely… The Heatmor pack roots for the Weezing across the lake, and while you hold on for dear life, you realize this is the gamble of a lifetime. Gemini is the strongest and oldest of your partners, so if there’s anyone you can entrust your life to, it’s him!<br />
<br />
Gemini immediately understands your predicament. The second he feels your grip is tight enough, he floats as high as he can, managing to lift you off the precarious platform the instant it’s swallowed by the burning magma. Under obvious strain, the Poison-Type hovers forward as fast as it can, your feet hanging danegrously close to the lava below but never touching it, much to your relief. Gemini groans as its struggle becomes harder and harder to bear, and just as it seems like he’s about to give in to your and Meowth’s combined weight, your reach the platform just in time before your makeshift transport collapses and tumbles down hard and rolls along the rocky surface of the lake’s margin. You made it!!<br />
<br />
The Heatmor group circles you with visible concern, but fortunately you aren’t seriously hurt. A bruised elbow and knee are nothing compared to what would’ve happened had you stayed behind a second longer, and after catching his breath, Gemini seems to be just fine as well. All in all, your makeshift plan was a resounding success!<br />
You gaze ahead to the hole in the wall right in front of you – the exit you fought so hard to reach is finally within your grasp. With renewed confidence, you look at the Heatmor group and boldly step forward, wondering what the Great One might have in store for you next; right now, the lava room’s exit seems to lead to yet another wide tunnel, something you’re no stranger to by now.<br />
<br />
However, the moment you walk through the opening and into the tunnel, the familiar booming voice is heard, anger patent in its ominous tone…<br />
<br />
<b><i>WRONG CHOICE, HUMAN.</i></b><br />
<br />
What happens next is a horrifying vision, and all you can do is watch powerlessly. While you’re already inside the tunnel, the Heatmor group is still making its way out of the room, and you look back just in time to see the ground collapse beneath their feet! The leader and three other Heatmor are able to rush inside the tunnel to safety, but the last two are immediately swallowed by the magma… falling to their death.<br />
<br />
<b><i>THE RESULT OF YOUR DEFIANCE. MEASURE YOUR CHOICES CAREFULLY NEXT TIME!</i></b><br />
<br />
The Heatmor leader is in shock; he can’t stop looking at the place where the last rock platform used to be… where his <i>family</i> used to be. Despite your struggle, the Great One still seems to have complete control over your collective fates, to the point where you now wonder if the fact that you’re still alive just means He’s toying with you. Or perhaps you lured the pack right where He needed them to be, to carry out their execution... could this be your <i>your</i> fault?!<br />
<br />
You’re given no more time to wonder, as Meowth tugs at your leg incessantly, calling your attention to something in the tunnel ahead. Guilt-ridden, you look forward to find yet another surprise – standing in front of you, blocking your path… is Kyle!<br />
<br />
-	Hey dude. You… made it. I was kinda hoping you wouldn’t…<br />
<br />
The self-entitled reporter looks just as heartbroken as you. His voice is sullen, almost a whisper, and his eyes remain locked on the ground as he speaks.<br />
<br />
-	But you made it here on your own, and I… I couldn’t. I struck a bargain with Him, Keith. And I can’t let you go any further. Only one of us gets to leave this mountain… and to make it out of that lava pit, I promised Him I’d stop you. I’m so sorry Keith…<br />
<br />
Doduo stands between you and Kyle, looking saddened but determined to see this through on its Trainer’s behalf. It adopts a battle stance and stares directly at you.<br />
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>jolteonjak</u>:</b> The final stand-off begins. Gasping for air, Excadrill looks on as Cyndaquil unlocks his hidden potential and achieves an entirely new form, finally evolving after all the time he spent alongside you in your travels. No longer a tiny echidna, flames burn bright and strong from the reborn Quilava as he glares back at his foes.<br />
<br />
-	That bond! Could it be…<br />
<br />
Excadrill buries his claws into the ground, again receiving silent instructions from Baro, and channels every last remnant of his energy into the earth, creating a row of protruding spikes that travel the soil straight at your partner; at the same time, Quilava gathers what energy he has left of his own and releases a stream of flames much larger than you’ve ever seen him unleash. <b>Earth Power</b> and Flamethrower move at equal speed in opposite directions, flames flying above the spikes as they meet in the middle.<br />
<br />
-	Could it be that…<br />
<br />
Rock spires close in on the exhausted Quilava, and the torrent of flames prepares to strike the Excadrill. Both you and Baro know that whoever hits first will win the fight.<br />
The end comes when one last earthen spike rises from the forest ground, half-inch away from Quilava’s neck… and stops. You look over to the foe’s side and see the reason – Excadrill is engulfed in fire, yelling in pain, and as it subsides seconds later, the creature loses its footing and falls… unable to get back up! <b>Quilava gained 1 Level!</b><br />
<br />
-	Could it be that I was wrong?<br />
<br />
Baro is stunned, unable to react out of sheer incredulity. The perfect bond he had with Excadrill has just been bested by an unremarkable kid. It takes him almost a minute to snap out of his trance and walk over to Excadrill, recalling him to safety. The way he looks at you is completely different from before, anger and defiance gone, having given place to shame and, suprisingly, a glimpse of respect.<br />
<br />
-	Maybe… maybe Saint isn’t mistaken after all. You may have the potential to be someone special. A true Gifted doesn’t yell his orders like common rabble, but perhaps you're just lacking experience. Come, let me show you the Wall… you might understand then.<br />
<br />

1x Sitrus Berry</b> and starts walking away from the clearing and into the woods, barely giving you time to catch up. When you do, you still struggle to keep up with the huge man. He isn’t speaking, perhaps pondering on his impossible defeat, or perhaps on the words of Saint and how he defied him by engaging you. Be that as it may, the journey across the forest is a peaceful one, as if Baro’s mere presence is enough to keep hostile wild Pokemon away. And after some hours of walking in silence, you realize you’re moving <i>out</i> of the woods as the trees start to become a progressively rarer sight.<br />
<br />
Before long, you and Baro reach the foothill of a tall, rocky, desolate mountain that stands alone in the center of the forest you just crossed.<br />
<br />
-	We climb. The wall is at the peak. Stop to rest and die by the talons of the local fauna.<br />
<br />
Despite his earlier change of heart, Baro still clearly holds a grudge. If he hated you for Saint’s unwarranted trust before, now it seems he’s angry at the way you humbled him. Either way, this is one man you won't be befriending any time soon.<br />
<br />
Baro finds a narrow trail that leads up the mountainside and takes the front. You follow close behind and dutifully climb your way up, for what feels like hours, minding your footing while keeping the native’s words in the back of your mind – the creatures of the mountain don’t seem to bow to Baro’s will, unlike those of the forest… In fact, a powerful cry in the skies above makes you instantly look up in concern, but you spot nothing. What does happen, in that momentary distraction, is a big chunk of loose rock crumbling beneath your feet. Causing you to lose your bearing and tumble to the side and roll off the narrow ledge!<br />
<br />
Out of pure instinct, you manage to hold on to the edge of a boulder with one hand, your whole body dangling off the side of the cliff. Although common sense always yell “don’t look down!”, it’s what everyone always does. And looking down, the forest you crossed earlier is now little more than a speckle of green in the distance… how high did you climb already?!<br />
<br />
Your hand hurts. Your grip weakens. Baro noticed, and stands on the ledge looking at you, unmoving. If he’s in any way concerned, he doesn’t show it. But he doesn’t turn around to leave either, or stomp on your toes… he just stands there, as if testing your resolve.<br />
<br />
You can’t hold on much longer, and if you lose your grip, who knows what’ll happen to you! Baro’s aid is a scream away, will you cry for his help? Or will your pride lead you to try doing this on your own? It’s a decision you’ll have to make… right now!!</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Pearl’s Perap</u>:</b> The towering figure looks you down with his ever-stoic expression and says nothing for a moment. When he does speak, he does so in a deep, lifeless monotone befitting a man to whom these strange events have become almost meaningless routine.<br />
<br />
-	The Silver Forest is cursed. It has been for the past year, and the disease continue to spread. I come from the only tribe who has yet to fall victim to the Black Ill. You invaded our aerial territory and were struck down.<br />
<br />
Again without a hint of remorse… Rogo kneels and picks up a dark leaf and shows it to you before crushing it in his massive hand.<br />
<br />
-	Those who linger in the wilderness of Silver Forest become afflicted by the Black Ill, sooner or later. The only way to prevent the catastrophe from striking our village is to keep everyone out. We did not know whether you and your Pidgeot were healthy or sick, so you had to be put down. As it turns out, you are quite healthy. For now.<br />
<br />
Turning his back, he effortlessly picks up one of the Leafeon corpses and lays it on the ground at your feet. It looks nothing like it did just moments ago; its colors have been restored, but it doesn’t matter anymore…<br />
<br />
-	This is the fate that awaits all those with the Black Ill. Death is the only cure, and sooner or later, everyone is cured. You just handed this one its fate a little sooner. The disease affects Grass Pokemon much faster than anyone else, who in turn seem to be responsible for infecting the other species. You placed your Leafeon in tremendous danger just by letting it out, and for all we know, it can already be infected.<br />
<br />
What is he talking about? Bettie… sick? She did get hit by the diseased Grass-Types pretty bad, but how could you have known? And if she is indeed infected… what’s gonna happen to her?!<br />
<br />
-	I cannot take you back to the village with me. It’s a chance I will not take; you may be healthy, but your Leafeon is likely to carry the Black Ill. After you find the roaming Healer and bring me proof of her work, you may come and find us. Head South, where the leaves remain silver. To the North you’ll find nothing but misery.<br />
<br />
Without waiting for your reply, Rogo mounts his Braviary and takes off, leaving you all by yourself once again, but with a lot on your mind. The native was being protective of his village, which you now learned is located south of where you are, but what should you do now? He also mentioned a vagrant healer somewhere in the woods, and hinted that the most dangerous part of the forest is to the North…<br />
<br />
Where do you head next? Going south will help you find the village sooner or later, but with Bettie’s potential illness, should you risk going there? You could be met with deadly force without proof of your Leafeon’s health… What about heading North? The black leaves blow from that direction, indicating that you could run into serious trouble in that direction, but possibly also the answer for this whole mess… is it worth the risk? Or maybe you could try to find the healer, but with so little to go on, how are you going to find her?<br />
<br />
What do you do?</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u> Electric Blue Eye</u>:</b> Sean lost his Quagsire, and you just lost your Jellicent. It would’ve made you even, if only you weren’t forced to reveal your last partner already, whereas the Gym Leader’s final Pokemon remains a mystery to you. And with Sean having already proven himself a highly tactical battler, information is a resource just as precious as type advantage.<br />
<br />
-	You just showed me your whole game Ethan. But I don’t blame you; after all, Snivy wouldn’t have had much luck against Pelipper. So, a Gastly it is… I wonder if you can protect that ghost better than the last.<br />
<br />
As if replying to his provocation, James unleashes a multicolored beam straight at the unsuspecting bird, causing Pelipper’s eyes to glaze over as its mind crumbles under the effects of the strange technique.<br />
<br />
-	Pelipper! Shake it off, focus! <b>Soak</b> that Gastly and put him away with another <b>Shock Wave</b>!<br />
<br />
The pelican tries its best to concentrate, pondering on the orders, trying to make sense of them. It manages to spit a water shower into the air, causing countless droplets to fall on James, soaking him as if he were a Water-Type himself… with everything that entails! Sean’s strategy is obvious – he intends to force Diego’s weaknesses on James to beat him the same way!<br />
<br />
Pelipper charges up again and unleashes a lightning bolt into the sky, looking to finish the job… but instead of curving towards James, the electrical discharge bends and lands right on top of Pelipper itself! Finally, the confusion is paying off! Intent on capitalizing on the opening, James gathers as much energy as possible and lets loose a wicked Thunderbolt that strikes the Water-Type out of the sky, sending it crashing to the frozen floor below, shattering the ice layer and causing it to sink into the water below!<br />
<br />
After a while Pelipper resurfaces, flapping its wings haphazardly on the surface, gasping for air… but James is waiting, and releases a wave of pure darkness that envelops the struggling pelican and puts it out if its misery! When the shadows lift, Pelipper is floating unconscious, forcing Sean to smile and recall his partner.<br />
<br />
-	Bravo! Didn’t expect you to put Pelipper away so quickly. Quite the flawless comeback! But unfortunately… the <i>real</i> battle begins now. You’ve brought me down to my last Pokemon, who happens to be my oldest and strongest partner. Let’s see if you can measure up!<br />
<br />
Sean unclips a Dive Ball from his belt, enlarges it and tosses it in the air. The device snaps open and from it emerges… a Dewott! It lands gracefully on the ice and throws you a defiant look. The otter wears a Red Scarf around its neck and its shells glimmer in the sunlight that bathes the stadium, clearly indicating their sharpness…<br />
<br />
-	This is Hanzo. He and I have been together since the beginning of my journey as a Trainer, and he’s the reason I chose to specialize in Water-Types. Beat him, and you’ll have surpassed the best I have to offer. Now, let’s make this a fight worthy of Gottfried’s admiration!<br />
<br />
Hanzo the Dewott smirks, tilts his head slightly and raises an arm toward James, <b>Taunt</b>ing him to strike! The Gastly seems more than eager to give the smug foe a taste of his power, so there’s no point in asking him to use anything other than offensive moves right now…<br />
<br />
What do you do?</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> You are determined to help Dana and Oscar and there’s no way a threat on a sheet of paper is going to dissuade you. In fact, you’re going to use it against it whoever sent it!<br />
<br />
Snubbull sniffs the note thoroughly, barks and runs outside. Seems it picked up a scent! You rush after the Fairy-Type, leaving the Center in a hurry and several bystanders looking at you in utter confusion. You step outside just in time to see a black van drive off and Snubbull fruitlessly barking at it in the middle of the road, blocking traffic and earning you several colorful comments from the angry drivers. There’s no way you can catch up to them now…<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, a hand on your shoulder causes you to turn abruptly, startled. You face a tall, attractive man, probably in his thirties, dressed sharply in a white shirt, light brown overcoat, matching pants and fedora. He looks sternly at the van as it makes a turn and leaves your field of vision, then turns his attention to you, visibly concerned.<br />
<br />
-	Girly, I don’t know what you did, but seems to me you just caught the attention of the wrong kind of people.<br />
<br />
He walks out to the road, picks up Snubbull and returns it to you.<br />
<br />
-	Next time you might find yourself in the back of that van. Care to tell me what’s going on?<br />
<br />
This man seems to know who those people were, or he’s just really good at sticking his nose in other people’s business. The way he talks, it seems as if he could help you somehow; on the other hand, you literally <i>just</i> met him… is it wise to open up to this stranger, or could it be a trap?<br />
<br />
What do you do?</span></span><br />

<b><u>Plague Swamp</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>DaveTheFishGuy</u>:</b> <i>((Welcome to Cascadia Dave! Hope you enjoy your time in the archipelago, though with your choice of island, it’s pretty clear you didn’t come here for the sightseeing ^^;<br />
<b>Record marker: 1 of 6</b> on-hand Pokemon declared: Croagunk))</i><br />
<br />
One of the goals for any Trainer worth his salt is self-improvement. And tired as you are of sand and heat, you could have chosen a cozier destination for your next adventure, but of all the wonderful places to visit in Cascadia, you chose… the Plague Swamp.<br />
In a way, it reminds you of the Great Marsh you knew so well as a child, but you aren’t delusional – this place is lifeless, dangerous and unforgiving. Jason the Croagunk seems to be taking it fairly well, being naturally conditioned to survive in this sort of environments, but have no such biological advantage.<br />
<br />
With no particular destination in mind, as is often the case of Trainers who seek only to get stronger and face the hardships as they come, you set off on your trip across the swamp, taking care not to breathe too deeply or step on any acid pool. And even then, you’re fully aware that a hundred other natural hazards may threaten your well-being simply for daring to cross this place on foot.<br />
<br />
Despite your best efforts, the foul stench and the humidity in the air start getting to you. Breathing alone is enough make you nauseous, your eyes water when wandering too close to some of the warmer pools of toxic mud and your legs begin to hurt after a while of pulling your feet out of the swampy terrain each time they bury too deep. You’d expected to be met with resistance of some sort, but rather from the local wildlife, not the wilderness itself. The only things getting stronger at this rate are going to be your thighs in their continued effort to keep you from sinking.<br />
<br />
However, after a while, a disconcerting sound not too far away catches your attention. Looking over to a nearby tree (long dead from the toxic waste it absorbed over the years), you spot a pair of Grimer pinning down and preparing to feed on a severely malnourished-looking Tranquill. You doubt the bird would even be strong enough to take flight on its own in its current state, let alone with the two Poison-Types ganging up on it.<br />
<br />
Do you do something about it, or will you let natural selection run its course?</span></span> <br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorange"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>Ruin Island</i></span><br />
<br />
<b><u>Amor Temple</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Charminions</u>:</b> <i>((Hey there Charm, welcome aboard! Hope you enjoy your adventure in Cascadia and the depths of Amor Temple. Hope you’re prepared!<br />
<b>Record marker: 4 of 6</b> on-hand Pokemon declared: Combusken, Honchkrow, Houndour, Magmortar))</i><br />
<br />
Guided by your trusty Honchkrow Don, you walk towards the abandoned-looking building. This is Amor Temple, located in the heart of Ruin Island; the Gods worshipped here have long been forgotten, but the structure has endured the test of time and stands proudly as one of Cascadia’s oldest <i>ex-libris</i>.<br />
<br />
After climbing precisely 500 steps, you finally reach the entrance, legs hurting and heart thumping. The front gate, massive and imposing, made of once-finely sculpted rock, is covered in vines and foliage, indicating nobody has opened it likely in hundreds of years. And yet, all it takes is a simple tap on the stony surface for the entire structure to start rumbling loudly while the doors spread apart, allowing you to pass through!<br />
<br />
Confused, you decide to step inside nonetheless. After all, it’s why you came here in the first place. But it makes no sense for the gate to open itself that easily when it showed clear signs of having remained untouched for centuries! You decide it’s best to let it go for now and focus on your new surroundings. The entrance hall is a massive room kept alit by three chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, each housing several slumbering Litwick. Their flames reveal the entirety of the area, from the elaborate stone walls to the two doors on the far end of the room. The gravures on the walls have faded with time, giving you no hints about the history of this place, but something does catch your eye and only serves to add to your lingering questions…<br />
<br />
A dead body!<br />
<br />
In the center of the room is the corpse of what you can only assume was another adventurer. And on closer inspection, he barely shows signs of decomposition, as if… he’d passed away only recently! But in that case, why did it seem as if the Temple hadn’t been entered in ages?!<br />
You force yourself to look at the man a bit more carefully, in case it could provide any clues as to what happened. He looked to be roughly your age, light on possessions for someone risking his life in an abandoned temple; his pants are darker from the knee down, with traces of dried mud, as if he’d crossed a lake of some sort; his shirt bears numerous cuts and tears, along with minor traces of blood; and the cause of death soon becomes apparent when you inspect his neck and arm – several black needles have pierced his skin, likely containing fatal poison. A classic trap…<br />
<br />
You notice he carried a backpack, but unfortunately it seems empty; he must have spent all of his provisions during the adventure, so there’s nothing left to salvage. Looking ahead, you inspect the two doors on the far wall a bit more carefully, as they seem to be the only way forward if you still want to explore the temple after this terrible discovery. The gates are identical and much like the images on the other walls, whatever used to be portrayed on these doors has long been eroded by time. Seemingly nothing sets them apart, until you notice that a small puddle of water beneath the gate on the left, and thin vines emerging from beneath the one on the right.<br />
<br />
With so little to go on, which door do you choose to pass through?</span></span></div>

<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> <i>((Record marker: <b>6 of 6</b> in-hand Pokemon declared – Nidoking, Meowth, Hariyama, Tauros, Vileplume, Weezing))</i><br />
<br />
Option C. It’s one any adventurer must always keep in the back of his mind, but more importantly, one he must know when to use. In your mind, this is the time to do it, as you refuse to give in to the creature’s demands and aren’t quite in the mood to die either. You only see one way out of this, and it regrettably involves calling out your last Pokemon, one you’d been saving for later… now this “God of Mountain” knows everything you might throw at him, but given the circumstances, that’s far from your greatest concern at the moment.<br />
<br />
You cling on to Gemini as hard as you can, hoping to Arceus he can somehow muster the strength to carry you over the lava pit safely… The Heatmor pack roots for the Weezing across the lake, and while you hold on for dear life, you realize this is the gamble of a lifetime. Gemini is the strongest and oldest of your partners, so if there’s anyone you can entrust your life to, it’s him!<br />
<br />
Gemini immediately understands your predicament. The second he feels your grip is tight enough, he floats as high as he can, managing to lift you off the precarious platform the instant it’s swallowed by the burning magma. Under obvious strain, the Poison-Type hovers forward as fast as it can, your feet hanging danegrously close to the lava below but never touching it, much to your relief. Gemini groans as its struggle becomes harder and harder to bear, and just as it seems like he’s about to give in to your and Meowth’s combined weight, your reach the platform just in time before your makeshift transport collapses and tumbles down hard and rolls along the rocky surface of the lake’s margin. You made it!!<br />
<br />
The Heatmor group circles you with visible concern, but fortunately you aren’t seriously hurt. A bruised elbow and knee are nothing compared to what would’ve happened had you stayed behind a second longer, and after catching his breath, Gemini seems to be just fine as well. All in all, your makeshift plan was a resounding success!<br />
You gaze ahead to the hole in the wall right in front of you – the exit you fought so hard to reach is finally within your grasp. With renewed confidence, you look at the Heatmor group and boldly step forward, wondering what the Great One might have in store for nyou next; right now, the lava room’s exit seems to lead to yet another wide tunnel, something you’re no stranger to by now.<br />
<br />
However, the moment you walk through the opening and into the tunnel, the familiar booming voice is heard, anger patent in its ominous tone…<br />
<br />
<b><i>WRONG CHOICE, HUMAN.</i></b><br />
<br />
What happens next is a horrifying vision, and all you can do is watch powerlessly. While you’re already inside the tunnel, the Heatmor group is still making its way out of the room, and you look back just in time to see the ground collapse beneath their feet! The leader and three other Heatmor are able to rush inside the tunnel to safety, but the last two are immediately swallowed by the magma… falling to their death.<br />
<br />
<b><i>THE RESULT OF YOUR DEFIANCE. MEASURE YOUR CHOICES CAREFULLY NEXT TIME!</i></b><br />
<br />
The Heatmor leader is in shock; he can’t stop looking at the place where the last rock platform used to be… where his <i>family</i> used to be. Despite your struggle, thr Great One still seems to have complete control over your collective fates, to the point where you now wonder if the fact that you’re still alive just means He’s toying with you. Or perhaps you lured the pack right where He needed them to be, to carry out their execution... could this be your <i>your</i> fault?!<br />
<br />
You’re given no more time to wonder, as Meowth tugs at your leg incessantly, calling your attention to something in the tunnel ahead. Guilt-ridden, you look forward to find yet another surprise – standing in front of you, blocking your path… is Kyle!<br />
<br />
-	Hey dude. You… made it. I was kinda hoping you wouldn’t…<br />
<br />
The self-entitled reporter looks just as heartbroken as you. His voice is sullen, almost a whisper, and his eyes remain locked on the ground as he speaks.<br />
<br />
-	But you made it here on your own, and I… I couldn’t. I struck a bargain with Him, Keith. And I can’t let you go any further. Only one of us gets to leave this mountain… and to make it out of that lava pit, I promised Him I’d stop you. I’m so sorry Keith…<br />
<br />
Doduo stands between you and Kyle, looking saddened but determined to see this through on its Trainer’s behalf. It adopts a battle stance and stares directly at you.<br />
<br />
-	Doduo, buddy… <b>Drill Peck</b> him.</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">Keith's heart was beating at the speed of Yanma wings. What was happening now would mean the difference between life and death, for him and Meowth, and almost certainly those Heatmor as well. As the Weezing emerged from their Poké Ball, Keith grabbed on, gripping the Poison Gas Pokémon tightly. &quot;Weez!?&quot; Gemini and Mustard gasped simultaneously, not used to being weighed down like this- Keith hadn't tried to use them as an emergency conveyance in years now, but fortunately, both heads were in agreement- Keith was still not a heavy man, and Meowth didn't exactly add too much to the load, either.<br />
<br />
&quot;You got this?&quot; Keith murmured to the Weezing.<br />
<br />
In response, a familiar voice sounded in Keith's head as Gemini replied telepathically; <i>A little heavier than we remember you, but yeah, we got this.</i> Keith said nothing in response, merely holding onto the Weezing as tightly as he possibly could. As much as he was currently vowing to bring his Crobat with him wherever he went from now on, he still had no problem putting his trust into Gemini and Mustard. The Weezing was Keith's oldest partner, his best friend, quite possibly the most reliable Pokémon on the team. Gemini floated high above the lava, and it took the combined efforts of both Gemini and Mustard to keep Keith high enough so his feet weren't touching the molten liquid death. As they floated towards the solid rock at the other end, Keith could hear the sounds of the pack of Heatmor rooting for Gemini and Mustard, cheering them on. However, the Poison-type was starting to groan under Keith's weight, which in turn caused Keith to silently curse the fact that the Weezing species was not meant to support human beings in flight. They were almost there by now, and yet Keith could tell that Gemini had reached his limit... The larger head started to give in, started to fall, and yet, they did not fall- Mustard, the Weezing's smaller head, still had that last bit of strength left in him, and with that last bit of strength, mixed with a healthy dose of adrenaline, heaved his larger head, his Trainer, and his Meowth teammate onto the solid rock platform at long last, where they all landed with a THUD.<br />
<br />
Keith started breathing again. They... they had made it! He wasn't plummeting to a molten grave, he had landed on solid rock. Hot, yes, but solid. Gemini and Mustard landed on the rock, and was already starting to rise back into the air after catching their breath.<br />
<br />
Meowth still clung to Keith's shoulder for dear life. &quot;Is we dead yet?&quot; he whimpered.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Meowth,&quot; Keith said with a small smile. &quot;We're alive. We made it! We're OK,&quot; he added, for he had noticed the Heatmor pack gathering around him in concern. &quot;We're all OK. My elbow and knee are gonna be sore tomorrow, but...&quot; he paused to glance back at the lava at this point. &quot;...sure beats the hell out of the alternative.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Weezing,&quot; agreed Mustard, the Weezing's smaller head, as both heads nodded in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; nodded Meowth. &quot;Alright, wat say we keep movin', huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith nodded as he climbed to his feet and straightened out his cowboy hat. &quot;Let's do this,&quot; he said, a confident grin returning to him as he led the way into the tunnel-<br />
<br />
<i><b>WRONG CHOICE, HUMAN.</b></i><br />
<br />
...Oh, <i>crap</i>. Keith froze as he heard the booming voice of The Great One, more angry and ominous than ever before. He waited for what would come next, but the voice didn't sound again. Shaking it off, he took another step... and then it happened. A crumbling sound got Keith's attention and made him turn around, and what he saw filled him with dread- the rock platform just outside the tunnel was starting to collapse, <i>and the Heatmor <b>were still on it!!!</b></i> Keith wheeled around as quickly as he could, to rush to their aid, but even as he turned, most of the rock was already gone. The leader had made it into the tunnel, along with a few others... but two of the Heatmor were not so lucky. Their mad dash for the tunnel was cut abruptly and cruelly short, as there lay nothing beneath them but molten magma. &quot;NO!&quot; Keith exclaimed, and he dashed forward, intent on grabbing them and pulling them to safety. Of course, Meowth, Gemini, and Mustard all knew better- they knew that if Keith went through with this, it'd be much more likely that he'd plummet to his death as well, and they weren't about to lose their Trainer like that! Meowth jumped off of Keith's shoulder and tried to hold him back by grabbing his pants leg, but the Weezing's method proved more effective- they floated down in front of Keith, barring his way. Fortunately for Keith's safety, Gemini and Mustard found it much easier to hold Keith back than support him in flight, and Keith could only watch helplessly as two Heatmor sank into the lava, sank to their deaths. The voice boomed again, though this time everybody was too shocked by what had just happened to really respond to it.<br />
<br />
<b><i>THE RESULT OF YOUR DEFIANCE. MEASURE YOUR CHOICES CAREFULLY NEXT TIME!</i></b><br />
<br />
&quot;...Dey're gone,&quot; Meowth murmured quietly.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... No...&quot; Keith gasped as he collapsed to the ground, still trying to process this. He... he had promised them he'd keep them safe, and... and... Keith turned to look at the leader of the pack- he was staring in horror at where his family had just been standing, mere seconds ago. Keith began to wonder... this... was this his fault? Did he just bring the Heatmor precisely where The Great One wanted him to? Was he just some puppet in the deranged deity's demonic design? An unwitting pawn in the plot to exterminate the Heatmor, a proverbial can of paint hitting the Wet Bandits in the face- wait a minute...<br />
<br />
At that moment, however, Keith's train of thought was abruptly derailed by Meowth. &quot;Uh... Keith?&quot; he said. Keith turned to look at Meowth, who was looking and pointing further into the tunnel. Keith turned a little more, and looked where Meowth was pointing, and there stood-<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle?!&quot; Keith exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Indeed, it was Kyle, the aspiring reporter, his Doduo accompanying him. So, he was spared from the Great One's wrath... but as Keith noticed the look on Kyle's face, he got an ominous feeling that it came at a price. And sure enough, the truth came out- Kyle had been spared by the Great One, but only if he... only if he agreed to stop Keith. It was horrifying, for sure, but Keith could see just how much this wasn't sitting right with the reporter, nor with his Doduo, who was very reluctantly about to comply with Kyle's orders to use <b>Drill Peck</b>.<br />
<br />
The plan clicked together in Keith's mind almost immediately. &quot;Meowth, go!&quot; he ordered. &quot;Use <b>Hypnosis</b>, and follow up with <b>Flash</b> if you need to! Kyle,&quot; he added as Meowth stepped forward and attempted to put the Twin Bird Pokémon into a trance. &quot;Don't do this. This isn't the only way, and this is not who you are. You were willing to die at the hands of that Magmar rather than see your Doduo meet that fate, you're clearly the kind of guy who puts the needs of those he cares about ahead of his own. Well, what about these Heatmor? You certainly cared about them back when we were fighting the Magmar!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was around this time Meowth understood why Keith hadn't told him to follow up the Hypnosis and Flash with Thunderbolt or Dream Eater or anything like that- he wasn't looking to defeat Doduo, merely to hold it at bay until he could convince Kyle to call it off. Doduo didn't deserve to get hurt as a result of The Great One's deranged puppetry, especially since it was the Normal/Flying-type who had helped save them from that cave-in.<br />
<br />
Keith, meanwhile, was still trying to get through to Kyle. &quot;We can do this, Kyle,&quot; he said. &quot;And you want to know why we can do this?&quot; He paused for a second, before stating out loud exactly what his mind had been piecing together before Meowth had noticed the reporter in the first place. &quot;Because I think The Great One... is scared of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;EH?!&quot; Meowth exclaimed, shocked and surprised at this. Gemini and Mustard exchanged surprised looks as well, though they weren't quite as well-acquainted with what was going on here.<br />
<br />
&quot;You ever see the movie <i>Home Alone</i>?&quot; Keith asked Kyle. &quot;I sure did. It's my favorite Christmas movie. Hell, it inspired me to name this Paras I used to own Kevin. See, I was starting to think there was something odd about the way this Great One keeps putting us through these deadly booby traps, runs us around like Rattata in a maze. If He really wanted to wipe out the Heatmor so badly, why doesn't He just show Himself and do it, you know? Why bother with all the lackeys and all this manipulating-the-environment hocus pocus if He could just show up, do the deed, and be done with it? And then it hit me- why did Kevin booby-trap the entire house instead of going right up against the Wet Bandits? Because he's a kid and they're two grown men, and they could have killed him in an instant if they so desired. And you know what? It might be crazy, but I think it might just be the same deal here. I don't think He's doing things this way to toy with us, I think He's trying to make sure we either don't live long enough to confront Him face to face, or we get too scared to do so. And even if I'm dead wrong about this, we still gotta confront Him,&quot; he stated. &quot;Because if we don't, even if you live to get out of here, all you'll have to look forward to is reporting on more and more tragic Pokémon deaths from this island, all of them seemingly of natural causes when you know better than that, each one of them a grim reminder of what you did to survive, and I know you don't want that on your conscience. Besides,&quot; he added, on a sudden inspiration, &quot;wouldn't it be so much better if you were able to report on how the tyrannical reign of the deranged god of Aduro Island finally came to an end? That's the kind of exclusive story that could really get a reporter's career going, am I right?&quot;</span></span><br />

<br />
<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u> Electric Blue Eye</u>:</b> Sean lost his Quagsire, and you just lost your Jellicent. It would’ve made you even, if only you weren’t forced to reveal your last partner already, whereas the Gym Leader’s final Pokemon remains a mystery to you. And with Sean having already proven himself a highly tactical battler, information is a resource just as precious as type advantage.<br />
<br />
-	You just showed me your whole game Ethan. But I don’t blame you; after all, Snivy wouldn’t have had much luck against Pelipper. So, a Gastly it is… I wonder if you can protect that ghost better than the last.<br />
<br />
As if replying to his provocation, James unleashes a multicolored beam straight at the unsuspecting bird, causing Pelipper’s eyes to glaze over as its mind crumbles under the effects of the strange technique.<br />
<br />
-	Pelipper! Shake it off, focus! <b>Soak</b> that Gastly and put him away with another <b>Shock Wave</b>!<br />
<br />
The pelican tries its best to concentrate, pondering on the orders, trying to make sense of them. It manages to spit a water shower into the air, causing countless droplets to fall on James, soaking him as if he were a Water-Type himself… with everything that entails! Sean’s strategy is obvious – he intends to force Diego’s weaknesses on James to beat him the same way!<br />
<br />
Pelipper charges up again and unleashes a lightning bolt into the sky, looking to finish the job… but instead of curving towards James, the electrical discharge bends and lands right on top of Pelipper itself! Finally, the confusion is paying off! Intent on capitalizing on the opening, James gathers as much energy as possible and lets loose a wicked Thunderbolt that strikes the Water-Type out of the sky, sending it crashing to the frozen floor below, shattering the ice layer and causing it to sink into the water below!<br />
<br />
After a while Pelipper resurfaces, flapping its wings haphazardly on the surface, gasping for air… but James is waiting, and releases a wave of pure darkness that envelops the struggling pelican and puts it out if its misery! When the shadows lift, Pelipper is floating unconscious, forcing Sean to smile and recall his partner.<br />
<br />
-	Bravo! Didn’t expect you to put Pelipper away so quickly. Quite the flawless comeback! But unfortunately… the <i>real</i> battle begins now. You’ve brought me down to my last Pokemon, who happens to be my oldest and strongest partner. Let’s see if you can measure up!<br />
<br />
Sean unclips a Dive Ball from his belt, enlarges it and tosses it in the air. The device snaps open and from it emerges… a Dewott! It lands gracefully on the ice and throws you a defiant look. The otter wears a Red Scarf around its neck and its shells glimmer in the sunlight that bathes the stadium, clearly indicating their sharpness…<br />
<br />
-	This is Hanzo. He and I have been together since the beginning of my journey as a Trainer, and he’s the reason I chose to specialize in Water-Types. Beat him, and you’ll have surpassed the best I have to offer. Now, let’s make this a fight worthy of Gottfried’s admiration!<br />
<br />
Hanzo the Dewott smirks, tilts his head slightly and raises an arm toward James, <b>Taunt</b>ing him to strike! The Gastly seems more than eager to give the smug foe a taste of his power, so there’s no point in asking him to use anything other than offensive moves right now…<br />
<br />
What do you do?</span></span>

<i>‘Looks like we got lucky,’</i> James said telepathically to his trainer while Ethan was wiping his brow of the nervous sweat he had building up once he had heard Sean’s orders to his seagull. <i>Lucky is right,</i> Ethan sighed, <i>I really thought it was over just then…but now…</i> the trainer said looking to the field at the last of Sean’s Pokémon.<br />
<br />
Quickly Ethan dug into his coat pocket, retrieving his purple Pokedex he had used to first register for the tournament, &quot;Dewott, the Discipline Pokémon and the evolved form of Oshawott…&quot; droned the machine nicknamed ‘Aya’ by its holder, &quot;Dewott never neglects to maintain the scalchop it carries on its person in tip top shape. Through rigorous training, Dewott has mastered to use its two scalchop technique to show off its fluid swordsmanship. No two Dewott are the same, thus all have different forms of fighting styles.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mighty impressive.&quot; Ethan commented, &quot;And an interesting choice…&quot; <br />
<br />
From the beginning of the battle, actually, when Ethan had originally read the gym leader’s bio, he had guessed two of the three Pokémon Sean would use. (Believe it or not) He had figured Sean may have had a Feraligatr or possibly a Swampert as his last Pokémon, Dewott was actually a refreshing choice of Pokémon to see. Especially as the boy wouldn't mind obtaining one someday. <i>Odd that you've never evolved it though…</i> the trainer thought before he looked at his own Pokémon, a Gastly he has had for practically forever, before chuckling to himself. <i>Who am I to judge.</i><br />
<br />
Sean’s Pokémon waved to the boy’s Gastly to make the first move, <b>Taunt</b>ing them from the get go- Ethan knew his ghost Pokémon was locked into only offensive type of attacks now, but that wasn't all, his ghost had also been turned into a Water type for the remainder of the battle. Thinking about it, it was difficult to tell if Sean had done them a generous favor or a great hindrance…<br />
<br />
<i>‘Well Ethan, what do we do now? What’s the game plan?’</i><br />
<br />
<i>Problem I’m having here is, Sean knew as a Ghost type trainer, we rely on ‘tricks’ so to speak to get the upper hand…now taunted…I just don’t know if we could...</i><br />
<br />
<i>‘Ethan?’</i><br />
<br />
<i>Right. We need to make sure he doesn't dive into the water. That's priority #1. Now that there’s a way in, I’m sure his going to want to use that to his advantage. Water conducts electricity, so. Shoot a <b>Thunderbolt</b> directly at the hole and keep him from going inside. Then use <b>Giga Drain</b>, I’m sure with the help of your <b>Grass Gem</b> you’ll be able to do some real damage there. Finally, with the only item you got gone after its use, let’s see if all those years of us stealing what we want comes in handy today, use <b>Thief</b> and grab Dewott’s item when he isn't looking.</i></span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> You are determined to help Dana and Oscar and there’s no way a threat on a sheet of paper is going to dissuade you. In fact, you’re going to use it against it whoever sent it!<br />
<br />
Snubbull sniffs the note thoroughly, barks and runs outside. Seems it picked up a scent! You rush after the Fairy-Type, leaving the Center in a hurry and several bystanders looking at you in utter confusion. You step outside just in time to see a black van drive off and Snubbull fruitlessly barking at it in the middle of the road, blocking traffic and earning you several colorful comments from the angry drivers. There’s no way you can catch up to them now…<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, a hand on your shoulder causes you to turn abruptly, startled. You face a tall, attractive man, probably in his thirties, dressed sharply in a white shirt, light brown overcoat, matching pants and fedora. He looks sternly at the van as it makes a turn and leaves your field of vision, then turns his attention to you, visibly concerned.<br />
<br />
-	Girly, I don’t know what you did, but seems to me you just caught the attention of the wrong kind of people.<br />
<br />
He walks out to the road, picks up Snubbull and returns it to you.<br />
<br />
-	Next time you might find yourself in the back of that van. Care to tell me what’s going on?<br />
<br />
This man seems to know who those people were, or he’s just really good at sticking his nose in other people’s business. The way he talks, it seems as if he could help you somehow; on the other hand, you literally <i>just</i> met him… is it wise to open up to this stranger, or could it be a trap?<br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: SILVER"><i>Damn it!</i> Liza cursed as she saw the black van her Pokémon had lead her to, drive off with her Snubbull in the middle of the street barking up a storm and patrons in their cars telling her to get off the road, “Well screw you too!!” she yelled back at them, having lived in Castelia City, you got used to yelling at people you barely knew for no reason…<br />
<br />
She was all gun hoe to chase after them, ignoring her brain telling her she would never be able to catch them by foot, she was all set to release a Pokémon she figured might be of some help when a hand grabbed her by the shoulder. Upset, by whoever sent her the note and drove off, Liza twirled around clearly angry at the world. <i>Why do people like Dana and Oscar have to suffer like this!</i><br />
<br />
When she turned around she came face to face with a handsome, much older man, his style of clothing seemed familiar to a man she had heard about when she volunteered at a Police Station as an operator during a summer off of college…a man who worked for the international police. Looker.<br />
<br />
“Who do you think you are, stopping me like that?” Liza yelled out trying not to make a scene, as the gentlemen modestly went to fetch her pup from the middle of the street so not to cause a driver to want to run it over. <i>How dare he pick up my Snubbull!</i> she thought, holding back her tongue, <i>Pokemon are pets, if they want to be picked up, they'll ask to be.</i><br />
<br />
At first he seemed to be friendly enough until he began to ask burning questions that made the lass trainer rather wary to answer them… so she decided to ask some questions of her own.<br />
<br />
“You got 10 seconds to tell me who you are pretty boy and what you know before I have the Snubbull you got there <b>Bite</b> your hands clean off!” she said as her Snubbull was now baring it’s fangs at the man after feeding off of her frustration. <br />
<br />
“Snub!!” the Snubbull barked.<br />

<br />
<b><u>Boreal Wastelands</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Treepandaone</u>:</b> Fighting through exhaustion, you manage to collect a single partner to make up for the loss of Deckard and Psyduck. Shieldon's Pokeball is successfully retrieved, just in time before your body gives out completely. You don't know how long you'll be allowed to sleep, but you'll take whatever you can get...<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
A grip around your left arm, tight enough that it snaps you out of your slumber... You jolt up, startled, and look around in alarm. What you find, fortunately, is a familiar face - Jacob. The camp leader smiles at you and holds out a heavy-looking brown coat.<br />
<br />
- Sorry to wake you up, but it's time to go hunting. Show'em what you can do.<br />
<br />
Groggily, you take the coat from Jacob's hands and put it on; you get up, grab Shieldon's Ball and follow the other man outside. You squint instinctively, expecting your still-sleepy eyes to be burned by the morning sunlight, but... there's no sun at all. Of course... the sky is still jet-black and lifeless. You wonder what it feels like to live in a place like this for months on end, with barely any notion of time, with nothing around you but a handful of other hopeless people... and Shards. Perhaps that soul-crushing reality is what warped Drummond's views of the world; perhaps this is the &quot;real world&quot; to him because all other realities seem distant as a dream. With nothing to hold on to, when maddening silence is the lesser of two evils, it's bound to tamper with anyone's sanity, let alone an older man's.<br />
<br />
- Really bringin' that one along then? I'm not saving his ass again. That's on you today.<br />
<br />
You don't even have to look to know who that voice belongs to. Daryl, the one that was with Jacob yesterday... the one who hit you and has been against your presence in the camp from the start. But also the owner of a Magneton and no doubt an invaluable member of this hunting party...<br />
<br />
- You've seen what he can do. He's coming along, no questions asked; we're undermanned as it is. Drummond, ready to go?<br />
<br />
You didn't notice him at first, but there he is - the old man from the canteen, wrapped in a large hooded blue coat. He sticks out like a sore thumb in the pristine white fields of the boreal Wasteland, but then again, you never want to lose track of your scout. Besides, you're all dressed in brown, is that really any better?<br />
<br />
- Ready when you are, boys. There's been some movement down west, and I reckon I spotted Piloswine trails the last time we went out there. Short of a Mamoswine herd, it doesn't get any better than that!<br />
<br />
Jacob nodded and motioned for the group to head for the snowmobiles by the front gate. After a quick check, you count seven of you in total: Yourself, Jacob, Daryl, Drummond and three others you've never seen before. Seven people responsible for the livelihood of the entire camp...<br />
<br />
- We're ready. Guys, you know what to do. Matthew, you ride with me.<br />
<br />
Drummond hops on a vehicle of his own, and the other split off into pairs. You wonder how wise it is to have the old man ride all alone, but you figure they've been doing this for long enough to know what works. Jacob jumps on one of the snowmobiles and you sit right behind him; shortly afterwards the gate opens, and the party rides off into the frozen wasteland.<br />
<br />
For some reason, it doesn't feel anywhere as inhospitable as it did just yesterday. The wind is just as cold and the landscape is just as desolate, lifeless and silent, but this time you're not alone, and that makes all the difference in the world. You have your reservations about these people, as anyone would, but there's no denying that without Jacob and Daryl you might not have survived the encounter with those Shards, and their company is at least more reassuring than being by yourself. Even if Daryl in particular would have left you to die, if it was up to him.<br />
<br />
- This might be something you're not used to. If we find those Piloswine, it won't be a regular battle... we'll fight to kill. It's the only way we can provide enough food for everyone. When the time comes, I beg that you don't hesitate; it might go against your morals, just like it went against mine, but sustenance is hard enough to ensure as it is.<br />
<br />
You ponder on Jacob's words while catching a glimpse of a single Pokeball attached to his belt, beneath the brown overcoat. He might be the leader, but it seems even he is short on Pokemon to lead the camp with. You can't help but wonder if his other partners fell to the Shards... becoming Shards themselves.<br />
<br />
- Psyduck and Porygon had to remain monitored. The whole thing's a slow process, we can't take any risks. If either of them was infected in that struggle, we... we can't risk having a Shard forming inside Hiel. With all the untrained people we're housing, it'd be a massacre. I promise you'll be reunited with your partners as soon as we're done.<br />
<br />
You've been riding for a while now. In the distance, you spot Drummond's snowmobile coming to a halt and the old man waving at the group following him. The entire party gets off their vehicles and silently walk over to the designated scout. Drummond points to what seem to be tiny brown speckles on the horizon; squinting, you realize it's actually a herd of Piloswine, seemingly eight in total.<br />
<br />
- Hah, what did I tell you boys?! And it seems we'll have it easier on our conscience - there are no Swinub among them!<br />
<br />
All five men in brown coats reach for a Pokeball; Drummond seems to be the only one lacking a partner. The three hunters you don't know call out a Grumpig, Gligar and Stoutland. Daryl calls out his Magneton, as expected... and lastly Jacob calls out his only Pokemon: an imposing Blaziken.<br />
<br />
- Please remember what I told you. It's for the good of the camp. We don't need to slaughter the whole pack, but we can't come back empty-handed.<br />
<br />
Jacob turns to his crew and gives the signal to strike. Perfectly coordinated, Trainers and their Pokemon prepare to engage the eight Piloswine...<br />
<br />
What do you do? </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: lightblue"><div style="text-align: center"><i>“Ah, yes... I was wondering what would break first... <br />
Your spirit, or your body”</i>&#8203;</div><br />
Fleeting sleep vanished as quickly as it had arrived; the veteran Pokémon trainer woke unceremoniously from his dreams of home to awaken once more in the pit of despair he had found himself in. How long he had gotten was a mystery, but his tired bag-ridden eyes and slumbering headache told him not nearly enough. Time was wearing on the trainer, it was not too long ago such vampestrial feats of advenure were welcomed by his young body as mere play, but now in his “old” age for a Pokémon trainer deep sleep was almost as much as necessity. He could see now why others his age had retired from the game to become more senior members of the Pokémon community. He brushed aside his ego's qualm of self-reliance, wondering how even older members than he, Drummond to name but one, could cope with the rigors of survival. Had he become lazy in self-indulgence? His awakening, a firm grip on the arm and a proactive look by Jacob, groggily brought Matthew back to reality and away from dreams collected during his absence from adventuring. He quickly rubbed sleep from his eyes, acclimatizing his eyes back to the low dim light-bulb hanging steadfast from the ceiling, providing the strangest light to wake up to. <br />
<br />
“it's time to go hunting”<br />
<br />
Jacob spoke in a calm and collected manner, giving the trainer some semblance of encouragement along with it. He nodded and let out a groan, as much as he could manage on such little sleep, before gratefully taking the heavy brown coat offered to him. Slipping into it, and taking a second to adjust to it's actual, surprising, weight, Matthew grabbed the shiny silver Premier Ball Shieldon was housed in, thanking Arceus he had managed a withdrawal at all. Following Jacob out of the compound, Matthew braced himself for the bright light he knew would be there, waiting as punishment for a lack of sleep.<br />
<br />
… none came.<br />
<br />
One eye winced open first, before the other soon followed as he glared up at the sky. The same pure-black, starless, lightless, lifeless surroundings bore down on him as if not a second had passed since he went back inside. Perhaps his judgement of Drummond was harsh; such quality of life without a notion of time passing must be almost torturous, as if Groundhog Day had trapped a person not in a secluded town but a living hell; barely scraping by and surrounded by foul beasts that exasperated doom with every step. Matthew knew he would have to find something to hold on to, a relic of the real word, to stop him from slipping down the slope towards never-ending madness in such a cruel place. Heavy heart. Regret. Remorse. Any weakness here would be a death sentence.<br />
<br />
“Really bringin' that one along then? I'm not saving his ass again.”<br />
<br />
Daryl's words hurt as Matthew's bit his tongue, ignoring the only other trainer he had seen since his arrival. Jacob reasserted the claim he was to join the hunting party, but Matthew's mind raced with tempers flaring should it go unsuccessful. How the group would accommodate him should he fail to catch food was questionable, and fighting Daryl, even verbally, would surely only increase the chance of ostracisation.<br />
<br />
Up ahead, Drummond's large blue hoodie signalled him from the rest of the party, his colourful figure creating a clear juxtaposition from the white snow littered on the grounds of the Boreal Wasteland. Matthew glanced around such an expanse with awe, wondering if any other life forms lived out here but Shards, humans and their now combined prey. Could there have been another civilization that lived amongst the land. The distance was great, the chance low, but his heart longed for some hope. Forever the optimist. Drummond's keen eye suggested some movement to the west, and his knowledge of tracking pinpointed potential Piloswine; the meaty mammoth-esque creatures a callback to ancestors long past who ensured the survival of their genes through persistence hunting, an epi-genetic feat Matthew could only hope would rise when he needed it most. Jacob called the group together onto snowmobiles like a true leader, swarming the “pack” together. The engines roared into life, giving a mechanically suitable soundtrack on their descent into battle. Jacob called Matthew over to sit behind him, the trainer obliging willingly as the newly-accepted rookie in a pack of what seemed coherently tight group – a tiger pack on the prowl.<br />
<br />
But … these were just scientists. Matthew's mind conjured great images of conquerors but before the tragedy that befell the camp he wondered if many would have been considered geeks. He looked around at his compatriots. They must have been tough to survive so long, but there are only a hand-full of Indiana Jones' out there. Fewer still Alan Grants. And what mental state could such people harvest over time? He had already seen the ill effects of Drummond, who seemed not to fight for food but merely scout the scene. It was surely a dangerous job, filled with sadness and regret for all the faces who didn't make it back to camp, but the act of bloodshed was not on his hands; not haunting his mind. Matthew had to trust the stability of the group, but the fine line of savagery and cruelty was a thin one, and resentment soon builds like a boiling pot.<br />
<br />
“we'll fight to kill” “don't hesitate” “against your morals”<br />
<br />
Dotted phrases from Jacob's windswept, and frankly hard to hear, speech as they sped along the Boreal Wasteland cut through Matthew's suspicions like a knife. Deep down he knew he would need to kill his own food here, but he had never really done it before. Was it hypocritical of him, as a meat eater, to never have experienced the act of killing? Memories flooded back, flashing his very first adventure in Fizzy Bubbles, where he <a href="http://forums.upnetwork.net/showpost.php?p=76194&amp;postcount=129" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.upnetwork.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D76194%26postcount%3D129&amp;hash=5c4381103c02ccd7e9e627d517b11854" rel="nofollow noopener">almost killed a Shinx</a>. A psychic block saw his enemy in front of him, but the brutality was still inside him, brewing. He thought he was protecting, but it all stemmed from anger and hate. Leaving Rocket-occupied Viridian had left him bitter and twisted towards the world, going out of his way to maim and destroy. He even disregarded the safety of innocence when he <a href="http://www.serebiiforums.com/showthread.php?380899-Cortoza-s-Recorded-History&amp;p=11840846#post11840846" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.serebiiforums.com%2Fshowthread.php%3F380899-Cortoza-s-Recorded-History%26p%3D11840846%23post11840846&amp;hash=5343338cc5b9e9a117a5eee79b022ea5" rel="nofollow noopener">blew up a Team Rocket trade ship</a> without even once thinking of the consiquences. He had still never returned to Cortoza, fearful of finding a plaque dedicated to those who lost their lives in his negligence. Was evil really as black and white as he had thought? Was pure denial creating a veilwhich he couldn't see past?<br />
<br />
“Psyduck and Porygon had to remain monitored. The whole thing's a slow process, we can't take any risks. If either of them was infected in that struggle, we... we can't risk having a Shard forming inside Hiel. I promise you'll be reunited with your partners as soon as we're done”<br />
<br />
An empty promise brought Matthew no further comfort from his spiralling depression. Jacob was a man with just one remaining Pokéball left on his belt, and the implication was a man of his calibre could've housed a full team … and more from the inbox system; just how many had fallen was an insensitive question, and just how many he personally put down was another he daren't ask. If Psyduck or Porygon showed the slightest sign of transforming into a shard they would be “put down” for the good of the camp, and what's worse is their trainer wouldn't even be there to say goodbye at their last conscious moments. All they would know if the master who abandoned them to be tested on then killed. He knew Hiel wouldn't hesitate. They had been through enough for morals to fall by the wayside, just like he did after Viridian.<br />
<br />
The snowmobiles slowed to a halt as Matthew saw Drummond waving his arms, calling for the others to do the same. Taking up a position in the rear, Matthew followed the group as silently as he could muster to the scout's position.<br />
<br />
*crunch* *crunch* *crunch*<br />
<br />
He walked backwards, attempting to spot any danger but he had poor visibility. His walking felt … uncomfortable. His shoes impacted off the snow unlike the others, as if he was wearing cloggs. His brain begun to sting as he questioned how a trained soldier could be outmatched by scientists in the art of sneaking.<br />
<br />
“Hah, what did I tell you boys?! And it seems we'll have it easier on our conscience - there are no Swinub among them!”<br />
<br />
Eight brown Piloswine-shaped dots littered the backdrop as Matthew turned to look at the party, his stomach on the verge of growling and his lips on the verge of salivating. Bread and soup was all good but a Piloswine steak sounded mighty tasty right now.<br />
<br />
“Please remember what I told you. It's for the good of the camp. We don't need to slaughter the whole pack, but we can't come back empty-handed.”<br />
<br />
Jacob delivered his final piece of advice as Matthew nodded, appreciating the company of other equally well trained looking Pokémon on either side of him. Having usually called on his Pokémon with a flair, Matthew mood called for a more sombre release; merely tapping the Pokéball close to the ground and letting the bright light dissipate into Shieldon's usual form. Taking the Heart Container bracelet from his bulldozer Pokémon, Matthew bent down and replaced it with the Heat Rock Drummond had given him the night previous. Strapping it to the back of Shieldon at his weakest point behind his head, Matthew gave him a weak smile, as if still morally conflicted.<br />
<br />
“Hey buddy, sorry to call you into this mess. We're going to battle to kill alright? No unnecessary damage to the surrounding area, we don't need to attract any <i>unwanted</i> attention.” the trainer explained, “<b>Flash Cannon</b> one of the Piloswine that the group targets. Then continue with a <b>Rock Blast</b>. If you get charged <b>Counter</b> it, but if not spit a glob of <b>Toxic</b> on the ground as a warning to the others”<br />
<br />
He considered Shieldon's arsenal before deducting a few moves; any loud noise-based attacks and scenery movers could trigger the Shards to sense their presence, and the presence of 8 other potential victims, and he Matthew's plan was to avoid ever seeing another shard, if it could be helped. He also came to the realization that in his sleep-deprived state, he hadn't considered Shieldon's weight and inability to stand in snow. What effects a battle may have on getting his Pokémon stuck and vulnerable he wasn't sure, but as the only suitable candidate who wasn't weak to ice, and perhaps had a chance of deflecting the Shard's turning power with his large shield-like face, he was probably the only real option.<br />
<br />
Whatever happened, he was worried. Scared. The most scared he had ever been during his travels...</span> <br />
