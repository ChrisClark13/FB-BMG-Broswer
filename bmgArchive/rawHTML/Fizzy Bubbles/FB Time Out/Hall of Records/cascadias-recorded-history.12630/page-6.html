<span style="color: teal">Skrusti and Joshua: Giving your orders to your Pokemon, they quickly nod and begin to move into action, seeing that both they and the Gyarados are beginning to wear out from the battle. As Hayley remains suspended motionless in midair, Tifa opens its mouth wide, a flurry of small green particles bursting forth and striking the Gyarados's hide, causing it to roar in pain as it quickly turns its attention from Hayley to Tifa. Hayley drops a few feet before it can regain control of its wings, circling back up to gain altitude. Opening its mouth, several Sludge Bombs begin to float through the air toward the Gyarados, who has its sights set on Tifa and Jamie, sending a gushing stream of water from its mouth in the form of a Hydro Pump at the pair, though they manage to dodge it in just the nick of time. <br />
<br />
The sludge bombs then make contact with the giant Gyarados, exploding across the back of its head. Turning around to face its attacker, it finds that it is nowhere to be found, having Faint Attacked behind its head, causing it to become slightly confused. However, Jamie begins to swim toward the Gyarados as electrical energy begins to gather in one of Tifa's fists, while one of Hayley's fists also begin to glow with crackling yellow electrical energy, both the signs of a Thunder Punch attack. As they move in toward the Gyarados, the Gyarados turns around to find its opponents but it is much too late for it to react, as both Hayley and Tifa unload their Punch attacks on the Gyarados, who roars in pain, shaking its head and gritting its teeth as the electricity courses through the water types body. It falls down into the water, and for a brief moment, it appears as though you had won. However, after a few seconds the Gyarados rises from the water again, looking extremely beaten, having only just Endured the attacks it had sustained. What will you do to finish it off?</span>

<span style="color: teal">Jeff watched as the trio of Pokemon continued to attack the behemoth Gyarados, who roared in pain as the moves struck their marks again and again. Jeff was a little worried when the Gyarados used its <b>Hydro Pump</b>, but Jamie, and in essence Tifa, evaded the attack at the last second.<br />
<br />
Jeff let out a cheer as Tifa and Hayley assaulted the Gyarados with a double whammy of <b>Thunderpunch</b>, and as the two swam towards him, he thought of something to quickly put the giant down. Strategies raced in his head, and when the two arrived, he held up a hand to show he wasn't ready to give orders yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right...that thing'll probably be dangerous to get close to, so let's stay away from it and barrage it from long range. Tifa, hit it with a few more <b>Bullet Seed</b>s, if you're able, <b>Mega Drain</b>.&quot; Tifa nodded, her breathing still light, not having done much this battle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jamie, concentrate on evading anything it might try to throw at you. Uh...Hit it with a <b>Water Pulse</b> or two if you get the chance. But your job firstly and foremost is to dodge, got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie also nodded, and began to move slowly back towards Gyarados. Jeff looked on, hoping that most of the fight was out of this thing. He also wondered what had caused it to grow in size, and what had caused it to go so berserk...</span>

<br />
Joshua's mind wandered, wondering what could drive a Pokemon to such extremes... and whether anything was controlling this menace. &quot;Hayley dear,&quot; he whispered, &quot;just in case Jeff's plan doesn't work, a Shock Wave after Jeff's done should be enough to end this.&quot;</span></div>

<span style="color: darkorchid"><b>Lonely Wanderer:</b> Deciding to head toward the middle tunnel rather than one of the other ones which showed no indication of anything interesting that lied within them. Ducking your head as you enter the tunnel, you find yourself in a room, smaller than the last one. You see a boy, no older than 15, with his Quilava, who appears to be using a barrage of different fire attacks against a Grimer, who winces in pain as the flames make contact with it. Sighing and realizing that the orange light, which had held so much promise for an adventure, was simply a Pokemon.<br />
<br />
The boy looks up at you for a second, before he shakes his head, ordering his Quilava to use a Flamethrower attack on the Grimer. Watching interestedly, you suddenly are surprised as a cold sensation is felt on the back of your leg. Quickly turning around in surprise, you see another Grimer, looking up at you interestedly. What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DarkOrchid">As the 16-year-old female walked through the light, Andrea was met with a rather disappointing sight: a Pokémon battle between a wild Grimer and a boy's Quilava. Sighing, Andrea folded her arms, Karasa wimpering as she realized the illusion of light was only balls of fire that flickered in life for a few seconds.<br />
<br />
The young male did noticed the newcomer, but he didn't speak to the trainer, as he continued to give orders to his trusted companion. As Andrea observed the battle, she felt some cold liquid on the back of her leg, and spinning around, she found herself looking at another Grimer; luckily, this one didn't seem to want to battle anyhow at the moment. It cocked his head slightly, looking at the trainer interestly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...&quot; Andrea whispered, uncertain whenever to speak. But, deciding that it didn't pose much threat to her, she squated down, Karasa landing on her head as she made small noises to herself. &quot;Hello there, Grimer. I'm Andrea.&quot;<br />
<br />
Feeling rather embarassing and weird, Andrea sighed as she glanced at the boy battling, before turning back to the Grimer. &quot;Well, it was nice to meet you, young fellow, but I really don't have a purpose here, so I need to leave. Sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Getting back up, she started to exit out of the cave, looking back at the battle once more before making her way out, patting the Grimer on its head.</span></span></div>

Realizing that Beedrill's Rage is building as its attacks land, the Vulpix moves quickly to attack again to hopefully finish off its opponent soon, before the Beedrill's attacks became even more powerful.<br />
<br />
Opening its mouth wide, a gust of superheated air rushes forth, aimed directly at the yellow and black bug. The Beedrill cries out in pain as the air rushes over its body, but it still holds on, quickly flying downward at Vulpix, ready to strike. Remembering your commands, Drought waits. The Beedrill swings its needle, striking Vulpix hard and sending it flying sideways a few feet, causing it to miss its attempted strike on Beedrill. What will you do?</span></span>

After the bar fills completely, the screen changes to the following:<br />
<br />
Thank you for completing your registration for the Brine Island Gym Challenge. There are currently <b>0</b> trainers in front of you in the queue to battle this gym leader. When the above counter reaches <b>0</b>, please enter one of the elevators and exit at the field labelled <b>Ruin Island Battling Field - Sub-Level 5.</b> The Gym Leader has received notice and awaits your challenge. <br />
<br />
Scanning the area with your eyes, you see several elevators lined up against a far wall. Walking over to them, you push down arrow button and wait until one of the opaque doors of an elevator opens. Walking in, you wait in the empty elevator as it begins to sink downward, the light above the door switching from G to -1, -2, -3, -4, and finally -5. Stepping out of the elevator, you walk down a short hallway before you walk through a sliding door. <br />
<br />
Before you, a room you estimate at about 50ft x 50ft x75ft completely filled with a light fog stands. You make out a figure on the opposite end of the field and as the door shuts behind you, a harsh voice calls out to you, &quot;I see that you are my only challenger as of now. Very interesting, though not surprising, as you are my first challenger in quite some time...But I digress. My name is Claire, and our battle shall be a 3 on 3 single one, with no switching allowed. I shall send out my Houndoom first.&quot; In a flash of light, the form of a Houndoom appears in the middle of the field. &quot;Who shall you send out, then?&quot;</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Silver">Taking a deep breath, James faced the Gym Leader, eyes narrowed and face set in a determined expression. He'd been waiting for this, his first badge, for a long time. One month ago, a traveller had faced James ina battle. Dangerous to everyone involved, violent, and overall the best battle he had ever had, James had to question what the other trainer had that made his pokemon so powerful. The opposing trainer had shrugged, and with wisdom before his years - about twenty, if James had to guess - he had answered. &quot;When two people battle, it's the thrill of victory both want to get.&quot; A wistful look had appeared on the man's face. &quot;When I was a Gym Leader, nothing was more exciting than a battle, every time a challenger came I'd do all I could to keep my badges... and that's what it came down to to me. Protecting my badge, my honor. It gave me a will to win, and I did - every battle, all the time. You want to know why you couldn't beat me?&quot; The man had chuckled. &quot;Experience. Get some. Face some other Gym Leaders, but if you ever want a rematch make a name for yourself. I'll seek you out.&quot;<br />
<br />
And since that day, James had trained twice as hard, fought with triple the will, and had begun to start winning. It was something he was unaccustomed to, but an incredible feeling came with it.<br />
<br />
And so, James wished to keep winning. And if taking down this Leader would get him one step closer to battling and defeating the trainer who had earned his respect, so be it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; James called, &quot;Let's do this.&quot; In a flash, a pokeball has in his right hand, gripped tightly. He was tempted to send out Kodou, his golduck, but that took away the point of the battle... where was the rush in winning if the opponent had a handicap. He wanted a true battle, and so he would do his damnest to fight fairly. His magmar was a no, would absorb all fire attacks... his gengar, no, too high level... that left only his steel types. James grinned. <i>So be it.</i> &quot;Necross, I choose you!&quot;<br />
<br />
In a torrent of red energy, the pokeball flew from James' hand, flying into the middle of the arena, a huge snake began to emerge. Its body spiked, and its jaw enormous, it fit the description of only one pokemon: steelix. <br />
<br />
<i>Type advantage,</i> snorted James, <i>what good's that when Necross is that big...</i><br />
<br />
The solemn faced steelix grunted for orders, his head crouched down, facing the houndoom straight on. James grimaced. <i>No need to get distracted,</i> he told himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, start off by Slamming into the thing, then Binding it as fast as you can. Once you have it cornered and trapped, do a very close range Dragon Breath - focus it all on the houndoom... no need to be nervous.&quot;<br />
<br />
The last part was more to himself than anyone else. No need to let anyone know that, though...<br />
<br />
And so the battle began.<br />

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px">Waterlight and Jon Jen: You've been removed from the zone for not replying to 2 consecutive updates. Unless I've made a mistake, in which you're free to correct me.<br />
<br />
I apologize for the delay.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorange"><b>Nash MOMO:</b> Giving your orders to Braids, your Bannette(? - plz have a link to your regi in your sig), it nods, glaring at the Mightyena. Ready to prove that type isn't everything, Braids holds its hands, palm facing, a few inches apart, a glowing, spiralling orb of golden-orange energy beginning to form in midair. The Mightyena's eyes narrow, as it begins to sprint across the room, its mouth filled with potent dark energy as it begins to ready a Crunch attack. However, just as the Mightyena lunges for its prey, the ghost type suddenly disappears from view, reappearing behind the dark dog of doom and unleashing its full destructive power, the Hyper Beam attack sending the Mightyena forward into a stone wall. <br />
<br />
Striking it hard, the Mightyena falls to the floor. It shakily gets up, turning to face the Banette with a renewed hatred, its red eyes becoming more intense as the dog's mouth opens wide, a crackling ball of black-purple energy forming and flying across the room, the Shadow Ball missing Banette by only a few inches. Banette appears to be extremely tired after that first round - will that affect your battle strategy?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorange"><b>Ichimaru:</b> Sending out the rest of your Pokemon as you give the Ralts your choice, it does a somersault in midair as it shouts out gleefully, &quot;I'll be it!&quot; <br />
<br />
Before it has the chance to utter another word, however, things go terribly wrong. Bounding of seemingly nowhere comes a huge Mightyena, almost double the size of a normal one. It lunges forward, sinking its teeth deep into the Ralts before it turns and walks back the way it came, dropping the Ralts at the feet of a large man who seems to have appeared out of nowhere, just like the Mightyena. Most of his body is shrouded in shadows - you can't make out any features or anything. The Ralts can only telepathically send one word to you before the man throws a jet black Pokeball at it, &quot;Help.&quot; As the ball strikes the weakened Ralts who had seemingly been taking out by the single attack by Mightyena, the psychic type is transformed into black energy before being sucked in, retreating to the man.<br />
<br />
He stands there for a moment, simply staring at you. You can't help but feel as though he is looking through you, into you, reading your thoughts. A small smile comes to the man's face as you stand there, and he says to you in a harsh voice, &quot;Yes, let's see how powerful you are against the powers of darkness.&quot; He throws the ball onto the ground, and what comes out is nothing like what went in to the ball seconds before.<br />
<br />
The Ralt's eyes are a bright crimson, the blue energy that had surrounded it now red as well. The white parts of its body have been changed to a smoky gray, the lime green turned to a deep green color, darkening in shade. The man then turns to you, &quot;Well, which of those do you intend to use?&quot; as he gestures to your Pokemon.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorange"><b>Jerichi:</b> You give orders to Smokestack, who nods as it begins to carry out its attacking orders. It points its head upwards, sending a beam of bright orange energy skyward, causing the clouds to clear and the sun to shine brightly. In the mean time, however, a crackling, spiralling beam of ghost energy forms in front of Haunter, sending the half-charged Shadow Ball at Smokestack as the Sunny Day finishes. The ball explodes upon contact, doing good damage to the fire type Pokemon. Shrugging it off, Smokestack opens its mouth wide, sending another stream of flames outward that wrap around Haunter in the form of a vortex. After a few seconds, the flames fade away into nothingness, and the Haunter looks homicidally onto Smokestack. Haunter's eyes turn a smoky gray as it uses another attack, cutting its HP as it places a Curse onto Smokestack, who is completely defenseless against the telekinetic-esque attack with its Endure attack. Seems as though you don't have as long as you'd like to finish the battle as the Curse is robbing Smokestack of its health and energy, but Haunter did sacrifice a lot of health and energy - perhaps that could be a ray of hope in your situation?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorchid"><b>John's Knight:</b> You give your orders to Forte, who nods, ready to take down its opponent, before it has a chance to do anything to it. Forte glows with sandy-brown ground energy as it jumps into the air, coming down on the ground, sending shockwaves through the ground. The ground violently shakes as the Ursaring loses its footing, falling to the ground with a thud. Its eyes narrowing again, the Ursaring's fist glows a bright cerulean as it sprints across the ground, slamming its fist into the rock/ground type and doing good damage with its Ice Punch attack. Taking the hit, Forte clinches its teeth, enduring the super effective strike. As the attack ends, Forte's mouth opens wide, a spiralling orb of golden-orange energy beginning to form, quickly spawning a devestating beam which races across the field, striking into Ursaring with a violent amount of force, sending it staggering backwards several feet before slamming into a tree. <br />
<br />
The Ursaring falls forward, taking one last look of hatred at you and Forte, before closing its eyes on the battle, having been defeated. Level up for Forte! Now, what will you do? Will you continue to explore the area? Or will you attempt to find a way to one of the other islands of the Cascadia archipelago?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorchid"><b>Lonely Wanderer:</b> Disappointed after the uneventful first attempt to find something interesting, you walk back out of the tunnel, back to the main room where the tunnels had gone their different ways. However, as soon as you step out of the tunnel, you hear a shriek of pain coming from in front of you. You run forward and through the dim light of the tunnel, you see a Taillow shaking in fear as a large Seviper stares down on it, looking to have every intention of sinking its teeth into the small bird for its dinner. Seeing you appear behind it, the Taillow quickly jets up into the air, perching on your shoulder as it looks at you with pleading eyes to help it. The Seviper, on the other hand, doesn't look to concerned about your presence, begins to circle you, as if pondering the best way to get at the Taillow. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: deepskyblue"><b>thed3:</b>You and your Caterpie enter the elevator with Aaron, before it ascends to the top of the crater, turning around and showing the lake. However, it already looked as though it had changed drastically in the few moments in which you were gone. Many more Pokemon lie on the beach, being tended to by the Nurse Joy and the assistants that she brought with her. You and Aaron begin to help them transport the Pokemon, putting them onto stretchers which are connected to several Pidgeot and Swellow, which lift the Pokemon off the beach and disappear into the distance, where it would be assumed a medical facility was located. <br />
<br />
After a bit of this, the elevator behind you whirred into life as it opens, a tall, older man with white hair walking out. Nurse Joy rushes over to him as soon as she spots him, and quickly says, &quot;It's happening again.&quot; A grave look comes over his face as his fears are proven true, looking to the ground before looking back at the water, a look of confidence coming over him. &quot;I want you to get a the Hydros team in there, search every little bit possible. Then if you're able to find a specimen, have it transported to me immediately by the one who captures it - these are fragile creatures, if they were to touch the side of a container, they would die.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nurse Joy nods, walking over to one of the walls of the crater near a small building, and putting her hand on a button, causing the rock wall to open a small bit, revealing a Pokemon transport device. She quickly begins to type, and several Pokeballs appear, which she tosses onto the beach, each opening to reveal a Golduck. They quickly go into action, holding their left arms out as their eyes glow blue, the water quickly rising in front of each of them and turning into a midair stream of water, which comes to a few inches in front of each of their faces before the water does a U-turn, returning to the lake in an endless cycle.<br />
<br />
The man seems to just notice you now, coming over to you, saying, &quot;Hydrokinesis...what a powerful thing. But no, that's not the point at the moment. I'm Dr. Rapson of the Hedland Research Center on Brine Island. We study the rare and elusive Irondi Tentacool as our main focus. They are no larger than a fingernail, but their venom can be deadly if not treated. No one's ever been able to capture one in order to create an antidote...but we may be lucky this time.<br />
<br />
Just as he says this, one of the Golduck call out. Rushing over to it, the man shouts, &quot;Yes, we've found one!&quot; He turns to you, saying &quot;I have to get this back to the lab immediately. Would you like to come with me, or would you rather stay here?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: green"><b>Alilatias:</b> You give your Pokemon their orders, and they give responses of recognition before they move into action. Falzter begins to use Focus Energy, and the other two Swellow mimic his actions, also using Focus Energy. As Faltzer begins to form a ball of glowing purple ghost energy in front of it, the other two Swellow nod to each other, figuring that the situation is under control with the Electabuzz, and they both begin a sky dive, directly at Magcargo. Saito begins to twirl around on its left foot, beginning to raise its attack and speed, the Swords Dance probably being a good idea against the opponent Magcargo, who needs to be dealt with swiftly to prevent any more damage being done.<br />
<br />
Faltzer ends its charging, and releases the Shadow Ball against the Electabuzz, whose prongs had began to glow with electrical energy, facing the two wild Swellow. Completely unsuspecting, it is hit hard in the left side by the Shadow Ball, and it is lifted from its feet, being thrown into a nearby tree as it faints. Level up for Faltzer. As the four Pokemon now begin their assault on the single opponent. The man stares at you, and says &quot;Why this isn't really fair, is it?&quot; He sighs, before he holds out his hand, stepping in front of the magma Pokemon, shaking his head. &quot;I accept defeat. However, I must warn you, we will be back. That amulet is ours.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man turns around, recalling his Electabuzz and Magcargo. He disappears into the forest. Looking around, you see the two Swellow and Faltzer making sure that the others are all right, before Faltzer retreats to your shoulder. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: green"><b>Centin:</b> You give your orders to Axtan, who nods as it continues its assault against the Machamp. It disappears in a flash of light, reappearing about 10 feet above the Machamp's head in the air. The Machamp looks upward as Axtan's eyes crackle with ghost energy, a dual attack descending upon the Machamp, who nimbly dodges the attack before opening its mouth wide, a stream of flame rushing forth and striking the psychic bird, doing a decent amount of damage upon contact, and slightly scorching Axtan. Recovering quickly, Axtan flies upwards before it begins a dive-bomb, smacking into the powerful fighting type before it has a chance to react, and doing a very good amount of damage. The Machamp glares at you and Axtan as the round of battle draws to a close, looking tired as though another powerful hit such as that could take it out easily. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: green"><b>Dark Fire:</b> Continuing your assault on the Beedrill, you decide to change your strategy in hope that this battle will end faster. Vulpix becomes covered in a black aura before it jets forward, striking into the Beedrill quickly before it has a chance to dodge. Before Beedrill has a chance to begin an attack, Drought's eyes glow blue, hypnotic waves rushing over Beedrill, and forcing it to fall asleep into a deep slumber...<br />
<br />
Wishing the Beedrill all the worst, Drought closes its eyes for a few moments before the Beedrill violently shudders. Drought smiles evilly as the Nightmare takes effect, beginning to drain the opponent bug's energy, leaving it looking in a rather poor shape...What will you do now?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: green"><b>Dark Scizor:</b> You give your orders to the Growlithe and to Rakdos. They both nod before they move into action in order to carry out their attacks. The Growlithe begins to glow yellow as it transfers attacking power to Rakdos, whose coat glints in its newfound power. Raising its power even more, Rakdos begins to focus its energy, closing its eyes as it commences the attack. In the meantime, Ariados's eyes glow blue as the leaves on the ground between you and it begin to quickly rush toward you as a tidal wave of Psychic force rushes over Rakdos and Growlithe, who are both sent backward a few feet as the attack hits them. Growlithe opens its mouth, a burst of flame rushing outward toward Ariados, who quickly moves into action, using a burst of Agility to dodge the attack, the Flamethrower hitting a tree which bursts into flame. <br />
<br />
Rakdos, done focusing its energy, begins to fly toward the Ariados to strike it, prepared to use its Wing Attack. However, the Ariados spits a sticky white thread from its mouth, wrapping up Rakdos in a Spider Web, falling to the ground as it attempts to rid its body of the sticky webbing which covers its wings. The Ariados has proven itself a formidible foe with only one round of battle - what will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: green"><b>quilava plush:</b> You give your orders to your Noctowl, who nods as it begin hovers in place for a few seconds as the Hypno turns toward you. The draining of the sleeping Pokemon halts as it turns toward you, glaring as it prepares for battle. As Kagami sends a series of Hypnotic waves Hypno's way in its Hypnosis attack, the Hypno reacts quickly, waving its arm in front of it as an opaque golden shield appears in front of it as its eyes begin to glow a deep gold color, shielding its eyes and breaking eye contact. The shield fades with the attack, and Hypno's eyes again turn the deep golden color as it punches the ground with its fist, large, golden needles of energy rising from the ground. Kagami avoids them easily before it sits in place for a few seconds, using its Substitute attack.<br />
<br />
Its eyes set on the Substitute which Kagami had just made, the Hypno's eyes turn the odd color once again as it holds its hands a few inches apart, a ball of golden energy forming which flies across the field into the Substitute. The ball explodes with an amazing amount of force upon contact, causing the Sub to be shredded to pieces, falling to the ground before disappearing. A smirk appearing on the psychic type's face, you return it as Kagami sends a fully powered Shadow Ball its way, smacking it in the back of the head as it explodes with its super effective fury, sending Hypno flying face first forward a good bit. It rises to its feet rather shakily. It seems as though this Hypno is not like a normal one. The whole golden energy thing is defintely different, while it hasn't used any of the Pokemon's normal Psychic type attacks. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: green"><b>Torkoal Stu and Joe:</b> You each give your orders to your Pokemon, hoping to be able to take down this opposing Arbok as quickly as you possibly can. Lily attacks first, its right fist glowing a bright cerulean as it punches into the Arbok, ice beginning to crystallize in the area of the strike. Glaring at the grass/water type, Arbok's mouth opens wide, a series of small white needles rushing forth and striking Lily, doing rather good damage with the Poison Sting attack. Not to be deterred, Lily shakes its head, several Razor Leaves bursting free and flying at Arbok at the same time when Joe's Dunsparce joins the action, sending a Water Pulse attack at the snake. Both attacks manage to hit the poison type, doing good damage, and putting it on its last figurative legs.<br />
<br />
Lily and Dunsparce then begin to carry out their next orders, Water Gun and Ice Beam respectively. Lily sends the high pressured stream of water at the snake at the same time that Dunsparce creates a crackling ball of ice energy which spawns a slightly erratic beam, both with Arbok in their crosshares. However, the Arbok still has some life in it, quickly burrowing into the ground with a Dig attack, causing both attacks to create a pillar of ice where Arbok was seconds before. Knowing that all that your Pokemon could do was wait, you hold your breath before the Arbok surfaces, smacking into Dunsparce rather hard. However, Dunsparce reacts quickly, its eyes glowing magenta as several waves of psychic energy rush across the field, striking Arbok and sending it flying back into a tree. The Arbok feebly attempts to get up, but it falls to the ground again, KOed. Level up for Lily and Dunsparce.<br />
<br />
What will you do now? Continue to search the forest and the dangers that it holds, or head somewhere else?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: silver"><b>P/Arts:</b> You send out Necross, your Steelix, who towers over the gym leader's Houndoom, but it hardly looks intimidated as the two Pokemon stare at each other, ready for orders and the chance to cause bodily harm. As you give your orders, Claire shouts out to Houndoom, &quot;Ah, we shall see. Houndoom, use your Faint Attack to dodge the Bind attack, and deliver your most powerful Flamethrower to the Steelix's back. Shroud yourself in a Smokescreen to dodge the Dragonbreath!&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Pokemon quickly move into action. Steelix lunges forward with its tail, attempting to constrict the Houndoom's motion, though Houndoom reacts faster. A black aura surrounds it as it disappears, reappearing behind the Steelix. Wasting no time, Houndoom's jaws open to reveal a brilliant orange and red glow which travels across the short distance between the two Pokemon quickly, the Flamethrower rushing over the Steelix's back quickly before the flames fade away, having taken a toll on the goliath Pokemon. Not to be deterred, Steelix turns around quickly, ready for vengeance. It opens its mouth, a greenish blue stream of dragon flame bursting forth, crossing the field quickly as Houndoom's mouth lets loose a Smokescreen, filling the area around the fire type. Steelix's attack penetrates the ash colored smoke, though it would appear as though Houndour managed to make a last second dodge of the attack.<br />
<br />
Claire then shouts out, &quot;An interesting first round, no? Nonetheless, Houndour, I want you to use your Will-O-Wisp when you have a chance, followed by another quick Flamethrower attack!&quot; How will you react?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: teal"><b>Faiyaa:</b> You give your orders to Scurvy for the second round of battle. Scurvy nods and immediately stops flailing around, a red aura consuming it as the Rattata's eyes grow wide, being flung across the room into a wall. Not wasting a second, Scurvy turns to face its opponent, its eyes glowing yellow as it sends a flurry of small, writhing electrical tendrils across the room, entangling the Rattata. After a few moments, the Rattata quits attempting to break free of the hold, frozen in place by the Thunder Wave attack's paralyzing effect. Smirking, Scurvy becomes covered in a smoky gray aura, bursting forward and striking the opponent Rattata, before five more shadows appear in midair, strike, and then disappear. However, it would appear the attacks, while doing good damage to the small rat Pokemon, also knocked it out of its paralysis. The small rat darts between several places on the wooden floor, 3 more Rattata appearing to join the original in a Double Team attack. Rattata seems to have taken a good amount of damage this round, but it can still go on. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: teal"><b>Joshua and Skrusti:</b> You give your orders to your Pokemon to try to finish this battle off as soon as you can. Tifa begins to attack first, sending a barrage of glowing green grass particles in the form of a Bullet Seed toward the opposing menace, who roars in pain as the barrage strikes it in the side. Before it even has a chance to recover from the strike, Tifa's eyes glow a bright green, draining health and energy from the opposing Gyarados, who once again roars in pain, though it isn't able to do a single thing about it. Ready to end the battle, Hayley's mouth glows with sparkling yellow particles as they fly across the field, the Shock Wave smashing into Gyarados, the electricity being carried throughout the water type's body and frying it from the inside out. It falls into the depths of the sea as the attack ends, having been defeated. Level up for Tifa, Jamie, and Hayley.<br />
<br />
Now what will you do? Will you attempt to further investigate the Gyarados by diving deep beneath, or will you attempt to go back to your original plans, heading to the shipwreck?</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver"><b>P/Arts:</b> You send out Necross, your Steelix, who towers over the gym leader's Houndoom, but it hardly looks intimidated as the two Pokemon stare at each other, ready for orders and the chance to cause bodily harm. As you give your orders, Claire shouts out to Houndoom, &quot;Ah, we shall see. Houndoom, use your Faint Attack to dodge the Bind attack, and deliver your most powerful Flamethrower to the Steelix's back. Shroud yourself in a Smokescreen to dodge the Dragonbreath!&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Pokemon quickly move into action. Steelix lunges forward with its tail, attempting to constrict the Houndoom's motion, though Houndoom reacts faster. A black aura surrounds it as it disappears, reappearing behind the Steelix. Wasting no time, Houndoom's jaws open to reveal a brilliant orange and red glow which travels across the short distance between the two Pokemon quickly, the Flamethrower rushing over the Steelix's back quickly before the flames fade away, having taken a toll on the goliath Pokemon. Not to be deterred, Steelix turns around quickly, ready for vengeance. It opens its mouth, a greenish blue stream of dragon flame bursting forth, crossing the field quickly as Houndoom's mouth lets loose a Smokescreen, filling the area around the fire type.

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Silver">In the back of his mind, a voice was screaming at James to change pokemon, to release Kodou, to play it safe and assure victory through type advantage. It was ignored. Because to James, comparing the feeling of an easy victory to the intense, nerve-wracking, overwhelming sensation to what he was feeling right now it wasn't even a choice.<br />
</span></span> <br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Silver"> The rush won.<br />
<br />
One thing he was not planning on, however, was that his pokemon would not do things as planned. It was... unlike Necross. James frowned. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Necross, what's the deal? I told you to slam first, so you could push him back.&quot;<br />
<br />
The snake bowed his head, eyes distant. &quot;I am not sure. I... apoligise.&quot;<br />
<br />
The frown receded and JAmes shook his head, grinning slightly. &quot;Yeah, it is you, I thought I owned another steelix there for a minute... but don't be so hard on yourself.&quot; A heavy, pleasant feeling filled James' head, making his face flush. &quot;This is why I love battling.&quot; He winked at Claire playfully. &quot;The challenge. Right?&quot;<br />
<br />
The steelix did not answer. His eye were fixed on the houndoom, and he seemed... stoic. Unmoving. A sign, James knew, that the steelix was trying to resist the urge to rip the arena apart.Damn, not good. Needing to quickly distract the steelix, before his rather unusual tempted became dangerous to Claire, the houndoom and even himself, James quickly let loose his orders:<br />
<br />
&quot;Quickly, let loose your Rage at the houndoom, and only at the pokemon... I don't want you tearing up the place like you did in the Emerald Jungle. Get it out of your system. Take the Will O' Wisp attack - your Shell Bell should even things out, with any luck, so no need to worry. Respond to the Flamethrower with a Dragonbreath, and stalemate 'im.&quot; The boy grinned. &quot;Then crack the thing round the head with your Iron Tail.&quot;</span></span></div>

<span style="color: darkorange"><b>Jerichi:</b> You give orders to Smokestack, who nods as it begins to carry out its attacking orders. It points its head upwards, sending a beam of bright orange energy skyward, causing the clouds to clear and the sun to shine brightly. In the mean time, however, a crackling, spiralling beam of ghost energy forms in front of Haunter, sending the half-charged Shadow Ball at Smokestack as the Sunny Day finishes. The ball explodes upon contact, doing good damage to the fire type Pokemon. Shrugging it off, Smokestack opens its mouth wide, sending another stream of flames outward that wrap around Haunter in the form of a vortex. After a few seconds, the flames fade away into nothingness, and the Haunter looks homicidally onto Smokestack. Haunter's eyes turn a smoky gray as it uses another attack, cutting its HP as it places a Curse onto Smokestack, who is completely defenseless against the telekinetic-esque attack with its Endure attack. Seems as though you don't have as long as you'd like to finish the battle as the Curse is robbing Smokestack of its health and energy, but Haunter did sacrifice a lot of health and energy - perhaps that could be a ray of hope in your situation?</span><br />

</blockquote><span style="color: DarkOrange">Tetsu watched as the battle continued. Although Smokestack did clear the skies, he got hit by a nasty Shadow Ball. Luckly, he did get in one hit, that of Fire Spin. But, Haunter turned the tables with a Curse. This is what worried Tetsu the most. Sure, Haunter took a hit himself, but the curse wasn't a good thing at all. Tetsu didn't want Smokestack to suffer the curse. Anyways, it's a disadvantage which he didn't like to deal with.<br />
<br />
He knew the best option. &quot;Alright, Smokestack. You did great, but I don't want you to suffer the curse. Come on back!&quot; Tetsu relayed to the tortiose before recalling him. The ball in his hand was switched out what looked like almost instantly. Instead of a firey Pokeball, a Chirstmas-themed was in his hand. He tossed it out onto the dying meadow. A Snorunt popped out of the ball in a flurry of ice and snow. &quot;Sno!&quot; he cheered, but that cheery expression was whipped from his face after he saw what he was facing. &quot;Don't be afraid, buddy! Keep strong! I want you to start with an <b>Ice Beam</b>, and lead straight into a <b>Tri-Attack</b>! <b>Protect</b> yourself from anything you can!&quot; Tetsu ordered. Snowy nodded reluctantly and started to attack the ghost.</span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorchid"><b>John's Knight:</b> You give your orders to Forte, who nods, ready to take down its opponent, before it has a chance to do anything to it. Forte glows with sandy-brown ground energy as it jumps into the air, coming down on the ground, sending shockwaves through the ground. The ground violently shakes as the Ursaring loses its footing, falling to the ground with a thud. Its eyes narrowing again, the Ursaring's fist glows a bright cerulean as it sprints across the ground, slamming its fist into the rock/ground type and doing good damage with its Ice Punch attack. Taking the hit, Forte clinches its teeth, enduring the super effective strike. As the attack ends, Forte's mouth opens wide, a spiralling orb of golden-orange energy beginning to form, quickly spawning a devestating beam which races across the field, striking into Ursaring with a violent amount of force, sending it staggering backwards several feet before slamming into a tree. </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorchid">The Ursaring falls forward, taking one last look of hatred at you and Forte, before closing its eyes on the battle, having been defeated. Level up for Forte! Now, what will you do? Will you continue to explore the area? Or will you attempt to find a way to one of the other islands of the Cascadia archipelago?</span></span>

Excelent performance! You deserve a good rest.&quot;</span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #9932cc">Grabbing his pokeball, John returned Forte the Golem to his pokeball. He then looked at the fainted Ursaring, lying on the muddy ground. &quot;Let's hope the mud doesn't 'consume' it...&quot;</span></span><br />

The Mightyena's eyes narrow, as it begins to sprint across the room, its mouth filled with potent dark energy as it begins to ready a Crunch attack. However, just as the Mightyena lunges for its prey, the ghost type suddenly disappears from view, reappearing behind the dark dog of doom and unleashing its full destructive power, the Hyper Beam attack sending the Mightyena forward into a stone wall. <br />
<br />
Striking it hard, the Mightyena falls to the floor. It shakily gets up, turning to face the Banette with a renewed hatred, its red eyes becoming more intense as the dog's mouth opens wide, a crackling ball of black-purple energy forming and flying across the room, the Shadow Ball missing Banette by only a few inches. Banette appears to be extremely tired after that first round - will that affect your battle strategy?</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DarkOrange">Looking at the amazing battle that was being fighting between Braids and that Mightyena Felix couldn't thought in anything else than &quot;When did Braids get this strong?&quot;. However, after fighting that good, Braids was breathing heavily now, she looked very tired, as she had run for 2 hours. &quot;That was cool!&quot; shouted Felix at his ghostie, but Braids you looked at him like saying &quot;Leave me alone, I can win this battle without your help&quot;, but as she was afraid of what Felix could do to her if she didn't obbey, she preffered to follow his orders.<br />
<br />
&quot;What can I do now?&quot;, asked Felix to himself. &quot;Braids is very bad in energy and I can't let her faint this easily&quot;. Felix looked at the Mightyena, it seemed pretty bad too, the Hyper Beam had struck it just in its back. &quot;Mmmm, I got it&quot;, said Felix raising one of his fingers, as Braids looked at him, still heavily breathing. &quot;Start things with <b>Torment</b>, that dog migh try to use another Shadow Ball against you and you probably couldn't take it without faint. After using Torment, go with <b>Mega Drain</b> twice, that way you can recover your energy. Try not to move fast and don't get tired&quot;.<br />

Braids aimed her eyes to the Mightyena, glared at it and prepared for battle.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: green"><b>Alilatias:</b> You give your Pokemon their orders, and they give responses of recognition before they move into action. Falzter begins to use Focus Energy, and the other two Swellow mimic his actions, also using Focus Energy. As Faltzer begins to form a ball of glowing purple ghost energy in front of it, the other two Swellow nod to each other, figuring that the situation is under control with the Electabuzz, and they both begin a sky dive, directly at Magcargo. Saito begins to twirl around on its left foot, beginning to raise its attack and speed, the Swords Dance probably being a good idea against the opponent Magcargo, who needs to be dealt with swiftly to prevent any more damage being done.<br />
<br />
Faltzer ends its charging, and releases the Shadow Ball against the Electabuzz, whose prongs had began to glow with electrical energy, facing the two wild Swellow. Completely unsuspecting, it is hit hard in the left side by the Shadow Ball, and it is lifted from its feet, being thrown into a nearby tree as it faints. Level up for Faltzer. As the four Pokemon now begin their assault on the single opponent. The man stares at you, and says &quot;Why this isn't really fair, is it?&quot; He sighs, before he holds out his hand, stepping in front of the magma Pokemon, shaking his head. &quot;I accept defeat. However, I must warn you, we will be back. That amulet is ours.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man turns around, recalling his Electabuzz and Magcargo. He disappears into the forest. Looking around, you see the two Swellow and Faltzer making sure that the others are all right, before Faltzer retreats to your shoulder. What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Green">&quot;Well...&quot; Soruta muttered as she looked to Faltzer, perched on her shoulder. &quot;That was a nice way to start a morning now, wasn't it? And it seems Saito has gotten over his fear of birds.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Saito suddenly looked up to the two wild Swellow, and sweatdropped. &quot;Aw, don't worry, Saito... They're your friends, right?&quot; Saito sweatdropped even more at that remark. Soruta sighed, slightly lost in thought about what the man from earlier had said.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;I accept defeat. However, I must warn you, we will be back. That amulet is ours.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
<i>&quot;What does that man mean by 'we'?&quot;</i> Soruta thought. <i>&quot;And what's up with this amulet that he claims the Swellow are protecting?&quot;</i> Before Soruta knew it, Saito had already gone back to his previous state of 'hide behind the trainer from the scary birds'. Looking down at Saito, Soruta gave a fustrated sigh. &quot;Saito, good job against that Marcargo, but you really are hopeless when it comes to even <i>looking</i> at a bird, huh? Well, if you want...&quot; Soruta then pulled out her Great Ball and returned Saito back to his Pokeball.<br />
<br />
Faltzer chipred softly, apparently thinking that Soruta had forgotten about him. &quot;Oh, yeah... That's right. There's still the whole amulet thing. The guy said that '<i>we</i> will be back', and that doesn't sound very good. Faltzer, you should go ask the two older Swellow here about the amulet. See why that man wanted it so much, and see if we can do anything to help the Swellow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Soruta sighed once more as Faltzer was preparing to take flight. <i>&quot;Young, nosy, and completely perky... That's probably what they think we are.&quot;</i></span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: deepskyblue"><b>thed3:</b>You and your Caterpie enter the elevator with Aaron, before it ascends to the top of the crater, turning around and showing the lake. However, it already looked as though it had changed drastically in the few moments in which you were gone. Many more Pokemon lie on the beach, being tended to by the Nurse Joy and the assistants that she brought with her. You and Aaron begin to help them transport the Pokemon, putting them onto stretchers which are connected to several Pidgeot and Swellow, which lift the Pokemon off the beach and disappear into the distance, where it would be assumed a medical facility was located. <br />
<br />
After a bit of this, the elevator behind you whirred into life as it opens, a tall, older man with white hair walking out. Nurse Joy rushes over to him as soon as she spots him, and quickly says, &quot;It's happening again.&quot; A grave look comes over his face as his fears are proven true, looking to the ground before looking back at the water, a look of confidence coming over him. &quot;I want you to get a the Hydros team in there, search every little bit possible. Then if you're able to find a specimen, have it transported to me immediately by the one who captures it - these are fragile creatures, if they were to touch the side of a container, they would die.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nurse Joy nods, walking over to one of the walls of the crater near a small building, and putting her hand on a button, causing the rock wall to open a small bit, revealing a Pokemon transport device. She quickly begins to type, and several Pokeballs appear, which she tosses onto the beach, each opening to reveal a Golduck. They quickly go into action, holding their left arms out as their eyes glow blue, the water quickly rising in front of each of them and turning into a midair stream of water, which comes to a few inches in front of each of their faces before the water does a U-turn, returning to the lake in an endless cycle.<br />
<br />
The man seems to just notice you now, coming over to you, saying, &quot;Hydrokinesis...what a powerful thing. But no, that's not the point at the moment. I'm Dr. Rapson of the Hedland Research Center on Brine Island. We study the rare and elusive Irondi Tentacool as our main focus. They are no larger than a fingernail, but their venom can be deadly if not treated. No one's ever been able to capture one in order to create an antidote...but we may be lucky this time.<br />
<br />
Just as he says this, one of the Golduck call out. Rushing over to it, the man shouts, &quot;Yes, we've found one!&quot; He turns to you, saying &quot;I have to get this back to the lab immediately. Would you like to come with me, or would you rather stay here?</span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: DeepSkyBlue">Watching the Golduck go to work they rise up the entire body of water to try and find the rare sort of Tentacool. The tall man with white hair watches the Golduck as well and he suddenly starts talking to Thed. He talks about the Tentacool, being called the Irondi Tentacool a rare and elusive type of Tentacool. Elusive most likely because of their size the biggest probably only as big as his fingernail.<br />
<br />
Suddenly one of the Golduck reacts and signals that it has one of the Tentacool. The man suddenly asks Thed if he would like to join him in taking the specimen back to his lab. &quot;Why, of course I would! This sort of find doesn't happen that often so I would love to be a part of the solution to the lake pokemon's pain. If it would be faster we could fly atop my Tropius to your lab.&quot; &quot;Papi! Papi!&quot; Thed's little Caterpie chirped as he heard the mention of flying.</span></div>

<span style="color: green"><b>Torkoal Stu and Joe:</b> You each give your orders to your Pokemon, hoping to be able to take down this opposing Arbok as quickly as you possibly can. Lily attacks first, its right fist glowing a bright cerulean as it punches into the Arbok, ice beginning to crystallize in the area of the strike. Glaring at the grass/water type, Arbok's mouth opens wide, a series of small white needles rushing forth and striking Lily, doing rather good damage with the Poison Sting attack. Not to be deterred, Lily shakes its head, several Razor Leaves bursting free and flying at Arbok at the same time when Joe's Dunsparce joins the action, sending a Water Pulse attack at the snake. Both attacks manage to hit the poison type, doing good damage, and putting it on its last figurative legs.<br />
<br />
Lily and Dunsparce then begin to carry out their next orders, Water Gun and Ice Beam respectively. Lily sends the high pressured stream of water at the snake at the same time that Dunsparce creates a crackling ball of ice energy which spawns a slightly erratic beam, both with Arbok in their crosshares. However, the Arbok still has some life in it, quickly burrowing into the ground with a Dig attack, causing both attacks to create a pillar of ice where Arbok was seconds before. Knowing that all that your Pokemon could do was wait, you hold your breath before the Arbok surfaces, smacking into Dunsparce rather hard. However, Dunsparce reacts quickly, its eyes glowing magenta as several waves of psychic energy rush across the field, striking Arbok and sending it flying back into a tree. The Arbok feebly attempts to get up, but it falls to the ground again, KOed. Level up for Lily and Dunsparce.<br />

Stuart stood waiting for someone to high five him, waiting, waiting for seconds on end until he sighed and got out Lily's Pokemon. &quot;Good job,&quot; he mumbled returning her back to her Pokeball and then turning over to Joe. He listened to Joe's long explanation about Cascadia and then Paras, Stuart yawned as Joe continued to drone on and on and on about CASSSSCADDIIIAAAAAA. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well...Salin City would take up a lot of battling, that means Joe and I could be pushed to our limits. Though I really did underestimate Joe and Dunsparce too, hmmm maybe we should take that Gym Challenge. But oooh Bane Forest, that sounds awesome to, not just awesome, like totally girlfriend awesome. I think we should go there but I dunno if Joe would prefer the gyms or not.....why did he leave this choice to me?&quot; Stuart debated with himself as he through his bag onto the ground and knelt down to go through it. After a few seconds he brought out his Christmas Coin Case and got out a single shiny coin and tossed it into the air. &quot;Heads Salin City, Tails Bane Forest!&quot; Stuart said sternly as the coin flew upwards, spinning as it did so. When the coin hit the ground Stuart looked at it carefully as smiled. &quot;Tails....&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Stuart then put the coins back into his case and bag and then put it back on his back and prepared himself for his next adventure. He then looked at Joe for a second, then Paras, then around the area he was in, he thought carefully over how he underestimated both Dunsparce and Joe and how he could of died if it wasn't for them. &quot;I'm sorry Joe, I won't doubt you again...now let’s get going to the Bane Forest!&quot;</span></span></div>

They both nod before they move into action in order to carry out their attacks. The Growlithe begins to glow yellow as it transfers attacking power to Rakdos, whose coat glints in its newfound power. Raising its power even more, Rakdos begins to focus its energy, closing its eyes as it commences the attack. In the meantime, Ariados's eyes glow blue as the leaves on the ground between you and it begin to quickly rush toward you as a tidal wave of Psychic force rushes over Rakdos and Growlithe, who are both sent backward a few feet as the attack hits them. Growlithe opens its mouth, a burst of flame rushing outward toward Ariados, who quickly moves into action, using a burst of Agility to dodge the attack, the Flamethrower hitting a tree which bursts into flame. <br />
<br />
Rakdos, done focusing its energy, begins to fly toward the Ariados to strike it, prepared to use its Wing Attack. However, the Ariados spits a sticky white thread from its mouth, wrapping up Rakdos in a Spider Web, falling to the ground as it attempts to rid its body of the sticky webbing which covers its wings. The Ariados has proven itself a formidible foe with only one round of battle - what will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: Green">Saturn already knew that the battle against Ariados would be difficult but the spider was more stronger than he expected. It countered every attack of Rakdos and the Growlithe. Maybe the bug knew that they were going to use those attacks because they have type advantage. If it came from a dangerous forest, it was obvious that it knew how to survive. The clue to defeat it was doing something that it wasn´t prepared for, but how? Saturn decided to try with something that came into his mind and hoped for the best.<br />
<br />
&quot;Growlithe, use Agility so you can move faster, then use Bite on Ariados and try to inmobilize it. Rakdos, use Quick Attack to distract the spider and after Growlithe´s Bite, Slash it.&quot;</span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: yellow"><b>Wayne:</b> Giving your orders to your Bulbasaur, it begins to move into action in order to carry out your attacking orders. Opening its mouth, a flurry of glowing green particles rush forth, flying through the air at the behemoth. The Electabuzz attempts to move out of the way of the strike, but the widespread characteristic of Bullet Seed causes it still to get hit by some of the attack, doing a small amount of damage. The Electabuzz roars in disdain, its fist beginning to crackle with electrical energy as tendrils of electricity wrap around it, the yellow Pokemon preparing a Thunder Punch attack. <br />
<br />
As the electric type runs forward to attack, Bulbasaur watches vigilantly, waiting for the chance to dodge Electabuzz's attack. As it swings its fist at the grass type, Bulbasaur nimbly jumps out of the way, Electabuzz's fist passing through the air where Bulbasaur was just seconds before. Roaring in anger again, the Electabuzz's prongs each begin to crackle with electricity, before the electrical currents join between them, spawning a bolt of electricity which flies downward, aimed at Bulbasaur. Bulbasaur manages to dodge the majority of the strike, though it does still get hit a bit and takes minor damage. Concentrating, Bulbasaur's bulb glows white for a few seconds before it sends a yellow-orange beam of energy up into the skies, which clear of the few clouds that had been overhead, but you do notice that the dark clouds of the infamous Ion Island thunderstorm still remain in the distance, rather curiously due to Bulbasaur's attack. What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Yellow">Wayne looked at Bulbasaur as he released the beam of energy that lead up into the sky that cleared a few clouds. Wayne started to grow nervous as it was obvious that this Electabuzz was quite strong and it was going to be a hard battle ahead. Trying to think of a strategy for this round Wayne then got a good idea of what to do next while the battle was pretty much even. “Bulbasaur I know this Electabuzz is strong but I also know you can beat it if you try your best. Use Magical Leafs and then try to make it fall asleep with Grasswhistle. After that use Leech Seed on it regardless if it falls asleep. Try and keep dodging it's attacks since they look strong...”</span></span></div>

It disappears in a flash of light, reappearing about 10 feet above the Machamp's head in the air. The Machamp looks upward as Axtan's eyes crackle with ghost energy, a dual attack descending upon the Machamp, who nimbly dodges the attack before opening its mouth wide, a stream of flame rushing forth and striking the psychic bird, doing a decent amount of damage upon contact, and slightly scorching Axtan. Recovering quickly, Axtan flies upwards before it begins a dive-bomb, smacking into the powerful fighting type before it has a chance to react, and doing a very good amount of damage. The Machamp glares at you and Axtan as the round of battle draws to a close, looking tired as though another powerful hit such as that could take it out easily. What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: green">&quot;I'm bored, philosophies,..fill low so fees, I'll call it a day for peotry and tea,&quot; the young trainer fixed his hat's position on his head and begins to take attention again, with grit this time, or more likely, boredom, at the battle this time around. The xatu hovered close to his trainer. However, with a slurred speech, the trainer gave a rather, hasty command of sheer lack of enthusiasm. &quot;Swirl up to the skies, crash down on that machamp if you want, but make sure to blast up a night shade over it. Now, swirl,&quot; the trainer then began to see his xatu turning itself up, releasing itself from the boundaries of the earthed ground, and swirl in style. He did stress the word night shade a little, but more importantly, he did a &quot;swuush&quot; sound depicting the word swirl, just right after it. The laid-back trainer pulled a few steps back, but began to fall and drop onto the grounds on his back, then with a sigh, &quot;Man, this sure is boring.&quot; After a short while, he put his small booklet back into his bag which was nearby, albeit, next to him, but began to take it out again, but this time, he just used it, with it opened, and closed his face, his eyes in particular, and gave another sigh-like-murmur, &quot;Burgh&quot;. Some small dust particles fly out from the page to his hair slightly spread out on the ground.</span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: green"><b>Dark Fire:</b> Continuing your assault on the Beedrill, you decide to change your strategy in hope that this battle will end faster. Vulpix becomes covered in a black aura before it jets forward, striking into the Beedrill quickly before it has a chance to dodge. Before Beedrill has a chance to begin an attack, Drought's eyes glow blue, hypnotic waves rushing over Beedrill, and forcing it to fall asleep into a deep slumber...<br />
<br />
Wishing the Beedrill all the worst, Drought closes its eyes for a few moments before the Beedrill violently shudders. Drought smiles evilly as the Nightmare takes effect, beginning to drain the opponent bug's energy, leaving it looking in a rather poor shape...What will you do now?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: green">Rayne quickly scanned the Beedrill, and noticed it was in pretty bad shape. But although victory was right in front of him he mentally decided not to harm the insect any further. Drought picked up on the thought with her newly discovered Psychic abilities and butted in.<br />
<br />
<i>&lt;You're joking right? Let me shred that the bee to oblivion.&gt;</i> She growled, sensing the remorse in her trainer. <br />
<br />
&quot;No. We've proven our point, that'll be enough.&quot; Rayne replied.<br />
<br />
<i>&lt;No, no we haven't. The minute he'll wake up he'll realize what we did and only get harder to beat. I have to finish him now!&gt;</i> The Vulpix hunched over, bearing her teeth, ready to attack. Rayne couldn't tap into her mind like she could his, so he couldn't tell why she had such a need for savageness. <br />
<br />
&quot;That Beedrill is in no condition to ward off attacks, and even when it wakes up it won't be able to. Forget it Drought, let's keep going, before more of its kind show up.&quot; He tried to plead, but to no avail.<br />
<br />
<i>&lt;That's exactly my point. He'll wake up, and gather the rest of his colony, and then what? You'll need Minerva to help you out, but she's not here right now. I can assure you, that even with my expertice, I won't be able to fend them off. So, if you won't give me commands, I'll attack on my own will.&gt;</i> The mental link faded, as she began concentrating for a Faint Attack. Desperate Rayne tried to grab the Vulpix, but she had vanished in a poof of black smoke. Swiftly he grabbed Drought's pokeball and clicked the return button. A red beam split the air around it seeking the Vulpix, and finally sucked her in as she reapeared inches from the bee. Relieved and shocked he let out a long sigh.<br />
<br />
<i>What was that all about?</i> He asked himself eyeing Drought's pokeball <i>It was like a whole different Vulpix out there.</i> Rayne was puzzled at his pokemon's behaviour, but decided to shrug it off for the time being. He slowly walked over to the snoozing Beedrill, and placed three oran berries a couple of feet in front of it, hoping it would forget the incident if its opponent showed some hospitality.<br />
<br />
With one last glance at the clearing they battled in, Rayne dissapeared in the thicket. For the time being he would continue further into the mysterious forest ... </span></div>

Ruin Island<span style="font-size: 9px"><br />
One of the more interesting areas of the archipelago, Ruin Island is also the most mysterious. Giant stone statues and buildings, eroded by time, stand in the overgrowing vegetation of the area, providing a home to many Pokemon, especially those who prefer dark, enclosed spaces. Studies done by researches show that this island was once under water, or flooded, or something. At the very least, they have established that it is the oldest of the areas. An eerie feel of foreboding rushes over one the second they set forth on the land, provoking myths and legends...<br />
<b>Oniero Ruins</b> - Another of the strange ruins of the island, the Oniero Ruins are a series of large, white rocks placed in a circle around a black rock in the middle, which is said to have powerful properties if touched. However, as one enters the ring, they find themselves in a dreamlike state, making this a rather interesting part of the island.</span>

Getting off the Ferry which connected all the islands in the Cascadian Region, a friendly welcomed, &quot;Welcome To Ruin Island - Where Endless Mysteries Await&quot;. With a young Slakoth slunk around his neck, the young trainer disembarked into new land. &quot;Well well well, looks like this place is just the place to tickle our pickles, eh Delilah?&quot; The Slakoth yawned, then muffled herself back into his sweater. &quot;So little places, so much time. The place that caught my eye was the <b>Oniero Ruins</b>. That is why we'll be starting off there, then work our way around the island. Thats if things go as planned.&quot; Asking some crew members on the ferry which way was which, Matt found himself on the start of his exploration of Cascadia.</span></div>
