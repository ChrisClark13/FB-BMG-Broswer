<span style="color: lightblue"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>Glacier Island</i></span><br />
<br />
<b><u>Boreal Wastelands</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Treepandaone</u>:</b> The words spill out of your mouth practically on their own. Struck by despair and disbelief, you promptly confess to carrying an infected Pokemon with you - not necessarily out of concern for the well-being of those at the encampment, but a frail hope that these men could do something. Anything at all.<br />
<br />
You feel the snowmobile halt to a stop almost immediately after you finish talking. Daryl turns around and forcefully pushes you off your seat and down to the icy floor.<br />
<br />
- What the f*ck did you say? Are you insane?!<br />
<br />
His voice is filled with rage and apprehension, as if the mere <i>thought</i> of travelling with an infected Pokemon safely stored inside its Ball was enough to contaminate the whole camp from a distance. Daryl looks ready to lay a beating on you until Jacob intervenes to stop things from escalating.<br />
<br />
- Calm down please! Daryl, it's not his fault. He was attacked, just like we were in the past. We all lost our Pokemon, you managed to hold on to Magneton but not everyone was so lucky. I wasn't, you remember that. Matthew's Psyduck needs our help and you should be glad he mentioned its infection <i>before</i> we got inside! How many people would do that?<br />
<br />
He gets off the snowmobile and helps you to your feet.<br />
<br />
- Listen, we've learned how to handle early-stage infections but we have to be quick about it, and even then the response to treatment varies with each host. Psyduck will have to be quarantined in a heated room to thaw out any ice particles in her circulation and prevent the corruption from spreading. Having her inside her Ball won't help either... If you trust me, please hand her over and I'll do my best to save her. I can't promise you anything, it's not a flawless method, but it's all we can do.<br />
<br />
He holds out his hand, hoping for an agreement.<br />
<br />
- Also, we'll need to take a look at Porygon as well. It's supposedly a digital creature but I don't know if it can be corrupted. We've realized that Pokemon like Magneton are immune, but a lifeform like Porygon is a complete mystery to us - it's unlikely that it's been infected, but for the sake of everyone inside I can't take any chances. Please... it's the only way I can let you in. </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: lightblue">The snowmobile juddered to a halt as Matthew found himself being pushed forcefully from the back no sooner than the words trickled from his mouth. The angry response washed over him while his head span with dizziness, culminating into lightheadedness as his stomach churned. The Pokémon trainer had been adventuring for some time, but never had he encountered such pure evil in the wilderness. Pokémon of his past had moved on, released, traded, put into adoption and taken by other trainers but the aspect of death was never something that occurred throughout his travels. Reanimated Pokémon and zombie Pokémon resurrected from a demi-god seemed so distant and yet so unreal but this experience, with his comrades lives on the line, brought him to a core-shattering reality he could never wish upon anyone. <br />
<br />
Daryl was right to be mad as his face bulged with pure anger, even Matthew had to agree that his moral compass was slowly eroding into a lacklustre effort. In his shoes, the reaction would have been the same and Matthew couldn't blame him violent repressions. He had put the entire camp's safety at risk, and the efforts of those who had lost friends, family and Pokémon to survive, a sin he would never had attempted in years gone by. His bed of ice made the trainer reflect on how self-centered he had become since his absence; as if old memories were of a completely different person. Years of swearing against Team Rocket had made him bitter and the taste was finally catching up to him, a palpable flavour of spiritual discomfort in juxtaposition to his ego's expectations.<br />
<br />
Death was inevitable, but Matthew had no desire to have a Pokémon so young to the world turn moments into its first adventure. He wanted to show his Pokémon the majesty he had been adventuring in for so many years, not have them perish in a place so frigid and lonely. He had heard many stories of a town dedicated to honouring the dead in his home region of Kanto, the famous Lavender town holding the Pokémon Tower where spirits are set free, though he had never been. He feared the repercussions of dying here in the Glacier Isle; not only having ones spirit forever decimated but unwillingly turning into the same monstrosities that had made them that way.<br />
<br />
“Calm down please! Daryl, it's not his fault. He was attacked, just like we were in the past. We all lost our Pokemon, you managed to hold on to Magneton but not everyone was so lucky. I wasn't, you remember that. Matthew's Psyduck needs our help and you should be glad he mentioned its infection before we got inside! How many people would do that?”<br />
<br />
Jacob spoke gentle and forgiving words, though Matthew wasn't sure if he agreed with him. He had endangered lives by not speaking up sooner, and a wave of guilt rushed through him once more. He tried to apologise and beg for forgiveness but he choked up, the trainer fighting back tears as he croaked out a pitiful attempt. Jacob helped him to his feet, a rush of blood bringing him back into an existence he wasn't sure he deserved to be in. He glanced over his shoulder at the figure carved into the snow, his body head creating an image that looked like the snow angels he made both as a child and as an adult at his base, but all he saw was a demon. It was like a symbol of fate, the image of life and death that could befall his Pokémon.<br />
<br />
Jacob spoke once more as Matthew turned and listened, a new fire burning in his soul to make matter right again. He had foolishly believed that a man-made construct like a Pokéball could hold the foul beasts of darkness he had just witnessed, but a spark of light glimmered at the prospect of a cure. He nodded at the prospect at handing over his Pokémon, even at the slightest chance of recovery, but this was a big step. He had never given control over his Pokémon to anyone, but he knew the deed had to be done. Unclasping the second Pokéball from his belt, he handed over Psyduck and Porygon to the man before thanking him with all his heart. <br />
<br />
He would find a way to make this right. No matter what happened he would repay this debt...</span></span></div>

<b><u>The SS Leviathan Shipwreck</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>CyberBlastoise</u>:</b> Dried blood or eerie mist... neither choice seems right. It seems that whichever door you choose, there will be consequences, and neither give any indication of how you'll get Swift healed up. Because that is still the number one priority.<br />
<br />
Or is it? Common sense tells you to stay away from the familiar blue mist that gives you the chills... but curiosity tells you to go ahead and open the door. Besides, trying the other one meant going to the <i>back</i> of the ship, if your sense of direction doesn't fail you...<br />
<br />
You place a hand on the door handle, turn it and push the door open. A thick layer of neon-blue smoke kicks up, pouring into the storage room you're in, making you cough a couple of times. You look up into the darkness ahead... and one more, overpowering chill runs down your spine while your legs begin to tremble on their own.<br />
<br />
Before you is a long, narrow corridor that stretches into the distance, covered in fog. And amidst the fog you count no less than <i>five</i> male Jellicent, absent-mindedly floating above the ground, casually bumping into each other and against the walls as if they weren't even there. Their moans fill the ship, as well as your very soul with an intense fear even though they haven't even noticed you yet - their mere presence seems to exert some kind of terrifying effect. The mist has a glow of its own that illuminates the hall in its entirety with a faint blue light, allowing you to peer into the distance and see a door on the far end of the corridor. And standing in front of it is a sixth male Jellicent, but green instead of blue...<br />
<br />
Turns out this isn't a sunken ship inhabited by a lone Jellicent... it's a full-on ghost ship! You try to hide behind the door you just opened as you go over your options, now that the mystery of the blue mist has been revealed...<br />
<br />
Will you force your way through the ghost horde, attempt to sneak by, turn back to one of the other doors, or something else entirely? </span></span>

</blockquote>OoC: I'll be honest. I expected a refrigeration unit...and that you were messing with me...<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: teal"><br />
Bill slowly opened the door, hoping that whatever was on the other side would be friendly...or at least not be a ghost that could hurt him now. A small creeeeeeak was heard as he pressed against the chilly handle. Now he wondered just what it could be that was on the other side of this doorway. The trainer's eyes peered through the small crack only to find another room, but this one was a little different. It was a long narrow hallway covered through the brim of that fog that was seeping under the door not too long ago. And amongst the fog was a very familiar site from not too long ago, the Jellicent that told him to leave...only this time it wasn't just the one, it was a group. He had a choice to make, did he really want to back track to find another exit? Go through the other door and maybe meet an even worse fate or go through there hoping for the best. He looked back at the other door, which was really tempting, but then he looked down at his Pokeball containing Swift in it. He didn't know how long that he would have and time was of the essence. Backtracking is going to have to be a last resort, and Bill had done dumber things in the past. <br />
<br />
&quot;Arceus, protect me...&quot; he mumbled to himself. If he could just get passed those Jellicent, maybe he could find an exit through the other side...or at least a place with water that he could battle in. Either way is fine. He opened the door fully, and started to crawl down low, maybe these ghosts can't see through their own smoke. The only thing that was on his mind right now is to get Swift to safety and fast. If only they could stay distracted with each other until he could reach the other side...or maybe he could find a hole in the floor and head down too. Either way works right now, just so long as he can keep going. Bill had to admit, he had been through paranormal stuff before and it never phased him but this time felt different...he couldn't quite explain it.<br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><i><span style="color: green">Lily Island</span></i></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px">With a totally different landscape from the first, Lily Island is the second largest of the archipelago. Completely covered with vegetation, this island was also formed by a volcano. However, erosion has taken this island down to almost flat, and giving many homes to all types of grass and bug Pokemon among others. Inside the dense jungle, which takes up about a half of the island, there is a very small lake. There are two different forests on the island, and you can tell when you've gone from one forest to another. Besides being divided by the Diamond River, some strange force causes them to have completely different climates as well...<br />
<b><span style="color: green">The Silver Forest</span></b> - The forest which takes up a bit more than half of the island, Silver Island is named for the silver veins the leaves are adorned with. A deciduous forest, you'll mainly see flying and bug types here, due to the lack of ground vegetation. There is a rest stop somewhere in the forest, helping trainers on their way.<br />
<b><span style="color: green">The Diamond River</span></b> - A fast flowing river that cuts through the two forests, the Diamond River is named so because of the crystals in the lake bed, which cause the water to seem to sparkle. These crystals look very valuable, though the fast running currents many make them hard to reach. The river is about 8 feet deep, and 10 feet wide. Its source is the mysterious lake in the Red Forest, while it empties into the Silver Ocean.<br />
<b><span style="color: green">The Red Forest</span></b> - Quite possibly the most dangerous of all of the areas in Cascadia, the Red Forest was named after the savage conditions it provides. Many ruthless and savage Pokemon live in this dense rainforest, of which many attack without warning. There's no telling what types of Pokemon you may find here. It is said that a small freshwater lake is somewhere in this forest as well.</span>

<span style="color: green">It had been a long time coming but the time was almost here. <br />
<br />
Having spent the past few years out of trouble and drowning in the monotony of life as an adult, Zak had decided that a vacation was long overdue. Not just any old seaside vacation, though, this excursion was to be a far cry from the city life he had completely adjusted himself to since laying down the mantle of boy adventurer. He had daydreamed about this trip for the past few months, ever since he had began his research on which regions would make for the best experience. There was only one true stipulation and that was, wherever he eventually chose, he would need to be able to completely immerse himself in the natural world he truly belonged in. With this in mind, Zak decided on the Cascadia archipelago. He knew that, with the assistance of his Pokémon, he could explore the islands at his leisure and spend some quality time with his Pokémon in the wilderness. <br />
<br />
Before he knew it, the morning of the trip was upon him and Zak made all of his final checks. Weighed down by a backpack brimming with provisions, everything was in place to hit the sky. With a swift movement, he had grabbed a Pokéball from his belt and activated the release button. In a split second and a flash of crimson light, a humongous avian stands before him. Tim the Pidgeot had always been Zak's go to Pokémon when it came to long distance travel. Not only could he quite comfortably seat himself upon the bird's back, but they could always reach incredible speeds over distance too. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Tim, we've got quite a long flight ahead of us. If you need to rest at any point, let me know.&quot; Zak stroked beneath the Pidgeot's feathered mane and the bird bowed his head ever so slightly. He knew as well as Zak that the journey would be no problem for him, but he was glad to hear that he could let another of his team mates carry the load as it were. It was a good job, really, as the prospect of straddling a Slowking and swimming to the archipelago would not only be more dangerous, it would be significantly more wet.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you're a confident flyer, but take a look at this map I've sketched up. This is the Cascadia archipelago and this is going to be our destination...&quot; he pointed to a circled island on the crudely drawn map which he had labeled LILY ISLAND with three less prominent labels for the specific locations upon the island; the Silver Forest, the Red Forest and the Diamond River which separated the two through the center. The entire island sounded beautiful and he couldn't wait to explore it as much as he could. With that in mind, he knew he would have to start somewhere and that wasn't a hard decision. Having read that the Silver Forest had a rest stop, it seemed only logical to aim to find his way there and get a feel for the locale as he did so. There might be people there, people with a mind for adventure.<br />
<br />
&quot;From what I can gather, the majority of the island is covered by the forests. Let's head towards the edge of the <b>Silver Forest</b> and I will get walking from there.&quot; With the destination set and Tim ruffling his feathers in anticipation, it was time to alight and ascend. Lily Island, here we come...</span><br />

<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> Your mind is set: you'll confront this &quot;god of the mountain&quot; and bring peace to Mt Aduro. Try as he may, there's no way Kyle will stop you from doing the right thing, and he seems to have given up trying.<br />
<br />
- Man, you sure are a righteous dude. I guess it's the decent thing to do... It's against the code of professional journalism to interfere directly with ongoing events; we're meant to cover the news and that's it. But I guess I'm not really a professional yet, so I can overlook the rules for once...<br />
<br />
He tries to sound carefree but it's obvious he's terrified. Doduo looks at its Trainer in horror - at least the bird has no problems about letting its fear show.<br />
The pack of Heatmor approach you as you offer them the Iapapa Berry, but after hungrily staring at it for a while, they realize there's no way they could share it among all of them; the leader hands the Berry back to you while Meowth explains that they're thankful for your gift, but they can't accept something they're unable to split evenly. They seem like a tight family, even if maybe they're not all related - having stuck together through all the hardships inside the mountain, they've become as close as siblings.<br />
<br />
The Heatmor leader tells Meowth they know where the Great One dwells, but no Pokemon have ever made it to Its lair without permission. It lives deep within Mt Aduro, at the very heart of the volcano, from where It control the flow of magma and the isle's expansion - the Great One decides when Aduro erupts and when it rests. Heatmor says that if they hope to confront the mountain god, they better be prepared to face heavy opposition, both from Its loyal servants and the volcano itself, which the Great One controls freely, as you've just witnessed. The Flash Fire anteater stresses the dangers of opposing such a creature, but adds that if they can count on your help to do so, then they're willing to risk death to put an end to the tyranny. Suddenly...<br />
<br />
<b><i>COME TO ME, IF YOU DARE.</i></b><br />
<br />
Again the deep booming voice is heard, but this time it echoes throughout the entire cave rather than in your head, a sound so loud that the walls around you seem to tremble. Taunting you to chase it, you can only guess that the Great One is listening, which is a frightening thought - if this creature can see and hear <i>everything</i> that happens inside the volcano, there's no way you'll catch it by surprise.<br />
<br />
A rumbling sound follows the voice and two large holes open up on a nearby wall, creating tunnels that lead to parts unknown. Embers continuously escape from the hole on the left, flickering ominously, while an odd yellow smoke-like substance seeps out from the entrance on the right. Neither seem particularly welcoming...<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Pearl’s Perap</u>:</b> <i>((Welcome to the team, hope you have a great time! ^^))</i><br />
<br />
It's been quite a while since you went on an adventure. You're no rookie, having explored many different locations over the course of your journey across Fizzy Bubbles spanning several years of travelling. You've seen and experienced a lot, and after a prolonged period of rest, your adventurer spirit has grown restless again.<br />
<br />
You choose Cascadia, and the legendary Silver Forest, as your final destination - a place widely known for its unique plant life, and considered by many one of the seven wonders of Fizzy Bubbles. But unlike many others who have ventured there, you don't do so by sea, but rather by air, courtesy of your long-time partner Tim, the Shiny Pidgeot.<br />
<br />
Your partner has been carrying you across the skies of Fizzy Bubbles for quite a while now, and he's flying noticeably slower than when you left off, even though his sheer strength allows it to keep a steady altitude. You've seen some of the most incredible sights in the land during this trip, the (almost literal) bird's eye view providing a spectacle few are fortunate enough to witness - after all, not everyone is capable of raising a Flying-Type to such a degree as to allow this method of travel for very long, so in a way, you've earned it.<br />
<br />
You passed over Aduro Island, with the eponymous volcano as imposing as always, perpetually fuming and leaking red-hot lava. You flew right above the dreaded Venom Island and its ill-reputed Bane Forest, and laid eyes on the beautiful Crater Island and its world-famous beaches. And now that Tim has reached the next island, one that looks half-green and half-silver from the sky, you know you're right where you want to be. Until...<br />
<br />
A loud choir of war cries fills the air around you, and you watch in awe as <i>six</i> huge red and blue birds, as big as your own, emerge from the silver foliage to the west and surround you and Tim. All six flap their wings simultaneously and release a flurry of wind blades on sight, a practically choreographed assault that almost definitely has been praticed before, and try as he may there's no way the tired Tim can dodge them all. Several <b>Air Slash</b>es slice away at the Pidgeot's wings and torso, and one of them grazes your left shoulder leaving behind a painful cut, though luckily not deep. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for Tim's injuries, and it isn't long before he's overwhelmed by the onslaught... he finds himself unable to support your weight any longer, and before you know it you're both free-falling toward the forest below!<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Everything is fuzzy for a while; your eyes have trouble focusing, and even after they do you're unsure of where you are. Everything is a mix of green, silver and light brown... your left knee hurts like hell, so much so that you forget about your shoulder. After a while you finally begin to make sense of your surroundings: the green and silver are leaves from trees that spread as far as the eye can see; the light brown are feathers from the pair of wings that cradle you... <i>Tim!!</i><br />
<br />
Startled, you spring to your feet, only to stumble as your left knee gives out. You turn to face your partner and watch in shock as your trusty Pidgeot lies mangled on the floor, its body covered in open wounds, tainted red from the blood. One of the wings is positioned awkwardly, suggesting it might be fractured, but (for better or worse) Tim remains conscious, though short of breath. You finally piece everything together and realize that Tim must have enveloped in his wings as you both crashed, shielding you from the branches and the rocky surface of the forest ground at the expense of his own well being. Whereas your only scars from the Braviary assault are a grazed shoulder and a banged-up knee, your partner had it much, much worse...<br />
<br />
You limp over to your fallen friend in concern. You're stranded in the middle of nowhere, and someone definitely doesn't seem to want you here... you can't linger much longer! But where do you go from here?...<br />
<br />
Looking up to the sky between the foliage, you can make out six dark-blue speckles moving to your left - if those are the Braviary who attacked you they must've given up the search and are probably returning from wherever they came, at least giving you a faint sense of direction. The way they attacked in such coordinated fashion suggests human involvement, maybe there's some sort of settlement nearby...<br />
A gentle breeze then starts to blow from the direction opposite that of Braviary's destination, carrying fallen leaves with it. Most of them are the famed silver leaves that put this forest on the map, but for some reason, several others are a totally different color... pitch-black.<br />
You pick up a handful of these leaves that the wind kicked up: you keep <b>

3x Silver Leaf</b> and inspect the fourth, black one... it's not burned, but instead the entire leaf seems to have been drained of color somehow...<br />
<br />
With Tim seriously injured and no way to be certain of your current location, where do you go? Do you follow the flock of Braviary to the west in hopes of finding people? Or do you go east, the way these black leaves seem to be coming from? </span></span><br />

<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u> Electric Blue Eye</u>:</b> You remember the rules of the Tournament: Gym Leaders aren't allowed to switch out their Pokemon, but the challenger is, and you intend to make the most of it. Quagsire may have sealed most of Diego's options, but you've already laid the foundations for your next partner to take center stage - recalling the Jellicent, you send out your Snivy, who is now capable of fighting on equal footing with Sean's Water-Types on the frozen arena.<br />
<br />
When Chris materializes, Sean nods in acknowledgement, understanding that the tables have turned - Quagsire's greatest weakness is Grass, and it seems he half-expected you to send out such a Pokemon. His expression says he knows he's in for a challenge, but he doesn't seem particularly concerned; all in all, Sean's a difficult man to read.<br />
<br />
You realize the importance of keeping up the pressure, lest Chris is trapped by Encore or Yawn like Diego was - you can't afford to have your trump card be locked like that, so your only option is to give Quagsire no breathing room.<br />
<br />
You choose to start off with an undodgeable move; Magical Leaf seems like a good choice, the many projectiles certain to keep Quagsire occupied. The Snivy spins around in place, releasing several glowing leaves into the air, which quickly converge and fly toward the opponent like a rainbow waterfall. Sean is quick to act, realizing that evading the maneuver is impossible.<br />
<br />
- Stop the leaves with <b>Icy Wind</b>!<br />
<br />
A freezing gale suddenly starts blowing, millions of ice particles flowing in the wind; the strong air current meets Chris's attack and you can only watch as the leaves freeze over and harmlessly fall to the ground like crystal decorations...<br />
However, your partner immediately follows up by locking eyes with the foe, Glaring at it with a mesmerizing gaze. Quagsire, in all its adorable dopiness, is far from scared, but for some reason is fascinated by Snivy's stare, finding itself unable to do <i>anything</i> but stare back... that's when Chris takes his opening: gliding at high speed right toward the opponent while its tail glows green, the grass snake slashes Quagsire's torso with his Leaf Blade scoring a direct hit! The amphibian stumbles back in great pain - Amnesia was useless against contact moves, and the move was highly effective! The crowd erupts at the turn of events, ecstatic to see the underdog bring the fight to the Gym Leader!<br />
<br />
Sean smiles once again, admired by your display of skill.<br />
<br />
- Quagsire, counter with <b>Ice Punch</b> now that he's in range!<br />
<br />
The Water-Type is quick to obey and exact revenge; it's not exactly <i>mad</i>, but definitely mildly annoyed at Snivy's aggressiveness, almost moderately upset. It raises an ice-cold fist and slams it down on Snivy who is still struggling to stop slipping on the tricky floor. The move sends the much smaller Pokemon flying back, but Chris quickly gets back up indicating it still has some fight left in him, despite his weakness to Ice moves. If anything, his Leaf Blade hit harder than Quagsire's punch, so you're in the lead!<br />
<br />
- Well done Ethan. But I can't let you go first all the time! You're putting on quite a show, let's see if you can keep up. Quagsire, <b>Recover</b> from the hit and whip up a<b>Blizzard</b> to put the Snivy away! If it gets close, another <b>Ice Punch</b> might change his mind. </span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> Despite wanting nothing more than to reunite with your dear Ethan, who was doing really well on his tournament debut, the man's pleas get to you. You can't ignore his issue, especially since it's something you feel you can actually do something about!<br />
<br />
The elder's smile widens once again, genuinely surprised that you would refuse the ticket in favor of helping him out. Judging by his immediate reaction, you can't help but wonder how many times he's been turned down before...<br />
<br />
- Oh-oh my, are you sure? I really didn't want to trouble you dear... but if you really would like to help, it'd mean the world to me! My name's Oscar. If it's not too much to ask, could you please follow me? We live practically next door to the Pokemon Center...<br />
<br />
You watch as old man Oscar hurries outside, as if time had suddenly reversed and he was a youngster once again. You follow him outside and toward a nearby house, a simple-looking one-story building, walls painted pale yellow, with a small garden by the entrance and a considerably larger yard in the back with a pond and a rusty slide.<br />
<br />
- I built that garden from the ground up... - said Oscar with a sad voice - Dana and I had planned to start a Daycare Center when we settled down from all the traveling, but then she lost her passion for Pokemon and it never really went anywhere... Maybe one day, right?<br />
<br />
He tries to sound cheerful but he's clearly overwhelmed by an almost palpable sense of hopelessness, as if sure they'll be dead long before his wife agrees to resume their plans. He opens the front door and invites you in, then asks you to wait in the hall.<br />
<br />
- I'll be right back dear!<br />
<br />
He disappears down a flight of stairs to your right and you find yourself alone for a moment. Looking around the house, it's obvious the elder couple has been living here for a long time. The furniture has a classic, almost vintage feel to it, made of dark, solid-looking wood you assume could be mahogany. Several tomes and and small vases line the shelves of a tall bookcase, neatly arranged but dusty all over. In fact, the carpet you're standing on, despite presenting an elegant combination of brown and beige designs, clearly hasn't been vacuumed in a long time... A shame really, as the entry hall is otherwise tastefully decorated.<br />
<br />
Oscar reappears carrying something colorful in his right hand, smiling but gasping for air after climbing the stairs back up.<br />
<br />
- Sorry for the delay, took me a while to find these... Here, pick one, maybe it'll help Dana remember the good old times if she sees it...<br />
<br />
He holds out his hand and shows you four dusty, worn-looking pieces of cloth, each with a different color - you recognize them as being Blue, Green, Yellow and Pink Scarves, and it seems Oscar wants you to have one.<br />
<br />
- It's alright, you can keep it. Think of it as my way of thanking you for coming all this way... It's really all I have to offer, I'm afraid.<br />
<br />
After you've made your choice, Oscar takes you by the hand and guides down the hall all the way to the door on the far end. Pictures of a once-young couple line the walls, and it's curious to note that the portraits have been meticulously cleaned, as opposed to just about everything else. You reach a heartwarming conclusion - even though Dana seems to lack motivation to do many things (perhaps explaining why house cleaning has been neglected), the elderly couple still goes to the trouble of preserving these memories.<br />
<br />
- She's in the living room by the couch. Come on in and I'll introduce you!<br />
<br />
The two of you enter the large division, also classically decorated with antique furniture. An elaborate glass chandelier hangs from the roof and there are two old-looking couches in the center of the room, facing a small TV set you notice is turned off. An old lady is sitting on one of the couches, donning a white sleeveless dress that must have been gorgeous when it was new... some forty years ago. The woman is facing a nearby window, gazing outside with a vacant expression, and doesn't notice you until Oscar speaks up.<br />
<br />
- Dear, I'm back! And look, I brought someone along! Her name is Liza, she's a girl who came to Salin just recently and guess what... she loves Contests just as much as you do!<br />
<br />
The elderly lady remains silent for what feels like hours and finally responds in a cold, distant voice without so much as shifting her head.<br />
<br />
- Contests are dead. You're wasting your youth. Please leave.<br />
<br />
An awkward, deafening silence fills the room...<br />
What do you do? </span></span> <br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Treepandaone</u>:</b> Daryl looks on with a furious expression as you hand your Pokeballs over to Jacob with little hesitation. The fact that he doesn't openly object seems indicate Jacob has more pull than Daryl and that, luckily for you, what the former says go. You get the feeling that, if it was Daryl's call, you'd probably be left to die outside the encampment.<br />
<br />
- Thank you for your trust Matthew. We'll keep them safe. Now come on, we have to hurry and put them in quarantine!<br />
<br />
Jacob approached the front gate, followed by Daryl, and both men took their helmets off - you only now realize you never got to see their faces before. Jacob has short light brown hair and looks to be in his mid-thirties, clean shaven and with green eyes. Daryl, the taller of the two, looks slightly older, although it may be so due to his thick pitch-black beard and shoulder-length black hair; his eyes are light blue in stark contrast with his remaining facial features, and he's all in all an imposing figure. Again, thank Arceus he doesn't seem to be in charge.<br />
<br />
Jacob knocks on the metal gate and shouts to the man on the other side. For such a renowned research facility, you'd expect them to have a less archaic method of answering the door...<br />
<br />
The gate opens at the sound of Jacob's voice and he motions for you to join them. As you set foot inside the camp, you're met with the curious (and not-so-friendly) gazes of several people inside... Jacob whispers something to the scrawny man that opened the gate and he immediately takes off running towards a nearby building. Daryl doesn't linger and instead walks into a tent in the distance without a word, leaving you alone with Jacob.<br />
<br />
- I gave the order to prepare the isolation room. Like I said, if we keep them warm it usually slows down the infection, but I can't guarantee results... Electricity is in short supply and if we reroute too much power to the heating room we risk a blackout, something we can't afford. But I'm sure Psyduck will be fine!<br />
<br />
He tries to cheer you up, but it's evident he's being cautious. You wonder what their actual success rate is, but if it's all you have to go on, there's nothing else you can do other than having faith...<br />
<br />
- Try to get some rest. I won't lie: you're one of the very few capable battlers we have in camp right now, and I'm inclined to ask for your assistance with some things while Psyduck heals. We're lacking supplies but each hunting trip is a dance with death out there, only a couple of us can hold our onw against Shards. If you could join us tomorrow I'm sure it'd be a huge help... Please think it over while you recover.<br />
<br />
He points to a building to your far left and enumerates each facility in the encampment from left to right of your field of vision.<br />
<br />
- That first building over there is the dormitory, you might want to head there and get some sleep. Next to it is the medical wing for our survivors, then the Pokemon Center where the quarantine room was built, and next to that is the canteen. The large green tent in the middle, where Daryl went, is a makeshift base of operations where we run the camp and discuss most pressing matters. To its right is the only research unit we haven't dismantled; we have a handful of coworkers studying the Shards, and there's a reinforced annex behind it that is off-limits to almost everyone in camp where we keep a couple of live specimens for their research... working on living Shards is the only way for them to find a definite cure, so I can't deny them that, as much as it troubles me.<br />
<br />
He puts a hand on your shoulder and nods with determination.<br />
<br />
- I'll drop your Pokemon over at the center to start treatment and then there are some things I have to go over in the research unit, so feel free to turn in for the day. Please think over my request, it'd be great to count on you tomorrow. And have faith, everything will be fine!<br />
<br />
Jacob leaves for the Pokemon Center and you find yourself alone once more, under many inquisitive and indiscreet glares. Where you go now is your choice, although it's getting rather late and most people are returning to the dormitory. Jacob didn't mention any curfew, but you do feel exhausted, not to mention hungry...<br />
<br />
What do you do? </span></span> <br />

<b><u>The SS Leviathan Shipwreck</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>CyberBlastoise</u>:</b> <i>((A refrigeration unit is much too harmless for what I intend to put you through <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite7" alt=":p" title="Stick Out Tongue    :p" data-shortname=":p" />))</i><br />
<br />
You bank it all on Swift's cure - whatever that may be - to be found on the front part of the ship, reasoning that going back to the bloody door would be pointless backtracking. With so little to go on, you decide to try your luck and sneak behind (or rather, <i>below</i>) the horde of fully-evolved ghosts all the way to the door guarded by the green Jellicent, hiding in the undead's own mist. They do seem oblivious to their surroundings, as if in a zombified state, so maybe they won't notice you...<br />
<br />
You crouch and crawl amidst the creepy fog, and as it surrounds you from head to tow you feel your body grow colder and colder. You start shivering but press onward, trying to figure out if this is actual cold or something else entirely... the paranormal isn't meant to make sense and none of this does.<br />
One benefit of the mist is that the Jellicent really don't seem to notice you, at least the first of the six you are now carefully crawling under. But the downside is that it clouds your own vision and it's impossible to tell if there are any door nearby without raising your head to see...<br />
<br />
Heart-wrenching moans fill the corridor, and the further your progress the mroe convinced you are that what you feel isn't a simple drop in temperature at all, but an intense lingering fear that's penetrating your very core as if made of ice. The ghosts' wordless cries speak of untold suffering, misery and loss, making you wonder what happened here and who they might have been in a past life. You also wonder why Pokemon so well-known for their voratious appetite choose to dwell in a lifeless ship where the only apparent means of sustenance are glowing mushrooms... what's keeping them here?<br />
<br />
After you successfully pass under the second Jellicent, the moans appear to intensify and the ghosts' movements become more frantic and erratic (at least judging by their fins, the only part of their body you can make out through the fog). They are growing increasingly agitated for some reason... did they sense your life force, or is it something else? There's no way to tell!<br />
<br />
More importantly, do you keep crawling forward towards the door at the far end, or do you risk peeking above the mist for a nearby shortcut out of this hall? </span></span> <br />

<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> Your mind is set: you'll confront this &quot;god of the mountain&quot; and bring peace to Mt Aduro. Try as he may, there's no way Kyle will stop you from doing the right thing, and he seems to have given up trying.<br />
<br />
- Man, you sure are a righteous dude. I guess it's the decent thing to do... It's against the code of professional journalism to interfere directly with ongoing events; we're meant to cover the news and that's it. But I guess I'm not really a professional yet, so I can overlook the rules for once...<br />
<br />
He tries to sound carefree but it's obvious he's terrified. Doduo looks at its Trainer in horror - at least the bird has no problems about letting its fear show.<br />
The pack of Heatmor approach you as you offer them the Iapapa Berry, but after hungrily staring at it for a while, they realize there's no way they could share it among all of them; the leader hands the Berry back to you while Meowth explains that they're thankful for your gift, but they can't accept something they're unable to split evenly. They seem like a tight family, even if maybe they're not all related - having stuck together through all the hardships inside the mountain, they've become as close as siblings.<br />
<br />
The Heatmor leader tells Meowth they know where the Great One dwells, but no Pokemon have ever made it to Its lair without permission. It lives deep within Mt Aduro, at the very heart of the volcano, from where It control the flow of magma and the isle's expansion - the Great One decides when Aduro erupts and when it rests. Heatmor says that if they hope to confront the mountain god, they better be prepared to face heavy opposition, both from Its loyal servants and the volcano itself, which the Great One controls freely, as you've just witnessed. The Flash Fire anteater stresses the dangers of opposing such a creature, but adds that if they can count on your help to do so, then they're willing to risk death to put an end to the tyranny. Suddenly...<br />
<br />
<b><i>COME TO ME, IF YOU DARE.</i></b><br />
<br />
Again the deep booming voice is heard, but this time it echoes throughout the entire cave rather than in your head, a sound so loud that the walls around you seem to tremble. Taunting you to chase it, you can only guess that the Great One is listening, which is a frightening thought - if this creature can see and hear <i>everything</i> that happens inside the volcano, there's no way you'll catch it by surprise.<br />
<br />
A rumbling sound follows the voice and two large holes open up on a nearby wall, creating tunnels that lead to parts unknown. Embers continuously escape from the hole on the left, flickering ominously, while an odd yellow smoke-like substance seeps out from the entrance on the right. Neither seem particularly welcoming...<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">As Keith set his mind on confronting this so-called &quot;great one&quot;, Kyle didn't seem up to trying to talk him out of it. His response to Keith was seemingly carefree, but he really was doing a horrible job at hiding how terrified he really was. His Doduo, on the other hand, made no effort to hide the horrified looks on its faces.<br />
<br />
At that moment, Keith offered the Iapapa Berry to the Heatmor, but to his surprise, the leader handed it back to Keith. &quot;Huh?&quot; Keith murmured, confused by this. In response, they spoke to Meowth, who listened intently before turning to Keith.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dey say dat dey're grateful fer wat yer tryin' ta do,&quot; Meowth translated, &quot;but dey ain't got no way to split it evenly, and dey don't wanna accept nuttin' dey can't split evenly among all five o' dem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith did not respond right away, his respect for this pack of Heatmor growing by the minute. Their pack was truly close, as close as family. Keith could only assume that they were family, but in his mind, registered the possibility that they weren't related, but rather grew close to one another by enduring the hardships they've had to go through. Finally, Keith found his voice. &quot;I... Wow,&quot; he murmured. &quot;But there's gotta be a way to split this five ways- Meowth, can't you use your claws and <b>Cut</b> this into fifths?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could try,&quot; Meowth said. &quot;Can't guarantee dey'd all be da same size, though, and dat seems ta be a big ting wit dem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Point taken,&quot; sighed Keith. &quot;Still, though, I think you should try,&quot; he added, handing the berry to Meowth. &quot;These Heatmor gotta eat something.&quot;<br />
<br />
At that moment, however, the leader of the Heatmor pack spoke up again, and after a few minutes of listening, Meowth turned to Keith, to provide translation once again. &quot;Dey know where da Great One is at,&quot; Meowth said to Keith. &quot;Accordin' ta dem, though, no Pokémon's ever made it to its lair witout permission. Apparently, It lives at da very heart o' da volcano and controls da lava flow, decides when da volcano erupts, dat sort o' ting. And it's gonna be dangerous,&quot; he added nervously. &quot;But if dey can count on our help ta take on da Great One, dey're willin' ta... ta risk death ta stop da tyranny.&quot; Keith opened his mouth to say something to the pack of Heatmor-<br />
<br />
<b><i>COME TO ME, IF YOU DARE.</i></b><br />
<br />
There it was, that booming voice again. This time, however, it sounded not in Keith's head, but throughout the cave. Meowth tensed up upon hearing it, and Keith couldn't blame him, really. And then, a rumbling sound could be heard. Now Keith tensed up, and as he turned to face the source of the rumbling, he could see two holes opening up on a nearby wall- a pair of tunnels had opened up, and there was no knowing where either of them led. The hole on the left flickered ominously with embers, while the hole on the right emitted some sort of yellow smoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Well,&quot; Keith said, breaking the nervous silence. &quot;Let's do this. Meowth, you ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As I'll ever be,&quot; the Scratch Cat Pokémon replied. His voice shook with nervousness, but his face was determined.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vernon, I think you've more than deserved a break, you were amazing back there,&quot; Keith added, turning to his Tauros. &quot;Take a rest,&quot; he said, holding out the Poké Ball.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, uh, wh-which way we goin, anyways?&quot; Meowth asked, once Vernon was back in his ball.<br />
<br />
For a moment, Keith did not respond, looking back and forth between the two tunnels. Neither of them seemed particularly welcoming, though it was hard to say which of them looked less dangerous. In the end, he reasoned that the tunnel with the flickering embers might be their better bet, though exactly what his reasoning was, he could not say. It was more than a guess than anything else, if he was being completely honest with himself, but it's not like any better ways of deciding were occurring to him. Slowly, he stepped toward the left tunnel. Meowth, meanwhile, decided to try and distract himself from his nervousness by attempting to <b>Cut</b> the Iapapa Berry into fifths, as Keith had asked of him. As he had said, of course, he couldn't guarantee the pieces would all be the exact same size, but he didn't want the Heatmor to starve any more than Keith did, so he was willing to make the effort.</span></span></div>

<b><u>Boreal Wastelands</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Treepandaone</u>:</b> Daryl looks on with a furious expression as you hand your Pokeballs over to Jacob with little hesitation. The fact that he doesn't openly object seems indicate Jacob has more pull than Daryl and that, luckily for you, what the former says go. You get the feeling that, if it was Daryl's call, you'd probably be left to die outside the encampment.<br />
<br />
- Thank you for your trust Matthew. We'll keep them safe. Now come on, we have to hurry and put them in quarantine!<br />
<br />
Jacob approached the front gate, followed by Daryl, and both men took their helmets off - you only now realize you never got to see their faces before. Jacob has short light brown hair and looks to be in his mid-thirties, clean shaven and with green eyes. Daryl, the taller of the two, looks slightly older, although it may be so due to his thick pitch-black beard and shoulder-length black hair; his eyes are light blue in stark contrast with his remaining facial features, and he's all in all an imposing figure. Again, thank Arceus he doesn't seem to be in charge.<br />
<br />
Jacob knocks on the metal gate and shouts to the man on the other side. For such a renowned research facility, you'd expect them to have a less archaic method of answering the door...<br />
<br />
The gate opens at the sound of Jacob's voice and he motions for you to join them. As you set foot inside the camp, you're met with the curious (and not-so-friendly) gazes of several people inside... Jacob whispers something to the scrawny man that opened the gate and he immediately takes off running towards a nearby building. Daryl doesn't linger and instead walks into a tent in the distance without a word, leaving you alone with Jacob.<br />
<br />
- I gave the order to prepare the isolation room. Like I said, if we keep them warm it usually slows down the infection, but I can't guarantee results... Electricity is in short supply and if we reroute too much power to the heating room we risk a blackout, something we can't afford. But I'm sure Psyduck will be fine!<br />
<br />
He tries to cheer you up, but it's evident he's being cautious. You wonder what their actual success rate is, but if it's all you have to go on, there's nothing else you can do other than having faith...<br />
<br />
- Try to get some rest. I won't lie: you're one of the very few capable battlers we have in camp right now, and I'm inclined to ask for your assistance with some things while Psyduck heals. We're lacking supplies but each hunting trip is a dance with death out there, only a couple of us can hold our onw against Shards. If you could join us tomorrow I'm sure it'd be a huge help... Please think it over while you recover.<br />
<br />
He points to a building to your far left and enumerates each facility in the encampment from left to right of your field of vision.<br />
<br />
- That first building over there is the dormitory, you might want to head there and get some sleep. Next to it is the medical wing for our survivors, then the Pokemon Center where the quarantine room was built, and next to that is the canteen. The large green tent in the middle, where Daryl went, is a makeshift base of operations where we run the camp and discuss most pressing matters. To its right is the only research unit we haven't dismantled; we have a handful of coworkers studying the Shards, and there's a reinforced annex behind it that is off-limits to almost everyone in camp where we keep a couple of live specimens for their research... working on living Shards is the only way for them to find a definite cure, so I can't deny them that, as much as it troubles me.<br />
<br />
He puts a hand on your shoulder and nods with determination.<br />
<br />
- I'll drop your Pokemon over at the center to start treatment and then there are some things I have to go over in the research unit, so feel free to turn in for the day. Please think over my request, it'd be great to count on you tomorrow. And have faith, everything will be fine!<br />
<br />
Jacob leaves for the Pokemon Center and you find yourself alone once more, under many inquisitive and indiscreet glares. Where you go now is your choice, although it's getting rather late and most people are returning to the dormitory. Jacob didn't mention any curfew, but you do feel exhausted, not to mention hungry...<br />
<br />
What do you do? </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: lightblue">Matthew felt nervousness and fear as he finally let go of the Pokéball into Jacob's outstretched hand, the decision to release his Pokémon into the scientist's care in hopes of curing it of becoming whatever monstrosities those shards where was almost certainly the right one, but it was the first time he'd ever have to hand over responsibility of his Pokémon.<br />
<br />
It wasn't Matthew's first time without them before, sure, but it was under different circumstances. Depositing his companions in shops, Poke Centers, the PC system and even his adventure in <a href="http://www.serebiiforums.com/showthread.php?380915-Lyanazia-s-Recorded-History&amp;p=9775245#post9775245" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.serebiiforums.com%2Fshowthread.php%3F380915-Lyanazia-s-Recorded-History%26p%3D9775245%23post9775245&amp;hash=1c55f319fe7cdc8db7fa5ed695b825c2" rel="nofollow noopener">Lyanazia safari park</a> was covered by the assurances of the Fizzy Bubbles government. Survivors who holed up in the Hiel Research base could offer no such promises, however, and Matthew was wary abut sketchy behaviour that was often associated with similar instances; betrayal, power hungriness, bitterness, insanity. <br />
<br />
In reality, it was his only choice and Matthew let go of the sphere with hopes and wishes of full recovery, unperturbed by the sight of Daryl's glaring glances from the corner of his eye. Theories of leadership and a hierarchy crossed the trainer's mind at the driver's lack of fight to keep him out. Daryl's objections were well-documented, but his lack of pull had saved Matthew's chances of getting a safe place to stay, at now at least, and perhaps the life of his Pokémon. For that, he was extremely thankful to Jacob.<br />
<br />
“Thank you for your trust Matthew. We'll keep them safe. Now come on, we have to hurry and put them in quarantine!”<br />
<br />
Matthew gave a weak smile at the statement as he pondered on its sincerity. To him, the trust was all laden on Jacob, he had merely spoke up about owning an infected when he could've remained quiet compared to the heralded leader who saved him from battle, attempted recovery on Psyduck's injury and offered the trainer a place to stay. <br />
<br />
Scooting from the back of the vehicle and back onto the snowy canvas Matthew begun his approach of the base, following the lead of the two Hiel “natives” as they took off their helmets for the first time. Their appearance, much like anything, didn't fit the mental image the Pokémon trainer had been holding of them, his limited experience from voice and action alone far different from the facial aesthetics they had. He equated it to reading a book then seeing the characters represented on television or film. Imagination develops character in an instant, a conversation alone, but once you've seen that person the perception is destroyed. Daniel Radcliffe will always be Harry Potter, Peter Dinklage always Tyrion. <br />
<br />
Jacob knocked on the looming metal gate before shouting to the presumed man on the other side, the archaic method of opening doors was one that Matthew wouldn't expect a research base to have but it was one he could believe. Communication amongst animals where instinctively unique, so much so that no mechanical device has yet been created to translate Dolphin, Whale or Pokéspeak; we as a race can send out similar signals and potentially get replies, but we merely rebroadcast words. For the same system to be used for guarding settlements, Matthew would assume there had yet to be a Terminator-esque Shard who could transform body and speech. He shuddered as the image as the gate swung open.<br />
<br />
Following Jacob's advancements, Matthew walked into the camp to find the majority of people in the vicinity staring at him with negative looks, those of curious or unwelcoming natures, but he could understand. This was their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Bastogne" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSiege_of_Bastogne&amp;hash=74a4beec85295214463b57e26fa34415" rel="nofollow noopener">Bastogne</a> and he was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kenyon_Webster" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FDavid_Kenyon_Webster&amp;hash=ec8a1938f84fbda76a5579c2028bdc79" rel="nofollow noopener">Webster</a>, the fresh-faced wanderer who had left peace to find hell; attempting to integrate through anger at the experiences that had made them weary and closed-off. Daryl bolted for a nearby tent while Jacob conversed with another survivor, leaving Matthew to begin to search the skies before turning his attention to the the fortifications. He examined them with a curiosity for safety reasons, if he was to stay and repay his debt it would be in his best interest to point out, and perhaps fix, any gaping holes in the defense, returning back to Jacob and Daryl's conversation about losing men to fortify the area and shut the gates. <br />
<br />
“I gave the order to prepare the isolation room. Like I said, if we keep them warm it usually slows down the infection, but I can't guarantee results... Electricity is in short supply and if we reroute too much power to the heating room we risk a blackout, something we can't afford. But I'm sure Psyduck will be fine!”<br />
<br />
Jacob's sentence confirmed the other reason Matthew wasn't surprised of the rudimentary entrance procedure; a lack of power. Small generators couldn't power significant defense mechanisms of laser-targeted aim-bots, not that a research facility is expected to have such high-powered weaponry, but if they did and the roles were reversed, Matthew would've dismantled to save power a long time ago. The trainer also wished he could've helped on that front, but a lack of electric Pokémon on his team, and during any significant time on his team's history for that matter, left him with only a few Pokémon with electric moves, and even those were in short supply. <br />
<br />
“Try to get some rest. I won't lie: you're one of the very few capable battlers we have in camp right now, and I'm inclined to ask for your assistance with some things while Psyduck heals. We're lacking supplies but each hunting trip is a dance with death out there, only a couple of us can hold our own against Shards. If you could join us tomorrow I'm sure it'd be a huge help... Please think it over while you recover.”<br />
<br />
Matthew nodded as Jacob asked him to consider his proposition, but he quickly held his hand up, confirming his attendance<br />
<br />
“I don't need the night to think Jacob. I'll join your hunting party, it's the least I can do for trying with Psyduck's and shelter here at the base.”<br />
<br />
Matthew smiled as he waved Jacob to finish his speech before being shown the grounds, and relevant buildings, only frowning when the subject of live test subjects came up. Jacob too shared his concerns, but seemed to agree with the process that Matthew wasn't so sure on. Though he was never a scientific mind, the tropes from The Living Dead series was more than enough to put morals in a state of turmoil, though wondrous advancements in the field of science had come from testing. If this plague was to spread, the extinction of the human race could be followed soon after, and maybe the danger was worth a cure, or extermination device.<br />
<br />
“I'll drop your Pokemon over at the center to start treatment and then there are some things I have to go over in the research unit, so feel free to turn in for the day. Please think over my request, it'd be great to count on you tomorrow. And have faith, everything will be fine!” <br />
<br />
Faith was a powerful thing, but the veteran trainer wasn't sure it could help in this situation. As Jacob left him alone, Matthew's stomach begun to rumble and his eyes begin to droop. Trying to remember which buildings were which, he contemplated on his next move. <br />
<br />
The adventure thus far had taken a toll on him, and while he was hungry he questioned if he would even be served. After all he was new here, and if the survivors were lacking in food as they were power he would be hard pressed to take upon arrival, not to mention the fact most around him were turning in for the night. On the other hand, Jacob was still up running errands and he didn't know how much time he would get to eat in the morning before heading out to hunt.<br />

<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u> Electric Blue Eye</u>:</b> You remember the rules of the Tournament: Gym Leaders aren't allowed to switch out their Pokemon, but the challenger is, and you intend to make the most of it. Quagsire may have sealed most of Diego's options, but you've already laid the foundations for your next partner to take center stage - recalling the Jellicent, you send out your Snivy, who is now capable of fighting on equal footing with Sean's Water-Types on the frozen arena.<br />
<br />
When Chris materializes, Sean nods in acknowledgement, understanding that the tables have turned - Quagsire's greatest weakness is Grass, and it seems he half-expected you to send out such a Pokemon. His expression says he knows he's in for a challenge, but he doesn't seem particularly concerned; all in all, Sean's a difficult man to read.<br />
<br />
You realize the importance of keeping up the pressure, lest Chris is trapped by Encore or Yawn like Diego was - you can't afford to have your trump card be locked like that, so your only option is to give Quagsire no breathing room.<br />
<br />
You choose to start off with an undodgeable move; Magical Leaf seems like a good choice, the many projectiles certain to keep Quagsire occupied. The Snivy spins around in place, releasing several glowing leaves into the air, which quickly converge and fly toward the opponent like a rainbow waterfall. Sean is quick to act, realizing that evading the maneuver is impossible.<br />
<br />
- Stop the leaves with <b>Icy Wind</b>!<br />
<br />
A freezing gale suddenly starts blowing, millions of ice particles flowing in the wind; the strong air current meets Chris's attack and you can only watch as the leaves freeze over and harmlessly fall to the ground like crystal decorations...<br />
However, your partner immediately follows up by locking eyes with the foe, Glaring at it with a mesmerizing gaze. Quagsire, in all its adorable dopiness, is far from scared, but for some reason is fascinated by Snivy's stare, finding itself unable to do <i>anything</i> but stare back... that's when Chris takes his opening: gliding at high speed right toward the opponent while its tail glows green, the grass snake slashes Quagsire's torso with his Leaf Blade scoring a direct hit! The amphibian stumbles back in great pain - Amnesia was useless against contact moves, and the move was highly effective! The crowd erupts at the turn of events, ecstatic to see the underdog bring the fight to the Gym Leader!<br />
<br />
Sean smiles once again, admired by your display of skill.<br />
<br />
- Quagsire, counter with <b>Ice Punch</b> now that he's in range!<br />
<br />
The Water-Type is quick to obey and exact revenge; it's not exactly <i>mad</i>, but definitely mildly annoyed at Snivy's aggressiveness, almost moderately upset. It raises an ice-cold fist and slams it down on Snivy who is still struggling to stop slipping on the tricky floor. The move sends the much smaller Pokemon flying back, but Chris quickly gets back up indicating it still has some fight left in him, despite his weakness to Ice moves. If anything, his Leaf Blade hit harder than Quagsire's punch, so you're in the lead!<br />
<br />
- Well done Ethan. But I can't let you go first all the time! You're putting on quite a show, let's see if you can keep up. Quagsire, <b>Recover</b> from the hit and whip up a<b>Blizzard</b> to put the Snivy away! If it gets close, another <b>Ice Punch</b> might change his mind. </span></span>

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver">Chris rushed into battle doing everything that Ethan had instructed him to do, <i>That longing look to be accepted,</i> Ethan had seen it ever since he was a boy...<i>When did you get that? That drive to show me that you are a star, don’t you remember when I was 8, not even a year had passed since the incident that someone had invaded our home and stolen my beloved Eevee that you were given to me to raise as my partner. I know I was only a child, but yet I neglected you and refused to play with you, because I was afraid to get close...afraid someone would eventually come and take you away from me too. But I was a famous trainer’s son, it was expected of me to raise Pokémon ever since I was a toddler learning to crawl, so what did I do? I ran away from the pressure of it all. I ran as far as route 15 where I lost myself in a maze and cried for someone to save me, I felt sad and alone...I heard rustling in the grass, hoping it was my dad, but instead found a wild Nidorino more scared of me then I was of it, it rose its claw at me, and I thought it was the end. But then you showed up, using your vines, you saved me in the nick of time and pulled me in to safety, we ran together until we met a dead end, we were trapped but you stood in front of me. Wanting to protect me, I had ignored you and yet you still wanted me as a trainer, I stood with my feet firmly on the ground and ordered you to attack...we barely made it by the skin of our teeth, ever since then you have listened, even after I lost my way and became incredible selfish...you just stood by me...you don’t need to keep trying to get my attention. You already have it.</i><br />
<br />
The match continued with the Chris coming out in the lead, he's Magical Leaf may have been stopped cold by a cleverly met Icy Wind but he had still successfully paralyzed the foe and managed to hit a critical blow on his opponent, &quot;Great job Chris,&quot; Ethan applauded, &quot;You've got them just where we want them. Now while he recovers, use <b>Synthesis</b> to replenish any health you may have lost from that Ice Punch you received earlier, <b>Protect</b> yourself from that Blizzard and strike back with a <b>Vine Whip</b>.&quot; Ethan knew Blizzard might have been a long shot of a move for Quagsire, strong as it was; there was no denying its accuracy level was quite low but with his Snivy barely able to maneuver around the icy floor, there was no point risking it would miss.<br />
<br />
Even so, it seemed that Sean wasn't a man that liked to waste a turn, of course maybe that was just Ethan over analyzing the situation again, but everything was as if it was perfectly planned out for a reason. Ethan smiled, &quot;I guess once a teacher always a teacher isn't that right Sean? You may not be doing it on purpose but it seems to me your testing my patience.&quot; He laughed. &quot;I can't wait to see my Snivy wipe the floor with your Quagsire though; I wonder what other Pokémon you got ready for me.&quot; He said cocky, hoping to get his opponent riled up.</span></span></div>

<b><u>The Silver Forest</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Pearl’s Perap</u>:</b> <i>((Welcome to the team, hope you have a great time! ^^))</i><br />
<br />
It's been quite a while since you went on an adventure. You're no rookie, having explored many different locations over the course of your journey across Fizzy Bubbles spanning several years of travelling. You've seen and experienced a lot, and after a prolonged period of rest, your adventurer spirit has grown restless again. <br />
<br />
You choose Cascadia, and the legendary Silver Forest, as your final destination - a place widely known for its unique plant life, and considered by many one of the seven wonders of Fizzy Bubbles. But unlike many others who have ventured there, you don't do so by sea, but rather by air, courtesy of your long-time partner Tim, the Shiny Pidgeot.<br />
<br />
Your partner has been carrying you across the skies of Fizzy Bubbles for quite a while now, and he's flying noticeably slower than when you left off, even though his sheer strength allows it to keep a steady altitude. You've seen some of the most incredible sights in the land during this trip, the (almost literal) bird's eye view providing a spectacle few are fortunate enough to witness - after all, not everyone is capable of raising a Flying-Type to such a degree as to allow this method of travel for very long, so in a way, you've earned it.<br />
<br />
You passed over Aduro Island, with the eponymous volcano as imposing as always, perpetually fuming and leaking red-hot lava. You flew right above the dreaded Venom Island and its ill-reputed Bane Forest, and laid eyes on the beautiful Crater Island and its world-famous beaches. And now that Tim has reached the next island, one that looks half-green and half-silver from the sky, you know you're right where you want to be. Until...<br />
<br />
A loud choir of war cries fills the air around you, and you watch in awe as <i>six</i> huge red and blue birds, as big as your own, emerge from the silver foliage to the west and surround you and Tim. All six flap their wings simultaneously and release a flurry of wind blades on sight, a practically choreographed assault that <br />
almost definitely has been praticed before, and try as he may there's no way the tired Tim can dodge them all. Several <b>Air Slash</b>es slice away at the Pidgeot's wings and torso, and one of them grazes your left shoulder leaving behind a painful cut, though luckily not deep. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for Tim's injuries, and it isn't long before he's overwhelmed by the onslaught... he finds himself unable to support your weight any longer, and before you know it you're both free-falling toward the forest below!<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Everything is fuzzy for a while; your eyes have trouble focusing, and even after they do you're unsure of where you are. Everything is a mix of green, silver and light brown... your left knee hurts like hell, so much so that you forget about your shoulder. After a while you finally begin to make sense of your surroundings: the green and silver are leaves from trees that spread as far as the eye can see; the light brown are feathers from the pair of wings that cradle you... <i>Tim!!</i><br />
<br />
Startled, you spring to your feet, only to stumble as your left knee gives out. You turn to face your partner and watch in shock as your trusty Pidgeot lies mangled on the floor, its body covered in open wounds, tainted red from the blood. One of the wings is positioned awkwardly, suggesting it might be fractured, but (for better or worse) Tim remains conscious, though short of breath. You finally piece everything together and realize that Tim must have enveloped in his wings as you both crashed, shielding you from the branches and the rocky surface of the forest ground at the expense of his own well being. Whereas your only scars from the Braviary assault are a grazed shoulder and a banged-up knee, your partner had it much, much worse...<br />
<br />
You limp over to your fallen friend in concern. You're stranded in the middle of nowhere, and someone definitely doesn't seem to want you here... you can't linger much longer! But where do you go from here?...<br />
<br />
Looking up to the sky between the foliage, you can make out six dark-blue speckles moving to your left - if those are the Braviary who attacked you they must've given up the search and are probably returning from wherever they came, at least giving you a faint sense of direction. The way they attacked in such coordinated fashion suggests human involvement, maybe there's some sort of settlement nearby...<br />
A gentle breeze then starts to blow from the direction opposite that of Braviary's destination, carrying fallen leaves with it. Most of them are the famed silver leaves that put this forest on the map, but for some reason, several others are a totally different color... pitch-black.<br />
<br />
You pick up a handful of these leaves that the wind kicked up: you keep <b>

<br />
With Tim seriously injured and no way to be certain of your current location, where do you go? Do you follow the flock of Braviary to the west in hopes of finding people? Or do you go east, the way these black leaves seem to be coming from? </span></span>

<br />
<span style="color: green">&quot;This archipelago is gorgeous, I must say I would really love to settle on any of these islands. Lily Island isn't too far now, though, right?&quot; Zak gave the Pidgeot beneath him a reassuring pat. If Tim was tiring, he showed very little of it. He was handling himself in the skies as adeptly as he always had and it meant for a most comfortable way to get a bird's eye view of the entire island chain. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I could fly, I don't think I'd ever want to come down...&quot; The trainer spoke aloud, he wasn't sure if Tim would have even been listening, he seemed to lose himself in the flight just as his trainer longed to do. This made Zak smile, he had raised the Pidgeot from his very first egg and had always felt the biggest connection with him. The skies had always been such a safe place for Zak when he and Tim became one. As close to flying as he would ever truly get. Nothing had ever stood in their way before, neither of the pair had let it come to that. <br />
<br />
This time was much different. In his entire time training Pokémon, he had never come under such an aerial attack, having seldom encountered any airborne threats. Regaining himself as best as he could given the severity of the assault, Zak managed to get a glimpse at the attackers. He knew the type of Pokémon responsible rather well, he had aspired to one day train a Braviary of his own. He would never dream of using his team mates and friends in such a way, especially as noble a monster as Braviary. There was no time to think and no time to plan a retaliation, the attack had left what looked to him like a gash in his arm and Zak began to panic before realising there was no time even for that. Tim had began to lose his ability to fly properly, let alone get in an attack of his own. The only way was down now and all the young man could do was to try and bury himself as deep in the huge bird's feathers as he possibly could. It was no use though, with his grip slipping from Pidgeot, it wasn't long before he lost a hold on his friend and the two continued to hurtle separately towards the trees.<br />
<br />
<i>Please Arceus, I beg thee, make this one hell of a soft landing</i><br />
<br />
Through his fuzziness, Zak could just make out what he assumed was the forest around him. A combination of greens, browns and silvers surrounded him at every angle. That had been another prayer ignored and he pulled himself into a seated position. As the forest was becoming clearer around the young man, he turned to his shoulder to examine the damage. It didn't appear to still be bleeding, that was a good sign, but the fall had left him aching all over. Pushing through it would be fairly easy, he was fairly robust and always tried to be quick to bounce back. He didn't want Tim to find him in a bedraggled heap, he would have got a good laugh out of that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Tim, you alright buddy?&quot; Zak had expected the bird to have landed nearby and regained himself too. It wasn't until he truly looked at his surroundings that he noticed the mangled form before him. The injuries his Pokémon had sustained were far worse than the ones he himself had taken. If he could not see that the bird was breathing, he could have been dead. This horrified Zak, he had never seen his friend in such a way and he was lost for words. All he could do was nestle alongside his friend, try and straighten out his wing and reassure him that all would be well. Who would pull something like this? It would surely take the worst of people to execute such an attack. Unless it was an all out assault from a fellow avian aficionado? Such a thought was almost worse.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a <a href="http://www.serebiiforums.com/showthread.php?39532-Pok%E9mart-Records&amp;p=9143192#post9143192" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.serebiiforums.com%2Fshowthread.php%3F39532-Pok%25E9mart-Records%26p%3D9143192%23post9143192&amp;hash=eafb605314c52448e61a77a27ab7ad7f" rel="nofollow noopener">Super Potion (2/5)</a> here, that should take the edge off of the pain. Then it's time to rest up in your Pokéball until we can get you a full check-up.&quot; Zak smiled as best he could at the Pokémon before him, not knowing if he could even tell what was going on around him. It would be the safest option for everyone right now, Tim would not be able to defend himself or Zak if anything else was to attack and there was other Pokémon the two could depend on to help out in a fight.<br />
<br />
With medicine administered and a long rest imminent for Tim, Zak returned the sphere to his belt. He had always planned to let Tim rest once they arrived, but now he needed more than just that and that had left his trainer with a worry niggling in his mind. That would not do, though, not here. Zak was effectively in the middle of nowhere, even with his strongest ally out for the count, he knew he could not give up. It was time to get a feel for the surroundings, there could be clues that would lead him to knowing more about the people behind the attack. Though he did not have the fire power to go at them all guns blazing, he certainly wasn't going to creep away and let them get away with harming Tim, let alone himself.<br />
<br />
In the sky, the Braviary appeared as red and blue specks. They were long gone, but would not doubt lead to their masters. Zak tried to imagine what these trainers would look like, what they would be planning. Though he didn't want to follow them, he did not want to fall fowl to any other sneak attacks. A pleasing breeze begins to blow through the forest in the opposite direction, bringing with it a flurry of fallen <b>silver leaves</b>. They looked almost skeletal with their white and silver veins, like they belonged to some wizened old hag of a tree. <i>They're oddly pretty</i> Zak thought as he slid <b>three</b> into his back pocket. That was when he noticed the black leaf.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is odd...&quot; the young man murmured to himself, turning the new discovery over in his palms several times. At first he had thought it was a feather but it was definitely a leaf. It clearly wasn't burned either, these leaves were fragile enough as it was and fire would have just caused them to disintegrate well and truly. This leaf appeared to be drained of all its colouration and had looked somewhat ominous sad amongst its strangely beautiful silver counterparts. It was then that he noticed the black leaf was not alone, it had brothers speckling the leaves of the surrounding area. Wherever they were coming from, the breeze had been bringing them to here and Zak was intrigued to say the least. He knew he could not begin his investigation blind and had just the candidate to help him out. With a tap on the right disengagement button on a Leaf Ball at his waist, his helping hand appeared on the grass before him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leeeeaf.&quot; The Verdant Pokémon yawned and stretched herself out. Zak knew she loved being immersed in the forest as much as he did, not to mention she had a much better sense of smell than her trainer. Having realised she was steeped in greenery, the Leafeon begins to pad around the clearing, taking in the sights and smells of the forest around her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bette, check this leaf out. Isn't it weird?&quot; The trainer had knelt down to offer one of the black leaves to his Leafeon for inspection, &quot;You up for helping me to investigate what is causing this blackness?&quot; At this point, he did not want to alarm his young Eeveelution and inform her of the attack he had just undergone. She was naive enough to completely miss the fact he was injured, nodding furiously at the idea of exploring in her favourite kind of domain.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's settled, then, let's follow the black leaves and see where they lead us to...&quot;</span></span></div>

<br />
<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> Despite wanting nothing more than to reunite with your dear Ethan, who was doing really well on his tournament debut, the man's pleas get to you. You can't ignore his issue, especially since it's something you feel you can actually do something about!<br />
<br />
The elder's smile widens once again, genuinely surprised that you would refuse the ticket in favor of helping him out. Judging by his immediate reaction, you can't help but wonder how many times he's been turned down before...<br />
<br />
- Oh-oh my, are you sure? I really didn't want to trouble you dear... but if you really would like to help, it'd mean the world to me! My name's Oscar. If it's not too much to ask, could you please follow me? We live practically next door to the Pokemon Center...<br />
<br />
You watch as old man Oscar hurries outside, as if time had suddenly reversed and he was a youngster once again. You follow him outside and toward a nearby house, a simple-looking one-story building, walls painted pale yellow, with a small garden by the entrance and a considerably larger yard in the back with a pond and a rusty slide.<br />
<br />
- I built that garden from the ground up... - said Oscar with a sad voice - Dana and I had planned to start a Daycare Center when we settled down from all the traveling, but then she lost her passion for Pokemon and it never really went anywhere... Maybe one day, right?<br />
<br />
He tries to sound cheerful but he's clearly overwhelmed by an almost palpable sense of hopelessness, as if sure they'll be dead long before his wife agrees to resume their plans. He opens the front door and invites you in, then asks you to wait in the hall.<br />
<br />
- I'll be right back dear!<br />
<br />
He disappears down a flight of stairs to your right and you find yourself alone for a moment. Looking around the house, it's obvious the elder couple has been living here for a long time. The furniture has a classic, almost vintage feel to it, made of dark, solid-looking wood you assume could be mahogany. Several tomes and and small vases line the shelves of a tall bookcase, neatly arranged but dusty all over. In fact, the carpet you're standing on, despite presenting an elegant combination of brown and beige designs, clearly hasn't been vacuumed in a long time... A shame really, as the entry hall is otherwise tastefully decorated.<br />
<br />
Oscar reappears carrying something colorful in his right hand, smiling but gasping for air after climbing the stairs back up.<br />
<br />
- Sorry for the delay, took me a while to find these... Here, pick one, maybe it'll help Dana remember the good old times if she sees it...<br />
<br />
He holds out his hand and shows you four dusty, worn-looking pieces of cloth, each with a different color - you recognize them as being Blue, Green, Yellow and Pink Scarves, and it seems Oscar wants you to have one.<br />
<br />
- It's alright, you can keep it. Think of it as my way of thanking you for coming all this way... It's really all I have to offer, I'm afraid.<br />
<br />
After you've made your choice, Oscar takes you by the hand and guides down the hall all the way to the door on the far end. Pictures of a once-young couple line the walls, and it's curious to note that the portraits have been meticulously cleaned, as opposed to just about everything else. You reach a heartwarming conclusion - even though Dana seems to lack motivation to do many things (perhaps explaining why house cleaning has been neglected), the elderly couple still goes to the trouble of preserving these memories.<br />
<br />
- She's in the living room by the couch. Come on in and I'll introduce you!<br />
<br />
The two of you enter the large division, also classically decorated with antique furniture. An elaborate glass chandelier hangs from the roof and there are two old-looking couches in the center of the room, facing a small TV set you notice is turned off. An old lady is sitting on one of the couches, donning a white sleeveless dress that must have been gorgeous when it was new... some forty years ago. The woman is facing a nearby window, gazing outside with a vacant expression, and doesn't notice you until Oscar speaks up.<br />
<br />
- Dear, I'm back! And look, I brought someone along! Her name is Liza, she's a girl who came to Salin just recently and guess what... she loves Contests just as much as you do!<br />
<br />
The elderly lady remains silent for what feels like hours and finally responds in a cold, distant voice without so much as shifting her head.<br />
<br />
- Contests are dead. You're wasting your youth. Please leave.<br />
<br />
An awkward, deafening silence fills the room...<br />
What do you do? </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver">It was heartbreaking to see how life was so fleeting, how a single moment could change life for the better or worse...To have made plans to retire happily by running a Daycare when everything was said and done get pushed so far back…it made Liza think of her future with Ethan.<br />
<br />
What if they ever felt like this women did? They had always talked about after adventuring they’d settle down in a cottage somewhere and start a family together but if something like this would happen to them…Liza just shook her head...she couldn't allow herself to think that way.<br />
<br />
She was always the strong headed one from the pair, she refused to feel so gloom, opting to pick herself out of bed whenever a feeling of helplessness or hopelessness would try it's best to retrain her. She never let Ethan feel like he was alone in the world, and always made sure he mattered. Together or not she always remembered the good times, laughing, smiling and enjoying life. <br />
<br />
But…<i>how can you help someone when they don’t want to be helped. How can you possibly save someone from feeling so hallow, when the thing you loved more than anything is simply dead to you.</i> It was agonizing to watch this women’s husband go into such incredible lengths only to be shot down repeatedly. Liza was sure she wasn’t the only one he had invited to help convince his wife to get off of that couch and persuade her to continue living her dream.<br />
<br />
Depression was a nasty thing, evil and at most, a lethal and silent killer. Talking didn’t seem like it’d do any good. Liza was sure Oscar had already done his fair share of that. But maybe if Liza could show her…show her an appeal, it didn’t have to be perfect but at the very least capture her attention…maybe she would have chance.<br />
<br />
But how was Liza going to get Dana to watch her performance, if the women didn’t even bother to look at her?<br />
<br />
At first she didn’t know what to say, Liza didn’t know how far gone this women had gone down the rabbit hole, she held the <b>Pink Scarf</b> Oscar had so generously given to her earlier. She gripped her hand tightly around it as if it gave her some sort of strength, “Miss, Dana…” Liza spoke politely, softly, and confidently while choosing her words very carefully, “There’s honestly nothing I can say, that I’m sure your husband hasn’t said before. There’s no denying that I love contests, and though I have never competed in one, don’t understand how it must of felt when people simply stopped caring about them…but regardless if someone is there or not, that doesn’t change the fact I love them…I’m reminded of the old saying, 'If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?' well ma’am, I’m that tree…I don’t know if that makes sense, but I don’t need anyone to be there…because it’s what makes me happy…looking at your pictures on the counter I can see they once made you happy too.” Liza broke her straight gaze at the women who’s back was turned to her and looked at the old man next to her, <i>I only got one shot at this. Please forgive me.</i> giving him a sympathetic look before returning to look at Dana, “Just one appeal, that’s all I ask, you see my performance out there in your garden, and if I can’t convince you that contests are still alive and well in the hearts of trainers and Pokémon I’ll ask your wonderful husband to drop this once and for all. What do you got to lose?”<br />
<br />
Liza stood with her bold declaration, a sweat droplet evident on the side of her face. <i>What have I done…</i> Liza thought before her Litiwick’s voice entered the trainer’s mind, <i>No Mama, this had to be done, you needed to get her attention, this was the only way.</i><br />
<br />
All Liza could do was see how Dana would respond. It was all up to fate to decide.</span><br />
<br />
*Liza obtained a Pink Scarf!* <br />

<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> Neither path presented to you seems safe; not that you'd expect them to be. The God of the Mountain is calling you out, taunting you to seek Him, but He likely prefers that you die along the way...<br />
<br />
You choose the tunnel with flames over the one with yellow smoke. For no other reason than gut feeling, it seems like the right choice - or the lesser of two evils.<br />
Meowth decides to split the Iapapa Berry in equal parts, and presents a tiny fragment of the fruit to each Heatmor after Cutting it in five. The anteaters look at each other, nod and promptly devour what little is offered to them. With their Gluttonous predisposition, you can only wonder the suffering they've endured so far.<br />
<br />
Kyle and Doduo look at you in disbelief as you head to the tunnel of your choice. Waving his arms about, the self-professed reporter lets his apprehension shine through once more, while Doduo runs circles around him in a frankly comical display of panic.<br />
<br />
- Dude, come on! I know you're like this fearless ace Trainer and all, but you're choosing <i>fire</i> over smoke?! It looks literally ten times more dangerous! What if we run into a pack of Magmortar or something?!<br />
<br />
The Heatmor group walks right behind you, thoroughly ignoring Keith's pleas. Then again, fire isn't one thing that would scare them. Left with no choice, the journalist sighs and follows everyone else.<br />
<br />
The tunnel is narrow and perfectly round, as if carved on purpose for you to pass through. And it might have just been. The temperature is markedly higher inside, the air hot enough to the point where inhaling too deep becomes painful. Just as you're about to take the next step the Heatmor leader leaps in front of you, forcing you to stop... just in time to see a jet of flames spew from the left wall to the right, inches ahead of you!<br />
<br />
- See?! I told you!!<br />
<br />
On closer inspection, you notice several round holes on each side of the wall at regular intervals; five on the left and five on the right. Soon thereafter another fire stream shoots out from each of the holes, quickly subsiding, and again after a short while. A rhythmic release of flames that threatens to incinerate anything that doesn't make it across the tunnel quickly enough.<br />
<br />
Meowth tugs at your leg and says he counts more or less 5 seconds between each burst, which you quickly confirm. How can a group of nine make it across the entire tunnel in five seconds?...<br />
<br />
- Screw it, I ain't going through that! Sorry Keith, the other path is a better choice. If they both lead us to the one we're after, see you on the other side! Come on Doduo!<br />
<br />
The bird is quick to obey, wanting nothing to do with this death trap, and they both backtrack to the other tunnel. You're now down to seven, some more tolerant to fire than others, but none of you made of flames... whoever gets caught by those fire blasts is not going to end up well.<br />
<br />
Kyle and Doduo have made their choice. What about you? </span></span> <br />

<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Pearl’s Perap</u>:</b> Curiosity taking the best of you, you choose to follow the trail of black leaves to its origin with the help of your long-time partner Leafeon. Doing the best you can to ignore the pain in your leg, you watch as Bette merrily explores her surroundings and try to keep up with the Grass-Type.<br />
<br />
The wind hasn't subsided, and countless silver leaves flow in the gentle breeze, in stark contrast with the occasional black speckles in the corner of your eye. It seems you're in the right direction, as more of these dark leaves fill the forest grounds as you progress...<br />
<br />
Despite the earlier assault that almost claimed your life, the forest is now silent and peaceful. If anybody's come to track you down after knocking you off the sky, they're doing a great job at going unnoticed. The only sound you hear is that of dry leaves cracking beneath your feet and Bette's paws as you follow the trail... until a sudden rustling sound to your right makes you freeze in place.<br />
<br />
For a while, nothing happens. No sign of movement, and for a brief moment you wonder if you're starting to hear things; it was one heck of a fall after all... But just then, two figures emerge from the foliage. Two very familiar figures, and yet...<br />
<br />
Bette can't believe her eyes, and neither can you. Before you stand two other Leafeon, almost identical to your own, but their bodies are entirely gray... and their leaves black.<br />
<br />
Before you can react, both creatures suddenly lunge themselves right at Bette, slamming into her with two <b>Quick Attack</b>s that knock your unsuspecting partner to the ground! They circle the downed Leafeon as she struggles back to her feet; they are expressionless, but their actions speak volumes... these two are hostile and Bette is in trouble!<br />
<br />
What do you do?! </span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u> Electric Blue Eye</u>:</b> Matching each other blow-for-blow, Quagsire and Snivy and putting up a great fight and the crowd's eating it up! Everyone's on the edge of their seats, cheering loudly for both competitors - the excitement of seeing a certified Gym Leader in action meets the eternal love of rooting for the underdog to create an atmosphere unlike anything you ever felt. Is this how competing in the Pokemon League feels like, you wonder?...<br />
<br />
The remaining Gym Leaders watch in silence from the balcony, some clearly more enthusiastic than others, but none dare take their eyes off the match. Even the Champion himself looks on intently, expressionless but unblinking. If you got Gottfried's attention, you know you're doing exactly what was asked of you.<br />
<br />
Both Pokemon take a minute to recover from their injuries; Quagsire's Recover and Chris's Synthesis washing over the respective user's body and easing their pain. Both moves take the same time to exert their effect, and when they're done neither Pokemon wastes time springing back into action.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Sean smiles faintly as you taunt him.<br />
<br />
- But you see, it's your job to overcome me! Defeating Quagsire is your obligation. Remember, Gym Leaders are stepping stones to a greater challenge; for years, that challenge has been Gottfried. Nobody faults a Leader for losing to a capable Trainer; you won't be the first nor the last to defeat me if you win today... but how will you live with yourself if I beat you on the very first match of the Tournament? The pressure is all on your shoulders Ethan... not mine.<br />
<br />
The Water specialist is clearly trying to respond in kind, taunting you back with a remark that is true nonetheless: what will happen to your reputation if you fail on your first attempt?...<br />
<br />
Quagsire raises its hands and the temperature suddenly drops all across the arena; ice crystals form out of the air moisture, materializing and gathering above the Water Type in a swirling sphere of frost. When the amphibian spreads its arms apart so does the orb, exploding into a storm of ice that encompasses the whole battlefield, a vicious Blizzard that causes several icy pillar to protrude from the already-frozen lake.<br />
Chris is quick to react and throws his tiny hands forward, creating an impenetrable shield of green energy; the winds rage all around the Grass-Type but nothing breaks the barrier, and when the storm subsides Chris remains unharmed. Finding his opening, the Snivy releases two vines from his neck straight at the opponent, who sees the move coming and tries to counter...<br />
<br />
Ice energy gathering around its fist, Quagsire tries to punch away the incoming Vine Whip. It manages to block and partially freeze one of the grassy ropes, causing Chris to wince in pain, but the Water-Type isn't fast enough to dodge the second vine. It hits the opponent in the flank, causing it to partially lose its footing on the slippery surface of the frozen lake, and Chris is quick to pick up on the chance: he repeatedly whips Quagsire with both vines, without letting up, and only stops when the foe slips and lands on its back!<br />
<br />
A deafening sound fills the arena for a minute, until...<br />
<br />
- Quagsire is unable to battle!<br />
<br />
Sean nods in quiet acknowledgment and recalls his partner, while your Snivy pants showing some signs of fatigue. <b>Chris gains 1 Level!</b><br />
<br />
The Gym Leader quickly makes his next choice, almost automatically after storing away Quagsire's Pokeball; it's as if he'd long decided who would be following the Ground-Type, as expected of Sean's analytic nature.<br />
<br />
- Well done Ethan. Now, face the perfect foil to Quagsire's counters!<br />
<br />
A new creature materializes from its Ball, but not on the ground. Spreading its wings wide, a Pelliper appears before you and Chris, and it's instantly obvious to you that it was a natural choice... Quagsire's greatest weakness is Grass, which can be easily dealt with by Pelliper; and in turn, Pelliper is extremely vulnerable to Electric Pokemon, which Quagsire has no trouble handling!<br />
<br />
- Can you keep up your momentum? It's your move Ethan, show me you have what it takes to move on in this competition!<br />
<br />
The crowd roars, overwhelmed by the excitement Sean's words carry. You know he's just playing a role, and is secretly concerned about the Plates just as you are, but when it comes to putting on a show this man can certainly deliver.<br />
<br />
What do you do now? </span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> Dana looks at the Pink Scarf coldly, almost absent-mindedly, as you plead your case to her. When you finish, the same uncomfortable silence as before sets into the room, but something tells you the old woman isn't oblivious to what you said. Sure enough, after a while, she mutters in a faint voice, looking outside as she does.<br />
<br />
- If you are indeed that tree... they'll just cut you down.<br />
<br />
She gets up from her chair slowly, almost struggling, and walks over to the window. She addresses you again without turning to face you, as if you were simply a voice whose physical presence didn't matter at all.<br />
<br />
- I suppose I can see the tree bloom one final time before it's fed to the fire. Go ahead if you please... it will change nothing.<br />
<br />
Oscar's face lights up upon hearing his wife's words, gloom as they were; after all, she accepts watching your appeal! The old man heads for a door on the far wall and motions for you to join him. When you do, he whispers in your ear.<br />
<br />
- She never leaves the house anymore, but she'll watch your performance through the window at least... Go on dear, please do your best! If there's a chance to bring Dana back to her old self, however fleeting that moment may be, it'll mean the world to me!<br />
<br />
The garden is well-kept, the lawn is trimmed and you can only guess Oscar has been the one doing all the work. If there's any chance to brighten this man's day, you'll take it! You step outside into the sunlight, take a deep breath and look over to the window to find Dana staring blankly on the other side. This is it...<br />
<br />
What do you do? </span></span> <br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Treepandaone</u>:</b> Stomach rumbling, you decide getting some food is your top priority. It should be almost empty at this hour, but then even so, who's to say you'll get anything to eat?<br />
<br />
The camp is almost empty by now, most people having returned to the dormitory already. The few that still haven't turned in for the night look at you with apprehension briefly before shifting their gaze, avoiding you as they go on with their lives. It's only natural that they've grown so weary; you wonder when was the last time they saw a stranger. Anything from the outside world instills fear in these people, mostly because the only things out there... are Shards.<br />
<br />
You walk inside the makeshift canteen, previously a research lab like all the other buildings. Stripped of every beaker, vial and any pieces of tech, only barren tables and chairs remain in the main room. A large cooking pot fumes in the left corner, where a man absent-mindedly stirs the contents with a look of melancholy on his face. The place is dead silent, only a handful of people still present, eating without uttering a word. You approach the cook, who grunts something as he fills a plate with what you hope is soup and hands it to you nonchalantly.<br />
<br />
A TV monitor has been set on the opposite corner of the room; it's turned on but there is no sound and the image flickers and vanishes constantly, making it practically unwatchable. From what you can tell, there's a tournament being held somewhere, a Quagsire and Snivy pitted against each other in heated battle to the crowd's delight. There are definitely merrier places to be right now than in this frozen nightmare...<br />
<br />
As you expected, all of the remaining people have their eyes locked on you with suspicion written across their face. All but one.<br />
An old man with scraggly gray beard, probably in his seventies, is sitting by himself at one of the tables. He motions for you to join him while finishing his meal, and the way he looks at you seems at least less ominous as everyone else. You find yourself instinctively drawing closer to the old man, and even before you decide to sit down he holds out a moldy-looking loaf of bread.<br />
<br />
- You look beat son. Go ahead, sit down. Got a name?<br />
<br />
He coughs twice, takes a moment to catch his breath and addresses you again.<br />
<br />
- Never seen your face before, and I know everyone in this Arceus-forsaken place. New faces have it rough 'round here, won't lie. Tell me ‘bout yourself; why'd Jacob bring you in?<br />
<br />
He doesn't seem to mean any harm, but he said it himself: new people aren't welcome inside the camp and, other than Jacob, you have no idea who you can trust. Do you indulge the old man, or do you prefer to eat by yourself and head out? </span></span> <br />

<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> Neither path presented to you seems safe; not that you'd expect them to be. The God of the Mountain is calling you out, taunting you to seek Him, but He likely prefers that you die along the way...<br />
<br />
You choose the tunnel with flames over the one with yellow smoke. For no other reason than gut feeling, it seems like the right choice - or the lesser of two evils.<br />
Meowth decides to split the Iapapa Berry in equal parts, and presents a tiny fragment of the fruit to each Heatmor after Cutting it in five. The anteaters look at each other, nod and promptly devour what little is offered to them. With their Gluttonous predisposition, you can only wonder the suffering they've endured so far.<br />
<br />
Kyle and Doduo look at you in disbelief as you head to the tunnel of your choice. Waving his arms about, the self-professed reporter lets his apprehension shine through once more, while Doduo runs circles around him in a frankly comical display of panic.<br />
<br />
- Dude, come on! I know you're like this fearless ace Trainer and all, but you're choosing <i>fire</i> over smoke?! It looks literally ten times more dangerous! What if we run into a pack of Magmortar or something?!<br />
<br />
The Heatmor group walks right behind you, thoroughly ignoring Keith's pleas. Then again, fire isn't one thing that would scare them. Left with no choice, the journalist sighs and follows everyone else.<br />
<br />
The tunnel is narrow and perfectly round, as if carved on purpose for you to pass through. And it might have just been. The temperature is markedly higher inside, the air hot enough to the point where inhaling too deep becomes painful. Just as you're about to take the next step the Heatmor leader leaps in front of you, forcing you to stop... just in time to see a jet of flames spew from the left wall to the right, inches ahead of you!<br />
<br />
- See?! I told you!!<br />
<br />
On closer inspection, you notice several round holes on each side of the wall at regular intervals; five on the left and five on the right. Soon thereafter another fire stream shoots out from each of the holes, quickly subsiding, and again after a short while. A rhythmic release of flames that threatens to incinerate anything that doesn't make it across the tunnel quickly enough.<br />
<br />
Meowth tugs at your leg and says he counts more or less 5 seconds between each burst, which you quickly confirm. How can a group of nine make it across the entire tunnel in five seconds?...<br />
<br />
- Screw it, I ain't going through that! Sorry Keith, the other path is a better choice. If they both lead us to the one we're after, see you on the other side! Come on Doduo!<br />
<br />
The bird is quick to obey, wanting nothing to do with this death trap, and they both backtrack to the other tunnel. You're now down to seven, some more tolerant to fire than others, but none of you made of flames... whoever gets caught by those fire blasts is not going to end up well.<br />
<br />
Kyle and Doduo have made their choice. What about you? </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">As Keith made his way toward the tunnel with the flickering embers, Meowth finished cutting up the Iapapa Berry. Keith was not one for hording berries, the only real reason that one had even still been in his bag was because they were a favorite food of his Weezing's second head. And only the second head, for some reason- the larger head didn't care much for them. Of course, now he was probably going to start keeping a stockpile of berries in there in case of emergency... assuming he'd make it out of this place alive, anyway. Meowth handed the Iapapa slices to the Heatmor. This time, the berry was divided to their mutual satisfaction, and each one hungrily devoured their slice. Keith watched this, and his resolve to help the Heatmor intensified.<br />
<br />
Kyle, meanwhile, was more focused on the tunnel of Keith's choice, immediately protesting Keith's choice on the grounds that it looked way more dangerous than the other tunnel. &quot;Fire is something the Heatmor at least can handle,&quot; Keith replied. &quot;And if it comes to it, Vernon can copy Flash Fire with Role Play again and help out whenever necessary.&quot; Another concern of Kyle's was the possibility of encountering a pack of Magmortar. &quot;We could encounter something just as nasty down the other tunnel,&quot; was Keith's response. &quot;I highly doubt any of these tunnels are gonna be truly safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
The pack of Heatmor followed Keith, all of them ignoring Kyle, leaving the reporter no choice but to follow the group. The tunnel was narrow, and perfectly round.&quot;Wow,&quot; Meowth commented. &quot;It's like dis tunnel was made fer us ta follow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably was,&quot; Keith reminded Meowth. &quot;The Great One probably just threw these tunnels together minutes ago for the sole purpose of leading us to- wha?!&quot; For at that moment, the leader of the Heatmor pack jumped in front of Keith, forcing him to stop. And not a moment too soon, either- just inches before Keith, a blast of flames shot from the left wall to the right! Kyle was quick to get in his &quot;I told you so&quot;, while Keith inspected the walls- there were ten round holes in them at regular intervals, five to the left and five to the right, and they unleashed streams of fire in some sort of rhythm, fire that would easily incinerate anyone unfortunate enough to not make it across in time. &quot;Oh, geez,&quot; Keith murmured. &quot;That was close. Thanks, Heatmor,&quot; he added to the Fire-type who had pretty much just saved his life.<br />
<br />
&quot;I count about five seconds between blasts,&quot; Meowth stated. &quot;Dat don't seem like enough time ta make it across.&quot;<br />
<br />
That news was the final nail in the coffin as far as Kyle was concerned- he stated his intention to take the other tunnel, and he and Doduo backtracked with haste.<br />
<br />
Keith studied the fiery deathtrap before him, shaking his head. &quot;Yeah, I'm thinking you're right, Meowth,&quot; he agreed. &quot;Unless there's some way to plug up those holes, which I somewhat doubt there is, I don't see any of us making it through there without ending up extra crispy. Even if my legs weren't still feeling those damn rocks from before, I doubt I could run that fast. I might be able to make it across on Vernon, but I don't think I'm willing to risk his life on that... or mine, for that matter. I mean, he could copy Flash Fire again, but that doesn't keep the rider safe from fire. The Heatmor might be able to survive the flames, but only one of them has Flash Fire, so the others are still gonna feel something from those flames, and it's not gonna be anything good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, wat now?&quot; Meowth asked. &quot;Dere ain't nuttin' we can do about dose flames? Wat about Vernon's Ice Beam?&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith gave a chuckle. &quot;An Ice Beam?&quot; he repeated. &quot;Against flames? In a <i>volcano?</i> Meowth, that's a recipe for disaster right there. And I doubt Water attacks will fare much better... you know what I'm thinking?&quot; he said finally. &quot;I'm thinking Kyle might have the right idea here. Yeah, I say we take the other tunnel,&quot; he decided. &quot;I dunno how we'll end up getting to the Great One, but if we all want to make it to Him alive and intact, this tunnel isn't the way.&quot; Keith turned around, intending to backtrack to the other tunnel like Kyle had done, and motioned for the Heatmor to follow him.</span></span></div>

<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> Dana looks at the Pink Scarf coldly, almost absent-mindedly, as you plead your case to her. When you finish, the same uncomfortable silence as before sets into the room, but something tells you the old woman isn't oblivious to what you said. Sure enough, after a while, she mutters in a faint voice, looking outside as she does.<br />
<br />
- If you are indeed that tree... they'll just cut you down.<br />
<br />
She gets up from her chair slowly, almost struggling, and walks over to the window. She addresses you again without turning to face you, as if you were simply a voice whose physical presence didn't matter at all.<br />
<br />
- I suppose I can see the tree bloom one final time before it's fed to the fire. Go ahead if you please... it will change nothing.<br />
<br />
Oscar's face lights up upon hearing his wife's words, gloom as they were; after all, she accepts watching your appeal! The old man heads for a door on the far wall and motions for you to join him. When you do, he whispers in your ear.<br />
<br />
- She never leaves the house anymore, but she'll watch your performance through the window at least... Go on dear, please do your best! If there's a chance to bring Dana back to her old self, however fleeting that moment may be, it'll mean the world to me!<br />
<br />
The garden is well-kept, the lawn is trimmed and you can only guess Oscar has been the one doing all the work. If there's any chance to brighten this man's day, you'll take it! You step outside into the sunlight, take a deep breath and look over to the window to find Dana staring blankly on the other side. This is it...<br />
<br />
What do you do? </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver">Liza walked out of the door following the elderly man outside with the woman’s words still fresh in her mind...Liza had instructed her Litwick to return back into her ball...and tied the Pink Scarf into a bow for her long hair.<br />
<br />
With a little spring in her step, Liza took in a deep breath of air as she walked onto center stage…her heart was beating fast as she envisioned her surroundings transform from a simple grassy field into a big stadium, the roar of the crowd and cheers a little bit intimidating, despite it being all in her head. <br />
<br />
She wasn’t dressed for the performance, wearing a black skater skirt and a worn out but comfortable blue jacket Ethan had out grown- but this wasn’t about how she looked, this was about her Pokémon performing.<br />
<br />
She looked back to where Dana was looking, the rest of the crowd was faceless, blank, if Liza wasn’t so nervous she probably be a bit scared out of her wits. With her palms sweaty, Liza reached for her pokeball from her pocket, a Ghostball wrapped around a Ball Capsule with a White Smoke (A) sticker attached to it. She had never actually performed in front of anybody besides her Pokémon on occasion, Ethan would watch always sharing with her his criticism, no matter how harsh, but she knew it came from the right place.<br />
<br />
Liza looked at the crowd again and she could clearly see him, seating there, his right leg over his left, with his arms crossed, not in defiance but in waiting…waiting for the show to start, he smiled at her, his warm smile always lit her world and she no longer felt scared anymore.<br />
<br />
“Lucy, onto center stage!” Liza said as she threw the sphere high in the air, the capsule opened up producing some white smoke, for a moment nothing would happen, until a little girls laugh was heard through the air and Lucy shot out of the smoke.<br />
<br />
“Alright Lucy, this is the only shot we got, so let’s have fun with it. Let’s create a wonderful fireworks display and show them a bit of your childish side. Send an <b>Ember</b> up into the atmosphere, when they disperse and the sparks start to fall onto the floor, don’t let the grass catch fire and instead catch them with your <b>Psychic</b>, hopefully they’ll be enough to make an illusion of fireflies floating through the air, use <b>Haze</b> to make it feel like we are in an enchanted forest and then make them disappear within the fog, when you finish don’t be shy, take a bow.”<br />

<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u> Electric Blue Eye</u>:</b> Matching each other blow-for-blow, Quagsire and Snivy and putting up a great fight and the crowd's eating it up! Everyone's on the edge of their seats, cheering loudly for both competitors - the excitement of seeing a certified Gym Leader in action meets the eternal love of rooting for the underdog to create an atmosphere unlike anything you ever felt. Is this how competing in the Pokemon League feels like, you wonder?...<br />
<br />
The remaining Gym Leaders watch in silence from the balcony, some clearly more enthusiastic than others, but none dare take their eyes off the match. Even the Champion himself looks on intently, expressionless but unblinking. If you got Gottfried's attention, you know you're doing exactly what was asked of you.<br />
<br />
Both Pokemon take a minute to recover from their injuries; Quagsire's Recover and Chris's Synthesis washing over the respective user's body and easing their pain. Both moves take the same time to exert their effect, and when they're done neither Pokemon wastes time springing back into action.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Sean smiles faintly as you taunt him.<br />
<br />
- But you see, it's your job to overcome me! Defeating Quagsire is your obligation. Remember, Gym Leaders are stepping stones to a greater challenge; for years, that challenge has been Gottfried. Nobody faults a Leader for losing to a capable Trainer; you won't be the first nor the last to defeat me if you win today... but how will you live with yourself if I beat you on the very first match of the Tournament? The pressure is all on your shoulders Ethan... not mine.<br />
<br />
The Water specialist is clearly trying to respond in kind, taunting you back with a remark that is true nonetheless: what will happen to your reputation if you fail on your first attempt?...<br />
<br />
Quagsire raises its hands and the temperature suddenly drops all across the arena; ice crystals form out of the air moisture, materializing and gathering above the Water Type in a swirling sphere of frost. When the amphibian spreads its arms apart so does the orb, exploding into a storm of ice that encompasses the whole battlefield, a vicious Blizzard that causes several icy pillar to protrude from the already-frozen lake.<br />
Chris is quick to react and throws his tiny hands forward, creating an impenetrable shield of green energy; the winds rage all around the Grass-Type but nothing breaks the barrier, and when the storm subsides Chris remains unharmed. Finding his opening, the Snivy releases two vines from his neck straight at the opponent, who sees the move coming and tries to counter...<br />
<br />
Ice energy gathering around its fist, Quagsire tries to punch away the incoming Vine Whip. It manages to block and partially freeze one of the grassy ropes, causing Chris to wince in pain, but the Water-Type isn't fast enough to dodge the second vine. It hits the opponent in the flank, causing it to partially lose its footing on the slippery surface of the frozen lake, and Chris is quick to pick up on the chance: he repeatedly whips Quagsire with both vines, without letting up, and only stops when the foe slips and lands on its back!<br />
<br />
A deafening sound fills the arena for a minute, until...<br />
<br />
- Quagsire is unable to battle!<br />
<br />
Sean nods in quiet acknowledgment and recalls his partner, while your Snivy pants showing some signs of fatigue. <b>Chris gains 1 Level!</b><br />
<br />
The Gym Leader quickly makes his next choice, almost automatically after storing away Quagsire's Pokeball; it's as if he'd long decided who would be following the Ground-Type, as expected of Sean's analytic nature.<br />
<br />
- Well done Ethan. Now, face the perfect foil to Quagsire's counters!<br />
<br />
A new creature materializes from its Ball, but not on the ground. Spreading its wings wide, a Pelliper appears before you and Chris, and it's instantly obvious to you that it was a natural choice... Quagsire's greatest weakness is Grass, which can be easily dealt with by Pelliper; and in turn, Pelliper is extremely vulnerable to Electric Pokemon, which Quagsire has no trouble handling!<br />
<br />
- Can you keep up your momentum? It's your move Ethan, show me you have what it takes to move on in this competition!<br />
<br />
The crowd roars, overwhelmed by the excitement Sean's words carry. You know he's just playing a role, and is secretly concerned about the Plates just as you are, but when it comes to putting on a show this man can certainly deliver.<br />
<br />
What do you do now? </span></span>

<br />
<span style="color: silver">&quot;T-that will never happen. I’m the type of person, when I set my mind to something I won’t stop until I succeed. When I’m done fighting every last of you, I will personally ask Gottfried for a match. That’s how determined I am to show the 10 year old me that we made it, we can be number one, we are so much more than just our circumstances!&quot; His heart crying out to the 10 year old self crying in the rain, with the fire still burning of his childhood home, having lost everyone he loved…<br />
<br />
Adam was on pins and needles wondering if Chris could pull off a win against the Gym Leader’s Quagsire, unknowingly digging his claws into Ethan’s shoulder, the trainer winced from the pain just a tad, as he too watched his plan unfold...a great big smile appeared on both of their faces, including Chris’s as the ‘great wall’ fell with a loud thud that resonated throughout the speechless crowd.<br />
<br />
<b>Chris has grown from Lv.<a href="http://forums.upnetwork.net/showpost.php?p=565424&amp;postcount=1538" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.upnetwork.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D565424%26postcount%3D1538&amp;hash=da45b800cc6cee557aa223c96a4b7ef1" rel="nofollow noopener">31</a> to 32!</b><br />
<br />
The cheers that erupted felt so addictive, that Ethan needed to hear more. The trainer looked up to the balcony where the other gym leaders stood watching, some emotionless while others were more enthusiastic about watching the match, even Gottfried, with his expressionless stare couldn't look away. <i>I’m coming for you, Gottfried.</i><br />
<br />
When he turned back, it seemed Sean didn't want to give Ethan time to relax and had already planned on his next Pokémon before even recalling his Quagsire.<br />
The ball opened up revealing a Pelipper soaring high in the air.<br />
<br />
<i>This could mean trouble,</i> Ethan thought, <i>Chris won’t fair well with this opponent, so the natural thing to do is to switch…but to who? If I decide on using anybody else besides Diego right now, I’ll be locked in before finding out who Sean’s last Pokémon could be…I guess I have no other choice…</i> <br />
<br />
&quot;Return Chris,&quot; Ethan said holding out the Premier ball, &quot;Take a long rest, you my friend have deserved it!&quot; but before he could call out his next Pokémon, Sableye jumped off of his shoulder and began walking toward the field, Ethan had barely stopped him before the Sableye had crossed the line, which would declare him an a official choice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look buddy, it’s not your turn just yet, I’m sure your <i>Gravity</i> move would work wonders here, but I need to make sure my last choice is a complete surprise. Can you understand that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sab…&quot; the ghoul said reluctantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don’t worry,&quot; Ethan said as his Sableye climbed up back on his shoulder, &quot;We’ll have plenty of chances for you to do battle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Holding the Dive ball from earlier in his other palm, &quot;Diego, I need your assistances again buddy!&quot; tossing it to reintroduce his Jellicent into battle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jellicent!&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>This may take a little longer since we don’t have any super effective moves…but maybe, just maybe we can get through this.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Diego, use <b>Ominous Wind</b> to disrupt his flight patterns. Hit him with an <b>Ice Beam</b> aimed directly at his wings and make sure to keep him at bay by using <b>Dark Pulse</b>!&quot;</span></span></div>

<br />
<b><u>The Silver Forest</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Pearl’s Perap</u>:</b> Curiosity taking the best of you, you choose to follow the trail of black leaves to its origin with the help of your long-time partner Leafeon. Doing the best you can to ignore the pain in your leg, you watch as Bette merrily explores her surroundings and try to keep up with the Grass-Type.<br />
<br />
The wind hasn't subsided, and countless silver leaves flow in the gentle breeze, in stark contrast with the occasional black speckles in the corner of your eye. It seems you're in the right direction, as more of these dark leaves fill the forest grounds as you progress...<br />
<br />
Despite the earlier assault that almost claimed your life, the forest is now silent and peaceful. If anybody's come to track you down after knocking you off the sky, they're doing a great job at going unnoticed. The only sound you hear is that of dry leaves cracking beneath your feet and Bette's paws as you follow the trail... until a sudden rustling sound to your right makes you freeze in place.<br />
<br />
For a while, nothing happens. No sign of movement, and for a brief moment you wonder if you're starting to hear things; it was one heck of a fall after all... But just then, two figures emerge from the foliage. Two very familiar figures, and yet...<br />
<br />
Bette can't believe her eyes, and neither can you. Before you stand two other Leafeon, almost identical to your own, but their bodies are entirely gray... and their leaves black.<br />
<br />
Before you can react, both creatures suddenly lunge themselves right at Bette, slamming into her with two <b>Quick Attack</b>s that knock your unsuspecting partner to the ground! They circle the downed Leafeon as she struggles back to her feet; they are expressionless, but their actions speak volumes... these two are hostile and Bette is in trouble!<br />
<br />
What do you do?! </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: green">After a rather traumatic descent onto Lily Island, the peacefulness of the forest comes as a welcome respite to Zak. With Bette tasked with helping him to scout his way through the woods before him, the two press onwards amongst the foliage.<br />
<br />
After a little while, Zak begins to feel like the two are not alone. Scoping out the surroundings, nothing appears to be amiss and there is nothing of any threat in the immediate vicinity. An apparently empty and secluded forest would be enough to play tricks of the mind on even the strongest willed trainers so it began to warp Zak's sense of well-being with a horrible ease.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bette, keep yourself alert, something doesn't feel right...&quot; Zak whispered into the bushes towards his Leafeon. She would have sensed something before him, surely, but it was better to play it safe. <br />
<br />
In a heartbeat, two figures emerged from the bushes ahead. Both of them were familiar to the trainer: they were Leafeon. However, unlike Bette who stood her ground before him, the two looked as devoid of colouration as the black leaves they had discovered upon their landing in the forest. Before Zak has any chance to react, the two lunge towards his companion, launching their <b>quick</b>est of <b>attack</b>s from both sides. With the two prowling around Bette, the time for action would be now if Zak and Bette were to regain their footing against these new and peculiar foes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bette, try your best to keep these two in front of you, we don't want any more sneak attacks...&quot; Zak called out to the three Leafeon before him. He needed to introduce another Pokémon, two versus one was never going to pan out well and Bette had very little battling experience as it was. Porter might have been a good idea, he had heard of trainers who utilised entire teams of Eeveelutions but that would require him to train and synchronise the two. He had no more time for thinking and before he knew it, the trainer was clutching a Snow Ball.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, now's as good a time as any for you two to team up. Come on out, Porter!&quot; With a beam of red, a forth fox-like Pokémon appeared in the forest's clearing. With a stretch and a yawn, the Glaceon looks up to his trainer in confusion as if to say &quot;why me?&quot;, he had always preferred solitude over the heat of battle but he had no choice but to assist Zak and Bette.<br />
<br />
&quot;Porter, I want you to give Bette a <b>Helping Hand</b> and whip up an <b>Icy Wind</b> to ward off the other Leafeon... if they are indeed Leafeon. Bette, you just make a point of maneuvering yourself so you can't get attacked. Give 'em a <b>Sand Attack</b> if it helps you gain some footing and use <b>Fury Cutter</b> if they get too close to you.&quot; <br />
<br />
It had been some time since Zak had engaged in any real battling in the wilds, a part of him was nervous in the face of danger but that thirst for adventure was definitely returning. With fingers crossed, he stands back to watch as Porter enters the fray...</span><br />

<b><u>Boreal Wastelands</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Treepandaone</u>:</b> Stomach rumbling, you decide getting some food is your top priority. It should be almost empty at this hour, but then even so, who's to say you'll get anything to eat?<br />
<br />
The camp is almost empty by now, most people having returned to the dormitory already. The few that still haven't turned in for the night look at you with apprehension briefly before shifting their gaze, avoiding you as they go on with their lives. It's only natural that they've grown so weary; you wonder when was the last time they saw a stranger. Anything from the outside world instills fear in these people, mostly because the only things out there... are Shards.<br />
<br />
You walk inside the makeshift canteen, previously a research lab like all the other buildings. Stripped of every beaker, vial and any pieces of tech, only barren tables and chairs remain in the main room. A large cooking pot fumes in the left corner, where a man absent-mindedly stirs the contents with a look of melancholy on his face. The place is dead silent, only a handful of people still present, eating without uttering a word. You approach the cook, who grunts something as he fills a plate with what you hope is soup and hands it to you nonchalantly.<br />
<br />
A TV monitor has been set on the opposite corner of the room; it's turned on but there is no sound and the image flickers and vanishes constantly, making it practically unwatchable. From what you can tell, there's a tournament being held somewhere, a Quagsire and Snivy pitted against each other in heated battle to the crowd's delight. There are definitely merrier places to be right now than in this frozen nightmare...<br />
<br />
As you expected, all of the remaining people have their eyes locked on you with suspicion written across their face. All but one.<br />
An old man with scraggly gray beard, probably in his seventies, is sitting by himself at one of the tables. He motions for you to join him while finishing his meal, and the way he looks at you seems at least less ominous as everyone else. You find yourself instinctively drawing closer to the old man, and even before you decide to sit down he holds out a moldy-looking loaf of bread.<br />
<br />
- You look beat son. Go ahead, sit down. Got a name?<br />
<br />
He coughs twice, takes a moment to catch his breath and addresses you again.<br />
<br />
- Never seen your face before, and I know everyone in this Arceus-forsaken place. New faces have it rough 'round here, won't lie. Tell me ‘bout yourself; why'd Jacob bring you in?<br />
<br />
He doesn't seem to mean any harm, but he said it himself: new people aren't welcome inside the camp and, other than Jacob, you have no idea who you can trust. Do you indulge the old man, or do you prefer to eat by yourself and head out? </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: lightblue">Matthew's stomach turned and grumbled as he approached the building he knew only as the canteen; the sounds of hunger churning to culminate an audible noise only fans of cthulhu would appreciate, a low rumble to indicate just how hungry he was. He pressed his stomach, promising his feeble mind the sustenance it craved after a long arduous day battling both nature and the devious creatures it had spawned from the depths of hell. It was a question between lack of food and lack of sleep for the veteran trainer, and adventures all over the lands of Fizzy Bubbles had often dictated his preference for a “good” meal over sleep, the constant deprivation of one of the two was an almost guarantee to the point where time spent away from adventures and in his base often culminated in 14 hour sleep sessions that even Odin couldn't shake his head at and large feasts ordered from multiple sources.<br />
<br />
The camp's silence indicated just how abandoned its people were as the majority had retired to what little comfort they had in beds, Matthew's stomach the only penetration to the eerie quiet that fell over the camp, but Matthew knew it was not a peaceful one. His presence drew fleeting glances as his peripheral caught those who were making their way back to bed stare at him before gazing down at the floor once he recognized it. It was an extraordinarily uncomfortable for the trainer, his mind playing tricks that he was always being watched as his ego felt all senses turned to manual overdrive; even his breathing was controlled by being aware. <br />
<br />
Deep down he knew that a fresh face was an oddity for those living in such conditions, and another person had reminded them of the normality and freedom their situation had snatched away from them. A stranger gave no credence to anything but fears of dependency and worry, the self-perfected interests of a person in danger could not be spurned by the activity of another, and Matthew was an anomaly who offered no assurance of things getting better, only worse. He was from the outside, and only shards lived outside.<br />
<br />
Matthew hurried his pace and made it to the entrance of the canteen, noticing its markings and origins of a previous research lab like all others; the building having been rehoused and refurnished in times of need to become a pop-up kitchen were of no surprise. Only tattered walls protected a stripped-down space from the evils of nature's coldest weather, and the lack of technology or equipment gave it a lonely feeling. Matthew scanned the room instinctively as he entered, an old habit of assessing danger, as he spotted its equally desolate inhabitants mindlessly attempting to live. The cook, if you could call him that, stirred a large pot at one end while scattered individuals ate without a word to one-another. It was another desperate image that Matthew wished upon no man.<br />
<br />
He approached the cook warily and was handed a plate of liquid, one he hoped was meant to resemble soup, before turning on his heels and looking for a place to sit. There was plenty, the lack of people in the hall and baron tables and chairs gave him options, but <i>something</i> told him not to sit alone. It was a strange feeling, like he had been in this situation before. Not here but somewhere like it. <br />
<br />
Twangs of memories expressed their desire to help him remember, but nothing came forward to tell him the truth. His proposed background in the military gave hope that the scenario was the same but his mind had deceived him before, and often. The army did have canteens where all the soldiers ate meals together, but the scene before him reminded him of a prison but what were the politics like? Did both have politics involved? Questions soared through his mind to make sense of his past, but once again no answers became apparent. The armed guard that stopped him in <a href="http://www.serebiiforums.com/showthread.php?556185-Whale-Island-The-Hydro-Electric-Zone&amp;p=17022094#post17022094" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.serebiiforums.com%2Fshowthread.php%3F556185-Whale-Island-The-Hydro-Electric-Zone%26p%3D17022094%23post17022094&amp;hash=539bfeeb496be94558d2b532842d94b5" rel="nofollow noopener">Whale Island</a> questioned his service, and he had a valid point. Team Rocket had trapped him in Viridian and had delayed the start of his adventure, but his past was still fuzzy, and a single tour combined with the most basic of training would have taken at least a year and a half. Had he lied to himself for all these years? What did he really do between leaving Viridan and coming to Fizzy Bubbles?<br />
<br />
Matthew's attention was caught as an old man waved him over to sit down. He obliged, walking past the flickering TV showing broken highlights of a Pokémon Battle and suspicious stares before sitting down on the bench opposite the individual. Almost immediately, before Matthew had even sat down, the old man had offered him a piece of bread, which Matthew graciously accepted before near-snatching it out of his hand due to hunger. Thanking him profusely he begun to tear the bread into little pieces before using it to soak up the soup and throwing it down his gullet. A bit of mold was the least of his concerns right now, and at the height of an adventure he had eaten much, much worse. <br />
<br />
“Got a name? Never seen your face before, and I know everyone in this Arceus-forsaken place. New faces have it rough 'round here, won't lie. Tell me ‘bout yourself; why'd Jacob bring you in?”<br />
<br />
Matthew stopped eating to indulge the man in his questions between coughs. He saw nothing to gain by extraditing him or himself, nor lying. Presenting himself as an honest man and a hard worker might win some level of respect, even a friend, and by the sounds of it he would need one before the night was over.<br />
<br />
“Brown. Matthew Brown” he answered in short sentences between bites of his soup-soaked-roll, “Jacob found me out in the wilderness battling shards. Guess he thought he could use me. Came by looking for this place to find fossil Pokémon, now I wish I hadn't. Rough don't bother me, better than out there. What about you? Got a story to tell? I got time.”</span></span></div>

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> Reasoning that there would be no way of safely transporting everyone across the tunnel, you opt to retreat and live to fight another day; for once you agree with Kyle’s decision an decide to do the same, leading the group back to the other path instead.<br />
<br />
You approach the tunnel entrance and notice how the thick yellow smoke continues to seep out of it, crawling lazily along the ground. You peek inside; it’s hard to see much of anything in the distance, but one thing’s for sure… Kyle and Doduo are nowhere to be found! How is that possible, they only go to this tunnel a little earlier than you!<br />
<br />
The Heatmor leader goes in first, determined to get to the God of the Mountain and put an end to His tyranny; he wouldn’t have minded trying his luck in the flame corridor, but since you opted to go back, he’s probably growing inpatient… You follow the anteater in, but before you know it, Heatmor falls to his knees, coughing uncontrollably!<br />
<br />
Meowth instinctively covers his mouth and points to the walls in pure horror. You can’t quite understand what’s wrong, but then it hits you: this yellow smoke isn’t coming from any holes on the rock like in the other tunnel! Fused into the stone walls, the deformed remnants of familiar Pokemon make your heart race… countless Weezing have been <i>embedded</i> in the walls, half-melted and long-dead, doomed to spill their toxic gas for all eternity!<br />
Soon after, the remaining Heatmor drop to the floor as well, choking on the venomous gas, having failed to realize its origin as fast as you or Meowth. The group has been <span style="color: purple"><b>Poisoned</b></span> and you’re not even one third into the tunnel!<br />
<br />
Now that you know what this smoke is, a substance you’ve seen Gemini expel more times than you can count, can you find a way to make it across before the worst happens? It’s one thing to have your own Pokemon use its poison attacks, but to be on the receiving end is something completely different!<br />
<br />
The tunnel walls are riddled with the corpses of Weezing, flooding the narrow corridor with their smoke. The Heatmor have already been affected…<br />
What do you do?!</span></span> <br />

<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Pearl’s Perap</u>:</b> You wonder if these creatures are truly Leafeon; they are unlike any you’ve ever seen, devoid of color and apparently compassion… but at the same time so real, so authentic in their motions and behavior! None of this makes any sense, but you know you need to even the odds before these two things hurt Bette!<br />
<br />
Porter enters the fray looking decidedly unamused, but willing to help his kin nonetheless. He starts off by helping Bette to her feet and giving her a pep-talk that pumps her up, knowing the Glaceon is right there for her. The two Leafeon refuse to stay idle during all of this, and prepare to launch another round of Quick Attacks, this time aimed at Porter… until something causes them to pause. Raising their heads to the sky, they seem to hear a voice nobody else can…<br />
<br />
Porter isn’t about to let that opening slide and blasts a gale of frigid wind at the pair, who break out of their trance under the sharp pain of the ice move. However, they seem to give up focusing on Porter, despite being the one who just injured them, and both lock their eyes on Bette. Your own Leafeon doesn’t like the look on the enemies’ faces on bit and decides to punish them for it; she tries to kick up sand but the ground is covered by fallen leaves, making it exceedingly hard for her to hurl much of anything other than a bit of dirt…<br />
<br />
It would’ve made no difference either way. The discolored Leafeon’s eyes begin to glow simultaneously, and before you know it Bette’s entire body is covered by a similar purple glow… followed by a sharp cry of pain! Your partner squirms and crawls along the ground in excruciating agony, from some sort of invisible move… that’s when it hits you: it’s a simultaneous <b>Synchronoise</b>! The move is absolutely devastating to Pokemon who share the same type as the user, which Bette does!<br />
<br />
When the glow around her body fades, Bette is barely moving. Her breathing is shallow, and she doesn’t seem to be getting up any time soon… However, the enemies aren’t looking to stop there, as they once again lock eyes with the fallen Pokemon and prepare to unleash two more Synchronoise! For some reason they are thoroughly ignoring Porter even though he’s clearly the bigger threat… for some reason, all they seem to care about is Bette, who is already in critical condition!<br />
<br />
What do you do now?!</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u> Electric Blue Eye</u>:</b> Sean smiles at your bold statement. You’re certain he has heard his fair share of promises and vows during his tenure as Gym Leader, each eager challenger shouting to the world how they would one day become Champion. And yet, in his old age, Gottfried has remained undefeated, signifying the failure of every single one of them.<br />
<br />
-	Believe me, I would love to see you try. But a match with Gottfried isn’t what’s at stake… not in his current state.<br />
<br />
The last part of his sentence is almost a whisper that only you can hear. The Leader quickly regains focus and prepares to counter your orders, while Diego charges up for its first move.<br />
<br />
-	Take that Ominous Wind. Then <b>Agility</b> around the Ice Beam, get some <b>Payback</b> and finish with an <b>Ominous Wind</b> of your own!<br />
<br />
The undead pirate captain summons a gust of dark wind that strikes Pelliper, but the bird shakes off the hit with little concern in an impressive display of endurance. Diego tries to follow up with a pinpoint Ice Beam, but Pelliper becomes a hard target to hit in the tumultuous winds that kicked up, and the overzealous instructions make aiming at the wings much harder. Spotting its opportunity, the Water-Type flies up gaining a serious boost of speed, and the Ice Beam misses by a wide margin when it is finally fired. Looking to get retribution for the earlier Ominous Wind, the pelican surrounds itself with evil energy and slams right into your Jellicent with a powered-up Payback, dealing a frightening amount of damage!<br />
<br />
-	Having trust in your Pokemon’s resilience allows you to plan accordingly; sometimes you don’t have to dodge everything, and taking a minor hit can even turn into an advantage later on, as you can see.<br />
<br />
Sean’s right; if Pelliper had evaded that Ominous Wind his Payback wouldn’t be half as powerful…<br />
The Water-Type gains altitude again and flaps its wings vigorously, just as Diego recovers and shoots a blast of pure darkness at the foe! Dark Pulse passes through the shadow gale and finds its mark, hitting Pelliper hard, but the latter’s Ominous Wind engulfs Diego at the same time and blows him back several feet, again dealing lots of damage!<br />
<br />
The crowd is going nuts; they chant for Pelliper, then Diego with equal passion. Before you know it, half the people in the audience are cheering for Sean and the other half… is chanting your name! The feeling is indescribable, but it feels you with motivation to push forward and defeat the Gym Leader once and for all!<br />
<br />
Both Pokemon got two hits in, but Diego is in <i>much</i> worse condition… Lacking effective moves to damage the bulky Water-Type, how much longer will the Jellicent hold on?</span><br />
<br />

<br />
Smoke fills the garden as Lucy’s Pokeball springs open. A single purple flame flickers through the mist like a small beacon of hope, and when the cloud disperses the tiny Litwick is ready to put on a show. You know you have to make this count or lose Dana’s interest for good, so you create the prettiest scenario you can imagine your head and try to have Lucy bring it to life!<br />
<br />
-	Go on little one… remind my precious Dana what it’s like to amaze a crowd!<br />
<br />
Lucy pauses briefly after your orders, trying to envision the big picture in her mind before getting to work. It’s clear that she lacks experience, taking her time to position herself properly and going over all the motions in her head before she actually gets started. The Litwick’s inexperience and fear of failing her first public display are showing… can she pull it off?...<br />
<br />
The Ghost-Type starts to spin in place, releasing countless purple and orange embers into the sky. Swirling in the air, the flames dance elegantly and flicker brightly; some fade in the wind, while others soon begin to rain down on the garden like a swarm of fireflies. Oscar looks on in silence with a smile on his wrinkly face, while Dana’s expression remains unreadable on the other side of the window. For better or worse, she still hasn’t looked away…<br />
<br />
Just as the tiny embers are about to touch the carefully-trimmed blades of grass, Lucy’s eyes glow blue and time seems to pause; the sparks float just barely above the ground, while a thin layer of haze begins to cover the garden floor. The real-life painting comes together to create the illusion of a fantasy land of mist and fireflies, but it requires too much focus for Lucy to maintain and soon the illusion dispels as the exhausted Litwick catches her breath, looking anxiously at you for approval.<br />
<br />
You don’t care what Dana or anyone else might have thought of that – to you, the display was magical, brief as it may have been. Lucy managed to put together your vision perfectly, creating a utopic scenario out of a common backyard. But the purpose of the appeal was to please the old lady, and you find yourself instinctively looking at the window… only to find out Dana is gone!<br />
<br />
Oscar rushes inside and you follow; when did she decide to leave? Did you fail to impress her so badly that she lost interest midway? That was the best you could do, if that wasn’t good enough…<br />
<br />
-Oh my… Dear, are you alright? What happened?!<br />
<br />
You arrive at the living room to find Dana back in her couch, crying and sobbing uncontrollably. Oscar is by her side, concerned and at a loss for words, all in all a heartbreaking scene… You walk up to the woman, shocked by her sudden change of behavior – she seemed to be made of ice when you first introduced yourself, but now she has clearly broken… why?<br />
Suddenly she gets back up, trembling as she does, and walks over to you. She pulls you in for a hug, saying nothing for a moment, but finally whispering in your ear in between tears. <br />
<br />
-	That… That was beautiful beyond words, dear… but it can never be real again. The art is dead, it is forbidden, no matter how bright you shine. They will take that shine, the beauty and joy away, lock you up if they have to… Please, for your sake, never do this again. Contests are dead… dead!<br />
<br />
She continues to cry as she lets go and falls to her knees, covering her face with her hands. It seems she had all this sadness piled up inside of her, poorly repressed, and your wonderful appeal only served to stir up unwanted memories. Moved to tears, Dana can’t bring herself to speak another word, and Oscar sighs as he makes a revelation…<br />
<br />
-	I never wanted this to happen… I only wanted her to feel happy again. But all I did was force the wrong memories out of her! Please forgive me Liza, you shouldn’t have to witness this. The truth is… Contests in Cascadia didn’t simply fade out of fashion. They were… forbidden.<br />
<br />
Oscar helps his wife up and lovingly encourages her to sit on the couch again to regain her composure. Your stunned silence serves as incentive for the elder to elaborate on his statement, although with obvious reluctance.<br />
<br />
-	The more you know about this, the more endangered you will be. Promise me you won’t act on this knowledge, or nothing good will come to you!<br />
<br />
He clears his throat and ignores Dana’s pleading eyes. She doesn’t want you to know the truth, but Oscar feels he owes it to you after what he put you through.<br />
<br />
-	Some thirty years ago, Contests were at the height of their popularity in Salin City. They were government-sponsored events, much like the Pokemon League and other Battle competitions. But even at their peak, Contests were never half as profitable as Battles. They were a novelty, a side show at best, compared to the traditional spectacle that people had grown used to for generations. And so, despite their fervent fanbase, Cascadia’s Government declared Contests a non-profitable endeavor and shut down any official support to the activity.<br />
<br />
Dana sobs again and Oscar holds her hand, but keeps going.<br />
<br />
-	The decision didn’t sit well with the general public; even though Battles were much more popular, casual fans still enjoyed the alternative. The Government’s adamant position only served to increase Contests’ fanbase, who demanded that the events be reinstated and funded on equal footing with Pokemon Battles. It wasn’t long until unofficial Contest Halls were erected and underground competitions popped up all over Salin and Cascadia in general. Contests went from simply being abandoned to becoming an illegal activity… Those who insisted on performing without permission would be tracked down and arrested, until finally all pockets of resistance were crushed.<br />
<br />
He stops briefly, looks at a dejected Dana and whispers <i>”I’m sorry”</i> before concluding his tale.<br />
<br />
-	Dana was the most famous and successful coordinator in Cascadia, perhaps all of Fizzy Bubbles. She was one of the last symbols of hope for Contest enthusiasts, and performed to the end on any and all venues. And for that, she was punished the hardest… POLT agents crashed an illegal event and arrested her, as well as the other participants. She was only in custody for a few hours though, before the Minister of Internal Affairs himself realized that he could use her to deal the final blow to the Contest revolution. Under his orders, her lifelong partner Arcanine was apprehended, and portrayed in the media as if Dana had voluntarily handed it over, admitting defeat.<br />
<br />
Dana bursts out in tears yet again, and Oscar almost does as well. His voice swelling with emotion, he apologizes to her yet again and turns to you one final time.<br />
<br />
-	Since Arcanine was taken, Dana was never happy again. That Pokemon, and Contests in general, meant the world to her. I’ve stayed by her side the whole time, and quit my Battling career shortly thereafter; it wasn’t fair that I got to live my dream while she withered away at home… I turned to you for help because nothing I’ve done for the past thirty years have ever cheered her up. I was desperate and tired, unfairly so, but my judgment was clouded and I involved you in all of this. I am so sorry Liza. Your appeal was glorious and Dana loved it, but it also forced her to relive all of this…<br />
<br />
Suddenly Dana interrupts him, her voice faint but determined as she wipes her tears.<br />
<br />
-	What happened to me was a lesson. I endangered my Pokemon out of stubbornness, believing I could somehow overcome the machine… The system always wins. Remember that, and stay as far away from Contests as possible in Cascadia if you prize your Pokemon friends. Don’t be selfish like I was… or you’ll end up like me. I thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for showing me true love for Contests after all this time… but for your own sake, don’t ever do it again!<br />
<br />
Oscar walks over to you and again holds out his ticket for the Grad Farewell tournament where Ethan is competing.<br />
<br />
-	That Pink Scarf is yours to keep, but we have nothing else to give you. To be honest, it might be better if you forget us and never mention this to anyone… Dana no longer poses a threat, but the anti-Contest mentality remains. If you want to keep travelling Fizzy Bubbles without fear of repression, you should choose a different path... like that boy you fancy, for example?<br />
<br />
He winks and musters a smile as he waves the ticket in front of you. It seems both elders want you to move on with your life, grateful as they are for everything you did for them. Maybe leaving them behind and forgetting all of this is in your best interest…<br />
<br />
What will you do now?</span></span><br />

You decide to accept the old man’s bread and company. After all, it was the first semblance of kindness you’ve encountered since entering the camp. That, and the desolate atmosphere of the canteen is stirring up all kinds of uncomfortable, confusing thoughts about your past that you only wish were clearer...<br />
<br />
-	Matthew heh? Jacob’s always had an eye for people… although at this point, he pretty much has to take what he finds.<br />
<br />
The old man tries to chew another piece of bread with some difficulty, while pointing to the TV nearby.<br />
<br />
-	Some people have it much easier than they know. D’you think any of them over at that Tournament could survive out here, in the “real” world? I’d wager not. But you’re here, so you gotta be a survivor, and that’s what Jacob needs the most right now. He’s a fine kid with a good head on his shoulders, that one… As for me, I’m Drummond. Oldest worker on camp, and supposedly the wisest if you ask Jacob.<br />
<br />
You try to picture the elder in front of you in a lab coat, working on top secret research material, and it proves exceedingly difficult. Then again, he seems a lot more cheerful than most people you’ve come across so far, so maybe you’re underestimating Drummond.<br />
<br />
-	I was the overseer for most of the research conducted here regarding climate changes on this island. The aurora seemed to play a crucial role in the circadian rhythm of most Pokemon on Glacier Island. Now the sky is pitch-black and I, of all people, have no idea what’s going on. Some scientist I am, eh?...<br />
<br />
He reaches for the inner pocket of his dusty old coat, and pulls out something wrapped in a white piece of cloth. He places the cloth on your hand and it’s warm to the touch… You unwrap the object and it immediately starts emitting a faint glow… it’s a

-	Make no mistake about it; Jacob brought you in because you can fight. There’s no place for charity in a world like this, you’ll be expected to contribute to this community as long as you take shelter within these walls. I’m sure you’ll be going on the hunt tomorrow… you’ll need that in case things go sour. Shards hate light and heat. That thing has kept me safe every time we go out, but something tells me you’ll need it more than I do.<br />
<br />
Drummond yawns and gets up, ready to turn in for the night. He waves goodbye and leaves you with one last statement.<br />
<br />
-	See you out there tomorrow kid. Yeah, I’m coming too. I can’t fight worth jack but I know that wasteland better than anybody; I’ll find us some food alright. Be seeing you!<br />
<br />
You’re left by yourself again, and you find yourself unable to hold back a yawn as well. Seems that move works on humans too… The canteen is empty by now, and you’re feeling exhausted; compelled as you might be to continue exploring the camp, you don’t want to break curfew on your first night (if it exists), and you need to get some rest for tomorrow’s risky endeavor.<br />
<br />
Recalling the way to the dormitory, you make your way over to the bland building. Everything looks the same at this time of night, but more disturbingly, night and day don’t feel different at all. The constant darkness in the sky is unsettling, as if something was missing… as if someone went and stole all the colors that were meant to be there. The entire camp seems to have fallen asleep, not a single sound to be heard. So this is what complete nothingness feels like…<br />
<br />
There are no assigned rooms. Some are taken as you peak inside, but a handful remains vacant. You pick one at random and walk inside to find an old mattress on the floor, a dusty PC by the wall and a single lamp hanging from the ceiling. You try to switch on the light and it flickers, barely illuminating the room but meaning that there is indeed some electrical power fueling the dormitory.<br />
<br />
You’ll be going on a dangerous mission tomorrow, and tired as you are, preparations are essential. You recall how both Psyduck and Deckard are undergoing treatment, but you can’t afford to go back into the wilderness empty-handed. The PC probably won’t remain turned on for several transfers, but you might keep it running long enough for a withdrawal in case you brought nobody else along…<br />
<br />
Before you go to sleep, how will you prepare?</span></span> <br />

<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> Reasoning that there would be no way of safely transporting everyone across the tunnel, you opt to retreat and live to fight another day; for once you agree with Kyle’s decision an decide to do the same, leading the group back to the other path instead.<br />
<br />
You approach the tunnel entrance and notice how the thick yellow smoke continues to seep out of it, crawling lazily along the ground. You peek inside; it’s hard to see much of anything in the distance, but one thing’s for sure… Kyle and Doduo are nowhere to be found! How is that possible, they only go to this tunnel a little earlier than you!<br />
<br />
The Heatmor leader goes in first, determined to get to the God of the Mountain and put an end to His tyranny; he wouldn’t have minded trying his luck in the flame corridor, but since you opted to go back, he’s probably growing inpatient… You follow the anteater in, but before you know it, Heatmor falls to his knees, coughing uncontrollably!<br />
<br />
Meowth instinctively covers his mouth and points to the walls in pure horror. You can’t quite understand what’s wrong, but then it hits you: this yellow smoke isn’t coming from any holes on the rock like in the other tunnel! Fused into the stone walls, the deformed remnants of familiar Pokemon make your heart race… countless Weezing have been <i>embedded</i> in the walls, half-melted and long-dead, doomed to spill their toxic gas for all eternity!<br />
Soon after, the remaining Heatmor drop to the floor as well, choking on the venomous gas, having failed to realize its origin as fast as you or Meowth. The group has been <span style="color: purple"><b>Poisoned</b></span> and you’re not even one third into the tunnel!<br />
<br />
Now that you know what this smoke is, a substance you’ve seen Gemini expel more times than you can count, can you find a way to make it across before the worst happens? It’s one thing to have your own Pokemon use its poison attacks, but to be on the receiving end is something completely different!<br />
<br />
The tunnel walls are riddled with the corpses of Weezing, flooding the narrow corridor with their smoke. The Heatmor have already been affected…<br />
What do you do?!</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">Keith led the way out of the fiery tunnel, and peeked into the other one- the yellow smoke seeped out of it still, though oddly enough, neither Kyle nor Doduo could be found. &quot;That's odd,&quot; he remarked. &quot;They only decided to come this way a little before we did...&quot; It seemed a little ominous, but since the alternative would render them extra crispy, Keith knew this had to be the way to go.<br />
<br />
The first one through the tunnel was the Heatmor leader, clearly determined to put an end to the tyranny... but before long, Heatmor fell to his knees, coughing uncontrollably! &quot;What the-&quot; Keith started, before he heard the sound of Meowth clapping a paw to his mouth. He looked at Meowth, who was shakily pointing another paw at the walls. Keith followed Meowth's horrified gaze, and as he looked upon the walls, he couldn't see what the big deal was... at first, anyway. As he looked, it slowly dawned on Keith just what had Meowth so horrified. Fused into the stone walls were... the deformed remnants of long-dead Weezing! Dozens of them! Keith's stomach churned at the sight of his favorite Pokémon in such a state. Their corpses were giving off the yellow smoke- nay, the <b>Smog</b>! The <b>Poison Gas</b>! Keith, a longtime Poison-type Trainer, was more or less immune to this sort of thing by now (and most likely would have been even if it weren't for a certain incident from when he was seven), and Meowth was building up a tolerance by now (and the fact that he knew well enough to keep his mouth covered would surely help him out greatly), but... the Heatmor! Keith looked, but by that time, the rest of the Heatmor had all collapsed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh, balls,&quot; Keith murmured shakily. &quot;If we live to get out of here, I'm stocking the hell up on Pecha Berries, that's for damn sure... Dammit, why'd I have to trade away those Casteliacones from Christmastime...&quot; As he muttered to himself, he ran his hands along the Poké Balls on his belt. Surely one of them would contain something that could help? Godric couldn't be poisoned, but that didn't exactly do the Heatmor much good. Vernon had nothing... Helga might be able to clear out the gases with her Whirlwind, maybe... Meowth, of course, was already out and on Keith's shoulder, but essentially useless in this scenario... Aha! Maybe it was sheer foolishness to bring him to a volcanic island, but right now, as Keith plucked a Poké Ball off his belt, he knew that contained within was the Heatmor pack's best hope. He pressed the button to enlarge the ball to full size. &quot;We need your help, James,&quot; Keith said in a low, urgent voice as the ball opened up, unleashing a Vileplume into the tunnel. The Grass/Poison-type looked around at all the poisoned Heatmor, a look of worry on his face. &quot;Vile? Plume?&quot; James said. And then, the Vileplume caught sight of the walls and recoiled in horror before looking up at Keith, mouth agape, but clearly at a loss for words.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's no time to explain, James,&quot; Keith said urgently. &quot;Those Heatmor need your help. Use <b>Aromatherapy</b> to cure their poisoning. And guys,&quot; Keith added, now addressing the pack of Heatmor. &quot;Once James here's cured your poisoning, do your best to keep your mouths covered so you don't breathe in the poisonous gases. Meowth and I will be alright, but if any of you get poisoned again, ask James to use Aromatherapy again, he'll be glad to do so.&quot; He then glanced at his Vileplume. &quot;Won't he?&quot; he added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Plume,&quot; James nodded. Hedwig, Keith's Crobat, only took orders from Keith, and nobody else. Even if Keith told her to obey someone else, it would be pretty much the only direct order from Keith Hedwig would take issue with. Well, that was Hedwig, and this is James, and James had no problems taking orders from others. He turned to the Vileplume and tilted his head, preparing to unleash the healing fragrance from his flower. Meowth was now focused on keeping his mouth covered so as to not breathe in the poisonous gases. Keith was feeling a bit more confident about this tunnel, even though he had no reliable means of preventing the Heatmor from getting poisoned again. If he had on him either of his Pokémon that knew Safeguard, he'd have brought that out as well. Alas, he deemed it risky enough to bring James, and therefore opted to not bring Pomona, his female Ivysaur, as well. And Stewie? Trusting that Shadow Ledian with their lives? Keith would be hesitant to consider it even if he did bring Stewie with him. Anyway, the fact remained that Keith was feeling more confident about this tunnel. Thanks to James, the Smog and Poison Gas wouldn't mean immediate death, and its effects could at least be dealt with. It was far from ideal, but it was closer to it than that other tunnel at the very least.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Pearl’s Perap</u>:</b> You wonder if these creatures are truly Leafeon; they are unlike any you’ve ever seen, devoid of color and apparently compassion… but at the same time so real, so authentic in their motions and behavior! None of this makes any sense, but you know you need to even the odds before these two things hurt Bette!<br />
<br />
Porter enters the fray looking decidedly unamused, but willing to help his kin nonetheless. He starts off by helping Bette to her feet and giving her a pep-talk that pumps her up, knowing the Glaceon is right there for her. The two Leafeon refuse to stay idle during all of this, and prepare to launch another round of Quick Attacks, this time aimed at Porter… until something causes them to pause. Raising their heads to the sky, they seem to hear a voice nobody else can…<br />
<br />
Porter isn’t about to let that opening slide and blasts a gale of frigid wind at the pair, who break out of their trance under the sharp pain of the ice move. However, they seem to give up focusing on Porter, despite being the one who just injured them, and both lock their eyes on Bette. Your own Leafeon doesn’t like the look on the enemies’ faces on bit and decides to punish them for it; she tries to kick up sand but the ground is covered by fallen leaves, making it exceedingly hard for her to hurl much of anything other than a bit of dirt…<br />
<br />
It would’ve made no difference either way. The discolored Leafeon’s eyes begin to glow simultaneously, and before you know it Bette’s entire body is covered by a similar purple glow… followed by a sharp cry of pain! Your partner squirms and crawls along the ground in excruciating agony, from some sort of invisible move… that’s when it hits you: it’s a simultaneous <b>Synchronoise</b>! The move is absolutely devastating to Pokemon who share the same type as the user, which Bette does!<br />
<br />
When the glow around her body fades, Bette is barely moving. Her breathing is shallow, and she doesn’t seem to be getting up any time soon… However, the enemies aren’t looking to stop there, as they once again lock eyes with the fallen Pokemon and prepare to unleash two more Synchronoise! For some reason they are thoroughly ignoring Porter even though he’s clearly the bigger threat… for some reason, all they seem to care about is Bette, who is already in critical condition!<br />

It was not that he was opposed to a good old fashioned Pokémon battle, he just preferred a little decorum... something you seldom find when encountering Pokémon in their natural wilds. <br />
<br />
In an instant, Porter crosses to Bette to offer her encouragement for the battle ahead and the two stand to face their all too similar foes side by side. The attacking Leafeon don't appear to be all too phased by the Glaceon joining the fray and begin to muster their next assault just for his benefit. <br />
<br />
&quot;Porter, wat...&quot; Zak begins but notices something quite peculiar. The Leafeon appear to have stopped in their tracks, listening out. All around the five, the breeze continues to bluster through the forest, whatever the two were listening to was beyond Zak's zone of hearing and didn't seem to have pricked the ears of his pair of vulpine companions either. With an opening set before him, Porter is quick to harness the breeze and send an icy wind at his foes, damaging the two simultaneously.<br />

&quot;Great job, Porter.&quot; Zak smiled over at the Glaceon, giving him a thumbs up. Though the battle was far from over, the move had been a success. Little could be said for Bette's defence, her sand attack creating a rush of flailing leaves and a spatter of dust. Not exactly the most combative measure, the attack appears to have merely focused the wrath of the Leafeon solely on Bette. Leaving their focus on Porter, both Leafeon's eyes begin to glow in unison and the same becomes true for Bette's entire body, all bathed in hues of purple. In a heartbeat, the moves effects become clear to the trainer as he can do nothing but watch, mouth agape, as the Leafeon cries out in pain and begins to crawl along the ground on her belly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bette, hang in there, girl. We'll get you out of this mess...&quot; Zak cried out to his Leafeon as it dawned on him what the attacks had been. The two had both used <b>Synchronise</b>, an attack known to cause an increase in damage to Pokémon who's typing is the same as that of the foe. At least that meant that the two Pokémon were indeed true Leafeon... or at least had been at some point in the past. That would have to factor in to Zak's strategy, he knew that, especially with what he was now seeing before him. As the glow subsided around Bette, she slumps to the ground, barely moving a muscle. With her breathing unnaturally shallow and no inkling in the slightest that she is able to continue, the trainer decides that he needs to act and he needs to act fast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Porter, those two Leafeon are not going to give up.&quot; Zak shouted over to the Glaceon to grab his attention, &quot;We're going to have to get Bette to safety. Are you prepared to take on both of these... things?&quot;<br />
<br />
With a nod of confirmation, Porter resumes a battle stance before the Leafeon to await his orders, &quot;Get up close to the two of them and bare your teeth. Show 'em you mean business and <b>Bite</b> them if need be. The moment you get a chance, send them another taste of your <b>Icy Wind</b>. We'll show 'em not to mess with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
With Porter's commands issued, Zak grasps for the spheres adorning his belt and grabs a hold of the second Leaf Ball on his belt and begins a headlong dash at the Leafeon. <i>I need to get Bette out of danger, be that into her Pokéball or scoop her up in my arms, I just need to get to her first...</i></span><br />

<br />
<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> <i> ((Record marker: <b>5 of 6</b> in-hand Pokemon declared – Nidoking, Meowth, Hariyama, Tauros, Vileplume.))</i><br />
<br />
Some quick-thinking reminds you of a Pokemon with all the tools to get you through this tunnel safely. James the Vileplume is not only immune to the poisonous gas, he has the ability to heal the entire group of Heatmor with one move, making him the perfect solution to your problem!<br />
<br />
The massive flower on James’s head emits a cloud of its own, light green and with a fragrance so intense that it even cancels the stench of Weezing’s smoke! The aroma washes over the ill Heatmor, and soon after inhaling it they get back to their feet, cured of their poison! Your plan seems to have worked to perfection, but the only way to prevent another mass-poisoning is for James to continuously release Aromatherapy while you all cover your mouths. Realizing you can’t linger in this corridor for much longer, you all dash to the exit on the other side, while your Grass-Type partner does his best to keep his healing technique going!<br />
<br />
The further in you run, the more dead Weezing you spot stuck in the walls, and even young Koffing too... It’s as if this place was once crawling with the species until the God of Mountain deemed them unfit to live in the mountain, just like he’s doing with so many other species, including the Heatmor! The more you see of this creature’s cruelty, the angrier and more determined to face Him you become!<br />
<br />
After a while, you literally start to see the light at the end of the tunnel – an eerie orange light… James is getting tired but successfully sees you all to the exit, stopping to catch his breath just as the last Heatmor walks outside. You owe him big time, if you hadn’t brought him along who knows what might’ve happened back there!<br />
Meowth is next to exit the tunnel and you follow close behind. But instead of finding the self-professed “Great One”, you find yourself in yet another empty cave… this one larger than all others before it, but something’s off… there’s no ground to stand on!<br />
<br />
Indeed, the rocky floor of the tunnel ends abruptly, and before you stands a sprawling lava pool! The boiling-hot magma bubbles and rumbles ominously, threatening to instantly consume anyone unfortunate enough to fall in… Meowth tugs at your leg and points to the other side of the pool, and you notice another opening on the far wall. That has to be the way out of here, but first you have to overcome yet another of the God’s challenges!<br />
<br />
Upon closer inspection, you spot tiny rock platforms rise and submerge randomly across the pool… it seems impossible to tell where the next platform appears, but they always do so close to each other, as if inviting you to leap from stone to stone! There is only room for one creature, human or Pokemon, to stand on a platform at any given time… and judging by how quickly they’re swallowed by the liquid fire, standing idly on any of them isn’t an option!<br />
<br />
You scramble your head looking for any strategies that might make this trip easier… How will you move your party safely across the deadly lake?</span></span> <br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Pearl’s Perap</u>:</b> <i>((You can order up to 3 moves each round. <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite2" alt=";)" title="Wink    ;)" data-shortname=";)" /> ))</i><br />
<br />
Realizing the foes are only interested in targeting Bette, for whatever reason, you switch up your strategy and have Porter take charge of the battle. Getting your precious Leafeon to safety is your top priority!<br />
<br />
Retrieving the empty Leaf Ball from your belt, you make a run for it in an attempt to get closer to the fallen Bette so you can recall her to safety. At the same time, Porter jumps at one of the gray Leafeon and sinks his fangs into the foe’s torso, making it cry in pain!<br />
However, the second opponent tracks your movement and leaps in front of you, blocking the path to Bette! The Leafeon’s black tail straightens and sharpens while the creature stares at you with danger-filled eyes… and jumps straight at you! It’s trying to hit you with <b>Leaf Blade</b>!<br />
<br />
Porter turns around in alarm but is much too late to react; the sword-like leaf spins in the air and just as the edge approaches your neck… a blast of wind pushes the enemy back, making its tail miss you by mere inches! What just happened?<br />
<br />
You turn to face your savior but see nobody at first… until a shadow from <i>above</i> passes through the clearing. Looking up your eyes widen in surprise as they spot one of the Braviary that attacked you earlier circling the battlefield! When the large bird starts descending however, you realize it carries a rider this time. Braviary lands next to you and from its back leaps a dark-skinned man, dressed with animal pelts around his waste and wearing a bone necklace. Barefooted and sporting red facepaint with a tribal design, you can only assume him to be a local, probably an inhabitant from a nearby village. But if he owns this Braviary, does this mean he was responsible for attacking and almost killing you earlier?!<br />
<br />
-	You cannot face them alone. Many have tried, all have failed. – he says in a deep voice, pointing at his necklace.<br />
<br />
Braviary takes to the sky again and releases an <b>Air Slash</b> at the Leafeon who nearly beheaded you, sending it tumbling back several feet and almost knocking it out! Its partner looks on in concern, and Porter takes the opportunity to blast it with another Icy Wind at point-blank range, dealing heavy damage!<br />
<br />
The two gray Leafeon step back and regroup, assessing the situation after the unexpected developments. Their eyes remain locked on the hurt Bette, but they seem to realize how hard it will be to get to her now… <br />
Still, can you trust this man? After all, if your assumption is correct, he was responsible for assaulting you before and severely injuring Tim! Can you rely on him?<br />
<br />
What do you do now?</span></span><br />

<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> <i> ((Record marker: <b>5 of 6</b> in-hand Pokemon declared – Nidoking, Meowth, Hariyama, Tauros, Vileplume.))</i><br />
<br />
Some quick-thinking reminds you of a Pokemon with all the tools to get you through this tunnel safely. James the Vileplume is not only immune to the poisonous gas, he has the ability to heal the entire group of Heatmor with one move, making him the perfect solution to your problem!<br />
<br />
The massive flower on James’s head emits a cloud of its own, light green and with a fragrance so intense that it even cancels the stench of Weezing’s smoke! The aroma washes over the ill Heatmor, and soon after inhaling it they get back to their feet, cured of their poison! Ypur plan seems to have worked to perfection, but the only way to prevent another mass-poisoning is for James to continuously release Aromatherapy while you all cover your mouths. Realizing you can’t linger in this corridor for much longer, you all dash to exit on the other side, while your Grass-Type partner does his best to keep his healing technique going!<br />
<br />
The further in you run, the more dead Weezing you spot stuck on the walls, and even Koffing too... It’s as if this place was once crawling with the species until the God of Mountain deemed them unfit to live in the mountain, just like he’s doing with so many other species, including the Heatmor! The more you see of this creature’s cruelty, the angrier and more determined to face Him you become!<br />
<br />
After a while, you literally start to see the light at the end of the tunnel – an eerie orange light… James is getting tired but successfully sees you all to the exit, stopping to catch his breath just as the last Heatmor walks outside. You owe him big time, if you hadn’t brought him along who knows what might’ve happened back there!<br />
Meowth is next to exit the tunnel and you follow close behind. But instead of finding the self-professed “Great One”, you find yourself in yet another empty cave… this one larger than all others before it, but something’s off… there’s no ground to stand on!!<br />
<br />
Indeed, the rocky floor of the tunnel ends abruptly, and before you stands a sprawling lava pool! The boiling-hot magma bubbles and rumbles ominously, threatening to instantly carbonize anyone unfortunate enough to fall in… Meowth tugs at your leg and points to the other side of the pool, and you notice another opening on the far wall! That has to be the way out of here, but first you have to overcome yet another of the God’s challenges!<br />
<br />
Upon closer inspection, you spot tiny rock platforms rise and submerge randomly across the pool… it seems impossible to tell where the next platform appears, but they always do so close to each other, as if inviting you to leap from stone to stone! There is only room for one creature, human or Pokemon, to stand on a platform at any given time… and judging by how quickly they’re swallowed by the liquid fire, standing idly on any of them isn’t an option!<br />
<br />
You scramble your head looking for any strategies that might make this trip easier… How will you move your party safely across the deadly lake?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">James set to work immediately, blasting a pale green cloud into the air, cancelling out the stink of the poisonous gas, and curing the Heatmor of their poisoning. Keith and Meowth sighed in relief, but as James turned to look urgently at Keith, the Poison-type Trainer realized one potential issue- the only way that the Heatmor were gonna stay healthy, the Vileplume had to keep putting out Aromatherapy constantly, and that wouldn't last too long.<br />
<br />
Keith nodded in understanding, then addressed the group as a whole. &quot;What are we all waiting for, then?&quot; he said. &quot;Run!&quot;<br />
<br />
And run they did! Keith, James, and all five Heatmor made a mad dash through the tunnel (Meowth was still in his usual spot on Keith's shoulder), as the Vileplume continued to let off the healing fragrance to fend off the poisonous gases. And the further in they got, the more dead Weezing seemed to make up the wall. And soon, Keith could even see the grotesquely mangled corpses of Koffing joining their evolved form. As Keith ran, he said nothing, but if Meowth was looking at the fiery look in Keith's eyes right now, he'd recoil instinctively out of fear, for Keith looked pissed. This cave was a volcano, just like the Fiery Path in Mt. Chimney back in Hoenn... Koffing and Weezing must have thrived in this cave at one point, but this... it was clear that they were of more use to the Great One dead than alive, useful only for Him to kill and build into the wall for use as weaponry. The thought made Keith's blood boil, and his desire to confront this thing increased by the minute.<br />
<br />
Soon enough, the end of the tunnel came into sight, albeit marked by an ominous orange light. Keith glanced down at his Vileplume- James was looking tired but determined, and was still determinedly running for the exit, blasting out Aromatherapy clouds all the while. And finally, they exited the tunnel, with James stopping to catch his breath. And soon, Keith stopped as well, after seeing what lay before them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa,&quot; Meowth murmured.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa&quot; was right. The rocky floor came to an abrupt end before them, replaced by a huge pool of boiling hot lava! &quot;Holy Cacnea needles,&quot; Keith murmured. &quot;This thing is huge!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look!&quot; Meowth exclaimed suddenly, pointing to the other end. Keith looked where Meowth was pointing, and saw an opening in the opposite wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;The way out,&quot; Keith murmured. &quot;But how to get there?&quot; As he said this, he noticed small platforms of rock rising and falling in random spots all across the pool. They didn't seem to have any sort of pattern to them, other than the fact that one would only rise up in close proximity to where another one was falling. And they didn't stay up long enough to stand on them idly for any amount of time, either, so jumping across on them would require luck and quick thinking in equal measure.<br />
<br />
&quot;How's we gonna tackle dis?&quot; Meowth asked. &quot;I don't suppose youse brought Hedwig?&quot; he added hopefully.<br />
<br />
Keith shook his head. &quot;Nope,&quot; he sighed. &quot;Didn't bring Luna or Batrach, either,&quot; he added, before Meowth could ask about Keith's Swoobat and Tranquill, respectively. &quot;It's a shame- something with Fly could help us bypass this puzzle easily... OK, lemme think...&quot; he muttered. &quot;Fly's out of the question... Teleport, too, I didn't bring Hebenon or Lily... And somehow, I'm not liking the idea of any of us taking our chances with those rock platforms. They seem like the obvious choice for getting through here- and that's exactly what has me worried.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh?&quot; Meowth asked in mild confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Great One wants us to come to Him,&quot; Keith explained, &quot;but I have the feeling He'd much rather we died in the attempt. He sets up this thing with the rock platforms to make it seem like that's the best and only way to safely make it across...&quot; Keith shook his head. &quot;I'm not buying it. It's too obvious. And even if it's not a trap, there's no pattern to these things, only enough room for one of us at a time, and we can only see in so many directions at once. I mean, what if the next platform pops up directly behind you? By the time you notice, you're plummeting down to a molten grave.&quot; As he spoke, Keith shook his head. &quot;It's... it's hopeless.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;EH?!&quot; Meowth exclaimed. turning his head to look at Keith.<br />
<br />
Keith sank to his knees. &quot;It's... it's hopeless,&quot; he repeated in a quiet, defeated voice. &quot;We can't get across. I got nothing with Fly, nothing with Teleport, nothing with Reflect or Light Screen to maybe make a temporary bridge across the pool, and I don't even own anything that knows Barrier, and even if these platforms aren't a trap, it'd take a miracle for all of us to make it across them safely.&quot; As he started to give in to the rising feeling of despair, this was interrupted by a sudden but light <b>Scratch</b> across his face. It was light, it didn't even draw blood, but it certainly got Keith's attention. He turned to look at Meowth, whose claws were still extended, and whose eyes were narrowed in irritation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just wat kinda quitter talk is dat?!&quot; Meowth demanded. &quot;Da Keith Masters I know ain't no quitter! Da Keith Masters who raised me would be tinkin' outside da box by now, findin' a way across dis molten deathtrap, like he thought ta have Vernon copy dat Heatmor's Flash Fire wit Role Play before takin' on dem Magmar! And da Keith Masters I know perhaps better den he knows hisself don't know da meanin' o' da word hopeless!&quot;<br />
<br />
With every syllable of Meowth's rousing speech, Keith realized that Meowth was right. This was no time for him to give up, just because the most obvious of solutions occurring to him weren't gonna work. This was no time for him to give up, not with a pack of Heatmor with their lives on the line, not with an entire tunnel full of Koffing and Weezing to be avenged. No, this was the time for him to think as only he could think, time for him to get them all safely across the pool of lava! The look of hopelessness now replaced with one of determination, Keith stood back up and turned his hat backwards.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right. You're right, Meowth,&quot; Keith said. &quot;We'll get across this pool of lava, all of us, and we'll reach this so-called Great One, and we'll give Him just what he's got coming to Him!&quot; He turned to face the tunnel they had just made their way through. &quot;You will all be avenged,&quot; he vowed to the Koffing and Weezing corpses. &quot;All of you.&quot; Then he turned to the pack of Heatmor. &quot;I'm sorry about just now,&quot; he said to them. &quot;All this stress, all these obstacles, they made me momentarily forget one of my fundamental rules about myself- the situation isn't hopeless until I say it's hopeless. And Meowth,&quot; he added, turning to face the Scratch Cat Pokémon on his shoulder. &quot;Thank you. I needed that. I really did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Happy ta help,&quot; Meowth grinned. &quot;Now get us across dis lava!&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith nodded as he plucked the a Poké Ball off his belt and tossed it straight up into the air, a plan already in his mind. &quot;Go, Godric!&quot; he exclaimed as the Nidoking materialized on the rocky floor overlooking the lava pool. Godric grunted as he glanced around the molten pool before him, and as he looked at the bunch of Heatmor who were unfamiliar to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;How's Godric gonna help?&quot; Meowth asked. &quot;Wat's da plan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The plan is this,&quot; Keith said, in a take-charge sort of voice. &quot;James, you did well back in that tunnel. Really well. I might even go so far as to use the phrase 'a credit to your species'. But now I need you to do just a little bit more- I need you to use <b>Aromatherapy</b> just one more time, to cure Godric's burn. Just that one more, and you can take as long of a rest in your Poké Ball as you need. And Godric,&quot; he added, now addressing his Nidoking. &quot;You're to use your <b>Confusion</b> attack to levitate me, Meowth, and all of these Heatmor across this pool of lava. You can do it all at once or one at a time, whichever you think will be easier on you. Once you get us all across, I'll return you to your Poké Ball from the other side of the pool. Do you think you got it in you to do this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Honestly, Godric could not give an honest answer to this. The battle against the Magcargo, he was still feeling that, particularly the burn. But his mind registered the serious, urgent tone in Keith's voice, and knew that if he, Godric, had been put in charge of this situation, he might very well be making the same calls Keith was making right now. Understanding the severity of the situation, Godric grunted, &quot;Nidooooh,&quot; in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Godric says he ain't completely sure,&quot; Meowth translated. &quot;But he's gonna give it his all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith grinned. &quot;That's what I like to hear,&quot; he said with an approving nod. He gripped James's Poké Ball in one hand as he used the other to reattach Godric's ball to his belt- he prepared to withdraw the Vileplume as soon as he had attended to Godric's burn. Normally, Keith would've waited for a more opportune moment to heal the burn, but Psychic moves had a lot to do with the mind, with concentration, and with all of their lives on the line here, Keith didn't want to risk the burn potentially becoming enough of a distraction to screw with Godric's focus. Now all he could do was to let his plan play out and hope like hell that it would work. Because to be perfectly honest, this was all that was coming to him that had a chance at working, the only sort of plan he'd gone for before- on Whale Island, he had previously used his Venomoth's Confusion for emergency transportation. Of course, back then it was only him Lily had to move, but still, it at least told Keith that the plan had merit in theory. It wasn't foolproof, but right now, given their distinct lack of options, Keith would take what he could get.</span></span></div>
