<span style="color: red"><span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>The Lithogic River</u></b> – Please reply in <b>Red</b><br />
<br />
<b>Flame Mistress</b>: You decide to head into the Litogic River in hopes to find some rare gems and whatnot, however your bickering with Charlotte does take away some of your concentration. As soon as you two agree to stop your bickering, you trip over your own two legs. Thankfully, you didn't trip into the lava, otherwise your adventure would have been cut...very short. You also see something shiny at the ground. As you pick it up, it looks like a very valuable gem of some sort. This thing that makes you and your Vulpix notably happy and excited. Before you can place it some place safe, a Growlithe jumps on you, causing you to drop the gem. <br />
<br />
The Growlithe rushes off you and grabs the gem. It looks just as happy as you did a moment ago. Its tail starts wagging looking at you with its cute eyes. The Growlithe then turns around and starts running in the opposite direction with your newly found gem.<br />
<br />
<i>What will you do?</i></span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #FF0000">Charlotte beamed as she gently picked up the gem, marvelling at the way it gleamed under the sunlight. <i>It truly is a piece of wonder,</i> she dreamily thought, and just as she was about to put it away safely in her bag, a tiger-like blur of red with black stripes jumped on her, making her yelp and drop the gem. It quickly grabbed the gem, and before she could grab it back, order an attack, or even take out her Pokedex to examine what Pokemon it was, it rushed off in the opposite direction with a very satisfied look on its face.<br />
<br />
For a moment, Charlotte stood there, dumbfounded, wondering whether what had just happened had been a hallucination. However, one look at Flare's face, which was positively quivering with fury, told her that yes, she had found a gem that looked as if it was priceless, and yes, this Pokemon had indeed stolen it from her right under her nose. Charlotte felt her face turn a bright, fiery shade of red with rage, and clenching her fists, muttered every foul word she could think of, all the while berating herself. If only she'd put the gem in her bag quickly enough... If only she or Flare had reacted quickly enough to stop the... the <i>pest...</i><br />
<br />
&quot;That's it,&quot; Charlotte declared angrily, her eyes flaming with rage. &quot;No one, and by that I mean <i>no one,</i> steals something from me and gets away with it!&quot; Flare gave a bark of agreement, and shot out some flames from her mouth while pawing at the ground. Yes, how <i>dare</i> the thief steal from them just like that? They would <i>pay</i> for it, they <i>would.</i> At that moment, a million hateful thoughts ran across both trainer and Vulpix's minds, and they were soon followed by thoughts seeking revenge and vengeance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, Flare,&quot; Charlotte said determinedly. &quot;I am <i>not</i> letting that <i>pest</i> get away, and I don't expect you to, either. The thief went this way--&quot; Charlotte pointed in the opposite direction they were facing-- &quot;and we're gonna catch them if it's the last thing we do, no matter what. It should be easy enough to catch them, they couldn't have gone that far. When we get them, I want you to use <b>Roar</b> to scare it so that it drops the gem, and <b>Quick Attack</b> to retrieve it. Clear?&quot; Flare gave a bark that obviously meant 'clear'. &quot;Good. Now, let's go!&quot;<br />
<br />
And, with the high hopes of retrieving their stolen treasure, they began to run.</span><br />

These islands contain the some of the most diverse typing of Pokemon in the entirety of Fizzy Bubbles. All of these islands are actually volcanoes, but the majority of them have gone dormant. As many Pokemon spend all their lives here, many fossils of Pokemon and plants are buried in the depths of the volcanic ground, maybe some of these may be worth a look? You start out on the island that you first choose, via a ferry. In order to change areas afterward, Surf or Fly is a necessity.</span><br />

Taking up the entirety of Brine Island, Salin City has everything-from shopping places, to schools, hospitals, a Pokemon Center, an airport, and a seaport, among other things. There is a small park in the middle, with a fishing pond and a few trees scattered about. Stands line the streets wishing to sell you things, and it'd be pretty hard to not find something to do. But if you would happen to find yourself in such a dilemma, there is a Pokemon Gym in the city which holds eight leaders, one each to symbolize the Cascadian Archipelago. However, only one may be challenged per visit to the gym.</span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver">Stacey stood on the deck of the ferry leaning against the railings as she breathed in the salty sea breeze. They were nearly at their destination now; in fact she could see the Port of Brine Island growing ever larger on the horizon. The young woman had a bright smile on her face as she thought of the adventure that possibly lay ahead of her. It had been a very long time since she had left the seclusion of the Mansion and an even longer time since she had seen the person she was going to meet. She had only met Jess a few times but they had gotten on very well and when she had suggested meeting up to travel together in Cascadia Stacey had eagerly agreed. She could do with some human company, that’s not to say she didn’t enjoy the company of her Pokemon and the wild ones that roamed her home but she looked forward to catching up with her. <br />
<br />
Jess had been a young girl when they met, she was now a young woman in her late teens. She frowned a little as she thought of how she had grown, she was nearly 10 years the girl’s senior, nearly an old fogie. Chuckling to herself she tore her eyes away from the scenery to peer down at her travel companion for this little trip. He came up to her thigh in height and stood stock still gripping the bars of the railing tightly. Stacey didn’t think he liked the water all that much but her Golett was brave enough to stand next to her in order to observe everything new around him. She had not yet had much chance to interact with Dwemer since he hatched on that very special day a few months ago but already he made her feel younger. He was quiet and observant and it was difficult to tell his emotions from his face but soon she hoped she would be able to read his body language to understand him better. After a few more minutes of contemplation the ferry docked in the Port and Stacey placed an arm on Dwemer’s shoulder dragging his attention away from the water and smiled at him beckoning to follow her off the boat. She could almost swear he looked relieved. <br />
<br />
Stacey walked towards along the dock almost reaching her destination immediately sue to the fact that the city she was heading for encompassed most of this island. She heard a noise come from Dwemer that she assumed to be a gasp of awe as he tilted backwards to take in the sights. Stacey chuckled and took hold of his hand and he hardly even noticed before she walked into the Salin City. The city was vast but Stacey knew where she was heading. She had let Jess choose their destination and she had chosen somewhere safe for she had a young Pokemon of her own she wanted to travel with. She had left Stacey to choose the meeting point so she headed towards the centre of the city. There she came across a small park and breathed in deep of the scents here. She walked over to a large tree and sat at its foot smoothing out her black shorts and watched as Dwemer took in the sights and sounds whilst keeping close to her. She would wait right here for her friend, this was a nice spot. </span></span></div>

<span style="color: gold"><span style="font-size: 9px">Welcome to PikaGod and Treecko's Awesomeness. Forgive me TA, I failed to see your entry post when I first posted. Hopefully it will never happen again. Arc, I won't post updates until Yuki joins in, so you guys can be together in the adventure from the very beginning. I'm sorry everyone for taking so long, work is piling up but I'd like to sneak this in for now. Forgive me if you deem this mediocre, I'd like to give something better but I need to do other stuff too. Despite that, I really hope everyone has a fun and not deadly time here. Except for PG of course, you picked Red Forest, you get Red Forest. *wonk*<br />
<br />
<span style="color: black">Just a reminder everyone. Please try to maintain the format for replies. Just give me something I can work with. Type it and make it within and your respective colors. Thank you~</span><br />

<span style="color: deepskyblue"><u>.:Crater Island - Iridi Beach:.</u> (Please reply in <b>DeepSkyBlue</b>)<br />
<b>kaisap112</b>: A Pokemon wallows in pain from the distance, the sound, the pain, masked by the soothing sounds of the sea. A cry for help, hidden by the cruel world with sounds of false serenity and calmness. There is always strife in this world, despite this, luxury comes, only to those unaware. We delve into the events surrounding the young girl, seeking adventure with heart of pure gold, and her partners to remind ourselves that despite our enjoyment, there is always someone in need, and happiness is only real when shared with others...<br />
<br />
The girl, almost falling onto the sand for an afternoon siesta, is caught off guard by a call for help; almost inaudible through the din of crashing waves. Silence falls upon the girl and her Skitty. A few moments ago, the Skitty enjoyed the world like there was no tomorrow, but due to the repetitive, heart-breaking and tear-jerking noise, her mood is now dead, as if damped by the ocean's water. The Skitty is first to snap out of the trance-like spell. She quickly starts going for the Pokeball filled belt, trying to knock one down.<br />
<br />
“You’re right Skitty, this is the perfect opportunity to bring out Callias!”<br />
<br />
She grabs the Pokeball and throws it up into the air. A red bolt of lightning plunges into the water as a silhouette of a fish appears underneath. Noriko puts the Pokeball back onto the belt neatly, greeting her Pokemon friend with a precise command. Callias, the Finneon, shrugs a bit because of getting demanding orders the second it got out. Either way, there's a Pokemon in trouble and you just can't have emotions get in the way of the greater good. Noriko hangs on to Callias while Skitty lays on top of her head. They move at a fast speed toward the epicenter of the cry. Finneon is starting to slow down due to the strain this travel has given him. He stops a few meters away from shoreline. Noriko acknowledges this and decides to swim to the exposed land with her Skitty. Callias comes with them but with signs of heavy panting and exhaustion. On land, the trio is shocked to see the giant up close and personal. From afar, one would think this Pokemon was a Wailmer due to its size... but it's not. The sun reflects on the shiny surface of the Pokemon's skin, black and white stripes line most of the being as the sounds are louder than ever. A few seconds pass before the creature finally takes notice of the presence of the adventurers. The sad and painful sound now gone... replaced with a moan of blind rage and anger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Poliwaaaaaaaag!&quot;<br />
<br />
The creature moves into an upright position, rising above the water, reaching a towering 10 feet in height. The sweet, crying Poliwag is now gone, replaced by a 10-foot monster filled with killer intent. The need for vengeance overwhelms the Poliwag's normal and modest nature as he looks at Noriko with swollen, bloodshot eyes. He looks like he's ready to kill you any second now, and unless you fight back or run away, it would seem that your death is swift and sure. Right before you could think, he blasts a powerful jet of <b>Water</b> at Skitty, pushing her back into the water where she came from. The trigger of the <b>Gun</b> has been pulled, there's no going back for the Poliwag now. Noriko shrieks in horror as the Skitty moans in pain. She's alright but obviously, that Water Gun did a number on her.<br />
<br />
How will you react?</span><br />

<span style="color: green"><u>.:Lily Island - Diamond River:.</u> (Please reply in <b>Green</b>)<br />
<b>Treecko's Awesomeness</b>: (Note: Please use the proper reply format. ^^. Thank you~) <br />
The summer fun is only getting started in the land of Fizzy Bubbles. All is well in Cascadia, the sun is shining oh so brightly, the humidity is just right, the reviving breeze can put a smile of relaxation on anyone lucky enough to experience it. The summer islands of Cascadia are currently being flooded by tourists from everywhere in the world. While loads of cruise ships dock at Crater Island, a few traditional aquatic vessels set sail to the island abundant in nature, appearing green from afar as plants populate the isle. This place serves as the respite for those nature lovers who would just want to admire nature and take a break from it all. It is here where the bond between the Pokemon, the environment, and people is strengthened. Though a dark mist shrouds the other half of the island with mystery, this place doesn't fail in attracting those tireless workers.<br />
<br />
A brown-haired lad is seen standing beside the dazzling Diamond River, coaxing his Pokemon into doing him a favor. The sunlight reflects on the water's surface and the murky river, protecting the riches of the island in the form of crystals, sparkles with excitement and thrill as the fast current washes along while the precious stones catch eyes. The surrounding environment is rich in flora and fauna, a flock of flying Pokemon can be heard chirping in the Silver Forest's canopy. The soothing vibrations created by numerous bug Pokemon complement the birds' chirping, forming a harmonious orchestra without them even knowing it! The sea breeze blows over and makes leaves drift overhead. The splashing of the currents is the most evident sound echoing in the ears of those who hear nature's musical.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you think we'll be able to do this, Nav?&quot; the boy asked his Treecko. The poor Pokemon steps farther away from the river, finding solace in the branches and the vines of the forest's understory. &quot;I know you don't like the current, but if you don't go anywhere near the water, there's no way we're going to get those crystals.&quot; he smiled at his Pokemon before continuing, &quot;and you know we need the coins we could get from those.&quot; The Pokemon so adapted to climbing trees is rock-solid in its position against diving into the depths of the fast-flowing river just to get some stupid crystals that aren't even edible. He softens up a little as Thomas fakes a whimper. He looks over the river before letting out a big sigh. The coaxing goes on and on until an agreement has been settled. The Treecko is now motivated to do what his owner asks of him because of some measly poffins. Little did he know he might just make the worst mistake of his life.<br />
<br />
The pair look around for a fallen branch that they can use to knock some crystals up into the riverbank. TA swings a few sticks around to check which one could withstand pressure and has the ability to nudge some crystals off the benthic zone of Diamond River. It is now down to two, on which to choose. Treecko makes his choice, grabbing the stick, hoping for the best, and jumping right into the river. A few seconds pass as the trainer awaits eagerly with a big fat smile on his face, connecting his two ears. A few more seconds pass once more, TA's face becoming emotionless. A shadow enlarges underneath the surface, before the unconscious Pokemon can be seen floating and being carried away by the current. TA takes a few moments before realizing what he has just done. No way can a tiny Pokemon like Treecko who wasn't even built for aquatic travel to be able to swim to the bottom of an 8-foot deep flowing river.<br />
<br />
What is your response?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: green"><u>.:Lily Island - Red Forest:.</u> (Please reply in <b>Green</b>)<br />
<b>PikaGod</b>: While all the tourists flock to Crater Island, some adventurers, foolish and brave, come together on Lily Island to enjoy nature's bounty. Most, if not all of them, venture in the calmer and generally more peaceful and kid-friendly places. Within all this though, a dark secret is hidden. A secret shrouded with darkness and mystery, a secret, centuries old, that no one seems to remember how it started. The secret is well-protected by the dense forest known by the name, &quot;Red Forest.&quot; It is named after the bloodshed that happens every now and then, in sight our out of sight, done by the savage beings that reside in this harsh environment. It seems like the aura changes whenever you enter this part of the island, then again, only the bravest of the brave try to find out what's up with this so called, &quot;Forest of Doom.&quot;<br />
<br />
We narrow down our focus today on a very average teenager in appearance. A teen with average height, average skin, average clothes, average hair, and a lot more average stuff. This is what people and Pokemon see, but inside, he's a brave, agreeable, selfless, and dependable man. His teenage hormones still plague him with easily-manipulated emotions. Like every teenager, he harbors many feelings inside of him that become a problem every once and a while. His maturity is still unstable especially around sugar, but in this place, he better not bring such sweets, or such behavior, as one wrong step could mean your life. A black lolita Pokemon stands by his side. From the looks of it, her serious and analytic attitude balances out Karmas' immaturity. This combo has what it takes to be an adventuring duo, but smarts just aren't enough to survive here.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well this looks like an interesting place, doesn't it?&quot; said Karmas, looking over at the Gothorita.<br />
<br />
Paine merely stared back at him, she really wasn't one to talk unless it was really really necessary. She crossed her arms and rolled her eyes, what exactly was her trainer waiting for? She motioned with her head for them to get going, making Karmas roll his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry Paine, I'm just trying to generate some atmosphere,&quot; said Karmas as they make their final decision of going to the dreaded forest. An ominous wind blows against them, as if the forest is already telling them to go back. Various sounds can already be heard, screams and moans echo in your ears. The sunlight is blocked by the thick canopies, with a lot of Pokemon, waiting above for an ambush. Better keep your eyes peeled and senses alert... a threat can be observed from every direction. Karmas shrugs this off and continues walking into the seemingly everlasting darkness. The abyss awaits for people who have come for the adventure of their lives. A new challenger has come... and only time will tell what would happen to him. Somewhere in Cascadia, people are having refreshing water to play with, friends to interact with, food to eat, lands to enjoy... here, you're only prey for everything that sees you. Perhaps even the tress... the ground... you'll never know what to expect.<br />
<br />
-o-o-o-o-o-o-<br />
<br />
A few minutes of trekking and cutting through the dense flora, scaring off tinier Pokemon who dare stand in your way, and you find yourself completely devoid of the outside world. An exit can no longer be seen as a little sunlight passes through the leaves, only enough to have you see the surroundings. Beady red eyes are seen staring through the darkness, the feeling of being watched will not go away as long as you're here. The wind just keeps blowing, even if there might not be open space anywhere, it's almost as if the wind was supernatural in here. Suddenly, silence lays upon the forest. Murkrow start panicking, trying to escape from the northern side of the forest. The earth shakes as big booming footsteps resonate. A bush suddenly rustles and you enter in a defensive position, ready for anything that comes out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Help me! Help me! A monster is coming for me! A monster is just behind me!&quot; a man comes through the bush screaming. He rushes over to Karmas and shakes him repeatedly before catching his breath. &quot;A monster is after me! He's so close, I can feel it! I only came here to investigate what makes this place so special... but now a monster is after me! Stranger! We need to escape quick, we can't fight it, he knocked out all of my Pokemon! I remember seeing a nice cave to hide in not so far from here while doing reconnaissance, I have to go there! You need to come with me! The monster is not too far behind!&quot;<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: red"><u>.:Audro Island - Lithogic River:.</u> (Please reply in <b>Red</b>)<br />
<b>Haradion</b>: (Note: PM/VM me when you get back so we can have your adventure rolling. Another thing, you cannot describe the environment in detail such as the Pokemon and stuff. It's considered self-updating and it's a big no-no in FB. Aside from that, everything is fine except for a few typographical errors, but I don't mind. I hope you enjoy this once you're back~)<br />
<br />
The scorching sun only modifies the oven-hot temperature in the biggest island of Cascadia. The island may not be a summer tourist spot, but it sure is a hot spot for all those researchers, miners, and those seeking some hot and sweat-inducing adventure. The wind is tottered with suspended bits of cinder and ash fall. The wind may not be completely safe to breathe in as the sulfuric gases plague the air of the isle. Lava continually pumps out of the mouth of the active volcano, only increasing the island's size as it cools when it reaches the sea. The ground here is pitch black, filled with the debris and the pyroclastic materials expelled by the vents scattered throughout the island. Though this place may not be the vacation spot for everyone, there are few sites worth taking note off for future sight-seeing.<br />
<br />
A boat can be heard chugging towards the docks of Audro Island. The water breaks as the ship moves forward, leaving waves and ripples in its wake. The debris-filled wind is blowing mighty as ever, as the smell of sulfur envelopes the newcomers. A particular lad converses with his Shuckle as he steps foot on the noir sand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Shuckle, what do you think?&quot; he asked the slow-moving endolith. The Pokemon replies with a soft sound, indicating his indifference with the new surrounding. The heat makes him uncomfortable somewhat, but his shell should be enough to handle it. His trainer replies with a disappointed face, sighing before speaking up, &quot;Shuckle, were not here to make a holiday home, were here to finance our travels, and build a team, remember?&quot; The helpless Shuckle can only reply with a nod at his owner. Haradion seems to have gone all out when making plans of visiting his islands. He sets his sights on the rare gems, said to have cooled along the famous river of lava, the Lithogic River.<br />
<br />
They stroll beside the hazardous river, covering their nose and mouths as they go. The ash filled air irritates their eyes, causing them to squint all throughout, all the more, making the search for the evasive gem hoard harder than ever. The sun is not making it any easier for them, it's as if, they're being cooked inside and out. Thankfully, there has been no record of man-eating Pokemon residing on this island. In fact, it is quite peaceful around here. Some fire-types have made this place, a place uninhabitable by humans, their homes. They seem to enjoy the heat and the constant supply of lava to suit their needs. All of this was actually stated in the advertisement of this island. It seemed effective as you weren't alone when you came here. The others are long gone by now, probably have started studying other parts of the island, while you were here acting as a prospector. Minutes pass as you get farther and farther away from the ocean, and closer to the heart, Haradion's face perks up like a light bulb showing that he's found something quite interesting. No... it wasn't the treasure he was looking for, it was something much more valuable than that. A Ponyta calf is sleeping right behind the boulder beside the river. This might not be a priceless rock, but perhaps an eternal friend would be a good substitute for that. It neighs in its slumber with a gleeful smile on its face.<br />
<br />

I'm sorry everyone for taking so long, work is piling up but I'd like to sneak this in for now. Forgive me if you deem this mediocre, I'd like to give something better but I need to do other stuff too. Despite that, I really hope everyone has a fun and not deadly time here.

<b>kaisap112</b>: A Pokemon wallows in pain from the distance, the sound, the pain, masked by the soothing sounds of the sea. A cry for help, hidden by the cruel world with sounds of false serenity and calmness. There is always strife in this world, despite this, luxury comes, only to those unaware. We delve into the events surrounding the young girl, seeking adventure with heart of pure gold, and her partners to remind ourselves that despite our enjoyment, there is always someone in need, and happiness is only real when shared with others...<br />
<br />
The girl, almost falling onto the sand for an afternoon siesta, is caught off guard by a call for help; almost inaudible through the din of crashing waves. Silence falls upon the girl and her Skitty. A few moments ago, the Skitty enjoyed the world like there was no tomorrow, but due to the repetitive, heart-breaking and tear-jerking noise, her mood is now dead, as if damped by the ocean's water. The Skitty is first to snap out of the trance-like spell. She quickly starts going for the Pokeball filled belt, trying to knock one down.<br />
<br />
“You’re right Skitty, this is the perfect opportunity to bring out Callias!”<br />
<br />
She grabs the Pokeball and throws it up into the air. A red bolt of lightning plunges into the water as a silhouette of a fish appears underneath. Noriko puts the Pokeball back onto the belt neatly, greeting her Pokemon friend with a precise command. Callias, the Finneon, shrugs a bit because of getting demanding orders the second it got out. Either way, there's a Pokemon in trouble and you just can't have emotions get in the way of the greater good. Noriko hangs on to Callias while Skitty lays on top of her head. They move at a fast speed toward the epicenter of the cry. Finneon is starting to slow down due to the strain this travel has given him. He stops a few meters away from shoreline. Noriko acknowledges this and decides to swim to the exposed land with her Skitty. Callias comes with them but with signs of heavy panting and exhaustion. On land, the trio is shocked to see the giant up close and personal. From afar, one would think this Pokemon was a Wailmer due to its size... but it's not. The sun reflects on the shiny surface of the Pokemon's skin, black and white stripes line most of the being as the sounds are louder than ever. A few seconds pass before the creature finally takes notice of the presence of the adventurers. The sad and painful sound now gone... replaced with a moan of blind rage and anger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Poliwaaaaaaaag!&quot;<br />
<br />
The creature moves into an upright position, rising above the water, reaching a towering 10 feet in height. The sweet, crying Poliwag is now gone, replaced by a 10-foot monster filled with killer intent. The need for vengeance overwhelms the Poliwag's normal and modest nature as he looks at Noriko with swollen, bloodshot eyes. He looks like he's ready to kill you any second now, and unless you fight back or run away, it would seem that your death is swift and sure. Right before you could think, he blasts a powerful jet of <b>Water</b> at Skitty, pushing her back into the water where she came from. The trigger of the <b>Gun</b> has been pulled, there's no going back for the Poliwag now. Noriko shrieks in horror as the Skitty moans in pain. She's alright but obviously, that Water Gun did a number on her.<br />
<br />
How will you react?<br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"> (OOC: I honestly thought I was using the right color and the HTML says the same thing…)<br />
<br />
<span style="color: DeepSkyBlue">Callias wasn’t happy about being ordered around right when he’d been released into such a nice spot at the beach, but hearing the wailing of the Pokémon in the distance and the worry in Noriko’s voice he decided not to throw a tantrum over it. Noriko hung on to Callias with Skitty on her head as they made their way in the water toward the Pokémon in need.<br />
After a while Callias tired out, stopping near a patch of dry land. Noriko didn’t need to ask what was up: Callias was still small and obviously couldn’t carry such a heavy load for too long. Taking the hint, Noriko got off and swam to the dry land, leaving Callias to rest a bit. He’d surely follow them when he’d have the energy.<br />
<br />
On the patch of land was the wailing Pokémon. Noriko and Skitty slowly approached it. Something was starting to feel odd about this whole situation. The Pokémon suddenly stopped wailing, instead turning around while growling with anger and rage, revealing black and white stripes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Poliwaaaaaaaag!&quot;<br />
<br />
To Noriko and Skitty’s horror, what was in front of them was a 10-foot tall Poliwag. Actually, a monster of a Poliwag. It also didn’t look happy at all to see them. Poliwag appeared more than ready to battle, but with bloodshot eyes that made Noriko wonder if there was something seriously wrong with it. Poliwag fired a very powerful <b>Water Gun</b> at Skitty, pushing her off the small land patch. Noriko ran over to the edge of the water in panic: “Skitty, are you alright?” She reached to her partner, pulling her on dry land. Skitty was moaning in pain, but otherwise alright. The attack had done a number on Skitty. There was no way tiny Skitty, or even Skitty and Callias put together, could beat Poliwag just like that. But Noriko didn’t want to run away either: something was wrong with Poliwag, it needed help. <br />
<br />
“Poliwag, please listen to me. We don’t want to hurt you! We heard you crying and wanted to help! I’ve got some <a href="http://www.serebiiforums.com/showthread.php?420650-Pokemart&amp;p=14675020#post14675020" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.serebiiforums.com%2Fshowthread.php%3F420650-Pokemart%26p%3D14675020%23post14675020&amp;hash=f4fc279dfc8c11db96deb2d699d0b5a3" rel="nofollow noopener">Fresh Water</a> in my bag, if you calm down and let us help you can have it, how about it?” Noriko dug a bottle of said refreshment from her bag, scared to death of all the possible ways this situation could go far beyond wrong.</span></span></div>

<i><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: silver">Brine Island</span></span></i><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><span style="color: silver">Salin City </span></b>- The only real city in the entire island chain, Salin City is huge. Taking up the entirety of Brine Island, Salin City has everything-from shopping places, to schools, hospitals, a Pokemon Center, an airport, and a seaport, among other things. There is a small park in the middle, with a fishing pond and a few trees scattered about. Stands line the streets wishing to sell you things, and it'd be pretty hard to not find something to do. But if you would happen to find yourself in such a dilemma, there is a Pokemon Gym in the city which holds eight leaders, one each to symbolize the Cascadian Archipelago. However, only one may be challenged per visit to the gym.</span>

</blockquote></span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Silver">Salt air stimulated. Jess inhaled it slowly, savoring. It was the smell of adventure, of longing, escape. She had missed it for so long.<br />
<br />
She also missed company. The girl’s cheeks turned rose, recalling how she boldly she imposed herself on the beautiful mistress of the mansion. She had heard their hopes for a holiday destination were the same, and loneliness and veneration compelled her to speak, to seek the veteran’s friendship. Though they had interacted in only small capacity before, Jess took comfort in the fact that they seemed to connect on at least a basic communal level. Beyond the surface, Jessica also sensed a spark, and hoped to strike a special kinship with the lady in purple.<br />
<br />
Stacey was one of the few females who had happened to move to Fizzy Bubbles around the same time as Jess, and to her knowledge the only one among their generation who had also chosen to stay, making the Mansion her permanent home. This made Jess feel a natural affinity for the ghost mistress, despite their difference in age. Witnessing a new wave of adventurers eagerly enter and explore the lands they once walked, she faced solace – and perhaps slight sadness – in the idea the two were both tired but proud, practiced comrades in partial retirement. Reflection. Jess smiled as she imagined they too had been bright-eyed buds, once. Such a time seemed so long ago, at this point a far-away dream. Now it was their job, for the most part, to simply watch over and guide these youngsters to tomorrow. To share their knowledge and experience.<br />
<br />
Jessica shook her head, realizing such nostalgia was making her regret her own advancement in years. She had been only the tender age of 12 when she first arrived to FB. Now her 20th Birthday was approaching in less than two weeks. She paused, stunning at the revelation that she was now about the same age Stacey must have been when she also registered to become a citizen. The girl-unready-to-accept-the-fact-she-was-a-young-woman sighed, recognizing both her own mortality and that despite their equivalence in duration of stay, Stacey was light-years ahead of her in maturity and wisdom. In the time that Stacey had spent as a resident, she had accomplished far more than Jess could ever hope to dream as not only caretaker of the Haunted Mansion, but a certified referee. As an ambitious hard worker, she even eventually obtained a top leadership position in government. Jessica greatly admired such dedication and capability, whereas she had fled from responsibility several times over the years. She grimaced at the memory, feeling almost unfit to be in the presence of one so great.<br />
<br />
Still, she looked forward to spending some quality one-on-one time with one of her idols. Not to mention a break from the work and coaching she had decided to finally apply herself to, to travel once more with her teammates she’d neglected for so long. Today she’d brought the latest addition her team: a beautiful baby Snorunt who had just recently hatched. This would be her first venture into the world outside her trainer’s seaside base, and Jessica hoped it would provide a valuable bonding experience, both for teaching and entertainment. She desired the same would hold true for her and Stacey, eager to learn from the senior she held in such high esteem, as well as enjoy their time together and build a strong relationship. As an incorrigibly shy introvert, Jessica rarely hung out with other humans. This would be the first time she journeyed with another of her kind, so she was understandably as nervous as she was excited. The last time they traveled in the same boat didn’t really count, as it was part of a group and under extreme duress…<br />
<br />
Jessica felt a sudden wave of dizziness and crouched down. Her hands slid gradually down the boat railing, coming to grip tighter at the bottom. Kristen glanced up from her sketchpad, where she had been describing a scenic study of the water as it married the horizon, to see her trainer breathing hard at the height she was sitting. She jumped up and began to pat the girl on the back until she felt better. Jessica smiled weakly and thanked her friend before attempting to stand up, but immediate faintness brought her to knees again. She briefly wondered whether it was seasickness that brought on such a spell, or… Something else…<br />
<br />
She shook her head, deciding it best to lay low for a while and not dwell on it too deeply. Kristen gazed at her trainer with concern, and Jess beamed back to reassure everything was all right. To distract them both from the cause for distress, Jessica picked up the pad and loudly praised the Snorunt’s work, leading Kris to shuffle her feet with humble, yet clearly happy humiliation.<br />
<br />
At that moment, the boat’s loudspeaker crackled to life, and the captain announced they had arrived at the destination. Kristen jumped in elation and peeked enthusiastically over the side, eyes wide to see Brine Island’s industrious port awaiting the passengers to disembark. She was especially taken by the natural formations of coral peeking out from the water, their colorful beauty perfect for painting.<br />
<br />
Having forgotten enough of the previously crippling incident to recover her stance, Jess staggered to her feet, swaying slightly but managing to hold herself steady. She recognized the coral and smirked, remembering she had briefly shown the sight once before to her Corsola. Unfortunately, their outing had been cut short by a school of annually invading Tentacool. At the time her precocious adolescent self had been so self-assured of her insight and environmental awareness, she had refused to interfere with the creatures’ long-standing egg-laying habits, lest it trigger some unseen destructive chain reaction. Inspecting the clean, pristine waters, it looked like they had managed to resolve that crisis without her help, at least. (Probably best for her own peace not to question how.) If the beaches were currently safe to swim in, perhaps they could take a trip down there later.<br />
<br />
Jessica also recalled how young and stupidly excited she was at that moment, standing on the slippery railing in sandals so that her entire body leaned over the side. It was a miracle she didn’t fall into the water. (Though she did succeed in bumping her head against the bar at one point when she tried to stand up from the deck.) Jessica smiled wistfully as she reached her own hand out to the water as far as it would go, wondering what she could have been inclining towards so intently. As she felt her shoes lifting and shoulders dropping, she quickly withdrew her hand and laughed. There was no way she could do something so dangerous now. She looked to her captivated Snorunt and smiled, scooping Kristen up into her arms as she descended to the dock. She had to protect herself, in order to be able to protect the ones she cared most about.<br />
<br />
Anchored opposite from her own vessel, Jessica observed a second commuter ship stationed on the other end of the boardwalk. Its groaning metal sides seemed to exude a greater air of solemnity than those around it, shuddering as if it had seen scary monsters at sea you couldn’t even imagine. Jessica checked the time on her Pokégear, and according to the boat schedule Stacey was supposed to arrive before her. Jessica smiled and smartly saluted the old titan. It had to be tough in order to brave the terror of making the trip to and from the Haunted Mansion’s region, ferrying what may as well be spirits from the underworld to the surface. (Perhaps that was why it only ran on a twice-weekly basis.)<br />
<br />
From Coral Harbor, she turned from the beach straight towards the city. Stacey had designated the park as their meeting place, a place of pleasant scenery and peace for their young Pokémon to play in. As she entered the gate, Jessica soon spotted the woman stretched out underneath the shade of a tree, a little blue ghost golem squatting beside her. Jessica anxiously checked her appearance to confirm she was perfectly and publicly presentable, and was about to wave and call out when a devilish idea occurred to her. Here was her chance to surprise the mistress of spook herself. Could she really pass up such an opportunity? She wasn’t a kid anymore, nor was she ever particularly bold enough to regularly carry out this sort of practice… But a little childish fun once in a while surely never hurt.<br />
<br />
Putting her finger to her lips, she shushed her Snorunt and snuck like silence around the back of the tree trunk. Popping her head out from behind the bark, she joyfully exclaimed,<br />
<br />
“Boo!”<br />
<br />
After the initial shock had died down and the two shared a laugh, they made their friendly greetings. Confused by the presence of strangers, the shy Kristen concealed herself behind her trainer’s leg as Jessica tried to introduce her to Dwemer. The girl then suggested she show the Golett her drawings, to which Kristen brightened slightly and shuffled forward with her sketchpad. While the Pokémon got to know each other, Jessica awkwardly attempted conversation with her human companion. After the thrill from her clever prank had passed, she was lost for inspiration. At length, she proposed they may as well take a mild walk through the park while they caught up.<br />
<br />
And so the group set off in pairs. Two old trainers and their youngest Pokémon, together embarking on a new beginning.</span></span></div>

<b>kaisap112</b>: A one-sided battle can be heard from a small patch of land away from Crater Island. Whispers get through the wave, what was that? The sound of pain and misery accompanied with the sound of peace and serenity. It made no sense at all as the giant Poliwag attacked with blind rage. The girl named Noriko is alarmed by the crying Poliwag's aggressive behavior as he blasts her partner back into the sea.<br />
<br />
She drags Skitty back to the shore while the Poliwag prepares another attack. It charges at Noriko with full speed, attempting to do a <b>Body Slam</b>. Noriko closes her eyes and accepts whatever fate is prepared for her. She knows that something is wrong with the Pokemon, and she knows, deep-inside, each Pokemon has a soft spot. Even though she had the chance to run, she opt to stay and help the beast.<br />
<br />
“Poliwag, please listen to me. We don’t want to hurt you! We heard you crying and wanted to help! I’ve got some Fresh Water in my bag, if you calm down and let us help you can have it, how about it?” This was said just in time... making the Poliwag stop right before her. His eyes return to normal and become teary as it looks at the trainer. It whimpers a bit before swimming away, not giving Noriko the chance to do anything else. It looks like it's headed to the rocky beach of Crater Island. <br />
<br />
Callias can <b>Surf</b> again but he would need to stay in his Pokeball or get treated before being able to do more tiring activities. What will you do?</span><br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: deepskyblue">Noriko was preparing for a hard hit of <b>Body Slam</b>, eyes closed and scared to death. She squeezed the bottle of Fresh Water in her hands – and nothing happened. She slowly opened one of her eyes. The Poliwag was standing still in front of her! He wasn’t attacking! Noriko opened her other eyes as well. Poliwag’s eyes were now normal, but to the young trainer they looked very sad. On que, the little eyes grew teary as Poliwag started whimpering.<br />
<br />
Not able to get a word in edgewise, Noriko could only watch as Poliwag swam away in the saddest manner Noriko had ever seen a Pokémon swim. The Pokémon seemed to be heading to Crater Island. Behind Noriko, her Finneon Callias arrived. While the young woman was determined to follow Poliwag, Callias was too tired to both take her to the island and battle if something bad happened.<br />
<br />
For once in her life, Noriko chose door number three. “Minori, come on out!” She threw a Pokéball in the air and with a flash of light, out of it came a Seel she had recently gotten. Minori made excited noise in the water. “And Callias, you can return to your ball for now.” Callias made a movement resembling a nod before disappearing back into his Pokéball in a flash of red light. Noriko stepped closer to Minori, with Kitty leaping on her head. “Minori, think you can <b>Surf</b> me and Kitty to that island? I’m even more worried about that Poliwag now.”<br />

Many Pokemon also live along these, creating a popular tourist attraction.[/size]

The wonderful reefs were out ahead of him, yet the ocean sparkle partially blinded his own perspective. The glare seemed to reflect around him, and he decided to go a bit more submerged in the water. He simply watched different boats docking nearby, and brought out Trick to reminisce with him. <br />
<br />
Then he dug under fine sand, though mostly to create a form of wave barrier, and to isolate an island of sand. though sand collapses easily, which left the rest of the structure vulnerable, falling into the waves, dispersing as it left.<br />
<br />
Then he decided to ask about the area. He then looked around for someone and approached anyone who came by, Though he then was drained of energy, as a result of being under the sun for a considerably lengthened amount of time...<br />

However, electric types thrive here, and recently people have learned how to use the electricity to their own use. <br />

<br />
<span style="color: #FFFF00">Caesar had a burning passion for Electric Pokemon. He wasn't sure why to be exactly, he just felt like they had such a great gift; to be blessed with the power to control electricity. He viewed it as a heavenly power, a mighty, unstoppable power, but he wasn't about to get down on his knees and pray to them like Gods. That seemed ridiculous, though on that note, travelling through the Thunder Fields seemed like quite a ridiculous idea too. The large expanse of fields that are constantly stricken with lightning, the thunder echoing outwards across the land exploded in Caesar's ears as he walked, the experience was exhilarating to say the least. It was like nothing he'd ever experienced before.<br />
<br />
As he watched another bolt of lightning come hurling down in the distance he winced, and when the thunder came he felt a little bit more prepared for the tremendous boom that came hurtling forwards from the heavens.<br />
<br />
&quot;What in the hell are we doing here, guys?&quot; He asked, lifting his two Pokeballs up and tossing them down. He didn't wish to be walking alone, so he decided to walk with his friends.<br />
<br />
The newly caught Lotad quickly scurried up his leg and sat on his shoulder, clearly not that afraid of his new trainer, or perhaps he was just more scared of the thunder and lightning. <i>Ah well</i>, Caesar thought, <i>Makes things a bit easier I suppose.</i> Meanwhile the proud Gaius stood as straight as ever.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can relax if you want, Gaius,&quot; Caesar spoke, but it was of no use. The Scyther simply nodded, and continued to keep his posture. <i>I guess he just likes it that way... Weirdo.</i> Caesar smiled and laughed inside his head a bit, his confidence rising with his new companions now in visible sight.</span></span></div>

<span style="color: darkorange"><i><span style="font-size: 12px">Ruin Island</span></i></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px">One of the more interesting areas of the archipelago, Ruin Island is also the most mysterious. Giant stone statues and buildings, eroded by time, stand in the overgrowing vegetation of the area, providing a home to many Pokemon, especially those who prefer dark, enclosed spaces. Studies done by researches show that this island was once under water, or flooded, or something. At the very least, they have established that it is the oldest of the areas. An eerie feel of foreboding rushes over one the second they set forth on the land, provoking myths and legends...<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: darkorange">Amor Temple </span></b>- An abandoned temple near the center of the island, plants have overgrown it and many dark and psychic Pokemon have taken the temple to be their home. Many tricks and turns lie around each corner and stairway, and one mistake could be your last...[/color]</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: darkorange"><span style="font-size: 9px">For the past few weeks Stark had found himself growing restless. He had been content for too long to sit back and relax, but if his last trainer battle had shown him, he was a little rusty when it came to keeping up with his goals. Not only had he let himself down, but he had also let his companions down by losing. He could have tried to be more competitive and battle more trainers. Maybe said something about shorts to them, but experience had taught him that getting out into the world was the best experience and the best way to bring his skills back up to the point where they used to be. Besides, he had been neglecting the chance to spend some quality time with his younger team members. Plus, it was nice to see the world again. He had originally planned to visit the waterfalls on Whale Island, but a rampaging elektross had caused the area to be cut off, thus ending his plans to go there. In a way it might have been a blessing in disguise. For now he could visit somewhere a little closer to home. It had been years since he had last been in this part of the land of Fizzy Bubbles. His last time here didn't exactly go so well, but this time he was sure that a nice peaceful sightseeing journey with his partners would more than make up for any bad experiences he might have had before. <br />
<br />
The Amor Temple had long been a fascinating place in Cascadia. A place where long lost civilizations had left their mark on the world. Stark had always been fond of history and while visiting the temple wasn't necessarily the safest place he could have gone, it was definitely one that he would have regretted never seeing. The warnings had been posted about wild dark and psychic pokemon wandering the ruins as well as the dangers of getting lost within the ruins themselves. Regardless, the trainer was confident enough his ability and those of his partners to think that this would be nothing more than a great chance for a photo op. And if things went a little south, at least he wouldn't be alone. He had his friends with him. The pair of Eevees he had begun to call Dusk and Dawn, Riolu, Charmander, and others. Each of them had been training for years in private with Stark and it was time to get them some real world experience. And maybe a few pictures too.<br />
<br />
Stark approached the ancient stone ruins slowly. His blue and gold jacket rustling in the light breeze of the afternoon. Vegetation had long since begun to overgrow the huge stone structure and in a way it was a shame. Had someone actually wanted to, they could probably clean up the place and make it a tourist destination. Granted, that would take a huge commitment and a lot of effort, but it certainly would make this trip a little easier.<br />
<br />
The trainer smiled a sideways smirk as he grabbed a pair of pokeballs from his belt and let loose a flurry of bright light from within them only to have two eevees appear when the light dissipated. Stark knelt down and opened his arms as the two furballs rushed over and jumped in his arms. There was nothing like squeezing those you loved after not seeing them for a while. <b>&quot;Hey you guys! Did you miss me?&quot;</b><br />
<br />
<b>&quot;Veeeeeee!&quot;</b> the two eevees squealed in delight as they nuzzled up against their human friend. Stark always found it amazing how similar the two were despite have very different personalities.<br />
<b><br />
&quot;Hey Twilight! Hey Aurora! It's nice to see you both too,&quot;</b> Stark smiled as he let the let the two backtrack down to the ground so he could pet them, <b>&quot;So this place is called the Amor Temple. I really don't know much about it, but I figured we could check it out. Maybe find a secret treasure,&quot;</b> he winked, <b>&quot;Nah I'm just kidding. We aren't here to look for treasure. This whole place is a treasure upon itself. So are you ready?&quot;</b><br />
<br />
<b>&quot;Eeeeveeee!&quot;</b> the two evolution pokemon responded in unison bringing a smile to Stark's face. The trainer arose and looked out over the ruins while the wind rustled his hair. This was it. He was once more on his journey to become a great pokemon trainer. With a nod to his partners, he placed one foot in front of the other and began his stroll with his companions into a new adventure.<br />

<span style="color: gold"><span style="font-size: 9px">Sorry again for the slowness. Sorry for the lack of updates for Arc and Yuki, I'll remedy that, hopefully. I'm taking in the last three posters, and there goes my slots, unless some of the old people decide to drop out. Have fun everyone, remember to use Size 1 and use the respective color for your area. Thank you~<br />
<br />
Welcome one and all to the weekend of fun and updates~ Let's try to get as much updates in ;o<br />
<br />
<span style="color: deepskyblue"><u>.:Crater Island - Iridi Beach:.</u> (Please reply in <b>DeepSkyBlue</b>)<br />
<b>kaisap112</b>: The young trainer is in distress as she can only watch the poor giant swim away and her Pokemon wavering and struggling to keep conscious. She looks at the teary eyes of her poor Skitty, hoping that she could do something for every one of them. What matters the most right now, is the safety of that poor Poliwag. In a swift manner, a mechanical ball is thrown up into the air, followed by a collection of sparkles and light. As the ball descents, a figure rises up to the surface of the churning sea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seal. Seal-seal-seal. Seal-&quot;<br />
<br />
She recalls the exhausted Finneon and jumps back into the water. She places her Skitty on her head before clinging to the back of the male Seal named Minori. “Minori, think you can Surf me and Kitty to that island? I’m even more worried about that Poliwag now.&quot; She said with a quiver in her voice. The Seal's enthusiasm vanishes as he takes on a more serious mood. He nods at his trainer's orders, hoping to serve her well.<br />
<br />
The tidewater becomes animated as the hours of darkness approaches. Danger is imminent as the seas are known to be rough during the night time. The sun unites with the horizon, forming a spectacular display of warm colors as they reach the secluded area of the island where the Poliwag was heading to. She orders Minori to stop near the shoreline beside the cave as voices breached the echoes of waves in the cave.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you are you little monster! We don't know how you got away the first time, but I'll make sure myself that escaping and resisting is futile! Get back in here if you know what's good for you!&quot; shouted a lady in a stern voice. Cries of Pokemon are heard, reverberating within the enclosed space, lost, sad, and wavering.<br />

<span style="color: silver"><u>.:Brine Island - Salt City:.</u> (Please reply in <b>Silver</b>)<br />
<b>Arc_Angel and lilbluecorsola</b>: A woman sits underneath a proud and imposing tree, reaching for the heavens in its majesty. An inquisitve Golett roams their radius, analyzing and taking in the sights that the park has to offer, experiencing a world completely foreign and different from where she hailed. A world of no boundaries, a world full of things to discover and learn. He scurries all over, filled with new emotions that cannot be shown, filled with the spirit of &quot;life&quot;, as his trainer chuckles at his antics.<br />
<br />
<i>Left, right, left, right, tap tap.</i> Alternating steps, following a rhythm of harmonious frequencies. The sound of feet striking pavement, as faint shuffling trails it. A girl with eyes filled with compassion and excitement, and glasses shining against the sun, moves through the busy streets of Salin City, brimming with confidence in every turn like a native city-dweller. A Snorunt shadows her with a Sketchpad in hand, taking in the landscape for future references and inspiration, known as the little art prodigy of Jessica's team, not to mention the youngest addition to it.<br />
<br />
Minutes pass by before she reaches park grounds. A gentle breeze blows through the park, the ruffle of the leaves blends with the sounds of the fountain water and the sounds of nature, forming a symphony of little delights. Little specks of sunlight passing through the tree canopy highlights a woman and her Golett sprawled out on the grass underneath it. She casts a smile before getting a devilish idea. She moves around the park without a whisper above a breath, gliding with stealth and assurance. She hides behind the bush behind the towering tree as she hushes her Snorunt.<br />
<br />
“Boo!”<br />
<br />
After they settled down from the initial shock, they laughed heartily together, causing a few eyes to be set upon them as park strangers pass by. Remaining unfazed by this, they greet each other with bright smiles and spirits of zeal. They introduce their babies to each other, helping them get comfortable with the scenario before deciding to take a walk while Kristen shows Dwemer her sketchpad.<br />
<br />
They walk around the park, catching up with each other's lives, it was a walk full of merriment and emotion. Though they haven't met each other for quite a long time, it's as if they've been connected all this time in the way they're acting right now. Light shines through the thick flora of the park, illuminating the area with vibrant colors and enchantment. Minutes pass by, eventually a few hours too. Time flies when there's someone to enjoy it with. As the sun is beginning to set, a picture-perfect environment encompasses Kristen to break out the pencil, the sky itself is a work of art, a mixture of just the right amount of cool and warm colors to give the effect of nostalgia and coziness. Clouds are clearing up as the wind picks up, having the women look at each other's tired but satisfied faces. Their reunion is cut short as alarms go off and sirens woo. The peaceful atmosphere quickly shifts to a tense one as police officers ran amok. Shouts and screams are heard from different directions as the two babies cower in fear behind close to their trainers.<br />
<br />
What will the duo do?</span><br />

<b>Coolz8</b>: Strangers walk pass you, minding their own family and friends, the lad's calls drowned by the merry-making on this fine day. The water teems with life, may it be people or pokemon. You've stayed in one spot for the whole morning and you're staring to feel sick of it. You decide to explore by yourself with 'lil Trick. You look around with marvel as you leave footsteps on the shoreline, eventually to be washed away by the foamy tidewater. The water glistens, calling for your name once more, Trick is starting to sweat despite the cooling sea breeze. You jump into the cool waters, splashing and forming bubbles and ripples.<br />
<br />
You and Trick float on the water face up when you notice a blue ball floating near the corner of your eyes, dangling into your view. You quickly snap out of your trance of relaxation as you were about to fall asleep for an afternoon siesta in the beach. You take a closer look at the blue ball, it shudders and twitches, before revealing to be the ear of a cute Marill.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ma-marill?&quot;<br />
<br />
It tilts its head and inspects you with such curiosity. It eyes you with big round eyes, before diving back underwater. It looks like it wants to play with you.<br />

The resting place of all the poor critters caught between the legendary fight, some say they still fight on this island occasionally... The constant thunderstorms that plague this field gives those adventurers thrill and excitement, perhaps a bit too much for what they bargained for.<br />
<br />
Everyone knows that the only lifeforms that call this dreadful place &quot;home&quot; are electric types, but sometimes a few Pokemon get lost here and there and get washed up here. You decide that this place is a bit too much for a solo trek, giving you chills down your spine, prompting you to send out your two companions. The newly-caught Lotad shuffles over to your side, holding on tight as the sky draws streaks of lightning around it. Meanwhile, the Scizor stands with pride and bravery, standing its ground against even the loudest of thunders. You see a few Pokemon dashing across the field, looking for shelter as the wind grows into a gale, making it look like a storm is coming. A lonely Mareep can be seen treading in dangerous waters, looking lost as it moves aimlessly. There's also a cave a distance from where it is located, you can decide to brave the weather and go to the <b>poor Mareep</b>, or you can save yourself, and your Pokemon by <b>hiding in the cave</b>.<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: green"><u>.:Lily Island - Red Forest:.</u> (Please reply in <b>Green</b>)<br />
<b>PikaGod</b>: While all the tourists flock to Crater Island, some adventurers, foolish and brave, come together on Lily Island to enjoy nature's bounty. Most, if not all of them, venture in the calmer and generally more peaceful and kid-friendly places. Within all this though, a dark secret is hidden. A secret shrouded with darkness and mystery, a secret, centuries old, that no one seems to remember how it started. The secret is well-protected by the dense forest known by the name, &quot;Red Forest.&quot; It is named after the bloodshed that happens every now and then, in sight our out of sight, done by the savage beings that reside in this harsh environment. It seems like the aura changes whenever you enter this part of the island, then again, only the bravest of the brave try to find out what's up with this so called, &quot;Forest of Doom.&quot;<br />
<br />
We narrow down our focus today on a very average teenager in appearance. A teen with average height, average skin, average clothes, average hair, and a lot more average stuff. This is what people and Pokemon see, but inside, he's a brave, agreeable, selfless, and dependable man. His teenage hormones still plague him with easily-manipulated emotions. Like every teenager, he harbors many feelings inside of him that become a problem every once and a while. His maturity is still unstable especially around sugar, but in this place, he better not bring such sweets, or such behavior, as one wrong step could mean your life. A black lolita Pokemon stands by his side. From the looks of it, her serious and analytic attitude balances out Karmas' immaturity. This combo has what it takes to be an adventuring duo, but smarts just aren't enough to survive here.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well this looks like an interesting place, doesn't it?&quot; said Karmas, looking over at the Gothorita.<br />
<br />
Paine merely stared back at him, she really wasn't one to talk unless it was really really necessary. She crossed her arms and rolled her eyes, what exactly was her trainer waiting for? She motioned with her head for them to get going, making Karmas roll his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry Paine, I'm just trying to generate some atmosphere,&quot; said Karmas as they make their final decision of going to the dreaded forest. An ominous wind blows against them, as if the forest is already telling them to go back. Various sounds can already be heard, screams and moans echo in your ears. The sunlight is blocked by the thick canopies, with a lot of Pokemon, waiting above for an ambush. Better keep your eyes peeled and senses alert... a threat can be observed from every direction. Karmas shrugs this off and continues walking into the seemingly everlasting darkness. The abyss awaits for people who have come for the adventure of their lives. A new challenger has come... and only time will tell what would happen to him. Somewhere in Cascadia, people are having refreshing water to play with, friends to interact with, food to eat, lands to enjoy... here, you're only prey for everything that sees you. Perhaps even the tress... the ground... you'll never know what to expect.<br />
<br />
-o-o-o-o-o-o-<br />
<br />
A few minutes of trekking and cutting through the dense flora, scaring off tinier Pokemon who dare stand in your way, and you find yourself completely devoid of the outside world. An exit can no longer be seen as a little sunlight passes through the leaves, only enough to have you see the surroundings. Beady red eyes are seen staring through the darkness, the feeling of being watched will not go away as long as you're here. The wind just keeps blowing, even if there might not be open space anywhere, it's almost as if the wind was supernatural in here. Suddenly, silence lays upon the forest. Murkrow start panicking, trying to escape from the northern side of the forest. The earth shakes as big booming footsteps resonate. A bush suddenly rustles and you enter in a defensive position, ready for anything that comes out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Help me! Help me! A monster is coming for me! A monster is just behind me!&quot; a man comes through the bush screaming. He rushes over to Karmas and shakes him repeatedly before catching his breath. &quot;A monster is after me! He's so close, I can feel it! I only came here to investigate what makes this place so special... but now a monster is after me! Stranger! We need to escape quick, we can't fight it, he knocked out all of my Pokemon! I remember seeing a nice cave to hide in not so far from here while doing reconnaissance, I have to go there! You need to come with me! The monster is not too far behind!&quot;<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Green">Karmas and Paine looked at the man, both of them incredibly bewildered that some man had just burst out of the bush, and that apparently had been attacked by some monster or something. Paine looked at her trainer, not really sure what to do, and to be quite perfectly honest she really didn't want to help him. Karmas slapped his palm to his forehead at his Gothorita's reluctance to help and turned to the man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, yeah sure Paine and I will be more than happy to help you, won't we Paine,&quot; said Karmas, glaring at his pokemon.<br />
<br />
The Gothitelle shook her head and rolled her eyes, as Karmas turned back to the man, still trying to process that there was a monster out there. He hoped that it didn't show, but he had had enough bad experiences to know that anything that could possiblt have been considered a monster was not good news. The trainer made sure that his hand was near Banane's ball, it sounded like there could be a chance of them needing a quick getaway, and what better way was there than a giant flying dinosaur.<br />
<br />
&quot;So where is this cave?&quot; asked Karmas, &quot;I don't think that I saw one when we were walking. And this monster, is there any more information that you could give us? Just so that I could possibly prepare for an encounter or something like that.&quot;</span></span></div>

&quot;Funny. have it fixed when you get back.&quot; Trick replied.<br />
&quot;So, have you found that Marill? Our vacation/ lesiure mission seems to be going well so far, and playing with him might get us somewhere.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, I got his scent locked and we may still be well within tracking distance of him. So, what's your plan this time?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, we'll be a bit diplomatic with him first, then we may need to battle him when necessary. While playing, be as cautious and patient as possible. Then we'll catch him for further adventures. we're going to need some variety in our team. Don't you remember our adventure in Astoria?&quot;<br />
&quot;Those Combee and their Vespiquen? It wasn't exactly a nice experience for me, though a necessary one for my battling experience. and All I got out of it as some laughs after you attempted to inflict some super effective damage on them by throwing some pebbles.

<b>Arc_Angel and lilbluecorsola</b>: A woman sits underneath a proud and imposing tree, reaching for the heavens in its majesty. An inquisitve Golett roams their radius, analyzing and taking in the sights that the park has to offer, experiencing a world completely foreign and different from where she hailed. A world of no boundaries, a world full of things to discover and learn. He scurries all over, filled with new emotions that cannot be shown, filled with the spirit of &quot;life&quot;, as his trainer chuckles at his antics.<br />
<br />
<i>Left, right, left, right, tap tap.</i> Alternating steps, following a rhythm of harmonious frequencies. The sound of feet striking pavement, as faint shuffling trails it. A girl with eyes filled with compassion and excitement, and glasses shining against the sun, moves through the busy streets of Salin City, brimming with confidence in every turn like a native city-dweller. A Snorunt shadows her with a Sketchpad in hand, taking in the landscape for future references and inspiration, known as the little art prodigy of Jessica's team, not to mention the youngest addition to it.<br />
<br />
Minutes pass by before she reaches park grounds. A gentle breeze blows through the park, the ruffle of the leaves blends with the sounds of the fountain water and the sounds of nature, forming a symphony of little delights. Little specks of sunlight passing through the tree canopy highlights a woman and her Golett sprawled out on the grass underneath it. She casts a smile before getting a devilish idea. She moves around the park without a whisper above a breath, gliding with stealth and assurance. She hides behind the bush behind the towering tree as she hushes her Snorunt.<br />
<br />
“Boo!”<br />
<br />
After they settled down from the initial shock, they laughed heartily together, causing a few eyes to be set upon them as park strangers pass by. Remaining unfazed by this, they greet each other with bright smiles and spirits of zeal. They introduce their babies to each other, helping them get comfortable with the scenario before deciding to take a walk while Kristen shows Dwemer her sketchpad.<br />
<br />
They walk around the park, catching up with each other's lives, it was a walk full of merriment and emotion. Though they haven't met each other for quite a long time, it's as if they've been connected all this time in the way they're acting right now. Light shines through the thick flora of the park, illuminating the area with vibrant colors and enchantment. Minutes pass by, eventually a few hours too. Time flies when there's someone to enjoy it with. As the sun is beginning to set, a picture-perfect environment encompasses Kristen to break out the pencil, the sky itself is a work of art, a mixture of just the right amount of cool and warm colors to give the effect of nostalgia and coziness. Clouds are clearing up as the wind picks up, having the women look at each other's tired but satisfied faces. Their reunion is cut short as alarms go off and sirens woo. The peaceful atmosphere quickly shifts to a tense one as police officers ran amok. Shouts and screams are heard from different directions as the two babies cower in fear behind close to their trainers.<br />
<br />
What will the duo do?</span></span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: Silver">As Jessica shuffled shyly in Stacey’s shadow, she racked her brains for an icebreaker, something they could both share in common. <i>Think, come on, think.</i><br />
<br />
“U-um, how’s the reffing business? Those newbies sure can be a handful, huh?”<br />
<br />
<i>Stupid, don’t ask about work. This is supposed to be a vacation, remember?</i><br />
<br />
“Er, I mean, how have you been?”<br />
<br />
<i>Generic, but better. Let’s go with that.</i><br />
<br />
As they casually conversed, Jessica gradually began to feel ease and exposure. Eventually the two were exploring sides of themselves never shown to the other before, beyond the superficial. The reticent girl rarely felt comfortable with such close dialogue, except with her sister. She couldn’t even remember the last time she spoke straight to somebody like this, one-on-one, without party or pretense. But being with Stacey, a person she placed high on a pedestal, but – as she grew to realize from their talk – a person all the same, she sensed safety. Kindness. Understanding. Sometimes it was even the silence that joined them.<br />
<br />
The sun was setting, and time was slipping. Where had the hours gone? Deep inside, she knew without saying. Towards having fun with a – dare she declare? – a friend.<br />
<br />
Kristen spread herself and a collection of colored pencils on the grass, sketching the glowing sky with all its warms and cools. Proud pastels. As Dwemer peered curiously over her shoulder, she sheepishly shifted the paper to prevent his seeing, telling him to go stand over by a tree and wait. Puzzled by her Pokémon’s sudden assertiveness, Jessica snuck a sideways glance at the pad, and smiled to see Kristen was carefully capturing the ghost golem’s pose. A bit of blue amongst the green, shaded pink. A perfect picture.<br />
<br />
Jessica stood beside her companion, breathing the crisp air as clouds swirled overhead. The breeze began to excite, announcing autumn’s arrival. Though her Snorunt did not seem to mind the chill, Jess shivered and sneezed (an unfortunate result of sensitive sinuses). The two trainers looked at each other, then burst out laughing as they realized it was time to start heading back – hopefully to a cozy hotel. The beach would have to wait for another day.<br />
<br />
At that moment, an alarm screamed. Somewhere, others did too. Jessica’s shrill voice followed as she ducked and covered her head instinctively, unprepared for the assault of sound on her senses. More than that, the sirens reminded her of something… People, panic, police… It was all the same as that time... Except for the police. They weren’t there back then. Where were they? Too late. Still, it was similar. Too similar. It made her sick to her stomach.<br />
<br />
She rocked back and forth on her heels, hugging her knees tight to her chest. The warmth reminded her of something important, a replacement. At the same time she tried not to remember. Abruptly her head snapped back up. Eyes went wild with fear, seeming, searching far away. Atzu. Where was Atzu? She had to save him from the crowd…<br />
<br />
She stopped when she saw Stacey’s worried face staring down at her. Something clicked. That’s right, Atzu was safe in his Ball. And Pip, Pippa was being taken care of. She breathed slowly, soothing. After that, surroundings registered. She wasn’t there. She was here. Now. Either way, people needed her help. No, forget that. Her… <i>Friends</i> needed her. Needed to know she was okay.<br />
<br />
“S-sorry. I must have spaced out.”<br />
<br />
She saw it in Stacey’s eyes, a familiar, forlorn look. Of course, how could Jess forget? She was not the only one with sad memories. Why should she be so selfish? But there wasn’t a single trace of blame in that beautiful expression, both haunting and haunted. In fact, if there was anyone who could understand her feelings right now, it was the smiling woman who offered her hand. Jessica gripped it firm, rising to her feet. She smiled weakly in return, glad it was Stacey who was with her today, that she was the one who brought Jess back to reality. Moreover, she was glad that they had met, not just by chance at the travel agency, but from the very beginning. Jessica recalled, during her blackout, briefly wishing her sister were here. But not even Daisy could provide the kind of support she required right now…<br />
<br />
She shook her head. She couldn’t keep relying on crutches like this. She wanted to be strong for others too. Steadying on her own, she stooped down to pick up the crying Kristen and cradle her until she settled. Turning to Stacey, she nodded toward the source of the sirens – presumably where the police were running to, and most people from.<br />
<br />
“Should we go check it out? Maybe we can help somehow…”</span></span></span></div>

<span style="color: gold"><span style="font-size: 9px">Sorry again for the slowness. Sorry for the lack of updates for Arc and Yuki, I'll remedy that, hopefully. I'm taking in the last three posters, and there goes my slots, unless some of the old people decide to drop out. Have fun everyone, remember to use Size 1 and use the respective color for your area. Thank you~<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: gold"><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver">After the shock her old friend gave her startling her from her half dazed thoughts Stacey got up and greeted her with a large hug. Perhaps a little forward but she was happy to see Jess again, it had been such a long time and this action conveyed her feelings on their meeting so aptly. They had garnered a few looks from passers by but Stacey paid no attention to their stares. Jess looked a little embarrassed at first by the embrace but soon they began to walk through the park taking in the sights and sounds as they conversed. Jess remained slightly behind Stacey in their slow walk and Stacey smiled, she could sense her trying to find her words and she asks about her reffing job hearing her curse herself for bringing up work. Chuckling Stacey replied easily looking over her shoulder to meet the eyes of her travelling companion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its not too bad thanks for asking. It gets me out of the Mansion and I get to travel around a lot and meet new people. I was never one much for that in the past but I was pushed to start socialising with others by my team of all things,&quot; She said with a laugh her eyes shining with the fondness she felt for all her Pokemon. &quot;They were worried I was becoming withdrawn stuck in the Mansion with the dead and perhaps I was. Human interaction is important too and I've learnt a lot as I go along. Meeting new trainers is always refreshing, they bring such vigour and enthusiasm to Pokemon Battles and its easy to feed off that.&quot;<br />
<br />
After her answer Jess asked how she was and Stacey smiled again, &quot;I'm fine really thanks but ready for this that's for sure. How have you been, been keeping busy yourself? I've noticed you've caught new Pokemon since we last met and I must approve wholeheartedly with your choice. Snorunt, especially female ones are wonderful company.&quot; Stacey waved to the little snow hat Pokemon as she spoke of her and giggled as she saw Dwemer keeping up with her avidly looking her over. He had seen a Froslass in Eve but not her pre-evolved form, she was ... interesting to look at.<br />
<br />
They fell into a comfortable silence walking next to each other now and Stacey felt that Jess was still a little nervous around her and it made Stacey a little sad. She never felt a higher sense of importance, she just kind of fell into her position. She loathed fame, didn't want to be known around the world which was a bit absurd for a trainer wanting to push to become a Ghost Pokemon Master, fame would come with such a position. She dealt with the notoriety as best as possible and hid away in her home when she couldn't. The day was moving along fast it seemed as the sun made its path through the sky leaving behind trails of gold, orange and red as it began to go to bed itself. It was so pretty and Dwemer thought so too making mental pictures of the colours and how they melted together. He had a brilliant photographic memory and could pull on any past picture he had seen with ease, something that made Stacey a little jealous; her memory sucked! Stacey noticed Kristen begin to draw something on her artists pad and Dwemer turned his attention away from the sky to observe the Snorunt who guarded her picture closely instructing the Golett to wait by the tree and he pondered the order before walking over to the tree and making mental pictures of that instead. Stacey snorted a little unlady-like at her Pokemon's reaction, he was such a relaxed Pokemon he didn't take offence to the instruction. When Kristen was finished they all took a look nodding with their approval, it was simply lovely. <br />
<br />
They began and made their way towards the exit to the park towards their hotel, they would have more time tomorrow to converse, perhaps even go to the beach that would be an experience for Dwemer, trying to explain what bikini's were for. Stacey held back a loud laugh as her thoughts took hold of her again but suddenly the air was pierced by the sound of high-pitched sirens which brought Stacey back to reality but it was Jess's haunting wail that nearly had the young woman jump of her skin.<br />
<br />
<i>'What the Hell??'</i> she thought trying to still the hammering in her chest. She felt her eyes narrow for a moment not appreciating the shock before she relaxed her face. It was her friend after all that was distressed, stop being so mean. Damn it, she felt that hold the Mansion had over heart crush harder wanting her to berate the young girl for her weak actions as she knelt down rocking back and forth. She was lost in her memories for the moment and Stacey could observe her frazzled state. Her gaze was harsh and she hated herself for it and taking all her strength she pushed through her own mental war, the darkness retreated to the back of her mind and she sighed with relief. She quickly soothed Kristen whoo looked terrified of the noise and her trainer's reaction to it. Dwemer was more interested in what the sound was but moved to the Snorunt upon his trainer's instruction and tried some small talk ... he was more the silent type but he asked about her drawing as Stacey moved to Jess. She wondered what had caused this retreat into herself when the sirens sounded louder in her own mind. She blinked as her mind flashed back to that day. She was enjoying a parade with her then young Rotom when the attack had hit causing the sirens to sound. She had been injured then but thankfully her Pokemon was safe. Jess had been there with her that day in amongst the crowd and her memory sped forward to the first of many battles that took place that day. How that Machamp had been ripped apart ...&quot; Blinking again Stacey stared down at Jess and placed her hands on her shoulders hoping to ground her.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're not there any more Jess, that day is long gone. They're just police or perhaps ambulance sirens. Come on love, Kirsten;s getting a little freaked out now,&quot; she said as gently as she could whilst part of her mind was begging her to slap the nonsense out of her, that dark part that always fought the rest of her. Jess looked up at her and suddenly her eyes looked a little clearer as she realised where she was. She took hold of Stacey's outstretched hand and stood up fighting an internal war that Stacey saw etched across her face. She eventually stopped mentally berating herself and smiled a little smile at the woman who returned it.<br />
<br />
“Should we go check it out? Maybe we can help somehow…”<br />
<br />
Stacey looked at her and felt that was putting on a brave face but perhaps she felt the need to be brave right now after that show. Stacey grinned as wide as possible and nodded her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure hon if you're feeling up to. I'm sure it won't be anything too big but a little help goes a long way. Anyway I'm sure Dwemer would love to see a Police or Ambulance Car, he's very interested in human technology and constructs such as the buildings here. Come on I think the sirens were heading over there, lets go have a look see.&quot; She grabbed Jess's hand looking like an excited child hoping that the little bravado and excuse for Dwemer to see some action would calm her enough to take her mind off her thought and concerns. She grabbed Dwemer's hand in her other and began to jog towards the source of sound nearly dragging her companions with her. </span></span></span></div>

<b>ChaoticHell83</b>: <i>The thunder clouds are rumbling. Sound of death echoing. Consecrating light flashing. Gales blowing. Pitter-patter-pitter-pat.</i> Darkness shrouds the Thunder Fields of the famous Ion Island. An island of huge tragedies and danger if you're not careful. The resting place of all the poor critters caught between the legendary fight, some say they still fight on this island occasionally... The constant thunderstorms that plague this field gives those adventurers thrill and excitement, perhaps a bit too much for what they bargained for.<br />
<br />
Everyone knows that the only lifeforms that call this dreadful place &quot;home&quot; are electric types, but sometimes a few Pokemon get lost here and there and get washed up here. You decide that this place is a bit too much for a solo trek, giving you chills down your spine, prompting you to send out your two companions. The newly-caught Lotad shuffles over to your side, holding on tight as the sky draws streaks of lightning around it. Meanwhile, the Scizor stands with pride and bravery, standing its ground against even the loudest of thunders. You see a few Pokemon dashing across the field, looking for shelter as the wind grows into a gale, making it look like a storm is coming. A lonely Mareep can be seen treading in dangerous waters, looking lost as it moves aimlessly. There's also a cave a distance from where it is located, you can decide to brave the weather and go to the <b>poor Mareep</b>, or you can save yourself, and your Pokemon by <b>hiding in the cave</b>.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span>

<br />
Noticing the poor Mareep treading around Caesar is struck with compassion for the little sheep-Pokemon, and excitement fills his core as the sound of thunder and lightning ring out through the air. <i>Ah! My first encounter with an electric Pokemon! No way I can pass this up, as dangerous as it is I'll keep Marcus safe in his Pokeball. Scizor should be fine outside with me. I could also send out my new Cubone, or my Carnivine. Hmm... I need to name them-</i> A blast of thunder breaks Caesar's thought and causes him to duck a bit and cover his head before taking off towards the Mareep, making sure to not move too quickly as to frighten it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to help you!&quot; He begins calling out, as he gets closer, &quot;It's dangerous out here, even for an electric like you!&quot;</span></span></div>

Thank you~<br />
<br />
Welcome one and all to the weekend of fun and updates~ Let's try to get as much updates in ;o</span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"><br />
<br />
<span style="color: deepskyblue"><u>.:Crater Island - Iridi Beach:.</u> (Please reply in <b>DeepSkyBlue</b>)<br />
<b>kaisap112</b>: The young trainer is in distress as she can only watch the poor giant swim away and her Pokemon wavering and struggling to keep conscious. She looks at the teary eyes of her poor Skitty, hoping that she could do something for every one of them. What matters the most right now, is the safety of that poor Poliwag. In a swift manner, a mechanical ball is thrown up into the air, followed by a collection of sparkles and light. As the ball descents, a figure rises up to the surface of the churning sea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seal. Seal-seal-seal. Seal-&quot;<br />
<br />
She recalls the exhausted Finneon and jumps back into the water. She places her Skitty on her head before clinging to the back of the male Seal named Minori. “Minori, think you can Surf me and Kitty to that island? I’m even more worried about that Poliwag now.&quot; She said with a quiver in her voice. The Seal's enthusiasm vanishes as he takes on a more serious mood. He nods at his trainer's orders, hoping to serve her well.<br />
<br />
The tidewater becomes animated as the hours of darkness approaches. Danger is imminent as the seas are known to be rough during the night time. The sun unites with the horizon, forming a spectacular display of warm colors as they reach the secluded area of the island where the Poliwag was heading to. She orders Minori to stop near the shoreline beside the cave as voices breached the echoes of waves in the cave.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you are you little monster! We don't know how you got away the first time, but I'll make sure myself that escaping and resisting is futile! Get back in here if you know what's good for you!&quot; shouted a lady in a stern voice. Cries of Pokemon are heard, reverberating within the enclosed space, lost, sad, and wavering.<br />
<br />
What will Noriko do?</span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: deepskyblue"><span style="font-size: 9px">Noriko and Kitty boarded Minori and made their way after Poliwag. The young trainer had a very bad feeling about all this…<br />
<br />
The water got dark and gloomy-looking as the sun began to set in the distance. Sure there had been beautiful colors painting the sky earlier, but Noriko was too busy worrying about what lay ahead – least of it being a potentially dangerous ocean at night. After a while of searching, the team reached an area of the island that was somewhat hidden and seemed perfect for a scared Poliwag to hide in. Stopping Minori at the shoreline, Noriko got on somewhat-dry land.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Kitty’s ears twitched. There was noise, voices to be exact, coming from a cave. The aggressiveness of the tone made Noriko’s stomach turn uncomfortably, but she decided to investigate the noise regardless.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you are you little monster! We don't know how you got away the first time, but I'll make sure myself that escaping and resisting is futile! Get back in here if you know what's good for you!&quot;<br />
<br />
The stern voice of a woman was accompanied by the saddest wailing of Pokémon Noriko had ever heard. And there seemed to be more than one as well! But whatever was going on, she had to get the Pokémon out of harm’s way first – questions could always be asked later. Noriko stepped forward.<br />
<br />
“Hey! Stop harassing those Pokémon right now! If you won’t, I won’t hesitate to take measures!” Kitty jumped off Noriko and hissed with her fur standing up, visibly upset at the events. No Pokémon was going to be hurt unjustly on their watch!</span></span></div>

<i><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: darkorchid">Venom Island</span></span></i><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px">Quite possibly the least attractive area of the entire island chain if you don't have a specific purpose, Venom Island is the epitome of all things putrid. The ground itself is saturated with poisonous substances. Also, all of the garbage from Salin City is transported here, but it is hardly noticed, as the acidic ground eats away at anything at a very quick pace. However, that means that not many things can live in this desolate area, with only a dead tree forest, a poisonous swamp, and a large skull tunnel interupting the landscape. The rest of the island is just plain dirt, but a good amount of poison types inhabit the area. The water surrounding the island is so poisonous that Pokemon cannot swim in it-therefore, unless it is a poison type, it cannot Surf to this area.<br />
<b><span style="color: darkorchid">Skull Tunnel</span></b> - Taking up small amount of the island, the top of Skull Tunnel is a giant white rock formation, shaped like a skull. However, Pokemon have dug tunnels far underground from the Skull. Poison and ghost Pokemon call this area home, and the tunnels are pitch black, so unless you'd like to wander around aimlessly, bring something with Flash.</span>

</blockquote>Keith stepped off the boat, and breathed deeply the putrid air of Venom Island. The purple Pokemon floating next to him seemed thoroughly disgusted by this.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can-not be-lieve I let you talk me in-to co-ming here, Id-i-ot Meat Sack,&quot; the Shuppet grumbled. &quot;This en-ti-re is-land smells like rot-ten gar-bage and dead things that have sat out in the sun for too long. How can you stand it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Training Poison-types tends to have that kind of effect, Myrtle,&quot; replied Keith. &quot;After years of training a Weezing, I'm kinda immune to bad smells. Plus, there was the Gloom, the Koffing, the two different Grimer, and let's not forget the Skuntank-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;O-K, O-K, you've made your point,&quot; interrupted Myrtle. &quot;But why do I have to be out of my Po-ke Ball?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because we're headed for Skull Tunnel,&quot; answered Keith. &quot;It's this skull-shaped rock formation with underground tunnels, home to all sorts of Pokemon. I can only imagine what we'll meet down there!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have yet to an-swer my ques-tion-&quot; began Myrtle.<br />
<br />
&quot;The tunnels are supposed to be pitch black, Myrtle, and you know Flash.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn,&quot; Myrtle grumbled. &quot;Why did I e-ver let you talk me in-to lear-ning that wretch-ed tech-nique?&quot; Keith headed off for Skull Tunnel, with Myrtle the Shuppet following behind him, grumbling the whole way in that same vein.</div>

<i><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: darkorchid">Venom Island</span></span></i><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px">Quite possibly the least attractive area of the entire island chain if you don't have a specific purpose, Venom Island is the epitome of all things putrid. The ground itself is saturated with poisonous substances. Also, all of the garbage from Salin City is transported here, but it is hardly noticed, as the acidic ground eats away at anything at a very quick pace. However, that means that not many things can live in this desolate area, with only a dead tree forest, a poisonous swamp, and a large skull tunnel interupting the landscape. The rest of the island is just plain dirt, but a good amount of poison types inhabit the area. The water surrounding the island is so poisonous that Pokemon cannot swim in it-therefore, unless it is a poison type, it cannot Surf to this area.<br />
<b><span style="color: darkorchid">Skull Tunnel</span></b> - Taking up small amount of the island, the top of Skull Tunnel is a giant white rock formation, shaped like a skull. However, Pokemon have dug tunnels far underground from the Skull. Poison and ghost Pokemon call this area home, and the tunnels are pitch black, so unless you'd like to wander around aimlessly, bring something with Flash.</span>

<span style="font-size: 9px">With kaisap's OK, this adventure will be a triad adventure with Missingno. Master and Marion Ette.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: Darkorchid">&quot;Con-nor, did you get us lost yet a-gain? This does-n't look or smell like A-du-ro Is-land the last ime I checked,&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor had been frantically looking at his map in all sors of directions with Gaspard on his shoulder and Foster staring at him incredulously. &quot;Aipopom...&quot; Gaspard shook his head at his trainer's absolutely terribly horrible sense of direction. It was always thanks to his mad navigational skills that the photographer always somehow ends up at the strangest of places. &quot;Oh man, not again... I could have sworn I took a left turn back there...&quot; Connor said, confirming Foster's suspicion. The Aipom and Shuppet groaned. &quot;You real-ly are a fool,&quot; Foster called back to his Trainer, &quot;Well, no point moping about it right guys? Since we're here, might as well check the place... right? Ehehe...&quot; he let out a forced laugh. &quot;Yeesh, it sure stinks around here...&quot;<br />
<br />
The trio then looked at the rock formation in front of them, &quot;You know, I wonder how they managed to make that rock look like that? It's amazing,&quot; he said as he grabbed his camera to take a picture of the tunnel. &quot;This place to-tally screams e-vil lair or some-thing out of a car-toon, don't you think Con-nor? At least that's what my sis-ter would have said a-b out this place,&quot; Foster replied as Gaspard agreed with him with a nod, &quot;Ai-ai,&quot; &quot;Heh, you have a point. I can totally imagine her saying something like that. And it does, doesn't it?&quot; Connor smiled. &quot;Hmmm... sure looks dark inside though...&quot; Connor said as he stared at the tunnel in front of him. As if on cue, Foster immediately used Flash to illuminate the inside of the tunnel, &quot;Well, are we go-ing in and get our-selves lost more than e-ver?&quot; Foster snickered as Connor pouted at the Shuppet's comment. &quot;Hey that's not very n---oh come on Gaspard, you too?&quot; he looked at Gaspard who was giggling as well. &quot;Ha! Some-one ag-rees with me!&quot; Connor sighed. &quot;Oh whatever... this place seems interesting enough. Looks like a good place to take photos of too. Okay, it's decided. Let's check it out!&quot; he exclaimed as he readied his camera's flash to serve as a flashlight as well. With Foster's Flash and Connor's camera serving as their light in the tunnel, the trio went inside the tunnel, not knowing what's ahead.</span></span><br />
