<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> Watching the sharp crystals pierce your pup’s flesh feels almost as painful to you as it does to Leo. But through his suffering you also see a burning determination to win, and reality forcefully sets in – your Growlithe isn’t a small cub anymore, but a fiery warrior eager to prove himself. And it falls on you give him such an opportunity!<br />
<br />
Despite struggling to set himself free, your orders still reach Leo’s ears, and he roars in approval before carrying them out. He tenses his muscles and finds just enough strength to kick one of the chains with his hind leg, shattering the ice crystals that kept him bound! Then, using his free right paw, he breaks the remaining chain and leaps away from Cryogonal, taking a moment to recover from the intense strain.<br />
Meanwhile, the frozen creature simply freezes more moisture from the atmosphere, rebuilding his crystal chains effortlessly. After all, this is its environment, and there’s nothing more dangerous than fighting an aggressive Pokemon in its favored habitat. However, you seem to have a plan…<br />
<br />
Leo growls, heats up inside and spits out a spiral of fire aimed at the ground beneath Cryongonal. Upon making contact with the floor, the flames twist, turn and shoot upwards, creating a spinning blaze pillar that progressively causes the foe to melt! The sudden increase in temperature causes parts of Cryogonal to liquefy, to which the foe responds by forcefully freezing the water again to reform itself, only to be molten again by the abnormally-hot air. It’s trapped in a loop!<br />
<br />
Leo roars in excitement, pumped up by his obvious success; no matter how quickly Cryogonal regenerates, the raging fire melts it right back down. However, elated by his temporary victory, the Growlithe fails to notice the commotion rising around him – there is movement around the ice-cream crates, and when a barrage of <b>Icicle Spear</b>s hits the pup’s side from out of nowhere, Leo looks around puzzled – there is no way that hit came from the trapped Cryogonal!<br />
<br />
You spot them first – one by one, four creatures hover from behind the abandoned crates and band together. Their bodies are white and round in shape, and their eyes are all locked on the one who picked a fight with their Cryogonal lord – it’s a Horde of

<br />
The fight just took a turn for the worst – Leo went from having to contend against one powerful foe to facing an army of five opponents! Is this a trap set by whoever sent you here over the phone?<br />
<br />
What do you do now?!</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver">With the sudden victory of trapping the Snow Flake Pokemon in a Fire Spin, Liza had to chalk up her success to her fight against Ethan, many moons ago. The Flaming Vortex helped her stand a chance back then, and she knew that the move would keep the Ice Type preoccupied for quite a while.<br />
<br />
“Growlithe!” the pup barked. This was it, the perfect chance to escape towards the set of stairs across the room. <br />
<br />
But as soon as Liza took a step, something had caused her Leo to go on high alert, a barrage of Icicle Spears piercing her Growlithe on the side. <i>The attack...don’t tell me, theres more of them!</i> Emerging from the abandon crates a horde of Vanillite appeared, clearly upset that they had picked a fight with their friend.<br />
<br />
<i>This can’t be a coincidence...this had to be a well planned trap!</i> she thought.<br />
<br />
Now Leo had to contend against five foes, the odds were clearly stacked against them now, but...what should she do? Should she release yet another Pokemon to help out here? Looking at her Growlithe, he had clearly taken a beating thus far but he still looked raring to go. <br />
<br />
“Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!” Leo barked at his new enemies.<br />
<br />
<i>Getting anyone else mixed in this wouldn’t be wise...if anything, this was the perfect opportunity...</i><br />
<br />
Ever since, Liza was a girl, participating in contests was her dream...but when she met Ethan, she had to learn that just coming up with combinations to make them pretty wasn’t the goal, it was making them so pretty, that they were deadly. <br />
<br />
There were 4 Vanillites and a Cryogonal, since the big boss was trapped the Lass didn’t need to worry about it...for now...if they attack after all, it’d only break the fiery twister and then, they would really be in some deep shit. It pained her to have to take down a bunch of Pokemon that reminder her of her own...but they seemed to have already decided what they thought of them, this was self defense after all.<br />
<br />
“Leo, it’s appeal time!” She said, “Use <b>Swift</b>, to strike everyone except Crygonal, then quickly follow up with <b>Ember</b>, heating the stars with intense fire energy to hit them even harder, finish with an <b>Aerial Ace</b>, slashing them all in one go!”<br />
<br />
The performance was a slight complicated one, but it was one she knew her Growlithe could pull off. “You can do it baby!” she cheered.<br />

<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> It has been leading up to this moment, and you’re not going to let the opportunity slip by – Heatmor guided and protected you throughout the countless challenges put in front of you by Heatran; he put his own safety on the line to take down the giant alongside you, shielded Gemini from almost-certain death and together, you have all conquered the God of Mt. Aduro. There is no question that a powerful bond has formed between you and the anteater leader, but… can you really expect him to leave his family behind, especially now that they’re all finally safe?<br />
<br />
Heatmor glances at the Level Ball you present him, looking conflicted. He stares up at you, at a loss for words, then turns around and walks back to his pack. The group welcome him with open arms, a family finally reunited in peace, but soon forcefully turn the leader back around and gently push in your direction. Looking confused, Heatmor can’t bring himself to choose; he fought to keep his family safe and give them a home, but in doing so found a human he’d be willing to journey the world with. Whichever calls he makes, he ends up leaving someone precious behind…<br />
<br />
Heatmor looks at Gemini, Mustard, Helga, Meowth and finally you. Every single one of you got him his family back and helped rid Aduro of the eternal tyrant. Who knows what else you can accomplish together? Turning to his group, he tears up a little, but they’re quick to tell them what they think ,and Meowth translates: they’re thankful for everything he’s done, but they don’t need protection anymore; they can settle down, become stronger and increase their numbers without fear of Heatran’s disapproval, all thanks to him and to you as well. So he should go, see the world beyond the mountain and return one day to tell them all about it, but for now, they’ll be fine! Heatmor breathes in deep, closes his eyes for a moment and nods, having made up his mind.<br />
<br />
The Fire-Type walks over to you once again, holds out his hand and presses the button on the Level Ball himself with an amused grin, before being drawn inside the device. Without so much as a hint of struggle the LED flashes three times, and the Ball locks unopposed. <b>You’ve captured a Level 8

Male Heatmor!</b><br />
<br />
The anteater pack cheers and you can’t stop yourself from smiling as well – Heatmor will no doubt make for a powerful ally and good friend; besides, how many Pokemon can claim to have toppled a Legendary foe?<br />
The air in the chamber is cooler already, and now it’s time to leave. Kyle and Doduo regrettably won’t be joining you on your way back – and to think the goofy reporter never managed to see who was behind it all. His documentary will never be finished, but you can tell everyone the story in his place; so long as the truth comes out, that should be enough to appease the soul of a die-hard reporter like Kyle Styles, even if all he really had was a homemade radio station and a video camera. If it wasn’t for him and his bird Pokemon’s help, you might have not made it at all, and that’s also something you’ll never forget. But at the end of the day, it was you who conquered the Great One and put a stop to his reign of tyranny – and there are very few journeying Fizzy Bubbles right now that would have successfully accomplished the same.<br />
<br />
You stand as one of the greatest Trainers roaming the land today, and sooner or later everyone will know about the Poison-Type master who defeated Heatran and put Aduro to sleep.<br />
Now it’s time to leave and seek out the next adventure, wherever that may be. A new chapter of your journey might be waiting for you right here in Cascadia or halfway across the world, but nobody will ever deny what you accomplished in Mt. Aduro today.<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> Sometimes a Trainer has to make important choices. Very rarely in the real world are battles simple affairs, one-on-one duels of honor and mutual respect; no, the real world is merciless, dangerous and those who don’t adapt, perish. This is one such case of survival of the fittest – the Vanillite rely on their lord to protect them, and keeping Cryogonal safe is in their best interest. You picked a fight that you now have to finish in vastly different conditions from the ones back when you started – can you adapt?<br />
<br />
Your call is to leave Leo to fend for himself. The pup is both strong and eager, but how wise of a choice is it? Despite the type advantage, the numbers game is far from favorable for a Pokemon of Leo’s stature. Then again, you’re not looking to battle using conventional means, gambling your Growlithe’s safety on a risky appeal. Whether or not it pays off is something you’re about to find out… but can you handle the consequences, and the guilt, if it fails?<br />
<br />
Leo roars at the horde menacingly while trying to piece all of your instructions together; this is a routine he’s simply not accustomed to, nor is this a battle routine you’ve trained extensively. As such, it takes the pup a while to process it all, but the Vanillite aren’t going to sit around waiting: all four of them release a new barrage of <b>Icicle Spear</b>s, dozens of frozen arrows flying through the air and landing all around your partner! Several miss their mark entirely and shatter on the ground, but an equally scary number of them dig into Leo’s flesh and make him squeal in pain from the onslaught. The Fire-Type remains standing, but his left hind leg is in bad shape; still, fighting through the pain, Leo grins as he seems to have finally realized what you’re aiming for!<br />
<br />
The canine causes several golden stars to materialized around him and shoots them upwards; when the shooting stars home in on the hostile group, Leo times a shower of Embers to hit the glowing projectiles, causing them to flare up in a spectacle of orange light! The Draco Meteor-lookalike crashes into the horde, exploding violently and causing two of the living popsicles to immediately melt away; the other two seem severely injured and Leo is swift to pick them off with a lightning-fast dash and upwards slash of his fangs, an improvised <i>Tsubame Gaeshi</i> samurai-like technique that is only slowed down by his aching leg, but effective nonetheless: the remaining foes tumble to the floor unconscious, and just like that, the entire group of low-leveled Vanillite has been conquered! <b>Leo gains 1 Level!</b><br />
<br />
Triumphant but tired, Leo grins while gasping for air. Hoever, the smirk quickly fades when he realizes the Fire Spin has subsided and Cryogonal towers before him, reformed and ominously waving his newly-grown ice chains!<br />
<br />
-	<i>Enough!</i><br />
<br />
That voice… it’s the same one you heard on the phone! The storeroom is too dark to spot the man, but suddenly, a bright glow emerges from behind Cryogonal, seconds before the Pokemon explodes into a million shards upon the impact of a massive <b>Fire Blast</b>! Where the heck did that come from?!<br />
<br />
-	Don’t just stand there, run to the stairs!!<br />
<br />
Shocked and without any real alternatives, you rush to where you had intended to go in the first place, before Cryogonal got in the way. As you make your way over, you find someone standing at the stop of the staircase; when you draw closer you realize it’s an elderly man, though not as old as Oscar: probably in his sixties, practically bald, wearing glasses, a light brown jacket and worn-out grey flannel pants, he carries a Pokeball in one hand and a concerned look on his face. He moves for you to follow him upstairs and you see little choice but to comply, before Cryogonal Recovers again. You climb up and enter another room, and the man closes the door behind him.<br />
<br />
-	That was reckless! What were you thinking?!<br />
<br />
Visibly irritated, he tosses his jacket to the floor and gestures randomly to let loose his frustration. It takes a good while for him to calm down enough to address you properly.<br />
<br />
-	Do you <i>want</i> them to find you? Is that it? Can’t you walk anywhere without making a huge scene? What, do you think those <i>dead</i> ice creams will give you points on the appeal? That’s what’s wrong with you contest lovers of today!<br />
<br />
You don’t quite follow, but his mind changes tracks fast enough that you don’t really have to.<br />
<br />
-	“Voice of unrest”, right? Come on, spill it, tell me what you know. You couldn’t have found me if you didn’t know something – give me the dirt. Did they start rooting out insurgents again?<br />
<br />
He talks like one of those cops from the movies, you find yourself noticing. This man seems to think you know a lot more than you actually do, and to make matters worse, you seem to have gotten off on the wrong foot with him...<br />
<br />
What will you do now?</span></span><br />

<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> It has been leading up to this moment, and you’re not going to let the opportunity slip by – Heatmor guided and protected you throughout the countless challenges put in front of you by Heatran; he put his own safety on the line to take down the giant alongside you, shielded Gemini from almost-certain death and together, you have all conquered the God of Mt. Aduro. There is no question that a powerful bond has formed between you and the anteater leader, but… can you really expect him to leave his family behind, especially now that they’re all finally safe?<br />
<br />
Heatmor glances at the Level Ball you present him, looking conflicted. He stares up at you, at a loss for words, then turns around and walks back to his pack. The group welcome him with open arms, a family finally reunited in peace, but soon forcefully turn the leader back around and gently push in your direction. Looking confused, Heatmor can’t bring himself to choose; he fought to keep his family safe and give them a home, but in doing so found a human he’d be willing to journey the world with. Whichever calls he makes, he ends up leaving someone precious behind…<br />
<br />
Heatmor looks at Gemini, Mustard, Helga, Meowth and finally you. Every single one of you got him his family back and helped rid Aduro of the eternal tyrant. Who knows what else you can accomplish together? Turning to his group, he tears up a little, but they’re quick to tell them what they think ,and Meowth translates: they’re thankful for everything he’s done, but they don’t need protection anymore; they can settle down, become stronger and increase their numbers without fear of Heatran’s disapproval, all thanks to him and to you as well. So he should go, see the world beyond the mountain and return one day to tell them all about it, but for now, they’ll be fine! Heatmor breathes in deep, closes his eyes for a moment and nods, having made up his mind.<br />
<br />
The Fire-Type walks over to you once again, holds out his hand and presses the button on the Level Ball himself with an amused grin, before being drawn inside the device. Without so much as a hint of struggle the LED flashes three times, and the Ball locks unopposed. <b>You’ve captured a Level 8

Male Heatmor!</b><br />
<br />
The anteater pack cheers and you can’t stop yourself from smiling as well – Heatmor will no doubt make for a powerful ally and good friend; besides, how many Pokemon can claim to have toppled a Legendary foe?<br />
The air in the chamber is cooler already, and now it’s time to leave. Kyle and Doduo regrettably won’t be joining you on your way back – and to think the goofy reporter never managed to see who was behind it all. His documentary will never be finished, but you can tell everyone the story in his place; so long as the truth comes out, that should be enough to appease the soul of a die-hard reporter like Kyle Styles, even if all he really had was a homemade radio station and a video camera. If it wasn’t for him and his bird Pokemon’s help, you might have not made it at all, and that’s also something you’ll never forget. But at the end of the day, it was you who conquered the Great One and put a stop to his reign of tyranny – and there are very few journeying Fizzy Bubbles right now that would have successfully accomplished the same.<br />
<br />
You stand as one of the greatest Trainers roaming the land today, and sooner or later everyone will know about the Poison-Type master who defeated Heatran and put Aduro to sleep.<br />
Now it’s time to leave and seek out the next adventure, wherever that may be. A new chapter of your journey might be waiting for you right here in Cascadia or halfway across the world, but nobody will ever deny what you accomplish in Mt. Aduro today.<br />
<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">For a minute, Heatmor stared at the Level Ball. Keith didn't need the translation skills of his Meowth, nor the ability to taste emotions of his Shuppet or Banette, to know that the Fire-type was conflicted. The two of them had certainly formed a close bond as they fought together through the arduous Mt. Aduro, overcoming all sorts of obstacles, helping each other out... it was clear that this was just as obvious to Heatmor as it was to Keith, but the Anteater Pokémon still looked conflicted. And it wasn't hard to see why- Heatmor, after all, had a family here who looked up to him. &quot;I'll understand if you'd rather stay here,&quot; Keith said to Heatmor. &quot;I mean, far be it from me to break up a family like this, but... I mean, I'm not the best judge of these things, but it seems to me like they're all for you coming with us,&quot; he added, glancing at the other Heatmor.<br />
<br />
Heatmor turned back to his pack, who welcomed him with open arms, but then forcefully turned him around and gave him a gentle nudge back in Keith's direction. Keith smiled- he had clearly been right about how the other Heatmor felt about this.<br />
<br />
Thunderous footsteps from behind Keith told him that his Hariyama had walked up behind him, and a quick glance told him that Gemini and Mustard were there as well. All of them had noticed what Keith was doing, and they were now all looking at the Heatmor leader, smiling in a friendly and welcoming fashion. Clearly, they all felt that Heatmor would be a good fit for the team as well. And then, tearing up a bit, Heatmor turned back and listened as the pack addressed him. Keith turned to look at Meowth, who took the cue and started to translate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Da Heatmor are sayin' dat dey don't need his protection no more,&quot; he translated. &quot;Now dat Heatran's outta da picture, deys can get stronger and work on buildin' Aduro Island's Heatmor population back up again witout worryin' about dat molten menace anymore. Dey's sayin... Dey's sayin' he oughta go, ta see da world beyond dis place, and maybe even come back ta tell da tale, but fer now, dey're fine witout him.&quot; Meowth was starting to tear up a bit as well at this emotional goodbye.<br />
<br />
Heatmor, meanwhile, took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and nodded. He then walked over to Keith, and pressed a clawed hand to the button on the Level Ball. To Keith's delight, the sphere split in half, sucked Heatmor inside, and didn't even shake as the light blinked on and off. And then, the ball gave that telltale low-pidched ping.<br />
<br />
Keith's grin spread across his face like wildfire as he stood back up. &quot;All right!&quot; he exclaimed as he held up the Level Ball. &quot;I just caught... a Heatmor!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Meowth! Dat's right!&quot; Meowth chimed in.<br />
<br />
And they weren't the only ones happy, either- the rest of the Heatmor started cheering, and Helga patted Keith on the back (though given the sheer size of her hands, this nearly knocked him to the ground). Gemini and Mustard looked happy as well. But now, the time truly had come for Keith to depart from Mt. Aduro. He knew, sadly, that Kyle never did get to see just exactly what was behind the whole ordeal, never managed to finish that documentary of his... but Keith did know, and that's what mattered. He would tell the story whenever and wherever he could, make sure that the story came out in the end. He owed that much to Kyle- even if his first impression of the guy was that of a brainless coward, he had grown to like the journalist, and certainly a lot of this achievement had to be credited to him and his Doduo. And as for what else he could do to repay the late Kyle Styles, Keith had another idea...<br />
<br />
As Keith and Meowth were making their way back down the mountain, Keith threw the Level Ball into the air. &quot;Heatmor, come on out!&quot; he exclaimed, as his newest Pokémon appeared before him.<br />
<br />
Heatmor looked up at his new Trainer. &quot;Mor?&quot; he said questioningly.<br />
<br />
Keith smiled. &quot;Welcome to the team, Heatmor,&quot; he said. &quot;We're headed home for now, but I wanted to talk to you about a nickname first. I've had an idea, I want you to tell me what you think. I mean, the guy wasn't exactly the bravest, but you saw how he risked his life to save Doduo from that Magmar... and not to mention how Doduo gave its life to give us that Max Revive and Dire Hit that helped turn around the fight against Heatran... Y'know, we owe them for this as well. It wasn't just you, me, and my other Pokémon. It was Kyle and his Doduo, too. And to that end... I'm thinking Kyle might be a fitting name for you. What say you, Heatmor?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heat...&quot; murmured Heatmor. Then, he nodded. &quot;Mor Heatmor!&quot; he agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then it's settled!&quot; Keith grinned. &quot;C'mon, Kyle, you got a lot of new friends to meet!&quot;</span></span><br />
<br />
(Thanks for the awesome adventure, MZ! I enjoyed every minute of it, and the updates were always worth whatever wait there was. And this Heatmor's in good hands, too! I'll have to think about which island I want to explore next, and when I do, you can bet you'll be seeing another intro post from me here!)<br />
<br />
*Adventure complete!*<br />

<span style="color: silver"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>Brine Island</i></span><br />
<br />
<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> Sometimes a Trainer has to make important choices. Very rarely in the real world are battles simple affairs, one-on-one duels of honor and mutual respect; no, the real world is merciless, dangerous and those who don’t adapt, perish. This is one such case of survival of the fittest – the Vanillite rely on their lord to protect them, and keeping Cryogonal safe is in their best interest. You picked a fight that you now have to finish in vastly different conditions from the ones back when you started – can you adapt?<br />
<br />
Your call is to leave Leo to fend for himself. The pup is both strong and eager, but how wise of a choice is it? Despite the type advantage, the numbers game is far from favorable for a Pokemon of Leo’s stature. Then again, you’re not looking to battle using conventional means, gambling your Growlithe’s safety on a risky appeal. Whether or not it pays off is something you’re about to find out… but can you handle the consequences, and the guilt, if it fails?<br />
<br />
Leo roars at the horde menacingly while trying to piece all of your instructions together; this is a routine he’s simply not accustomed to, nor is this a battle routine you’ve trained extensively. As such, it takes the pup a while to process it all, but the Vanillite aren’t going to sit around waiting: all four of them release a new barrage of <b>Icicle Spear</b>s, dozens of frozen arrows flying through the air and landing all around your partner! Several miss their mark entirely and shatter on the ground, but an equally scary number of them dig into Leo’s flesh and make him squeal in pain from the onslaught. The Fire-Type remains standing, but his left hind leg is in bad shape; still, fighting through the pain, Leo grins as he seems to have finally realized what you’re aiming for!<br />
<br />
The canine causes several golden stars to materialized around him and shoots them upwards; when the shooting stars home in on the hostile group, Leo times a shower of Embers to hit the glowing projectiles, causing them to flare up in a spectacle of orange light! The Draco Meteor-lookalike crashes into the horde, exploding violently and causing two of the living popsicles to immediately melt away; the other two seem severely injured and Leo is swift to pick them off with a lightning-fast dash and upwards slash of his fangs, an improvised <i>Tsubame Gaeshi</i> samurai-like technique that is only slowed down by his aching leg, but effective nonetheless: the remaining foes tumble to the floor unconscious, and just like that, the entire group of low-leveled Vanillite has been conquered! <b>Leo gains 1 Level!</b><br />
<br />
Triumphant but tired, Leo grins while gasping for air. Hoever, the smirk quickly fades when he realizes the Fire Spin has subsided and Cryogonal towers before him, reformed and ominously waving his newly-grown ice chains!<br />
<br />
-	<i>Enough!</i><br />
<br />
That voice… it’s the same one you heard on the phone! The storeroom is too dark to spot the man, but suddenly, a bright glow emerges from behind Cryogonal, seconds before the Pokemon explodes into a million shards upon the impact of a massive <b>Fire Blast</b>! Where the heck did that come from?!<br />
<br />
-	Don’t just stand there, run to the stairs!!<br />
<br />
Shocked and without any real alternatives, you rush to where you had intended to go in the first place, before Cryogonal got in the way. As you make your way over, you find someone standing at the stop of the staircase; when you draw closer you realize it’s an elderly man, though not as old as Oscar: probably in his sixties, practically bald, wearing glasses, a light brown jacket and worn-out grey flannel pants, he carries a Pokeball in one hand and a concerned look on his face. He moves for you to follow him upstairs and you see little choice but to comply, before Cryogonal Recovers again. You climb up and enter another room, and the man closes the door behind him.<br />
<br />
-	That was reckless! What were you thinking?!<br />
<br />
Visibly irritated, he tosses his jacket to the floor and gestures randomly to let loose his frustration. It takes a good while for him to calm down enough to address you properly.<br />
<br />
-	Do you <i>want</i> them to find you? Is that it? Can’t you walk anywhere without making a huge scene? What, do you think those <i>dead</i> ice creams will give you points on the appeal? That’s what’s wrong with you contest lovers of today!<br />
<br />
You don’t quite follow, but his mind changes tracks fast enough that you don’t really have to.<br />
<br />
-	“Voice of unrest”, right? Come on, spill it, tell me what you know. You couldn’t have found me if you didn’t know something – give me the dirt. Did they start rooting out insurgents again?<br />
<br />
He talks like one of those cops from the movies, you find yourself noticing. This man seems to think you know a lot more than you actually do, and to make matters worse, you seem to have gotten off on the wrong foot with him...<br />
<br />
What will you do now?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver">“Groooooooooooooo!” Leo let a howl of a pain, as the Icicles that came barraging down on him, once again were hurdled from the Ice Cream Pokemon...slashing and cutting Liza's Growlithe apart. <i>How much more can he take?</i> She thought to herself...<i>Why didn't I have him dodge if the attacks proved too much for him?</i> She was becoming aware how reckless she has been since this whole thing started, half the time she couldn't even think straight. It felt like she running a race, trying to get to the finish line, except she didn't know where it was or how to even get there...<br />
<br />
Looking up, she knew her Growlithe was suffering...but he pushed through it. With a glint of a sparkle in his eyes and a determined smile, as long as he could feel useful to her, he was happy. That's how all of her Pokemon looked...that's how all of them felt they were saying, sometimes she wondered if they would die for her...and what she did to warrant such love and affection from them. <br />
<br />
The battle raged on, Leo wasn't accustomed to the way appeals worked. But like she thought before, combinations weren't just about making them pretty, they were about creating an even more powerful move.<br />
<br />
Stars began to fly as they honed in on their targets, with Leo lighting them up with an Ember attack, igniting them and causing them to flare, the sparkling Red Meteor inspired by a star show she had watched some night with her Pokemon long ago was about to pay off! <br />
<br />
The attack wiping out two out of the four Ice Type goons, and weakening the last two just enough for Leo to run and pick them off one by one with a lightning fast Aerial Slash!<br />
<br />
(Leo has grown from Lv.<a href="http://www.serebiiforums.com/showthread.php?640137-FB-Calendar&amp;p=17728672#post17728672" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.serebiiforums.com%2Fshowthread.php%3F640137-FB-Calendar%26p%3D17728672%23post17728672&amp;hash=f76771a40bb30ba02b8809163fb08af1" rel="nofollow noopener">8</a> to 9!)<br />
<br />
Leo had done it! Now there was only the matter of their boss and she could get on her wa-<br />
<br />
But when she looked for the Cryogonal they had been fighting, it wasn't trapped in the Fire Spin anymore, it was now towering behind her Leo with a pair of newly formed ice chains ready to finish the job- “Leo!” She gasped with Leo facing sudden death!<br />
<br />
“Enough!” A voice broke off, clearly sounding enraged. <i>Is it the one responsible?</i> she thought but once a Fire Blast came flying by, the intense fire attack passing her by and striking down the Cryogonal she had been trying to fend off, nearly knocking it out in one go, the voice called out to her to follow up the stairs, the same voice from the phone call.<br />
<br />
With no other choice and originally needing to head up there anyways, Liza ran and picked up her pup who looked a tad exhausted, she held him close, “I'm sorry for putting you through that exercise, I'll promise not to be so rough with you in the future. Promise.” Hugging him tight, the pup gave a low but happy bark before licking her face. Returning her Growlithe back inside his Pokeball, thanking him for a well timed performance and putting his ball away in her sweater pocket. She eyed the ice crystal Pokemon one last time before she ran and reached the top of the stairs where she was met with a door to another room. And inside that room she met with the man from the phone.<br />
<br />
Clearly enraged by her spectacle, Liza was at a lost for words as he was basically bashing her for her reckless behavior. “They started attacking me and blocked my path, what was I supposed to do!” She began to say before she remembered what she was really here for, “What do I know? How about you tell me what you know? Like who these people are that make Dana so frightened. Who took her Arcanine away? Who decided that Contests should be outlawed? Are the people that tried warning me to keep my nose out of other people's affairs working for this person? And the man that gave me your number, the man in the brown fedora and coat, who is he? Tell me!!! Because every time I take a step in this city, it seems I'm riddled with more questions then answers! <b>Tell me how this all started and what happened then!</b>”<br />

These islands contain the some of the most diverse typing of Pokemon in the entirety of Fizzy Bubbles. All of these islands are actually volcanoes, but the majority of them have gone dormant. As many Pokemon spend all their lives here, many fossils of Pokemon and plants are buried in the depths of the volcanic ground, maybe some of these may be worth a look? You start out on the island that you first choose, via a ferry. In order to change areas afterward, Surf or Fly is a necessity.</span><br />

<i><span style="color: yellow"><span style="font-size: 12px">Ion Island</span></span></i><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px">Ion Island is made of almost entirely iron ore and magnetic substances that conduct electricity easily. It is said that long ago, a huge battle which pitted two powerful electric Pokemon electrically charged the island, causing most Pokemon that lived here to die. However, electric types thrive here, and recently people have learned how to use the electricity to their own use. <br />
<b><span style="color: yellow">Eletron Plant </span></b>- A large power plant at the center of the island, large metal rods are drilled into the ground, causing the electricity to flow up into and through large thick wires that go along the bottom of the sea the entire way to Brine Island, and power Salin City. Electric Pokemon hang around here, as well as scientists who will often ask for help in finding something.</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: yellow"><span style="font-size: 9px">The ferry had come to a stop, and was now letting off its passengers. And as they disembarked, one among them stood out, identifiable by his trademark cowboy hat- Keith Masters, the 24-year-old Poison-type specialist, was setting foot in the Cascadia archipelago once again, a part of the Fizzytopia region he seemed to come back to again and again. Naturally, he'd spent his fair share of time on Venom Island- his first visit saw him catch a Grimer who was now his Muk, and his second visit saw him exploring the caves with Connor and Marion, two good friends of his. But more recently, Keith had explored Aduro Island. What had started out as a simple sightseeing journey ended with him taking out the god of Mt. Aduro and saving the island's local wild Pokémon from its tyrannical reign of terror, and as if that wasn't enough, he even caught a Heatmor.<br />
<br />
But today, Keith's travels took him to a slightly more... <i>shocking</i> part of the archipelago- Ion Island. This island was known for being electrically charged, being composed of all sorts of substances that conduct electricity with ease. And he had six of his Pokémon with him today- besides Meowth, who was seated on his shoulder as usual, one of them was also outside her Poké Ball. This one, seated on Keith's other, usually unoccupied shoulder, was a small Bug and Poison-type, a pair of stingers on her body- a Weedle, and most assuredly one of the more intelligent of her kind. Though their trip to Whale Island's hydro-electric dam never really took off, Hermione found herself fascinated by Ion Island, and to that end, it was Keith's intention to head out to Ion Island's power plant- the Electron Plant, which harvested the island's electricity and used it to power Salin City on the neighboring Brine Island. Hermione had a keen interest in learning about the island's unique electrical properties, so it seemed like the right place to visit.<br />

&quot;Heh, you ready to go, Hermione?&quot; smiled Keith. The Weedle nodded vigorously, which made Keith chuckle- it was, he ought to have known, a pretty stupid question on his part.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, let's move,&quot; agreed Meowth. &quot;I'm kinda wonderin' wat's da deal wit dis place myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let's get going,&quot; said Keith as he started walking. He too was a bit curious about Ion Island- not to quite the same extent as Hermione, but enough to make him want to satisfy said curiosity.</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>Rayzen</u>:</u></b> The officer looks on while you show him your badges; the more you plead your case, the more obvious it seems you don’t have to try too hard at all – the police are desperate for help, so you probably had them convinced the minute they saw your Claydol. Still, you don’t want to get in trouble with the authorities, and reiterate that you will pull out at the first sign of trouble you can’t handle.<br />
<br />
-	Yes, I can see you’ve been around. To be frank, you’re the best nbet we’ve come across all day; we got some men inside, but we can’t even reach them because communications go all sorts of crazy once you get inside. It’s like something’s jamming the line… Look, see what you can do okay? We got three officers in there we can’t contact, a dead employee for Arceus knows what reason and the entire Power Plant seems to be against us. We don’t expect any miracles, but maybe you can get to the bottom of this.<br />
<br />
The elder cop kneels down next to a military-issue iron suitcase and opens it. He pulls out a red garment of sorts and hands it to you.<br />
<br />
-	Here, it’s the least I can give you for troubles – everyone on the force uses these in hostile environment missions. Hopefully it’ll keep you safe in there…<br />

<b>1x Assault Vest</b>. It seems he’s neither too happy to be here, nor too confident in your success. Either way, you can tell he appreciates your willingness to help.<br />
With permission from the old police officer, the rest of the group let you through, muttering something under their breath. The front gate is wide open, so you boldly walk inside followed closely by Claydol.<br />
<br />
The main lobby is barren, loose wires hanging from the ceiling and not a single light bulb lit. Contrary to what one would expect, the Power Plant is decidedly dark – for some reason, not a single active source of light can be found anywhere, save for the emergency neon signs that provide little lighting to the spacious room. It feels like nobody has been here in decades, but you know that’s not the case. What the hell happened here?...<br />
<br />
There are three doors leading out of the lobby. One on the far wall, as wide open as the front gate was; one on the wall to your right, partially open but not enough for a man to pass through without forcing the rest open; and one on the wall to your left, tightly shut, with a single red button next to it. The longer you stay here the more time you waste in finding out what happened here, so the best thing to do is move on ahead… but which door will you go through?</span> </span>

</blockquote><span style="color: yellow">Upon hearing that something was jamming the line, Rayzen and his pokemon giggled a bit to each other. He remembered that one time that he had pranked his friend. He had used his claydol to distort the frequency bands of the smartphone that was used by his friend nearby. She actually called someone else instead of the intended person and had to rearrange the garden again. &quot;Remember that one?&quot; without even needing to talk, his claydol already knew which instance its trainer was thinking about. Rayzen then took the

assault vest from the elder cop. He wore the red equipment but he was not sure if it was correctly worn as he fumbled through the sleeves. While the others chattered around, he thought that they were gossiping about himself, so he was a little embarassed to ask about the vest, and so he just continued into the Eletron plant.<br />
<br />
It was dark inside the building, but thankfully there was light from neon signs for emergency access purposes. Rayzen saw 3 doors. He decided to go for the partially open door without wasting time. He thought that if anybody needed help, it would be somebody who was trapped inside a room or one who was stuck and couldn't get out. He asked his claydol to use confusion, which was a small psychic move, to budge the door a little before going for more strength. Meanwhile, Rayzen's pokegear flickered several times and made buzzing noises. He tried to read the words but they were nonsensical, &quot;Keith? Who Keith? Keith the poison trainer hunting for missingno?&quot; Soon after, he dismissed it as interference due to the communication signals behaving strangely as advised earlier outside. As his claydol prepared, it tried confusion on the object.</span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Ex-Admiral Insane</u>:</b> <i>((Well, it’s been a really long time hasn’t it? Let’s see if I can remember where I was going with this story without skipping over any details. ^^))</i><br />
<br />
You suggest that human curiosity might trump Man’s hunger for wealth, towhich the Gastly doesn’t respond immediately. It looks at the flame of your lighter longingly, as if overwhelmed by memories of a distant past, and any hopes you might have had of the tiny flame scaring the ghost are quickly crushed.<br />
<br />
-	I wish I could still feel the warmth of that flame... But I digress; my time in your world came and gone a long time ago. I’m with <i>them</i> now, fighting a common enemy… Humanity.<br />
<br />
The Gastly speaks fluently, clearly and without malice despite the contents of his speech.<br />
<br />
-	The humans that came to this Island claim to wish to stop its growth, stating it is detrimental for the neighboring regions. Do you share such a sentiment, Lucas? Or have you found a sudden new interest in matters of ecology once those Coppers lined your pockets?<br />
<br />
So it knew… Then what is this all about after all?<br />
<br />
-	Venom Island is our home. We are many, and will fight to defend it no matter what. It is the will of Arceus to see this Isle grow and prosper until It deems it proper to stop… it is not our place to question the ways of God. Venom Isle will continue to expand naturally, and if Arceus decides that it should consume the rest of Cascadia, then it shall. The humans that took you in seek to stop that process, failing to realize that tampering with it will mean the death of most of us. I am their guardian, their will and this is my plea to you – open the other humans’ eyes… before it’s too late. Before we’re forced to move against them.<br />
<br />
A sudden migraine, more intense than anything you’ve ever felt, makes your eyes water; Gastly’s smoke envelops you ,and the last thing you see is a purple veil before everything fades to black.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
-	Lucas? Lucas, come one, wake up! We got you, come on!<br />
<br />
Your head’s killing you. Everything around you is a blurry mess at first, but when your eyesight adjusts, you find yourself looking up at a familiar face – EPAL member Ria, the girl who recruited you with 3 Relic Coppers and the promise of more to come at the end of a successful mission to prevent Venom Isle’s uncontrolled expansion.<br />
<br />
-	We found you just outside the camp gate, passed out… what the hell happened? Are you alright? Look, we have to head out before night falls – Arceus knows it’s always dark around here even at noon, and we won’t get any recon done at night. If you’re still feeling woozy better get some rest, otherwise we need all the men we can spare in case we get jumped by anything hostile. We need to find out the source of this isle’s continuous growth, but the swamps are pretty much uncharted territory…<br />
<br />
She takes a nearby backpack, straps a single Pokeball to her belt and heads for the group already waiting by the camp’s exit. She turns around briefly, concern clearly visible across her face, and her voice gives away her apprehension.<br />
<br />
-	Lucas… I need to be able to trust you. We’re already in enough danger as it is… you sneaking out in the middle of the night doesn’t exactly fill me with confidence.<br />
<br />
She turns back and prepares to leave; if you mean to follow and join the expedition you better hurry up. Otherwise you can stay at the camp and look around until they return, although people are growing weary of you already, so snooping around might get you in trouble…<br />
<br />
What do you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: darkorchid"><span style="font-size: 9px">The flame from the lighter did little in scaring the gaseous Pokémon. Instead it hovered there, mesmerised by the flame only briefly as it details his longing for warmth.<br />
<br />
“The humans that came to this Island claim to wish to stop its growth, stating it is detrimental for the neighboring regions. Do you share such a sentiment, Lucas? Or have you found a sudden new interest in matters of ecology once those Coppers lined your pockets?”<br />
<br />
Lucas gripped his pocket tightly in shock. He knew he had them with him. The trainer felt like taking a step back as he tried to figure a response. The cigarette in his hand was left burning. Suddenly he didn’t feel like taking a puff. The Gastly didn’t give him much time to answer either way. It continued on, what Lucas would find to be, a rant of sorts. Ecology and livelihood. While the EPAL members were trying to recruit Lucas to their cause of stopping the pollution, the Gastly was doing the exact same thing for the cause of spreading it. Both sides had now clearly stated that their view was in the interest of survival<br />
<br />
<i>’Bah,’</i> Lucas thought to himself. Others can fight over what was right and what was wrong. Adventures and treasure, that was what he wanted. Led by an insatiable curiosity that would always find something new for him. <i>’Still…’</i> There was one thing the Gastly had said that struck a chord. <i>’We?’</i> As far as he remembered he hadn’t seen a single living thing on Venom Island safe for the EPAL members. Who the hell was so desperately in need of more polluted space to thrive in?<br />
<br />
Lucas lifted his cigarette to his mouth before he’d respond. But before he even got a chance to ask questions of his own, the gas surrounds him and clouds his mind and eyes. His vision distorted, tears streaming out to sting him even further while his head hurt from some migraine. The last thing he remembered was dropping his cigarette as he called out to Rags. The words couldn’t escape his mouth and he collapsed, then and there, in the dirt.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
The next thing he saw was a red-haired angel with glasses shouting out to him. <i>’Did I die?’</i><br />
<br />
“Lucas? Lucas, come one, wake up! We got you, come on!”<br />
<br />
His vision returned and he started making out more shapes. A few dead trees in the background and strange shadows hurrying from one place to the next. He recognised the angel. It was Ria. She was rambling on about something. A faint remnant of the migraine left a ring in his ear and couldn’t make out most of what she was saying. The expression on her face said enough. She was less than happy about him. She moved on to grab her backpack. Lucas rubbed his eyes and massaged his temples. The view around him was clearing up. Looking around he saw the campsite. Somehow he had managed to find his way back in his unconscious state. He was too beaten up to question it at this time.<br />
<br />
“Lucas…”<br />
<br />
He looked up at Ria who was readying herself to leave.<br />
<br />
“I need to be able to trust you. We’re already in enough danger as it is… you sneaking out in the middle of the night doesn’t exactly fill me with confidence.”<br />
<br />
He opened his mouth to protest but decided against it. It felt like there was little point.<br />
<br />
Ria turned back to join her expedition group. Lucas jerked his arms to his side, quickly realising something. “RAGS?!” Touching his belt, he found all three of his Pokéballs with him. At least he had his Magnemite and Zubat with him. Rags was out of his Pokéball when he lost him. A quick look showed he wasn’t here with him either.<br />
<br />
Lucas sighed. The expedition group was already leaving but he had something very important to ask Ria. First things first. He pulled a Pokéball from his belt and flipped it up high. Mal the Zubat came out of her shell and was frantically flapping her wings up high already.<br />
<br />
“Mal, go scout ahead for any signs of wild Pokémon. Look for Rags as well.” The Zubat gave a weird jerking motion as a nod and swooped off, almost silently.<br />
<br />
“Ria!” Lucas ran after the group, eager to join them. He was panting by the time he caught up with them “Ria, I need to ask something. Have you seen any wild Pokémon on this island?” His mind went back to the Gastly and the ‘we’ he was talking about. <i>If the Gastly wanted to stop the preservation then he must have tried talking to the EPAL members as well’</i>, he thought. The young trained frowned down on Ria as he waited for her answer. He himself was starting to feel like he couldn’t fully trust them at this point either.</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> The old man looks at you with a raised eyebrow during your tirade. Having been in the dark for so long, only to be demanded answers you never had, has finally sent you over the edge – if anything, you’re the one in need of an explanation!<br />
<br />
When you’re done he lets out an exasperated sigh and falls on the dusty couch at the edge of the small room. You didn’t realize it at first, but you’ve been led to a cubicle with nothing but that old couch, a wooden table with a desktop computer and, of course, a telephone with a small screen display that was no doubt the one he used when you made that call from the Pokemon Center.<br />
<br />
-	You’re telling me you made it all the way here, all the way to me, and you know jack? Does that idiot just randomly hand out my phone number to passersby these days?<br />
<br />
He clears his throat, rests his chin on his hands and, frowning all the way through, vents his frustrations once more.<br />
<br />
-	We’re never gonna make any progress at this damn rate. I mean look at you! You’re a small girl! You couldn’t even keep your mutt from attacking an immobile Cryogonal! Listen gal, you’re in this thing up to your neck now. No matter how much you do or don’t know, the fact that you made it to me means there’s no turning back for you now. So listen up good…<br />
<br />
The old man motions for you to sit on the ground while he stays in the sofa; clearly not too bothered with being a gentleman, he finally lays everything out for you, eyes closed the entire time as if struggling to remember all the details.<br />
<br />
-	I’m sure you noticed by now, but there are no Contests being held anywhere in Cascadia at the moment. Not anywhere in Fizzy Bubbles, I reckon. There’s a reason for that – they weren’t profitable. You know who runs the show as far as Pokemon Battles are concerned, right? It’s the Government. The authorities oversee, regulate and fund all sanctioned Trainer Battle events; they also promote these events to make the investment worth it – more often than not, they make considerable profits out of just about any kind of competition, that’s how hot Battles have become. They also used to host Contests, and that’s where the problem is.<br />
<br />
He looks up at the door cautiously, as if waiting for Cryogonal to invade at any moment. After a while nothing happens, and he resumes.<br />
<br />
-	Let me see if I can get this through to someone your age. Contests use Pokemon, and Pokemon use attacks. That’s the basis of any appeal, as you know. So Contest spectacles have dangers of their own, especially when Coordinators got too creative and messed up – that’s why the competitions had to be held in the same arenas as Battles, because they were specifically designed to keep spectators safe while the action went on. Problem was… Contests didn’t turn a profit; not half as much as Battles anyway. Despite the many followers, it was quickly evident that reserving Arenas for Contests was a bad business decision when Battle tournaments could be organized instead for much more revenue. And naturally, the more arenas were built to accommodate Contests, the sooner those also became Battle-dedicated facilities. It’s simple economics. So when the Government decided to cut Contest budget altogether, some people got… very vocal about it. “Voices of unrest”, they were called by the authorities. Voices they soon found the need to silence.<br />
<br />
He stops briefly to make sure you understand everything he said. His condescendence is palpable.<br />
<br />
-	Contests may not have gathered a lot of people or generated a lot of money, but those who liked Contests really loved them. They held countless protests, invaded and occupied Battle Arenas to hold unsanctioned Contests, Cascadia was a mess back then – I wouldn’t be exaggerating if I told you there was a riot every day. Mostly always the same people, but still. Salin City had it worst, being the capital. So, what was at first a simple statement by the Government became an all-out war between the authorities, who went from cutting Contest funds to prohibiting them entirely, and the activists who fought to keep the sport alive.<br />
<br />
You can tell he lived through all of it. He makes no effort to hide his discomfort while recalling those past events.<br />
<br />
-	Things got real ugly, real fast. Uprisings were met with force from the police, many people were arrested or injured. Eventually, the Government succeeded in rooting out most insurgents and locking them up. It took them about a decade, but Contests were eventually all but forgotten and battles continued to thrive; to this day, they are the most lucrative sport on television – there’s a big tournament going on right now in Salin, maybe you heard of it. But I digress…<br />
<br />
He shifts his gaze from the door back to you, staring firmly as if expecting you to say something.<br />
<br />
-	People can be silenced, but their passions aren’t so easily forgotten. Voices of unrest still exist in Cascadia, waiting to speak up once again. You seem to be one of them, but I advise you to tread lightly. As for dear Dana, yes, she was a prominent figure back in the day, quite possibly the best Coordinator in Fizzy Bubbles. She too was a voice of unrest that went mute with the passing of time, but the Government hasn’t forgotten about her; Arceus knows what would happen to the old woman if they got to her – they still have her Arcanine locked up somewhere in the Presidential Residence. Have you met her personally? Is she safe? Where is she staying? I told you everything I knew, now please, put my own mind to rest.<br />
<br />
He seems exhausted once again, but seems more at ease to talk now than he was on the phone. What else would you like to ask him, if anything?</span></span><br />

<br />
<b><u>Eletron Plant</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>Rayzen</u>:</u></b> You just stepped inside through the only entrance of the Power Plant, and yet you receive signals of a familiar Trainer’s presence. Are the strong electromagnetic waves of the island tampering with your gear that much? You wonder if Keith passed through here recently or a long time ago, and what scenario did he find upon arriving. As for you, your setting feels particularly bleak.<br />
<br />
Your choice falls upon the partially-open door to your right, which requires being forced open in order to pass through. Whether it came from a conscious decision or a random pick, it doesn’t matter – finding a way deeper into the sleeping Power Plant is the only priority. Claydol focuses on the damaged metal, enveloping the heavy door in Psychic energy; then, waving its floating arms, it forces open the broken gate, causing the iron to creak and bend at its will. It takes a while for the low-power Confusion to work, but finally the Ground-Type manages to open a hole big enough for you to pass through. You seize the opportunity and proceed ahead, and Claydol Teleports itself next to you once you enter the other room.<br />
<br />
A pungent smell fills your nostrils and you take a while to identify the scent. When you do, your stomach turns and you instinctively cover your mouth and nose with your hands – the room reeks of burnt flesh. Around the small cubicle, lying on the ground or bent over panels and pipes, are the charred corpses of several Power Plant workers – six of them, to be exact. The policemen outside mentioned a single casualty – which means they don’t have a clue about the true magnitude of the events. Whatever happened here claimed more lives than the officials think, and now that you’ve unveiled a bit more of the gruesome truth, it falls on you to get to the bottom of it all!<br />
<br />
You muster the courage to approach the screens on the wall; Claydol psychically moves one of the dead employees away from the keyboard, but you feel no inclination to type anything – your eyes are locked on the monitors. Most of them are switched off, but three of them flicker occasionally, showing glimpses of other areas of the Plant where surveillance cameras are still recording. The images are too fast to examine in detail due to the faulty connection, but what little you can see perfectly illustrates the severity of the situation:<br />
<br />
The screen on your left reads “CAMERA 02 – WEST WING LEFT CORRIDOR” on the top right corner each time an image pops up; you can barely see a thing, as the hallway is completely dark save for the emergency exit signs across the wall. What little you can make out resembles a large number of bodies littered across the floor, but being little more than black heaps on a dark gray background, you can’t be sure. Whatever it is you’re looking at, it’s making you uncomfortable.<br />
The working screen in the middle flickers just as randomly, displaying “CAMERA 08 – MAIN CORRIDOR”. The scene is equally dark and hard to interpret, but you can see it’s a much wider hallway than the one on the first camera; there is a fluorescent line painted along the floor, possibly marking an emergency escape route, but the overall lighting is so weak you can barely make out anything else – only that the line itself is interrupted frequently by black masses that lie on top of it, unmoving.<br />
One more screen seems to be on, though just barely, and is apparently connected to “CAMERA 17 – EAST WING STORAGE ROOM”. The image on this one is vastly different, and you find yourself staring at it the longest out of sheer disbelief – it intermittently shows a large, lit-up room where, contrary to the previous corridors, everything inside is perfectly visible… every one of the four incinerated bodies that lie on top of wooden crates, and every large splatter of dry blood on the walls, like a twisted decoration on the otherwise completely white cubicle. The sight is both horrifying and intriguing – what on Earth could have caused such a massacre? One thing’s for certain – contrary to what the cops believe, or choose to believe, this is no accident.<br />
<br />
You look around the monitor room and realize there are only two doors: the one you came in through, leading back to the main hall, and a partly open one on the opposite wall leading further east. You reason the working cameras show different parts of the Plant: Camera 02 shows a part of the plant on the west side, probably reachable through the closed door with the red button you didn’t choose earlier; Camera 08 shows the Main Corridor, whatever that is, and logic dictates it probably runs through the center of the plant – perhaps the gate that was wide open on the far wall of the previous hall led that way? And Camera 17 displays the terrifying storage room on the right wing, which might be found if you head deeper in through the door you came in from, considering you turned right to get here.<br />
<br />
With those assumptions in place, and based on the camera’s displays, what will you do? Do you backtrack and choose a different door, or will you keep heading east?</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</u></b> It hasn't been long at all since you last headed to this part of the world and already Cascadia calls out to you again. The memory of your last adventure is still fresh in your mind, your victory over the tyrant Heatran something you won't soon forget - especially with the warrior you found in that journey having joined your team permanently, the brave Heatmor you named Kyle.<br />
<br />
This time however, you've been drawn to a new landscape - not of natural wonder but man-made practicality. The Eletron Plant isn't a pretty sight, but makes the most of Ion Island's unique properties - fueled by the electrically-charged particles both in the atmosphere and the ground itself, the facility is responsible for amplifying and distributing that electrical power to the nearby populations, including the capital of Brine Island, Salin City.<br />
<br />
- Hey man, you with the backup team?<br />
<br />
A young man comes running to you, short of breath but with a friendly smile. He's wearing a red jumpsuit on top of a gray t-shirt and thick black glasses, gloves and black boots, and is covered in dirt and oil.<br />
<br />
- Been waiting on you for a while. Hate to say it, but I can't figure out what the problem is no matter how many cables I check...<br />
<br />
He points to the main gate of the Power Plant; access inside is blocked off by black and yellow tape.<br />
<br />
- If you ask me, the problem isn't in the tubes. It's in there. The wiring outside is perfectly fine and the amplifiers seem to be in order, it's the current that stops flowing altogether from time to time. This is a generator issue if I ever saw one, but the brass don't want us going in without engineering support - things can get real messy if they don't work their nerdy magic on the Plant's software to switch off the facility while I work. Like I said, about time you came!<br />
<br />
He seems excited to finally have a shot at fixing whatever's wrong. His paycheck probably depends on it, you reason. But now you're left wondering on whether to tell him the truth or not: if you play along he can get you inside, but if you explain your real occupation you might not be allowed to enter the Plant under repair...<br />
<br />
What do you do? </span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Ex-Admiral Insane</u>:</b> Ria stares at you in obvious confusion. When she regains her composure, the answer comes as bluntly as one could put it.<br />
<br />
- Yeah, of course we did. Why do you think we need help?<br />
<br />
She places a hand on the single Pokeball in her belt.<br />
<br />
- It's why I brought this one along. This island isn't just expanding, it's hostile. There are things living in the toxic marshes you're about to see for yourself, Pokemon who thrive on waste and death. We don't mean any harm to them, but the feeling isn't mutual - they seem to think we're out to destroy their home, when all we're doing is stopping their home from destroying everything else.<br />
<br />
Ria's hands clench in barely-contained despair.<br />
<br />
- Listen, I don't know why you're bringing this up now, but I'm sure you knew what you were getting yourself into when you agreed to help. Heck, I already paid you something in advance. What are you, scared of wild Pokemon?<br />
<br />
Her tone isn't sarcastic at all but genuinely worried. It seems she's banking heavily on your support, and judging by the group that follow her, perhaps she has good reason to need you - most of the EPAL scouts Ria brings along look more fitting in a lab than the wilds, and only a handful of them are carrying Pokeballs. How does the woman expect to accomplish anything with such a team?<br />
<br />
She doesn't stick around to hear an answer, and rushes to her colleagues. Ria seems intent on doing her job as fast and efficiently as possible, with or without your help. But looking at the crew she's taking with her, you can't help but feel concerned for the girl's well-being, no matter how skilled she might be at fighting...<br />
<br />
Mal returns and lands on your shoulder; she gives no indication of having found a single life form in the camp's vicinity, including Rags... where could he have gone?<br />
<br />
- You coming or not? If something's bothering you that much, we can talk on the way there. Where we're going there are no trustworthy maps, so we'll be braving unknown territory. Everyone, keep your eyes open and do your best to find any potential sources that might be causing the swamps to grow... although I have no idea what those might look like. We have to do this, for Cascadia's sake!<br />
<br />
The team moves out, most looking apprehensive but not Ria. The young woman's face is glowing with determination, even if she has no idea where she's going.<br />
<br />
Haunted by Gastly's words, Rags's disappearance and the possibility of being stranded in uncharted, poisonous territory for the rest of your life, you know you have to do <i>something</i>. Question is... what?</span><br />

<br />
<b><u>Eletron Plant</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</u></b> It hasn't been long at all since you last headed to this part of the world and already Cascadia calls out to you again. The memory of your last adventure is still fresh in your mind, your victory over the tyrant Heatran something you won't soon forget - especially with the warrior you found in that journey having joined your team permanently, the brave Heatmor you named Kyle.<br />
<br />
This time however, you've been drawn to a new landscape - not of natural wonder but man-made practicality. The Eletron Plant isn't a pretty sight, but makes the most of Ion Island's unique properties - fueled by the electrically-charged particles both in the atmosphere and the ground itself, the facility is responsible for amplifying and distributing that electrical power to the nearby populations, including the capital of Brine Island, Salin City.<br />
<br />
- Hey man, you with the backup team?<br />
<br />
A young man comes running to you, short of breath but with a friendly smile. He's wearing a red jumpsuit on top of a gray t-shirt and thick black glasses, gloves and black boots, and is covered in dirt and oil.<br />
<br />
- Been waiting on you for a while. Hate to say it, but I can't figure out what the problem is no matter how many cables I check...<br />
<br />
He points to the main gate of the Power Plant; access inside is blocked off by black and yellow tape.<br />
<br />
- If you ask me, the problem isn't in the tubes. It's in there. The wiring outside is perfectly fine and the amplifiers seem to be in order, it's the current that stops flowing altogether from time to time. This is a generator issue if I ever saw one, but the brass don't want us going in without engineering support - things can get real messy if they don't work their nerdy magic on the Plant's software to switch off the facility while I work. Like I said, about time you came!<br />
<br />
He seems excited to finally have a shot at fixing whatever's wrong. His paycheck probably depends on it, you reason. But now you're left wondering on whether to tell him the truth or not: if you play along he can get you inside, but if you explain your real occupation you might not be allowed to enter the Plant under repair...<br />
<br />
What do you do? </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: yellow"><span style="font-size: 9px">As Keith walked, the Electron Plant came into his view. It wasn't the most aesthetically pleasing sight in the world, but then, it was more about practicality than about its looks. Even if it wasn't exactly a pretty sight, it was still something worth appreciating- something that made use of Ion Island's unique electrical properties. A truly remarkable-<br />
<br />
- Hey man, you with the backup team?<br />
<br />
Keith saw a young man running his way. He was out of breath, but he gave Keith a friendly smile nonetheless. His clothes were also so filthy Keith was a little surprised the guy wasn't attracting wild Grimer. He continued to speak, and Keith realized what was happening- the man seemed to think Keith was some sort of Power Plant employee, sent to help fix a problem the Power Plant was experiencing.<br />
<br />
For a moment, Keith wasn't sure how to respond. Obviously, he was not with this backup team, but this guy was clearly thrilled at the prospect of finally fixing the problem. And Keith knew that maintaining such a charade would allow him access to the Power Plant, but at the same time, he'd seen too many TV shows where people pretending to be things they aren't end up in over their heads in big, major problems they have no idea how to fix. And from the sound of it, the guy he was mistaken for would be depended on to keep the Power Plant deactivated while the others did their work. Meaning that if he fucked up with this task he knew nothing about, lives would be at risk. Yeah, that didn't exactly appeal to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, wait,&quot; Keith finally said. &quot;I'm sorry, but I'm not with the backup team- I'm just a Pokémon Trainer, I came so my Weedle could learn about the Power Plant. Look, I'll be glad to help out any way I can,&quot; he offered. &quot;I'm Keith Masters, by the way. This is Meowth, and this is Hermione, my Weedle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Weedle,&quot; Hermione greeted the man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Meowth added, waving.</span></span><br />

<br />
<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> The old man looks at you with a raised eyebrow during your tirade. Having been in the dark for so long, only to be demanded answers you never had, has finally sent you over the edge – if anything, you’re the one in need of an explanation!<br />
<br />
When you’re done he lets out an exasperated sigh and falls on the dusty couch at the edge of the small room. You didn’t realize it at first, but you’ve been led to a cubicle with nothing but that old couch, a wooden table with a desktop computer and, of course, a telephone with a small screen display that was no doubt the one he used when you made that call from the Pokemon Center.<br />
<br />
-	You’re telling me you made it all the way here, all the way to me, and you know jack? Does that idiot just randomly hand out my phone number to passersby these days?<br />
<br />
He clears his throat, rests his chin on his hands and, frowning all the way through, vents his frustrations once more.<br />
<br />
-	We’re never gonna make any progress at this damn rate. I mean look at you! You’re a small girl! You couldn’t even keep your mutt from attacking an immobile Cryogonal! Listen gal, you’re in this thing up to your neck now. No matter how much you do or don’t know, the fact that you made it to me means there’s no turning back for you now. So listen up good…<br />
<br />
The old man motions for you to sit on the ground while he stays in the sofa; clearly not too bothered with being a gentleman, he finally lays everything out for you, eyes closed the entire time as if struggling to remember all the details.<br />
<br />
-	I’m sure you noticed by now, but there are no Contests being held anywhere in Cascadia at the moment. Not anywhere in Fizzy Bubbles, I reckon. There’s a reason for that – they weren’t profitable. You know who runs the show as far as Pokemon Battles are concerned, right? It’s the Government. The authorities oversee, regulate and fund all sanctioned Trainer Battle events; they also promote these events to make the investment worth it – more often than not, they make considerable profits out of just about any kind of competition, that’s how hot Battles have become. They also used to host Contests, and that’s where the problem is.<br />
<br />
He looks up at the door cautiously, as if waiting for Cryogonal to invade at any moment. After a while nothing happens, and he resumes.<br />
<br />
-	Let me see if I can get this through to someone your age. Contests use Pokemon, and Pokemon use attacks. That’s the basis of any appeal, as you know. So Contest spectacles have dangers of their own, especially when Coordinators got too creative and messed up – that’s why the competitions had to be held in the same arenas as Battles, because they were specifically designed to keep spectators safe while the action went on. Problem was… Contests didn’t turn a profit; not half as much as Battles anyway. Despite the many followers, it was quickly evident that reserving Arenas for Contests was a bad business decision when Battle tournaments could be organized instead for much more revenue. And naturally, the more arenas were built to accommodate Contests, the sooner those also became Battle-dedicated facilities. It’s simple economics. So when the Government decided to cut Contest budget altogether, some people got… very vocal about it. “Voices of unrest”, they were called by the authorities. Voices they soon found the need to silence.<br />
<br />
He stops briefly to make sure you understand everything he said. His condescendence is palpable.<br />
<br />
-	Contests may not have gathered a lot of people or generated a lot of money, but those who liked Contests really loved them. They held countless protests, invaded and occupied Battle Arenas to hold unsanctioned Contests, Cascadia was a mess back then – I wouldn’t be exaggerating if I told you there was a riot every day. Mostly always the same people, but still. Salin City had it worst, being the capital. So, what was at first a simple statement by the Government became an all-out war between the authorities, who went from cutting Contest funds to prohibiting them entirely, and the activists who fought to keep the sport alive.<br />
<br />
You can tell he lived through all of it. He makes no effort to hide his discomfort while recalling those past events.<br />
<br />
-	Things got real ugly, real fast. Uprisings were met with force from the police, many people were arrested or injured. Eventually, the Government succeeded in rooting out most insurgents and locking them up. It took them about a decade, but Contests were eventually all but forgotten and battles continued to thrive; to this day, they are the most lucrative sport on television – there’s a big tournament going on right now in Salin, maybe you heard of it. But I digress…<br />
<br />
He shifts his gaze from the door back to you, staring firmly as if expecting you to say something.<br />
<br />
-	People can be silenced, but their passions aren’t so easily forgotten. Voices of unrest still exist in Cascadia, waiting to speak up once again. You seem to be one of them, but I advise you to tread lightly. As for dear Dana, yes, she was a prominent figure back in the day, quite possibly the best Coordinator in Fizzy Bubbles. She too was a voice of unrest that went mute with the passing of time, but the Government hasn’t forgotten about her; Arceus knows what would happen to the old woman if they got to her – they still have her Arcanine locked up somewhere in the Presidential Residence. Have you met her personally? Is she safe? Where is she staying? I told you everything I knew, now please, put my own mind to rest.<br />
<br />
He seems exhausted once again, but seems more at ease to talk now than he was on the phone. What else would you like to ask him, if anything?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver"><i>If he thinks I'm going to seat down on some dirty, cold, abandon Ice Cream factory floor; he has another thing coming.</i> Liza thought as she gritted her teeth and politely responded with, “I rather stand, thanks.”<br />
<br />
She was here to gather more information. So she could keep moving forward with her promise to save Dana's partner, Arcanine. But any chance she took, came with the grieve consequence that ‘something more’ would turn out to be a trap.<br />
<br />
After hearing what her contact had to say about the events that transpired then, there was some room (very little) in which she could begin to trust him...of course hearing what he had to say, a few inquires came to mind...<br />
<br />
One, he didn't seem all that sympathetic towards contest lovers. The way he spoke to her earlier was also proof of this, ‘That's the problem all you contest lovers have!” As if it was the fault of those that favored contests, that contests turned out the way they did, which was more of a fading memory at this point...<br />
<br />
Two, he also spoke as if he had some personal involvement from back then as well. He didn't mention himself in anything, which Liza found strange. But something about the way he described what happened, it was as if he was there with his very own eyes to document the whole thing...was there a chance he used to be a cop? He sure spoke and acted like one...<br />
<br />
Lastly, could he feel partly responsible? Guilt or regret, felt was ensnared in his words. Unfortunately, she couldn't be too sure on either fronts...<br />
<br />
When the old man asked about Dana, Liza was slightly taken back, she half expected the man to know from his own accord how Dana might've been fairing. Liza quickly responded with, “Wait, you don't know?” Before thinking, <i>Then you really can't be on the governments side. If my theory is correct, the way the men in the black van were able to give me that warning before, was because they were keeping tabs on Dana and Oscar...maybe they heard our whole conversation. And there was a good chance they were hot on my trail now that I've been on the move...is that why he keeps looking at the door?</i> she wondered, <i>Because his waiting for someone to barge in or was he really worried about the Cryogonal that attacked earlier?</i><br />
<br />
Clearing her throat she continued to say, “She's well...or at least...” The Lass looked down gazed at the floor for a second before meeting the man's eyes, “As well as you would expect for a person to be, when the government takes your loyal pet away...keeping them hostage.” She so bluntly said before trying to remind herself that he wasn't the enemy...he didn't deserve all of her rage or snide comments. <br />
<br />
She sighed before saying, “She's alive, and lives with her husband, Oscar. In a run down daycare...she might be better off where she is...but honestly I don't see what more the government could do, the damage has already been done. Her life and Oscar's has been frozen for decades...life goes on but in their hearts there is no tomorrow.” Liza shakes her head while closing her eyes, remembering what it felt like being in their home, “I wanted to cry! Just being there, in their home, I wanted to take them both from there, hold them like if they were my own grandparents and tell them it was all going to be okay...but that's impossible to do.” <br />
<br />
Liza's heart was beating with a rush of emotion again, “I came here to the city thinking, if I could participate in contests I'd show the world how far we- me and my Pokemon have come. When I heard there weren't any, something in me sunk to the bottom. Disappointed, I was approached by an old gentlemen, a little older then you, asking if I could cheer up his wife. Reluctantly I agreed. Met with a bitter old women and I convinced her to allow me to preform for her. I did and she cried...but not because my performance was horrible...but because, it brought back memories of a time she had with her Arcanine...a time she can never have back. When I heard what she went through...I had to do something, I had to help, somehow. Arceus! She wasn't the only one affected by this! Oscar was too and something tells me, so were you! There's probably still people suffering and I just want to make it all okay again! Even if that makes me sound foolish...” <br />
<br />
Ice particles from the fight she had with the deadly snow flake began to fall from Liza's brown wavy hair. “I vowed to myself, if it was the last thing I would do, I'd get Dana her Arcanine back. No men in black vans, wild ice demon creatures or even the government would stop me.” She took a breath, her body not feeling the cold atmosphere around as much anymore...“But, before I can ask for your help...to take me to where her Arcanine is being held. I need to know something, what was your involvement in this whole thing? Why do you know so much? You can't just be someone that lived through it, if you were, then why would <i>your</i> contact give me your number? What role do you play in all of this? And what is it you have to gain?”<br />

<br />
<b><u>Eletron Plant</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>Rayzen</u>:</u></b> You just stepped inside through the only entrance of the Power Plant, and yet you receive signals of a familiar Trainer’s presence. Are the strong electromagnetic waves of the island tampering with your gear that much? You wonder if Keith passed through here recently or a long time ago, and what scenario did he find upon arriving. As for you, your setting feels particularly bleak.<br />
<br />
Your choice falls upon the partially-open door to your right, which requires being forced open in order to pass through. Whether it came from a conscious decision or a random pick, it doesn’t matter – finding a way deeper into the sleeping Power Plant is the only priority. Claydol focuses on the damaged metal, enveloping the heavy door in Psychic energy; then, waving its floating arms, it forces open the broken gate, causing the iron to creak and bend at its will. It takes a while for the low-power Confusion to work, but finally the Ground-Type manages to open a hole big enough for you to pass through. You seize the opportunity and proceed ahead, and Claydol Teleports itself next to you once you enter the other room.<br />
<br />
A pungent smell fills your nostrils and you take a while to identify the scent. When you do, your stomach turns and you instinctively cover your mouth and nose with your hands – the room reeks of burnt flesh. Around the small cubicle, lying on the ground or bent over panels and pipes, are the charred corpses of several Power Plant workers – six of them, to be exact. The policemen outside mentioned a single casualty – which means they don’t have a clue about the true magnitude of the events. Whatever happened here claimed more lives than the officials think, and now that you’ve unveiled a bit more of the gruesome truth, it falls on you to get to the bottom of it all!<br />
<br />
You muster the courage to approach the screens on the wall; Claydol psychically moves one of the dead employees away from the keyboard, but you feel no inclination to type anything – your eyes are locked on the monitors. Most of them are switched off, but three of them flicker occasionally, showing glimpses of other areas of the Plant where surveillance cameras are still recording. The images are too fast to examine in detail due to the faulty connection, but what little you can see perfectly illustrates the severity of the situation:<br />
<br />
The screen on your left reads “CAMERA 02 – WEST WING LEFT CORRIDOR” on the top right corner each time an image pops up; you can barely see a thing, as the hallway is completely dark save for the emergency exit signs across the wall. What little you can make out resembles a large number of bodies littered across the floor, but being little more than black heaps on a dark gray background, you can’t be sure. Whatever it is you’re looking at, it’s making you uncomfortable.<br />
The working screen in the middle flickers just as randomly, displaying “CAMERA 08 – MAIN CORRIDOR”. The scene is equally dark and hard to interpret, but you can see it’s a much wider hallway than the one on the first camera; there is a fluorescent line painted along the floor, possibly marking an emergency escape route, but the overall lighting is so weak you can barely make out anything else – only that the line itself is interrupted frequently by black masses that lie on top of it, unmoving.<br />
One more screen seems to be on, though just barely, and is apparently connected to “CAMERA 17 – EAST WING STORAGE ROOM”. The image on this one is vastly different, and you find yourself staring at it the longest out of sheer disbelief – it intermittently shows a large, lit-up room where, contrary to the previous corridors, everything inside is perfectly visible… every one of the four incinerated bodies that lie on top of wooden crates, and every large splatter of dry blood on the walls, like a twisted decoration on the otherwise completely white cubicle. The sight is both horrifying and intriguing – what on Earth could have caused such a massacre? One thing’s for certain – contrary to what the cops believe, or choose to believe, this is no accident.<br />
<br />
You look around the monitor room and realize there are only two doors: the one you came in through, leading back to the main hall, and a partly open one on the opposite wall leading further east. You reason the working cameras show different parts of the Plant: Camera 02 shows a part of the plant on the west side, probably reachable through the closed door with the red button you didn’t choose earlier; Camera 08 shows the Main Corridor, whatever that is, and logic dictates it probably runs through the center of the plant – perhaps the gate that was wide open on the far wall of the previous hall led that way? And Camera 17 displays the terrifying storage room on the right wing, which might be found if you head deeper in through the door you came in from, considering you turned right to get here.<br />
<br />
With those assumptions in place, and based on the camera’s displays, what will you do? Do you backtrack and choose a different door, or will you keep heading east?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: yellow">While he let himself inside, his claydol teleported next to him into the next room. &quot;Why didn't you teleport me earlier?&quot; he asked his claydol. It blinked at him and wanted to say that it didn't know what was behind the door and that it wouldn't want to drown its trainer into a pool of water. However, Rayzen just assumed that pokemon are more in tune to nature than people are, ie, he thought that the electromagnetic intereference might cause teleportation to glitch them out. Of course his pokemon knew better. Inside the room, he saw 6 dead power plant workers. Then, he observed Camera 02, 08 and 17. Camera 17 showed a new section of the building with a scene akin to a still horror movie, causing the trainer to almost vomit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Smartphone, use psybeam,&quot; Rayzen commanded his claydol to use psybeam towards the monitor that was connected to Camera 17. After a steady colourful beam emerged linking the claydol and the screen, Rayzen tried something interesting, &quot;Smartphone, now use <i>reverse</i> psybeam.&quot; By reversing the directionality of the psybeam, his claydol would be capturing images from the camera and storing them into its own memory with psychic energy. After all, Rayzen trained his claydol to mimic the functionality of a real smartphone. &quot;The officials need to know about this,&quot; Rayzen decided to backtrack to tell the officials outside the power plant. The trainer started to feel the harsher stenches of dead bodies and bile was slowly rising to his throat, &quot;Ugh, we also need an arcanine to burn the corpses.&quot;</span></div>

<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> The older man listens silently while you pour your heart out to him. He nods in understanding every once in a while, but his expression remains the same throughout. When you finish, he ponders on it all for a while, rises to his feet and begins pacing slowly around the room.<br />
<br />
- Me? I stand to gain very little, if at all. I lived through it all, yes, just like Dana and her husband, if not more so. I was there from the very start, enduring it all, long before Dana became involved. I saw the shift in economics, the falling out of Contests and the bloody riots that followed. I watched Contest supporters be labeled criminals...<br />
<br />
He walks up to you and stops inches away from where you stand.<br />
<br />
- ... when I issued the order.<br />
<br />
The door opens and a familiar face walks in - the handsome man in a fedora that gave you the note with this man's number! He greets the elder, who in turn continues to address you.<br />
<br />
- I am Cascadia's Vice President, Layard. I've known for a long time that the old woman in the abandoned Daycare could very well be the legendary Dana, but her husband erased all traces of them both years ago - no official documents, no legal papers of any kind that pointed in their direction! We couldn't very well just barge in and have an elderly couple arrested on frail suspicions. I've had my eye on them for ages, yes, but the law is the law and my hand swere tied. But now you exposed them, and all I lacked was that confirmation! For that I thank you. Dana, and everything she represents, is no longer welcome in this society. She is a dissident like all the others and, by extension, a criminal.<br />
<br />
The younger man by the door says nothing, but his very smile is unsettling. You've been played...<br />
<br />
- However, grateful as I am... you have just admitted to being their accomplice. Don't get me wrong, &quot;liking&quot; Contests is just fine; fighting to bring them back is not. Fighting <i>me</i>. Now, I see you've met my greatest asset - thanks to him, you've basically turned yourself in. You wanted to know who he was, right?<br />
<br />
The young man steps forward, politely takes off his hat and bows. His voice is just as calm and soothing as before.<br />
<br />
- They call me what I am: merely a Whisper.<br />
<br />
The older one chuckles.<br />
<br />
- Rooting out &quot;voices of unrest&quot; has been my task for the past decade. I will not allow some brat to undo everything the Government has worked so hard to keep in check. Cascadia does <i>not</i> need Contests any more than it needs a flood - both are bad for business. Those dark times of violent protest are over and I will never allow Salin City to be overrun with criminals again! You and Dana, both of you are weeds in my perfect garden. You will be taken in for interrogation - a formal declaration of guilt is all we need to lock you and your decrepit friends away. Whisper, if you will...<br />
<br />
- Yes, Vice President.<br />
<br />
You turn around to face Whisper instinctively, fearing an attack of some sort, but just as you shift your attention to the younger man, it's the older one that strikes you in the back of the head with something blunt, so hard that you pass out immediately. You drop to the floor, unconscious, the elder's chuckle the last thing you hear...<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
You finally come to, with no idea how long you've been out. Your head hurts like hell and your eyes have trouble focusing in the beginning. The place is so bright it burns, but when you finally manage to make out your surroundings, you find yourself sitting on a chair in a small cubicle with white walls, a small iron door shut tightly in one of the corners, a large lamp providing intense lighting, a metal table in front of you... and a man.<br />
<br />
- Mornin', precious. Glad you’re awake. Let's get right to it, shall we?<br />
<br />
His face is unfamiliar to you. A man in his forties, raspy voice and dressed in a dark gray suit, places a small recording device in front of you and slams his hands on the table.<br />
<br />
- Liza Marin, you are accused of plotting against the Government to help Contest insurgents. You are also accused of acting as a direct accomplice to one of the Government's most wanted criminals, Dana Ribbonet. Do you deny these charges? </span></span><br />

<b><u>Eletron Plant</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>Rayzen</u>:</u></b> The first thing that pops into your mind is letting the authorities know just how wildly mistaken they are about this disaster's proportions. A handful of policemen is hardly enough to investigate a full-scale massacre at the archipelago's largest power plant. You have Smartphone record all the images of Camera 17, the one that best displays the magnitude of the situation, and hurry back to the entrance of Eletron Plant. As you return to the main hall with the three doors, something feels even more wrong - a strong smell of ash and smoke fills the room and seems to come from the outside...<br />
<br />
The main gate remains wide open and you step back out of the building, but the scene before you is something you didn't expect. Not a single officer can be found in the vicinities! In fact, the only thing noteworthy is a massive patch of pitch-black soil, charred earth all around the Plant's entrance, as if a massive fire or huge bolt of lightning has just struck! The ground is mixed with still-fuming ash, and the silence is deafening - where there once was a huge commotion with policemen running around everywhere, now remains nothing but desolation... What the hell is going on?!<br />
<br />
Something very wrong is happening in the Eletron Plant. You seem to be the only remaining Trainer around to investigate, but do you even want to take such a chance? Who's to say you don't end up exactly like everyone else you saw on the cameras? On the other hand, can you afford to turn back now, with the facility completely unguarded and most of Cascadia depending on its electricity? It's none of your responsibility after all, and you can easily find adventure elsewhere on the Island. Is this worth the risk?<br />
<br />
The choice is now yours; will you return and explore the Power Plant, or leave the premises and head elsewhere? </span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</u></b> The repairman looks at you, confused at first, then downcast and finally glad, all in a matter of seconds.<br />
<br />
- Well, at least you didn't try to put one past me. Thanks for the honesty I guess... I should've known you weren't with the IT department, what with the cool hat and all. Name's Bolt, nice to meet you guys.<br />
<br />
He twirls a wrench in his fingers, lost in thought, then smiles apologetically.<br />
<br />
- Well ain't I in a pickle? I <i>should</i> wait for the tech guys, but if I do there's no way I'll get any work done. Place is shut down for security purposes and the employees were sent home, everything's running on emergency generators... Salin's getting electricity for now but who knows for how long? Imagine the chaos if such a big-ass city went dark all of a sudden... Which is kinda where I am right now, come to think of it - completely in the dark!<br />
<br />
He looks around slyly, to make sure nobody's watching, then grins at you and motions for you to follow him.<br />
<br />
- Cops have the place on lockdown until we can get it fixed, so nobody gets in or out without ID, which you obviously don't have. But I'm pretty sure we won't get to the bottom of this fast enough before the backup generators fry... so I have to get you in! Follow me if you really wanna help, there's a couple of ways inside that not everybody knows about.<br />
<br />
He directs you to an airlock entrance concealed behind some thick foliage on the west wall of the Power Plant.<br />
<br />
- Big enough for a grown man to crawl around; you should have no problems reaching the end. Should lead you somewhere around the West Wing, into one of the storage rooms - unless they changed the architecture up in the last year, which I'm pretty sure they didn't.<br />
<br />
He holds out his hand, revealing a tiny flashlight.<br />
<br />
- If you're sure about helping out, this is the only way. Like I sid, everything's perfectly in order outside, so the problem has to be within, an I'm not allowed to go without engineering support. You're on your own inside the Plant; if you're absolutely sure, take this flashlight with you just to be safe. But hey... I know what I'm asking is illegal and probably unsafe. You don't have to do this man.<br />
<br />
The choice is yours. What will you do? </span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</u></b> The repairman looks at you, confused at first, then downcast and finally glad, all in a matter of seconds.<br />
<br />
- Well, at least you didn't try to put one past me. Thanks for the honesty I guess... I should've known you weren't with the IT department, what with the cool hat and all. Name's Bolt, nice to meet you guys.<br />
<br />
He twirls a wrench in his fingers, lost in thought, then smiles apologetically.<br />
<br />
- Well ain't I in a pickle? I <i>should</i> wait for the tech guys, but if I do there's no way I'll get any work done. Place is shut down for security purposes and the employees were sent home, everything's running on emergency generators... Salin's getting electricity for now but who knows for how long? Imagine the chaos if such a big-ass city went dark all of a sudden... Which is kinda where I am right now, come to think of it - completely in the dark!<br />
<br />
He looks around slyly, to make sure nobody's watching, then grins at you and motions for you to follow him.<br />
<br />
- Cops have the place on lockdown until we can get it fixed, so nobody gets in or out without ID, which you obviously don't have. But I'm pretty sure we won't get to the bottom of this fast enough before the backup generators fry... so I have to get you in! Follow me if you really wanna help, there's a couple of ways inside that not everybody knows about.<br />
<br />
He directs you to an airlock entrance concealed behind some thick foliage on the west wall of the Power Plant.<br />
<br />
- Big enough for a grown man to crawl around; you should have no problems reaching the end. Should lead you somewhere around the West Wing, into one of the storage rooms - unless they changed the architecture up in the last year, which I'm pretty sure they didn't.<br />
<br />
He holds out his hand, revealing a tiny flashlight.<br />
<br />
- If you're sure about helping out, this is the only way. Like I sid, everything's perfectly in order outside, so the problem has to be within, an I'm not allowed to go without engineering support. You're on your own inside the Plant; if you're absolutely sure, take this flashlight with you just to be safe. But hey... I know what I'm asking is illegal and probably unsafe. You don't have to do this man.<br />
<br />
The choice is yours. What will you do? </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: yellow"><span style="font-size: 9px">The man gave Keith a confused look initially, then he looked downcast for a moment. Finally, however, he actually looked glad- he was thankful that Keith didn't try to pull one over on him, and thanked him for his honesty. &quot;Not a problem,&quot; Keith replied. The man then remarked that he should've guessed Keith wasn't with the IT department, on account of &quot;the cool hat&quot;, and introduced himself as Bolt. Keith grinned at the remark about his hat. &quot;Nice to meet you, Bolt,&quot; he replied.<br />
<br />
Bolt continued talking- he knew he ought to wait for the tech guys, but also knew that if he did that, he wouldn't get any work done. The Power Plant was shut down for security purposes, the employees were sent home, Salin City was getting all of its electricity from backup generators, though this was by no means a permanent fix. Keith nodded in agreement as Bolt remarked on the chaos that would ensue if such a big city lost all electricity all of a sudden- he knew what that was like. Not firsthand, but he'd certainly heard about it before. Back when he was around eleven, still living in Lavaridge, he remembered when Mauville City lost power for a week due to the local Gym Leader's attempted renovations backfiring. It was all over the news- the city was in chaos, there was rioting, it was horrible. And from what Keith heard about Salin City, its size would put the likes of Mauville to shame, so if it lost power... Keith shuddered to think what would happen.<br />
<br />
At that moment, however, Bolt looked around slyly, no doubt to make sure nobody was watching, then gave Keith a grin and gestured for him to follow. As they walked, he continued talking- the cops had the Power Plant on lockdown until it was fixed, and that anyone going in or out needed ID, which Keith clearly lacked. That said, Bolt seemed sure that they weren't going to get to the bottom of the problem before the backup generators went, so his idea was to sneak Keith in. Keith listened, mildly interested- of course he was willing to help, so he followed Bolt to an airlock entrance, hidden among thick foliage. He stated that it was big enough for a grown man to crawl around, and that Keith would have no problems reaching the end, and that barring the extremely unlikely circumstance of a major architectural change to the building in the previous year, it should lead him to a storage room in the West Wing. He held out his hand, revealing a small flashlight, and confirmed to Keith what he'd already gathered- if he was sure about helping out, this was the only way to do it. Everything was fine on the outside, so there was no doubt the problem was within. He informed Keith that as he himself wasn't allowed in without engineering support, he'd be on his own in there, and thus he offered him the flashlight to be on the safe side. Keith knew that his Meowth knew Flash, but he also knew that Meowth wasn't going to like having to keep using Flash, especially if a flashlight was being offered instead. Finally, Bolt told Keith that he didn't have to do this, that what he was asking of him was illegal and unsafe.<br />
<br />
In response, Keith accepted the flashlight from Bolt. &quot;I know I don't have to,&quot; he replied. &quot;But I don't want Salin City to lose power, either. I'm from the Hoenn region- I heard all about that one week when Mauville City lost power, it was utter chaos. If there's something I can do to prevent that kind of chaos here, I'm all for it. Besides,&quot; he added, recalling his various adventures- going up against a clan of poisonous ninjas, fighting a Team Rocket grunt in the sewers of Gilded Town to put an end to their black market Moo-Moo Milk operation, going up against the legendary Heatran... &quot;wouldn't be the first time I was in an unsafe situation and came out on top.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He ain't kiddin' about dat, either,&quot; Meowth added. &quot;Count me in, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Weeedle,&quot; Hermione chimed in, nodding in agreement.<br />
<br />
Keith turned to smile at his Pokémon, then looked back at Bolt. &quot;Let's do this,&quot; he said firmly.</span></span><br />

<br />
<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> The older man listens silently while you pour your heart out to him. He nods in understanding every once in a while, but his expression remains the same throughout. When you finish, he ponders on it all for a while, rises to his feet and begins pacing slowly around the room.<br />
<br />
- Me? I stand to gain very little, if at all. I lived through it all, yes, just like Dana and her husband, if not more so. I was there from the very start, enduring it all, long before Dana became involved. I saw the shift in economics, the falling out of Contests and the bloody riots that followed. I watched Contest supporters be labeled criminals...<br />
<br />
He walks up to you and stops inches away from where you stand.<br />
<br />
- ... when I issued the order.<br />
<br />
The door opens and a familiar face walks in - the handsome man in a fedora that gave you the note with this man's number! He greets the elder, who in turn continues to address you.<br />
<br />
- I am Cascadia's Vice President, Layard. I've known for a long time that the old woman in the abandoned Daycare could very well be the legendary Dana, but her husband erased all traces of them both years ago - no official documents, no legal papers of any kind that pointed in their direction! We couldn't very well just barge in and have an elderly couple arrested on frail suspicions. I've had my eye on them for ages, yes, but the law is the law and my hand swere tied. But now you exposed them, and all I lacked was that confirmation! For that I thank you. Dana, and everything she represents, is no longer welcome in this society. She is a dissident like all the others and, by extension, a criminal.<br />
<br />
The younger man by the door says nothing, but his very smile is unsettling. You've been played...<br />
<br />
- However, grateful as I am... you have just admitted to being their accomplice. Don't get me wrong, &quot;liking&quot; Contests is just fine; fighting to bring them back is not. Fighting <i>me</i>. Now, I see you've met my greatest asset - thanks to him, you've basically turned yourself in. You wanted to know who he was, right?<br />
<br />
The young man steps forward, politely takes off his hat and bows. His voice is just as calm and soothing as before.<br />
<br />
- They call me what I am: merely a Whisper.<br />
<br />
The older one chuckles.<br />
<br />
- Rooting out &quot;voices of unrest&quot; has been my task for the past decade. I will not allow some brat to undo everything the Government has worked so hard to keep in check. Cascadia does <i>not</i> need Contests any more than it needs a flood - both are bad for business. Those dark times of violent protest are over and I will never allow Salin City to be overrun with criminals again! You and Dana, both of you are weeds in my perfect garden. You will be taken in for interrogation - a formal declaration of guilt is all we need to lock you and your decrepit friends away. Whisper, if you will...<br />
<br />
- Yes, Vice President.<br />
<br />
You turn around to face Whisper instinctively, fearing an attack of some sort, but just as you shift your attention to the younger man, it's the older one that strikes you in the back of the head with something blunt, so hard that you pass out immediately. You drop to the floor, unconscious, the elder's chuckle the last thing you hear...<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
You finally come to, with no idea how long you've been out. Your head hurts like hell and your eyes have trouble focusing in the beginning. The place is so bright it burns, but when you finally manage to make out your surroundings, you find yourself sitting on a chair in a small cubicle with white walls, a small iron door shut tightly in one of the corners, a large lamp providing intense lighting, a metal table in front of you... and a man.<br />
<br />
- Mornin', precious. Glad you’re awake. Let's get right to it, shall we?<br />
<br />
His face is unfamiliar to you. A man in his forties, raspy voice and dressed in a dark gray suit, places a small recording device in front of you and slams his hands on the table.<br />
<br />
- Liza Marin, you are accused of plotting against the Government to help Contest insurgents. You are also accused of acting as a direct accomplice to one of the Government's most wanted criminals, Dana Ribbonet. Do you deny these charges? </span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver">The realization hit Liza like a ton of bricks. The glass had shattered and the fog had cleared up. She had been blind sided!<br />
<br />
“You're the reason...” She began to say, tightening her fists in a ball, anger raging through her veins, “You're the Arceus-damn reason for all the suffering in this city!” She yelled.<br />
<br />
And when she knew she was cornered, it began to make sense to her...<br />
<br />
She tried keeping them talking, like a classic villain showdown Layard revealed his true motives, she hoped it might buy her enough time to reach for a Pokeball. Digging into her pocket, she held the cool sphere in the palm of her hand, she was about to go on the offensive when Layard told Whisper to take her out and when she had reacted, it wasn't Whisper that had attacked her, it was the Vice President instead.<br />
<br />
<b>Thud</b> her body fell instantly to the floor. The last thing she heard was the old man's creepy laugh...she shouldn't have trusted anyone after all. Now the bad guys had gotten to her, and worst of all they had managed to silence her too...<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center">~*~*~&#8203;</div><br />
Waking up from her groggy state, it took a while for the ringing in her head to subside a little before her eyes could focus again and she could see clearly.<br />
<br />
She looked around her surroundings and took note of the room she was in, she was definitely being held for an interrogation but that's not what scared her, what scared her was that her belongings and Pokemon were no longer with her, <i>...they must've taken them when I was out cold,</i> she thought to herself as her headache didn't seem to want to completely go away, still recovering from the blow to head, remembering the whole exchange that had gone on earlier, <i>Oh no! Dana and Oscar, shit. What have I done? This is all my fault...but, it's not like I ever meant for any of this to happen. I thought I was being careful. I thought I was being smart, and now I realize, it was all too easy.</i> <br />
<br />
Except, with everything Liza knew now, she had to look at everything that had happened much differently. What if the Cryogonal wasn't trying to attack her, what if it was trying to warn her and, if Layard was telling the truth...if he was the one that issued the order to criminalize all Contest supporters, then why keep the Arcanine at the presidential suite? Wouldn't it make more sense to keep it <i>closer</i> to him...<i>that Fire Blast from earlier...it couldn't have been...right?</i> If her head wasn't spinning from before, it was now with all the her questions.<br />
<br />
As the man in front of the lass began his form of interrogation, it became perfectly clear that they needed a clear confession out of her for anything to stick. Why else try to record it.<br />
<br />
What Vice President <s>Snow</s> Layard said earlier ‘A formal declaration of guilt is all we need to lock you and your decrepit friends away.’ <br />
<br />
<i>Who were you to call anyone decrepit, Layard. You're as old as dirt.</i><br />
<br />
Seating up straight in her chair, crossing her right leg over her left. She clasped her hands bringing them to her knees and looked at her interrogator straight in the eyes before responding, “Why yes, whatever are you talking about?” <br />
<br />
<i>Deny, deny, deny...Now, how am I supposed to get out of this?</i><br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> Denial is your best friend until you can find a way out of this cubicle. That, and you’re not going to give these people what they want any time soon! You decide to play dumb for now, testing the interrogator’s patience.<br />
<br />
Turns out he’s a bit short in that regard. A large hand makes contact with your face the second you finish talking, delivering a violent slap that leaves your cheek burning afterwards! A true gentleman, this one.<br />
<br />
-	Playin’ dumb are we, sweetie? The Vice President himself brought you here to the Presidential Residence after your little slip up to keep an eye on you; you already confessed to him, you already lost! Now be a good little criminal and say it again for the recorder!<br />
<br />
So that’s where you are – an interrogation room somewhere in the undoubtedly massive Presidential Residence of Salin City. Layard must want to keep tabs on you until… until he arrests Dana and Oscar using the information you gave him…<br />
<br />
With you lost in thought, reliving the events at the abandoned factory and what your confession might mean to the elderly couple, the interrogator takes your silence as another sign of rebellion and slaps you a second time.<br />
<br />
-	Not gonna talk to me? Fine. We got someone who’s really good at handling the likes of you!<br />
<br />
He makes a call from his cell and minutes later, you hear someone unlocking the door of the interrogation room. Another man in a suit is waiting, and the interrogator hands you over to him.<br />
<br />
-	Take her back to her cell. We’ll leave this one to Red-Hand.<br />
<br />
The other man smiles and they grab you by the arms, forcefully dragging you out of the room and into an elevator. Both men tower over you and struggling to break free is futile. You’re taken to the very bottom floor, “-3”, and arrive at a corridor that would be more fitting in a prison that a government residence. The hallway is poorly lit, murky and the air is heavy with humidity. They open the first rusty door to the right and toss you inside a tiny, empty cubicle that reeks of mold and… other things you don’t care to identify.<br />
<br />
-	You’ll talk, no doubt about it. It’s just we have a group bet going on – whether you’ll break <i>before</i> or <i>after</i> Dana Ribbonet and her husband come to join you! Cheers lass.<br />
<br />
They shut the door behind you, leaving you alone with your pain and thoughts. Soon, the one they call Red-Hand will come to pick you up and… who knows what will happen then. With nothing else to do, you try to peek through the keyhole and scan your surroundings; you can’t see much other than the door directly in front of yours, but it does provide valuable information – there is a label reading “Evidence” on it, giving you a pretty good idea where your possessions might be…<br />
<br />
<i>*THUMP, THUMP*</i><br />
<br />
A couple of sudden knocks on the door makes you leap back instinctively. A hesitant, low-pitched voice speaks from the other side.<br />
<br />
-	H-hey, don’t get any ideas! I… I have orders to keep you in check until Red-Hand gets here. Listen, I really don’t want to be forced to hurt you, okay? Please behave…<br />
<br />
Despite his assigned duties, it seems the guard isn’t too keen on the idea of harming a young girl; at the very least he displays a bit more humanity than everyone else so far…<br />
<br />
Red-Hand, whoever that is, is coming for a “different” kind of interrogation. With what little time you have left, what will you do?</span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</u></b> Your mind is made up – you’re going to help Bolt from the inside. After all, considering everything you’ve had to handle so far, how bad can a trip inside Eletron Plant be in comparison?...<br />
<br />
Bolt pulls the airlock lid and motions for you to get going. You drop to your knees and crawl inside the duct, finding ample space to maneuver within, although not enough to actually stand. The path is straightforward, through what feels like a mile of iron pipes; the air is cold and humid, and the way it runs through the air duct creates a whistling sound that breaks the otherwise silent monotony of your surroundings.<br />
After a long while of dragging yourself along on your hands and knees, you see a beam of light emerge further ahead; you hasten your pace and finally reach the end of the ventilation duct; with the help of Meowth and Hermione, you force open the metal door at the end and drop down to the floor below. You find yourself dropping straight into an empty room, a relatively small cubicle with a heap of machinery stored away in a corner. The gear looks mostly rusty and partly eroded, and you reason this must be a storage room of sorts for obsolete parts.<br />
<br />
There is a single metal door leading out of the room, and a green button right next to it to open it, no doubt. You walk over to it and press the button to begin exploring the Plant… but the door won’t budge! Is the circuit faulty? How are you going to get out of here now?... A couple more button presses yield the same result, and you’re at a loss. Should you ask your Pokemon to try and force such a heavy-looking door open with their attacks?<br />
<br />
As you ponder on your limited options, a small Rattata leaps out of the rubble and heads for the door as well, clawing and gnawing fruitlessly at the obstacle before him in an attempt to escape the room, having found nothing edible in the leftover metal scarps. Suddenly, a lamp overhead flickers for a moment; immediately afterwards you hear a click, and the door starts to slide effortlessly to the side. Somebody’s coming in! However, before you can manage a glimpse of who that might be, the lights go out completely, filling the room in pitch-black darkness. A shriek is heard, then absolute silence, and after a couple of seconds the power comes back on, before you can even remember to turn on your flash light…<br />
<br />
The door remains wide open, but there’s nobody in sight. Rattata itself is nowhere to be found, but a small trail of blood leading out the room leaves a pretty good idea of what might have happened to the rodent. Fortunately (or strangely), whatever targeted the Normal-Type didn’t seem interested in you… for now, at least!<br />
<br />
You can now explore the Plant freely, but you have no idea where to go next; if only you had a map of the place, or even blueprints of some sort… You remember Bolt saying you should be somewhere in the West Wing of the Plant, but that’s all you have to go on.<br />
<br />
So… any plans?</span></span><br />

<b><u>Eletron Plant</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</u></b> Your mind is made up – you’re going to help Bolt from the inside. After all, considering everything you’ve had to handle so far, how bad can a trip inside Eletron Plant be in comparison?...<br />
<br />
Bolt pulls the airlock lid and motions for you to get going. You drop to your knees and crawl inside the duct, finding ample space to maneuver within, although not enough to actually stand. The path is straightforward, through what feels like a mile of iron pipes; the air is cold and humid, and the way it runs through the air duct creates a whistling sound that breaks the otherwise silent monotony of your surroundings.<br />
After a long while of dragging yourself along on your hands and knees, you see a beam of light emerge further ahead; you hasten your pace and finally reach the end of the ventilation duct; with the help of Meowth and Hermione, you force open the metal door at the end and drop down to the floor below. You find yourself dropping straight into an empty room, a relatively small cubicle with a heap of machinery stored away in a corner. The gear looks mostly rusty and partly eroded, and you reason this must be a storage room of sorts for obsolete parts.<br />
<br />
There is a single metal door leading out of the room, and a green button right next to it to open it, no doubt. You walk over to it and press the button to begin exploring the Plant… but the door won’t budge! Is the circuit faulty? How are you going to get out of here now?... A couple more button presses yield the same result, and you’re at a loss. Should you ask your Pokemon to try and force such a heavy-looking door open with their attacks?<br />
<br />
As you ponder on your limited options, a small Rattata leaps out of the rubble and heads for the door as well, clawing and gnawing fruitlessly at the obstacle before him in an attempt to escape the room, having found nothing edible in the leftover metal scarps. Suddenly, a lamp overhead flickers for a moment; immediately afterwards you hear a click, and the door starts to slide effortlessly to the side. Somebody’s coming in! However, before you can manage a glimpse of who that might be, the lights go out completely, filling the room in pitch-black darkness. A shriek is heard, then absolute silence, and after a couple of seconds the power comes back on, before you can even remember to turn on your flash light…<br />
<br />
The door remains wide open, but there’s nobody in sight. Rattata itself is nowhere to be found, but a small trail of blood leading out the room leaves a pretty good idea of what might have happened to the rodent. Fortunately (or strangely), whatever targeted the Normal-Type didn’t seem interested in you… for now, at least!<br />
<br />
You can now explore the Plant freely, but you have no idea where to go next; if only you had a map of the place, or even blueprints of some sort… You remember Bolt saying you should be somewhere in the West Wing of the Plant, but that’s all you have to go on.<br />
<br />
So… any plans?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: yellow"><span style="font-size: 9px">With Keith's mind made up, Bolt opened up the airlock lid and motioned for him to get going. Keith nodded, then got down on his hands and knees and crawled in. It was roomier than he had pictured it- he had plenty of room to maneuver, though not enough to actually stand up. Moreover, the path was a straightforward one, though very, very long. Keith was crawling through the iron pipes for he didn't even know how long, a whistling sound from the air running through the duct being the only thing to break the monotony.<br />
<br />
At long last, Keith could see a light up ahead. He quickened his pace, and finally reached the end of the duct. There was a metal door at the end, but Hermione and Meowth helped to force it open with no trouble.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh,&quot; Keith sighed as he landed on the floor. He straightened up and looked around. &quot;Huh,&quot; he murmured- the room was more or less empty, save for a pile of rusted machinery stowed away in one of the corners. &quot;Wonder what this is for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Weedle, Weedle Weedle,&quot; Hermione observed, also eyeing the pile of scrap metal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hermione's sayin' dis must be a storage room fer obsolete parts,&quot; Meowth translated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Makes sense,&quot; agreed Keith. &quot;Though why they don't just throw them out I can't imagine...&quot;<br />
<br />
As he pondered this point, Keith saw the metal door, clearly the only way out of the room. Next to the door, a green button. Doesn't exactly take a genius to work out what the button's for, Keith figured, though as he pressed the button, he started to reconsider that point of view- the button had just as much effect as a Magikarp's Splash. &quot;What the-&quot; Keith murmured. He pressed the button a few more times, but as he had feared, this did him just as much good as the first time he pressed it. &quot;Arceus damn it!&quot; he grunted. &quot;Looks like we'll have to force the door open,&quot; he decided.<br />
<br />
&quot;And just how does youse propose ta do dat?&quot; Meowth demanded. &quot;Call me crazy, but I don't tink my Fury Swipes are gonna cut it here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Weedle...&quot; Hermione murmured, looking at the door intently. Though it was rather tough to read a Weedle's face, Keith and Meowth could nevertheless see that she was trying to come up with a plan. Keith looked at the Weedle on his shoulder- he figured that if there were any good ways to break through the door, Hermione would be the first to come up with it.<br />
<br />
And then, suddenly, that stopped being an issue. A Rattata had emerged from the pile of rubble and was trying to gnaw his way through the door, when suddenly a lamp overhead flickered on and off for a few seconds... followed by a click, which was then followed by the door sliding open! But before Keith could see who or what was coming in, the lights went out completely. He could feel Meowth tightening his grip on Keith's shoulder, and from the movement he could feel on his other shoulder, his Weedle had been rather startled as well. A loud shriek was heard, and then nothing. And then, just as Keith remembered the flashlight he'd been given, the lights came back on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh...&quot; Meowth groaned, looking down at the floor. Keith had been looking at the door, which was still open, but now he followed Meowth's gaze, and saw what he meant- the Rattata was gone, and in its place, there was a trail of blood leading out of the room. The implication was clear- whoever or whatever had opened the door and turned off the power, must also have issued that bone-chilling shriek and ate that Rattata. Of course, the idea of a Rattata having been eaten didn't faze Keith all that much- he owned a handful of carnivorous Pokémon, most prominently among them a Seviper, many of whom had quite a taste for Rattata. This was even in spite of the fact that he himself had once owned a Rattata for a brief period of time. No, what was bothering Keith about this was that there was something loose in the Electron Plant that, at the very least, could somehow screw with electricity and feasted on, at the bare minimum, Rattata.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Keith murmured. &quot;That's not good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya tink?!&quot; Meowth whimpered. &quot;Wat if dat ting decides we're da next course?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a chance we'll have to take,&quot; Keith stated. &quot;Besides, if we get into trouble, I do have other Pokémon that can help us out,&quot; he reminded the Normal-type. &quot;OK, so, we gotta come up with a plan. We got nothing to go on, other than the fact that we're in the West Wing of the Electron Plant, and there is something in here that can mess with the electricity and preys on, at the very least, Rattata.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Weedle Weedle,&quot; Hermione spoke up. &quot;Weedle Weedle Weedle, Weedle Weedle, Weedle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hermione tinks dat dat ting, watever it is, might be da source o' da Power Plant's problems,&quot; Meowth translated. &quot;If it's wat made da power shut off like dat, it could be interferin' wit other parts o' dis place, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, that's possible,&quot; Keith agreed. &quot;I'm not sure how possible, but right now, that's pretty much all we got to go on, so I'll take it. We'll follow the trail of blood, try and find that creature. And this time,&quot; Keith added, looking down at the flashlight in his hand, &quot;we'll be ready if the power cuts out again. Hermione,&quot; he added, turning to the Weedle on his shoulder. &quot;Try and get the scent from that trail of blood- if we're lucky, you might be able to get that thing's scent in addition to the Rattata's scent. That way, if the trail of blood ends, you can sniff the creature out, tell us which way to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Weedle,&quot; Hermione nodded, crawling down to Keith's arm as Keith lowered said arm towards the ground. Once Hermione was in his hand, that hand was just above the trail of blood, allowing her to sniff at the blood with her huge red nose. Keith smiled- he knew for a fact that a Weedle's large nose wasn't just for decoration, but that it in fact gave the species an extremely acute sense of smell. He had complete confidence that Hermione's sense of smell wouldn't fail them.</span></span><br />

<br />
<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> Denial is your best friend until you can find a way out of this cubicle. That, and you’re not going to give these people what they want any time soon! You decide to play dumb for now, testing the interrogator’s patience.<br />
<br />
Turns out he’s a bit short in that regard. A large hand makes contact with your face the second you finish talking, delivering a violent slap that leaves your cheek burning afterwards! A true gentleman, this one.<br />
<br />
-	Playin’ dumb are we, sweetie? The Vice President himself brought you here to the Presidential Residence after your little slip up to keep an eye on you; you already confessed to him, you already lost! Now be a good little criminal and say it again for the recorder!<br />
<br />
So that’s where you are – an interrogation room somewhere in the undoubtedly massive Presidential Residence of Salin City. Layard must want to keep tabs on you until… until he arrests Dana and Oscar using the information you gave him…<br />
<br />
With you lost in thought, reliving the events at the abandoned factory and what your confession might mean to the elderly couple, the interrogator takes your silence as another sign of rebellion and slaps you a second time.<br />
<br />
-	Not gonna talk to me? Fine. We got someone who’s really good at handling the likes of you!<br />
<br />
He makes a call from his cell and minutes later, you hear someone unlocking the door of the interrogation room. Another man in a suit is waiting, and the interrogator hands you over to him.<br />
<br />
-	Take her back to her cell. We’ll leave this one to Red-Hand.<br />
<br />
The other man smiles and they grab you by the arms, forcefully dragging you out of the room and into an elevator. Both men tower over you and struggling to break free is futile. You’re taken to the very bottom floor, “-3”, and arrive at a corridor that would be more fitting in a prison that a government residence. The hallway is poorly lit, murky and the air is heavy with humidity. They open the first rusty door to the right and toss you inside a tiny, empty cubicle that reeks of mold and… other things you don’t care to identify.<br />
<br />
-	You’ll talk, no doubt about it. It’s just we have a group bet going on – whether you’ll break <i>before</i> or <i>after</i> Dana Ribbonet and her husband come to join you! Cheers lass.<br />
<br />
They shut the door behind you, leaving you alone with your pain and thoughts. Soon, the one they call Red-Hand will come to pick you up and… who knows what will happen then. With nothing else to do, you try to peek through the keyhole and scan your surroundings; you can’t see much other than the door directly in front of yours, but it does provide valuable information – there is a label reading “Evidence” on it, giving you a pretty good idea where your possessions might be…<br />
<br />
<i>*THUMP, THUMP*</i><br />
<br />
A couple of sudden knocks on the door makes you leap back instinctively. A hesitant, low-pitched voice speaks from the other side.<br />
<br />
-	H-hey, don’t get any ideas! I… I have orders to keep you in check until Red-Hand gets here. Listen, I really don’t want to be forced to hurt you, okay? Please behave…<br />
<br />
Despite his assigned duties, it seems the guard isn’t too keen on the idea of harming a young girl; at the very least he displays a bit more humanity than everyone else so far…<br />
<br />
Red-Hand, whoever that is, is coming for a “different” kind of interrogation. With what little time you have left, what will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver"><i>I mustn't cry.</i> Liza thought as the first smack left her face feeling hot and her eyes a little teary, <i>I won't. I absolutely won't give them the satisfaction to see me cry.</i> She bit her lip and clenched her fists as the interrogation began.<br />
<br />
Listening carefully she noticed a few key words in the interrogator's sentence. ‘The Presidential Residence’ <i>So, that's where I am! That makes perfect sense, I mean, I didn't think that I was being held in a Police Station. That's for damn sure.</i> Everything hadn't exactly gone her way but she was where she wanted to be, and that's what was important. <i>Now to get my Pokemon and give these guys the slip, so I can search for Dana's Arcanine...</i><br />
<br />
The second slap disrupted her thought process, as she clenched her fists a second time, resisting the urge to fight back. They were trying to mentally break her with brute force. She wasn't one to give in so easily. Liza simply smiled back at her interrogator as she thought of ways she was going to pay back all these lowlifes. <br />
<br />
When the interrogator figured that it was pointless to go on, he handed her to another man that would take her back to her cell. Going by their size, it was pointless to fight back opting to conserve her strength for later...<br />
<br />
Escorting her to an elevator where they took her to a lower level ‘-3’ she wondered exactly how many floors the place had and was curious to know how many people knew of the interrogation room and basement prison cell they were taking her to. <i>When I make it out of this, I'm doing a full interview with someone from the press and informing the world of this!</i><br />
<br />
Arriving at her cell, with little light, lot of humidity and smells she didn't want to know the origins of. She was thrown and locked in as the two gentlemen that brought her left on their merry way.<br />
<br />
Only with her thoughts to companion her, after what one of the men told her about their sick bet. <br />
<br />
Liza was worried if they were telling the truth. If they were going to get Dana and Oscar, they didn't have solid proof yet <i>but I guess, when you're the Vice President you can do that sort of thing underneath enough suspicion.</i> If they were bringing them here, to this terrible place...remembering how fragile Dana looked crying, the interrogators wouldn't have a difficult time trying to break her or her husband and...Liza definitely didn't want to wait around to find out who this Red Hand was everyone was talking about.<br />
<br />
The Lass wished she had a bobby pin, as Ethan had taught her how to pick a lock. But she didn't have anything of the sort to even attempt it.<br />
<br />
Her main concern was getting out, finding her Pokemon and freeing the Arcanine. If she could exact her revenge for everything- well she wouldn't be opposed to it. On the second hand, was an eye for an eye the right thing to do? Underneath the circumstances.<br />
<br />
Peering through the peep hole she was only able to see another door adjacent to hers, <i>Wait...could that be?</i> she blinked and focused her eyes to be sure that the door across from hers was marked ‘evidence’ on it. <i>They have to be there!</i> she thought, <i>My Pokem-!</i> a couple knocks on her cell soon startled her and she quickly scrabbled back a few paces.<br />
<br />
<i>Someone came to keep tabs on me? They're probably afraid I'd figure a way out...</i> she thought but...he didn't exactly seem like the rest she had the ‘pleasure’ of meeting. He sounded worried, scared even...but was he scared of her or scared of what he might do to her? Either way, she had to give it a shot, she needed to get out and fast!<br />
<br />
*Cough**Cough* “Thank heavens someone's here...” *Cough**Cough* “I thought I was going to die here,” *Cough* “Please! I need my medication- the heat in here and the dry air makes it so difficult to breath...” *Cough* “I have high blood pressure, and I feel incredibly faint in small in-closed spaces, no one else wanted to listen to me...” *Cough* “You-u,” she began to stutter, “You can't let me die here...” She said a little weaker, *Cough**Cough* “Be the hero! Or else Layard won't get what he wants from me...” *Cough**Cough* she made a thud sound as she hid behind the door getting ready for a surprise attack.<br />
<br />
Always with the dramatics, well she had one shot. If he fell for the sick act, to open her door or at least give her her stuff, she's lunged at him and grab his keys before locking him in and closing the door behind her. All she could do now was hope her plan would work.<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> Your theatrics better pay off. After all, gentler as he may sound, this man is still a Government official and probably has direct orders to keep you on your &quot;best behavior&quot;...<br />
<br />
You plead with whoever is on the other side to help you with your terrible illness, trying your very best to sound convincing while carefully positioning yourself to strike. The scent of the cell is nauseating, and the longer you stand still, keeping your breathing as shallow as possible toavoid detection, the harder it is to ignore the pungent odor of filth that engulfs the cubicle - no surprise seeing as there isn't so much as a hole in the ground for prisoners to... nevermind, that's ot important. You try your hardest to keep focused, clinging tightly to the cell wall. Now to see if the fish takes your bait...<br />
<br />
It takes a bit for anything to happen, but you finally hear the guard sight and mutter to himself, followed by the unmistakable sound of keys rustling together...<br />
<br />
- Damn... fine, hang in there! You've been through enough already, what they're doing to you is bad enough as it is! You ain't dying on my watch!<br />
<br />
His concern is obvious and makes you ponder on your next action. It seems this one really isn't like everyone else and is actually against the way you're being treated. You hold still as the heavy iron door begins to open, shrieking loudly due the rusty hinges. A tall, slightly chubby man with a stubble and glasses walks in, flashlight in hand, to check on you. He looks around puzzled for a while, not finding anyone when he expected to find a child on her knees, close to unconsciousness. A large ring filled with keys dangles from his back pocket, the man having no doubt forgotten to strap it back to the belt in his hurry to help you out.<br />
<br />
He's right where you want him, ripe for the picking, but you only have a fraction of second to act. Quick, what do you do now? </span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</u></b> That trail of blood is the only thing you have to go on. The Plant itself is huge, and all you know is you're on the west side of it - everything else remains a complete mystery to you. However, by following the crimson stains, you might be able to track down whoever was responsible for the attack, and maybe then you can make sense of it all!<br />
<br />
Hermione has no trouble picking up the intense scent of Rattata's fresh blood. She scurries along the floor excitedly, happy to prove useful, and you and Meowth follow suite. You exit the storage room and turn right, winding up in a wide and tall corridor with thick black cables running across it; definitely not a building erected to look pretty. You can only imagine how depressing it must be towork inside this place every day of one's life... You take a mental note of how most lights are still on, but several of them flicker repeatedly as if about to give out. But at least for now, the flashlight isn't necessary.<br />
<br />
Hermione keeps going despite the visible trail of blood being long gone. She finally stops in front of another metal door at the edge of the corridor you just crossed, and it doesn't take much to realize she's on the right track - on the floor just to your left is a severed purple tail... Rattata's tail no doubt. You wak over the door, wary that it might not open at all, but it seems this one is triggered by motion sensors that are still active - your mere approach triggers the device and the iron door slides open. What lies beyond is a complete mystery, as everything past this point is pitch-black. Still, it's all you have to go on, so walking inside seems to be the only option.<br />
<br />
You step inside carefully, and the door shuts right behind you. The second it does, two pairs of white eyes glimmer in the otherwise complete blackness of the room, and you suddenly feel a sharp pain on your right shoulder, as if a blade just ran through it! It's too dark to see if you're bleeding, but the humid warmth that covers the fabric of your clothes gives you a pretty good indication. Meowth yelps in pain almost at the same time, indicating he too is under attack!<br />
<br />
What's going on? Quick, what do you do?</span></span><br />

The Plant itself is huge, and all you know is you're on the west side of it - everything else remains a complete mystery to you. However, by following the crimson stains, you might be able to track down whoever was responsible for the attack, and maybe then you can make sense of it all!<br />
<br />
Hermione has no trouble picking up the intense scent of Rattata's fresh blood. She scurries along the floor excitedly, happy to prove useful, and you and Meowth follow suite. You exit the storage room and turn right, winding up in a wide and tall corridor with thick black cables running across it; definitely not a building erected to look pretty. You can only imagine how depressing it must be towork inside this place every day of one's life... You take a mental note of how most lights are still on, but several of them flicker repeatedly as if about to give out. But at least for now, the flashlight isn't necessary.<br />
<br />
Hermione keeps going despite the visible trail of blood being long gone. She finally stops in front of another metal door at the edge of the corridor you just crossed, and it doesn't take much to realize she's on the right track - on the floor just to your left is a severed purple tail... Rattata's tail no doubt. You wak over the door, wary that it might not open at all, but it seems this one is triggered by motion sensors that are still active - your mere approach triggers the device and the iron door slides open. What lies beyond is a complete mystery, as everything past this point is pitch-black. Still, it's all you have to go on, so walking inside seems to be the only option.<br />
<br />
You step inside carefully, and the door shuts right behind you. The second it does, two pairs of white eyes glimmer in the otherwise complete blackness of the room, and you suddenly feel a sharp pain on your right shoulder, as if a blade just ran through it! It's too dark to see if you're bleeding, but the humid warmth that covers the fabric of your clothes gives you a pretty good indication. Meowth yelps in pain almost at the same time, indicating he too is under attack!<br />
<br />
What's going on? Quick, what do you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: yellow"><span style="font-size: 9px">As Keith had expected, Hermione had no trouble whatsoever picking up the scent. She hopped out of Keith's hand and scurried along the floor, leading them with confidence even long after the trail of blood had handed. Keith couldn't help but smile- many people who came to own Weedle, he found, tended to not really know about the species's remarkable sense of smell. They'd always be more focused on leveling them up as quickly as possible, hoping to evolve them into Beedrill. Indeed, this was what he himself did with Melittin, but in that case, it had been because Melittin himself had insisted upon it, wanting to evolve as quickly as possible. Hermione, on the other hand, had made it known to Keith not long after she came into his ownership that she had no desire ever to evolve. It was- and still is- her belief that Weedle are perfectly viable Pokémon in their own right, and the training she and Keith would so often do was her ongoing attempt to prove her hypothesis to be true. And thus far, she was doing one hell of a job of it- Keith recalled using Hermione in battle against a Starly owned by a friend of his. Hermione had lost, but it was agreed all around that she had put up one hell of a fight. Even the referee had mentioned that the battle was a lot closer than one might think it to be.<br />
<br />
Keith's smile, however, faded as he saw his dismal surroundings- the building was obviously built more for practicality than to be aesthetically pleasing. He started feeling sorry for Bolt, and for all the other people who worked in this place every day- this was, by far, a downright depressing place to have to work in. At least, he reminded himself, the lights were holding up. Indeed, a few of the lights started to flicker on occasion, but that was the worst of it- the flashlight was proving unnecessary thus far.<br />
<br />
At last, Hermione came to a stop before another metal door. And as if Keith needed any further proof that they were on the right track, there lay a morbid yet familiar sight on the floor to their left- a severed Rattata tail. Again, not such a troubling sight for Keith, considering some of the Pokémon he's raised, but he couldn't help but wonder what exactly did leave behind that Rattata tail... And then, as Keith approached the door, it slid open.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; Meowth remarked. &quot;Dis one must work wit some kinda motion sensor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty cool,&quot; Keith nodded. Cautiously, Keith and Hermione made their way into the room, Meowth still on Keith's shoulder. And then the door slammed shut behind them. Meowth jumped a little bit, but said nothing. The room was pitch-black, plunged completely in darkness, and Keith remembered the flashlight- but before he could use it, there came a minor distraction in the form of a sharp pain on his right shoulder! &quot;GAH!&quot; Keith exclaimed, clutching at the area where he'd been struck with his left hand, trying hard to not think about the warm liquid he could feel in that area, staining his clothes. And then, Meowth cried out in pain as well. &quot;Meowth!&quot; Keith exclaimed. &quot;Alright, that's it,&quot; he declared, brandishing his flashlight in the direction where he'd seen two pairs of white eyes just before being attacked, his thumb going for the switch. &quot;Time to shed a little light on this mystery!&quot; he stated.<br />
<br />
Even in the dark, even while under attack, Keith knew that Meowth must have rolled his eyes at that bad pun.</span></span><br />

<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> Your theatrics better pay off. After all, gentler as he may sound, this man is still a Government official and probably has direct orders to keep you on your &quot;best behavior&quot;...<br />
<br />
You plead with whoever is on the other side to help you with your terrible illness, trying your very best to sound convincing while carefully positioning yourself to strike. The scent of the cell is nauseating, and the longer you stand still, keeping your breathing as shallow as possible toavoid detection, the harder it is to ignore the pungent odor of filth that engulfs the cubicle - no surprise seeing as there isn't so much as a hole in the ground for prisoners to... nevermind, that's ot important. You try your hardest to keep focused, clinging tightly to the cell wall. Now to see if the fish takes your bait...<br />
<br />
It takes a bit for anything to happen, but you finally hear the guard sight and mutter to himself, followed by the unmistakable sound of keys rustling together...<br />
<br />
- Damn... fine, hang in there! You've been through enough already, what they're doing to you is bad enough as it is! You ain't dying on my watch!<br />
<br />
His concern is obvious and makes you ponder on your next action. It seems this one really isn't like everyone else and is actually against the way you're being treated. You hold still as the heavy iron door begins to open, shrieking loudly due the rusty hinges. A tall, slightly chubby man with a stubble and glasses walks in, flashlight in hand, to check on you. He looks around puzzled for a while, not finding anyone when he expected to find a child on her knees, close to unconsciousness. A large ring filled with keys dangles from his back pocket, the man having no doubt forgotten to strap it back to the belt in his hurry to help you out.<br />
<br />
He's right where you want him, ripe for the picking, but you only have a fraction of second to act. Quick, what do you do now?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver"><i>Empty your mind of all thought...</i> she tried telling herself, keeping a low steady breath, nauseous fumes unavoidable making her feel like she had been there for longer then she really had been. She couldn't wait to take a shower once this was all through but quickly reminded herself of the task at hand, <i>...void your mind of all thought...let the actions happen naturally...or it won't work.</i> She started to mentally prepare herself for was about to happen next...<br />
<br />
Liza wouldn't lie if this wasn't important and being in the enemy's lair, she didn't know who she could trust, if anyone at all. She'd already been burned trusting the wrong people. And even though the guard seemed to be sympathetic towards her and her situation, she couldn't take a chance now that her cell door was finally being opened. If he really cared, despite the job he had to keep her in check, if he really cared then he would have let her go on his own...she wouldn't have to put up a charade to convince him to open her door, no. She couldn't go weak now and trust someone...she needed to depend on herself and only herself from here on out. <i>Whatever happens now, I'd do it with my own strength, alongside with my Pokemon's.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Quick like a cat, quick. You only have an instant. Better get it right or its all over...</i> she told herself as the door opened and her heart skipped a beat. It began to sing like a choir, she stood up from the darkness and aimed to go after the keys that the chubby man had left in his back pocket, <i>Grab them and toss his ass to the side of the room!</i> she told herself, <i>Grab them and lock the cell door behind him!</i> She only had one shot at this...but there were so many keys...she just hoped she could figure out which key was meant for the cell door. There were so many things that could go wrong doing this...<br />
