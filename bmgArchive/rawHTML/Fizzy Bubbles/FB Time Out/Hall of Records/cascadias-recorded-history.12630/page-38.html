<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> The Mountain God’s threats aren’t empty after all. Sure, He’d shown little remorse in disposing of his own minions, and tried to do the same to you on multiple occasions so far, being foiled at every turn. But to actually see Him carry out his word, remorselessly killing the good-hearted Kyle Styles and his clumsy Doduo, who’d shared most of the trials with you… it brings His cruelty to a new level. The Great One yet again orders you to stand down and surrender, lest you want to suffer the same fate as the reporter, and is intent on taking the small group of rebel of Heatmor with you.<br />
<br />
As if making good on his Master’s promise, the Magmortar unleashes a violent burst of fire that takes the shape of the oriental <i>Daimonji</i>, a wicked <b>Fire Blast</b> that explodes on contact with Helga; the shockwave itself is so severe, it tosses you and the entire group of Heatmor to the ground, while the Hariyama, having taken the full brunt of the blow, is sent flying across the arena! You watch helplessly as Helga’s body flies through the air, quickly realizing she’ll fall into the lava pit that circles the central chamber if she keeps going!<br />
But just as hope beings to fade (how could you possibly grab such a huge Pokemon?), you catch a glimpse of something beginning to move through the corner of your eye – faster than you thought possible, the Heatmor leader gets back to his feet and dashes toward Helga! The anteater leaps and tackles the Hariyama from behind, stopping her momentum and causing the two Pokemon to fall back down before the edge of the platform!<br />
<br />
Helga struggles back to her feet, mutters her thanks to Heatmor in her native tongue and switches her attention back to the giant Magmortar, her Guts fueling an unprecedented rage. She readies herself and lunges forward with her palm glowing, while Magmortar again chuckles in amusement and leaves itself wide open, curious to find out the true extent of its persistent little foe. This time, letting out a bone-chilling battle cry, the Hariyama rams her open hand into the magma Pokemon’s torso and the ensuing energy blast effortlessly topples the giant, who collapses backwards! Furthermore, it seems this time the aftereffect of Force Palm has taken effect – Magmortar’s limbs lock up during its attempt to get back up! Unwilling to let up, Helga gets on top of the fallen titan and repeatedly slaps it across the face, over and over again as if trying to wake an unconscious person up, but dealing heavy damage instead!<br />
<br />
When she’s had enough, the heavyweight Pokemon steps away from her battered opponent, but the fire in her eyes remains. Stunned and hurting all over, Magmortar gets to one knee, gasping for air, wondering how could such a weakling be manhandling it this way… but before it can even think of mounting an offense of its own, Helga has already decided to wrap things up! She brings her hands forward, creating a blue orb between them, and releases a torrent of saltwater at the Fire-Type!<br />
<br />
The water stream crashes into Magmortar and this time, thanks to the high pressure of the jet, it’s the enemy who goes flying back! Doused in seawater, the Magmortar collides with the rock wall at the edge of the huge circular arena, and when the Brine subsides, the creature’s massive frame detaches from the wall and tumbles into the magma surrounding the main chamber! For a while, nothing seems to happen, and you would imagine Magmortar to be relatively at ease inside the active volcano but… something surfaces, and it’s not the foe as you knew it just now! Helga bends over the edge and pulls out the incapacitated enemy – revealing that Magmortar’s body has been encased in a layer of pitch-black stone! Meowth is quick to explain that the water blast that drenched Magmortar must have caused the lava to solidify around the creature’s body, and because Helga was quick enough to pull it out, it never got to melt back over… Magmortar is unable to battle anymore, having been turned into a harmless statue! <b>Helga gains 1 Level!</b><br />
<br />
Your celebration, if any, is short-lived. While Helga helps the Heatmor leader back to his feet, thanking him again for essentially saving her life, another terrible quake makes the volcano’s main chamber shake wildly, the wide platform you all stand on trembling violently before a huge portion of the volcano throat’s wall falls off with a loud rumbling noise. You all instinctively look up to find…<br />

<b>I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU ALL. I WILL PUT AN END TO THIS NUISANCE MYSELF!</b><br />
<br />
He didn’t need to speak for you to have known – you’re finally standing face to face with the Great One, the Mountain God and heart of Mt. Aduro! This is the one behind it all – not just Aduro’s continued existence, but the abhorrent “natural selection” imposed on the island, that has doomed so many Pokemon considered “unfit” to perish!<br />
<br />
The gigantic creature, several times that of Magmortar, lets go of the wall and crashes down on the platform, causing half of it to crumble under His weight, allowing his legs to sink into the lava with no repercussions! The area you’re all standind on has just become twice as small, and the final foe has finally revealed Himself! But… can you hope to topple such a mythical being?<br />
<br />
<b>PUNY HUMAN. YOU DO NOT BELONG HERE, YET SEE FIT TO MEDDLE IN MY AFFAIRS – ADURO’S AFFAIRS! THE HEATMOR ARE NOT WORTHY OF DWELLING IN MY PARADISE. THEY ARE <i>FATED</i> TO DIE! BEHOLD!</b><br />
<br />
With a deafening roar, the Great One causes a stream of lava to rise from the depths of the pit, as if controlling it mentally; the magma tendril wraps itself around one of the remaining Heatmor, and much to the leader’s despair… drags it into the boiling lava near the God’s feet, instantly incinerating the poor thing!<br />
<br />
<b>REMEMBER MY WORDS – “DEFY ME AGAIN, SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT!” THIS IS THE RESULT OF YOUR CONTINUED DEFIANCE! YOU WILL WATCH THEM <i>ALL</i> DIE, NOW THAT YOU’VE LURED THEM TO ME... AND YOU WILL BE THE LAST ONE TO MELT AWAY!</b><br />
<br />
The final battle begins now! What will you do?!</span></span>

<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">This was it. It was now or never. Keith had to end this battle, and end it fast, lest the Great One end any more lives, cause any more unnecessary fatalities, be any more cruel than He already has been (though that'd be a difficult feat to pull off, considering what he had just done).<br />
<br />
Magmortar moved first- whether he was just as cruel as his master or simply pleased to be battling such a formidable foe, they couldn't tell. Either way, he launched a powerful plume of flame that took a distinctive shape that Keith recognized immediately- none of his Pokémon knew the move themselves, but having grown up in Lavaridge Town, not only a stone's throw from a volcano but also the home to the Fire-type specialists of the local Pokémon Gym, he had certainly seen this technique before: Fire Blast. Widely considered to be the most powerful weapon in a Fire-type's arsenal (though Keith knew that certain attacks could surpass it in power), it was a terrifying force to behold in and of itself, but when used by a Fire-type, it gained even more ungodly strength. Ever determined, Helga stood her ground, but unlike the Flamethrower, she couldn't muscle her way through the Fire Blast- it exploded on contact, and quite violently, too. The shockwave knocked Keith, Meowth, Gemini, Mustard, and the Heatmor on their backs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oww...&quot; Keith murmured as he got up. And then, as he looked, his eyes widened in horror- the blast had sent Helga flying, she was soaring across the arena... and if she continued on her path, she was going to fall right into the lava!!! &quot;No! <i>NO!!!</i>&quot; Keith exclaimed, his right hand scrambling to find Helga's Poké Ball on his belt, but it was too late, Helga was moving too fast, he probably wouldn't even get the ball enlarged in time...<br />
<br />
And then, at that moment, swift movement caught Keith's eye- it was the Heatmor leader, this time charging forward and slamming into Helga with a Tackle- not enough to cause her any real damage, but more to the point, enough to cause her to land on solid rock instead of in molten, fiery, liquid death.<br />
<br />
Keith breathed again as it sank in- Helga was OK, she wasn't falling to her death, she was still alive. As Helga murmured a grateful thanks to the Heatmor, Keith also turned to the Fire-type. &quot;Heatmor... Thank you,&quot; he said, gratitude evident in his voice. Then he turned back to Helga, who was glaring at Magmortar with renewed rage, her Guts fueling her spirit once again. She glanced back at Keith, and from the look in her eyes, Keith knew that she was going to finish this battle here and now. Nodding his approval, Keith called out, &quot;Let's go, Helga! Force Palm!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YAAAMAAAAAA!&quot; Helga bellowed, charging forward with earth-shaking steps. She slammed an open palm into the Blast Pokémon's torso, toppling the massive molten Magmortar with astonishing ease. And then Keith noticed something else that caught his attention- Magmortar's limbs weren't doing it any good in its attempt to get up- Force Palm's side effect must have kicked in! His strategy was working out after all!<br />
<br />
&quot;Now's our chance, Helga!&quot; Keith cried out. &quot;Smelling Salts attack!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hariiiiyama!&quot; responded Helga. In an instant, she was attacking Magmortar, slapping him repeatedly as though attempting to wake up a sleeping Pokémon, the slaps causing particularly heavy damage due to the paralysis. This, this was Keith's strategy- he knew that Force Palm could paralyze the target, so if he could just get that to happen, then Helga would be able to land a particularly nasty blow with Smelling Salts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, dat's powerful!&quot; Meowth remarked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's the idea,&quot; Keith grinned. &quot;Finish it off, Helga!&quot; he added, once the attack was done, and the Hariyama was standing over the gasping, exhausted Magmortar. &quot;Brine!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Helga was more than happy to oblige, and Magmortar was blasted with the super effective Water move, the last piece of the puzzle that was Keith's strategy for this battle- between Magmortar's natural weakness to water moves, and Brine's tendency to cause even more damage to enemies that have already taken heavy damage, this was the perfect move to use here. Indeed, the blast of salt water sent Magmortar flying backwards and slamming into the rock wall at the back of the chamber. And then, its body peeled off of the rock and fell into the lava.<br />
<br />
For a moment, nothing happened. &quot;Is it... is it knocked out?&quot; Keith asked uncertainly. And then, he could see something protruding up from the lava- it was shaped like Magmortar, but... it was pitch-black.<br />
<br />
Helga stomped over and pulled the object out of the lava, causing Keith's eyes to widen- it was Magmortar, somehow turned to stone! &quot;What- How the-&quot; Keith spluttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dat Brine must'a cooled off Magmortar's body,&quot; Meowth speculated. &quot;And Helga pulled it out so quick it didn't have enough time ta melt again.&quot; Keith gave Meowth a look, to which the Scratch Cat Pokémon shrugged. &quot;Hermione taught me some stuff about rocks and lava and whatnot before we came here,&quot; he explained.<br />
<br />
It wasn't exactly how Keith was expecting the battle to have ended, but in any case, he breathed a little easier- Magmortar was down. Helga had won, just as Keith knew she could! A smile crept up his face as his Hariyama gained sufficient experience to level up, and <a href="http://forums.upnetwork.net/showpost.php?p=627082&amp;postcount=1847" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.upnetwork.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D627082%26postcount%3D1847&amp;hash=ff46a2a26f35c555718627adc61a8a08" rel="nofollow noopener">grew to level 27</a> as a result. As the Hariyama finished helping the Heatmor leader back to his feet, Keith ran over and threw his arms around the Hariyama. He couldn't even say anything at that point, he wouldn't know where to start- he was proud of her for thoroughly destroying such a powerful foe, grateful that she didn't fall in the lava and perish, and overall, just so relieved that things turned out well in the end...<br />
<br />
And then a massive quake rocked the chamber. Keith looked around in all directions, when he heard a rumbling sound from somewhere in the throat of the volcano, high above them all. Keith, along with his Pokémon and the Heatmor, looked up at the source of the noise... and what Keith saw made his jaw drop. A massive, four-legged creature was on the ceiling, its body looking like equal parts metal and magma.<br />
<br />
<b>I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU ALL. I WILL PUT AN END TO THIS NUISANCE MYSELF!</b><br />
<br />
The booming voice no longer echoed in Keith's head, but now issued directly from this monstrous creature. As if Keith needed any further confirmation of what he pretty much guessed- this was the Great One's true identity. And then, as they looked on, it released its grip on the wall and fell down onto the platform, crushing half of it beneath its weight, allowing its legs to sink into the lava with seemingly no ill effects. Speechless, Keith took out his Pokédex and pointed it at the beast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heatran, a Lava Dome Pokémon,&quot; droned the device. &quot;Crawling on ceilings and walls with its cross-shaped feet, this legendary Pokémon dwells in volcanic caves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Oh, crap,&quot; Meowth whimpered. Heatran opened its mouth and its booming voice sounded again;<br />
<br />
<b>PUNY HUMAN. YOU DO NOT BELONG HERE, YET SEE FIT TO MEDDLE IN MY AFFAIRS – ADURO’S AFFAIRS! THE HEATMOR ARE NOT WORTHY OF DWELLING IN MY PARADISE. THEY ARE <i>FATED</i> TO DIE! BEHOLD!</b><br />
<br />
Before any of them could react, Heatran gave a bellowing roar, and a tendril of magma snaked out of the pool- and wrapped itself around one of the Heatmor! &quot;No!&quot; Keith exclaimed. He prepared to lunge, to try and grab it, to pull it to safety, but the magma was quicker- it pulled the poor Heatmor into the magma pool, incinerating it instantly.<br />
<br />
<b>REMEMBER MY WORDS – “DEFY ME AGAIN, SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT!” THIS IS THE RESULT OF YOUR CONTINUED DEFIANCE! YOU WILL WATCH THEM <i>ALL</i> DIE, NOW THAT YOU’VE LURED THEM TO ME... AND YOU WILL BE THE LAST ONE TO MELT AWAY!</b><br />
<br />
&quot;...No,&quot; Keith said, his voice quiet and calm, albeit ominously so. Indeed, as Meowth caught sight of the look in Keith's eyes, he instinctively recoiled in terror. He had seen that look before, and that coupled with such an ominously calm tone of voice could only mean one thing; Keith was fucking <i>pissed</i>. &quot;You will not kill anyone else. You might be a legendary Pokémon, and you may have all these powers, but that doesn't mean you can just choose who lives and who dies based on your arbitrary criteria. I don't care that you call yourself a god- I don't give a Raticate's ass if you're Ash friggin' Ketchum with the world's strongest Pikachu- you are nothing but a bully, and your reign of terror will end now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yama!&quot; nodded Helga as she assumed a fighting stance. Keith, however, held her back. &quot;Hari?&quot; she murmured, looking at Keith.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I know you got it in you,&quot; Keith nodded to his Hariyama. &quot;After what you just did, your power and ability cannot be in question. The thing is, Helga... this is <i>their</i> battle.&quot; As he said this, he glanced over at the Weezing- Gemini and Mustard were glaring at the Heatran with identical expressions of pure, unadulterated hatred. Not just because of all the cruelty they witnessed at His hands... er, feet... whatever... but also because of what Keith had said, about the hundreds, maybe thousands, of cruelly killed Koffing and Weezing, about how their twisted and horribly mangled corpses were being used as booby traps... it was disgusting, the whole thing, and the Weezing's two heads were agreed that they would not stand for this. Nodding in understanding, Helga backed down, instead opting to try and keep the remaining Heatmor safe as best she could.<br />
<br />
Gemini and Mustard turned to look at Keith, who smiled and gave them an approving nod. No words were necessary at this moment, telepathic or otherwise- they understood each other perfectly, and Keith knew that of all his Pokémon, it was this, his oldest and strongest partner, who stood the best chance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gemini, let's do this!&quot; Keith exclaimed. &quot;Use your <b>Sweet Scent</b> to start, then blast it with your <b>Zap Cannon</b> attack! Then follow it up with <b>Hidden Power</b>!&quot;</span></span><br />
<br />

<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> This has been a pretty strange ride so far. The elderly couple, who want nothing more than to see Contests return,<br />
<br />
You try your very best to sound determined; after all, a lot is hinging on this next call! The phone number you got from that stranger is all you have to go on, and even if it means exposing yourself here, you're willing to take that chance.<br />
<br />
The deafening silence of the private video room is pierced regularly by the beeping of the call in transit. It seems to go on forever, adding to your state of already high tension, and for a moment it seems as if nobody's picking up; maybe the man was playing a prank on you? Maybe those guys in the black van are using this call to trace your movements and corner you...<br />
<br />
<i>*click*</i><br />
<br />
Suddenly, the monitor display goes from pitch black to a vivid image - someone answered the call!! However... there doesn't seem to be anyone on the other side. The camera is pointed to what seems like a huge bookcase, filled with ancient-looking tomes you can't quite identify. The room being broadcast is poorly lit, reminding you of something like an abandoned library, and nobody steps in front of the camera for even a second - but somebody <i>must</i> be there, or else why would the call be going through?<br />
<br />
Nothing happens for a good while, and you're about to give up. Whoever's on the other side is either mocking you, picked up by mistake or maybe the whole system is jsut bugged and there isn't really anyone on the other side of the line...<br />
<br />
<i>- You have the wrong number. Get off this line!</i><br />
<br />
The sudden words startle you; the voice on the other side sounds heavily distorted, probably due to interference, and whoever is speaking sounds awfully wary of your intentions, which is strange if you actually did call a &quot;wrong number&quot;...<br />
<br />
Maybe there's something you can say that'll prevent them from hanging up... Do you have any clue? Quickly!</span></span>

<br />
“Do you think I marked a wrong number or something? I didn't happen to guess them either, this number was given to me by a mysterious man in a coat and hat. He assured me that you would be able to help me! <b>...THE VOICE OF UNREST</b>” The lass trainer began to say, “There is an unrest that has plagued this city for decades, it has turned innocent people's lives upside down...torn relationships apart and I want to know why! Who! And what I could do to change that!”<br />
<br />
But still, there was no response...<br />
<br />
“What is it that I have to do for <i>you</i> to take me seriously!?” She said slamming her trainer bag next to the nearest desk. Digging through her contents she came across the items she wanted to show.<br />
<br />
“Even though I've never won a major contest...I have managed to collect these <b><span style="color: pink">Pink</span>, <span style="color: blue">Blue</span>, <span style="color: green">Green</span>, <span style="color: yellow">Yellow</span> and <span style="color: red">Red</span></b> Scarves. These are my pride and joy. And I have my Pokemon wear them when I compete.” She sighed, “I gave up my secure life behind so that I could chase my dreams, my dreams to become a coordinator. And now someone's telling me that contests are the thing of the past, forbidden. That self expression is dead. That everything I've done, devoting countless hours in practices to find just the perfect combo was all for naught?! I refuse! I refuse to except this without a fight! I refuse to admit to my family, that wanted nothing more then for me to become a nurse and have a secure future, that they were right! So you can hide in the shadows all you want and if you want to call me a dreamer then so be it. But I know in my heart that this <i>is</i> the correct number and before you have the nerve to hang up on me, the least you can do is come out and look me in the face.”<br />
<br />
Her nostrils were flared, her attitude was stern. She knew if she pushed too hard there was a chance she would lose this contact...but when it came to passion, she had it. If she could jump through the monitor and ring this persons neck she probably do it, just to get her point across.<br />
<br />
Liza's belly was lit with the fire of determination, now only time would tell if she was able to burn bright enough to get this person's attention.<br />

<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u> Electric Blue Eye</u>:</b> This is it, you can feel it - the grand finale is here! If you can surpass Dewott, you'll have beaten Sean with a Pokemon to spare, and what a start to your gauntlet that would be!<br />
<br />
Hanzo stares James dead in the eye, empty-handed and unmoving. It's impossible to predict what his move's going to be, but you try to cover all your bases: in a move that surprise both Sean and the Dewott, you order the limbless Gastly to use Thunderpunch - twice!<br />
The Ghost-Type charges electricity within its miasma, then shapes the swirling shadows that surround him into a pair of gaseous fists. The darkness extends all the way toward Hanzo, who is caught off-guard by the unconventional move, allowing the first Thunderpunch to hit home! Lightning courses through Hanzo's body, making him growl in pain, but the impact of the move itself is considerably low, seeing as Gastly's smoke isn't a solid surface.<br />
<br />
With just enough time to recover, Hanzo, being the tactical mastermind you've come to realize, telegraphs the combo and nimbly dodges the second strike by kneeling down at the last second. Sean smiles at his partner's resilience and outs his own plan into motion.<br />
<br />
- That's it! Now close the distance with <b>Aqua Jet[]/b] and ready the Flowing River Stance!<br />
<br />
The technique's name is entirely foreign to you, and you're not eager to find out what it is. It's bad enough that Hanzo's speed suddenly allows him to essentially become a bullet of water, travelling all the way toward James in a split second! However, just as your partner prepares to meet his foe with a timely Sucker Punch... Hanzo stops an inch before contact, standing idly <i>right in front</i> of the Gastly, as if mocking him! Temporarily stunned by the lack of impact, James instead decides to follow your orders and channels Grass energy into an orb that will hopefully put the Dewott away... which is when Hanzo's mysterious technique reveals itself!<br />
<br />
The Dewott lighlty taps on the icy floor with one foot, causing a rising <b>Waterfall</b> to emerge from the frozen pool, shattering the frost layer and, instead of hitting James as expected... propels Hanzo himself upwards! Aided by the pillar of water, the Dewott executes a perfect somersault over James, who widely misses the Giga Drain as a result, and gracefully lands right behind your partner!<br />
<br />
- Well done Hanzo! Now, <b>Copycat</b> that Giga Drain to allow for the finale you've had in mind for a while now...<br />
<br />
Instead of triumphant, Sean's voice sounds resigned - as if he's known for a while that Hanzo is going to finish this battle on his own terms. Hanzo, panting heavily and on the brink of collapse after the beating he's taken, smiles in gratitude. He channels a green orb similar to James and blasts his unprotected back with a <b>Giga Drain</b> of his own! The glowing particles left floating after the explosion return to Hanzo, partially restoring his energy, while James writhes on the floor in pain from the highly effective hit (courtesy of having been turned to a Water-Type before). And then, you realize what Hanzo's &quot;finale&quot; is...<br />
<br />
The Dewott, still breathing heavily, bows respectfully to his injured opponent, before kneeling down next to James and placing a hand on his gaseous body. The Gummi Bomb in his chest glows brighter and brighter, and a massive explosion ensues, shattering most of the remaining ice floor with its powerful shockwave! When the mist cleared, the two Pokemon, James and Hanzo, are floating motionlessly - each of them knocked out cold and unable to continue. It's a draw!!<br />
<br />
- Dewott and Gastly are both unable to battle. With one Pokemon left... the winner is Ethan!<br />
<br />
The crowd, who'd been in silent suspense for the last moves of the incredible match, suddenly erupts into cheers, chanting your name over and over again, evidently sold on your battling skills!<br />
Sean recalls Hanzo, smiles and claps at you while the arena is lowered back to the depths of the earth and replaced by the usual concrete surface. He descends from his pod and walks over to yours. His words are barely perceptible amidst the crowd's roars, but you get the feeling it's completely intentional...<br />
<br />
- That was a phenomenal match. Thanks for giving it your all and making me go all out as well; it's been a while. Here, take this... but show it to nobody, for your own sake.<br />
<br />
He walks up to you and gives you a handshake and a hug, during which he slips something wrapped in a piece of cloth into your hand. He whispers something into your ear as he hands you the mysterious item.<br />
<br />
- Someone's after these. Please keep them safe, whatever the cost; I don't really know who I can trust, but something's very wrong with this tournament.<br />
<br />
He steps back and raises his voice once again, this time clearly intending to be heard.<br />
<br />
- Well done Ethan! Maybe you do have the makings of a Champion. I'm sure Gottfried himself was entertained, and I look forward to seeing how far you can go in this gauntlet! Oh, and you can keep that scalchop you took from Hanzo; he can always craft another, and I'm sure he'll want you to keep it as a souvenir.<br />
<br />
You've earned three things at the end of this match: the crowd's utmost respect, a <b>

1x Splash Plate</b> carefully concealed that Sean fears might fall into the wrong hands...<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the crowd's cheers die down. The Champion Gottfried is on his feet and has approached the balcony; it seems he's about to address you and Sean, and the sight of him alone commands respect, as if an elder titan stood before your eyes - how can one ordinary man exude such a mighty aura of power and reverence? Just as the retiring Champion is about to speak, a voice to his left cuts him short - a voice filled with urgency and concern.<br />
<br />
- The gauntlet cannot continue!<br />
<br />
You instinctively turn to the origin of the fearful voice; in one of the Leaders' seats next to Gottfried's throne, one man has stood up as well and faces the Champion. A slender, sharply-dressed man with black hair, thin-rimmed glasses, several rings on each finger and a gold necklace, the embodiment of style. His expression is one of worry, and his accent is decidedly foreign.<br />
<br />
- I have just learned that Trevor, who was scheduled to face that Trainer in the afternoon round, was found unconscious just now in the corridor leading to the restrooms! His medical condition is uncertain, but we cannot continue under these circumstances!<br />
<br />
Gottfried's stare pierces the soul, but he doesn't answer the nervous man. Instead, another Gym Leader answers.<br />
<br />
- Settle down Pietro. The tournament must proceed.<br />
<br />
Next to the man in expensive garments stands a much taller figure, dressed in an elaborate black robe with silver embroideries; his face is pale as moonlight and his hair, kept past shoulder length, is half black and half white The man's voice is calm, soothing, as if inviting those who listen to let go of their worries and embrace sleep...<br />
<br />
- These people paid good money to attend this ceremony. And war does not cease on the first casualty...<br />
<br />
- Luther! A man might be gravely ill and you want to continue the spectacle? Besides, he was scheduled to face that very Trainer in the arena right now! Do you not find that highly suspicious? What if <i>he</i> is responsible for what happened to Trevor? Man can go to great lengths to reach fame and fortune!<br />
<br />
The strange Luther approaches the balcony and glares at you with interest - an unsettling stare that fills you with apprehension, even if he seems to be on your side.<br />
<br />
- That man has done no harm. We witnessed his grand battle from start to finish, not once did he leave our sight. Do not hold him accountable with no proof. Besides... don't you wish to see how far this one can go? Good Trevor is in capable hands. The show must go on... right, Champion Gottfried?<br />
<br />
The elder remains silent throughout the entire exchange, and also when directly confronted. He seems to ponder on the two sides - Pietro, who asks that the tournament be suspended to find out what happened to Trevor, despite not knowing the actual seriousness of the man's condition, or Luther, the shady figure who wants to see the gauntlet resumed and seems to have taken an unnatural amount of interest in you...<br />
<br />
Pleading your own case might help right now - after all, you've been accused of something terrible! And in the middle of all this, what do <i>you</i> want Gottfried to decide? It's time to speak up! </b></span></span>

<br />
--<br />
<br />
The last few moments of the battle between James and Hanzo were watched in silence, each Pokemon going all out for the pride of their trainers, and though pushing themselves to the point of exhaustion, the expressions on both Pokemon’s faces were happy ones.<br />
<br />
With the help of the Gummi Bomb, Ethan and James were finally able to out maneuver the tactical genius’ Sean and Hanzo.<br />
<br />
Like the beating of a heart, the bomb attached to the Dewott ticked away before finally taking him and Ethan’s starter out of the match simultaneously.<br />
<br />
&quot;...the winner is Ethan!&quot; the ref declared as the crowd erupted in cheer, the match that had been 'edge of your seat, action packed' had at last come to an end.<br />
<br />
&quot;We did it...we won...&quot; Ethan barely managed to say, feeling a little faint, almost losing his footing he quickly reached for the pod’s handle bar and stabilized himself before he fell over. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sableye!&quot; The ghoul looked on a bit concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's nothing...&quot; Ethan smiled, &quot;Just a little mentally drained is all. I've never had a Psychic link with James for that long of a time frame. I’ll just need a small breather to feel as good as new.&quot;<br />
<br />
The crowd was chanting Ethan's name now, causing the young man to smile. Water formed underneath his eyes, as he looked out to the crowd &quot;I did it Clyde! Just like I told you I would!&quot; <br />
<br />
<i>Maybe</i> he was getting a little bit ahead of himself, having only defeated one of the eight gym leaders needed to win the whole thing but still, life was too short not to celebrate the small victories. <br />
<br />
Tears now began cascading down his cheek, he tried hiding them but his little ghoul noticed anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sab, Sableye?!&quot; the ghost Pokemon said grabbing the boy from the collar shaking him a tad as if asking if everything was alright, having never seen his trainer cry before.<br />
<br />
&quot;I’m fine Adam. I just feel like I’ve made my inner child very happy.&quot; He said rubbing the ghoul’s head affectionately before wiping away the tears.<br />
<br />
Returning his Gastly back inside his pokeball, Ethan lightly pressed the sphere back into his belt, lined up with the other ones containing his Jellicent and Snivy. <br />
<br />
&quot;I was finally able to achieve a childhood dream of mine, I wouldn’t have been able to experience this if it wasn’t for all of you. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was a phenomenal match. Thanks for giving it your all and making me go all out as well; it's been a while.&quot; Sean's words caught the trainer off guard, &quot;Really?&quot; Ethan chuckled, &quot;Honestly, I feel like I should be thanking you, that battle was a learning experience for me. It's helped me grow in more ways then you could ever imagine.&quot; <br />
<br />
As the gym leader leaned in for a shake of a hand and a hug, he whispered something in Ethan's ear, just like before, &quot;Here, take this... but show it to nobody, for your own sake. Someone's after these. Please keep them safe, whatever the cost; I don't really know who I can trust, but something's very wrong with this tournament.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan eyes widen, he had forgotten through the excitement of the battle what he was really facing now. Through the battle, the bond Sean had with his Pokemon was unmistakable, there was no way a Gym Leader of his caliber would stoop so low as to threaten him with a note. As he felt something slip inside his jacket, the bulk of an item wrapped neatly in a cloth was by no mistake a Plate similar to that of the others he already had...<br />
<br />
[Ethan has obtained <b>x1 Splash Plate</b>!]<br />
<br />
If a man like Sean was too scared to hold on to this...who was this enemy hiding in the shadows? And how powerful could they be?<br />
<br />
&quot;Well done Ethan!&quot; Sean spoke a bit louder so that the battledores would be able to hear, &quot;Maybe you do have the makings of a Champion. I'm sure Gottfried himself was entertained, and I look forward to seeing how far you can go in this gauntlet! Oh, and you can keep that scalchop you took from Hanzo; he can always craft another, and I'm sure he'll want you to keep it as a souvenir.&quot;<br />
<br />
[Ethan has obtained <b>x1 Shoal Shell</b>!]<br />
<br />
Cheers subsided for a second, when the Champion himself stood up, his presence demanding respect with every move he made. How did Gottfried earn such fame and power to be able to do that? Was it given to him at birth or did he have to work for it?<br />
<br />
It seemed like Gottfired himself was ready to speak, giving his opinion on the match. Was this it? The recognition Ethan so craved? <i>Did I earn his respect? Through this battle...did I show him that I am worthy of being here?</i> the young man thought but before he could hear the Champion's words, another voice shout from the gallows, a Gym Leader he didn't recognize was shouting for the tournament to seize...<br />
<br />
<i>Did I hear him correctly? Was Trevor really found unconscious?.</i> Ethan was too in shock to understand, a Gym Leader had gotten bested by someone?<br />
<br />
But the worst of it was, Ethan was being accused of being the attacker!<br />
<br />
<i>But-t that’s ridiculous...I didn’t even know Trevor...why would I...</i> Ethan's thought broke off, a flash back of a burning house came into his mind, as a young 8 year old Ethan stood crying, screaming, he yelled for help but nobody came...until it was too late. He's clothes looked tattered and burned, as he and his pet Snivy stood watching as their home lay in flames...<i>No...this isn't happening...this can't be- I can't be blamed for another heinous crime!</i> He was shaking now...how many times would he be blamed for a crime he didn’t commit...Ethan’s thought was swiftly broken off when the man, another Gym Leader, protesting the tournament continue defended him with reason. While the little exchange went on to go ahead with the tournament or not, Ethan couldn't help but get the impression that Luther had taken a keen interest in him, it was only a guess but could <i>he</i> have been the one to make that phone call last night that allowed Ethan to enter the tournament? It would make sense that a Gym Leader that was participating would be able to have some say on the matter...But why? And why him?<br />
<br />
<i>Was this really happening? It sounded too ridiculous to be real, this couldn't just be an act, a performance for the audience between gym battles to keep the crowd entertained...no, that note, the threat is real. And if what Sean said is true...there is something terribly wrong here.</i><br />
<br />
Ethan was silent for a moment, he wasn’t too sure he should bring up anything that Sean and he knew about...after all, he still didn’t know who he could trust among the main players of the tournament. And even if he did tell them, he had been threatened...whoever it was was watching him, maybe at this very moment to see how he would react to this. Ethan didn’t have any proof of any of this. He had originally ripped and thrown out the note back in his temporary living space...if he even mentioned it and it wasn’t there or worse! If the person that had attacked Trevor left some incriminating evidence behind so he would take the fall...<i>I refuse to be someone else's pawn!!</i><br />
<br />
If he didn't speak out now...he would regret it, Ethan couldn't allow others to decide his fate, he knew better then that. <br />
<br />
Looking directly at Peitro, the trainer spoke loudly and confidently, &quot;Just because Trevor was meant to be my opponent doesn't mean that I had something to do with what happened to him. Luther makes perfect, <i>rational</i> sense, I was here the whole time. A hundred thousand people can attest to the same thing. The truth is I knew Trevor only by name. You can have your computer technicians look at my computer history if you don't believe me. All I had time for last night was to search my first opponent, Sean. I was planning to play it by ear whenever I faced Trevor, but it doesn't look like that's going to happen now...does it? With your little out burst you've caused confusement and panic to pass through the spectators.&quot; Ethan shook his head, &quot;What they must be thinking right now for their beloved Gym Leader...even worse, you've tipped off the real criminals!!&quot; His voice rose in an angers pitch, &quot;The tournament can't go on with such an ominous wind casting itself in the horizon, it should be cancelled...at least, until an investigation can be fully conducted that will find the ones responsible.&quot; He said before turning his attention toward the Champion, &quot;Don't you agree? Gottfried.&quot;</span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>CyberBlastoise</u>:</b> <i>((A refrigeration unit is much too harmless for what I intend to put you through <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite7" alt=":p" title="Stick Out Tongue    :p" data-shortname=":p" />))</i><br />
<br />
You bank it all on Swift's cure - whatever that may be - to be found on the front part of the ship, reasoning that going back to the bloody door would be pointless backtracking. With so little to go on, you decide to try your luck and sneak behind (or rather, <i>below</i>) the horde of fully-evolved ghosts all the way to the door guarded by the green Jellicent, hiding in the undead's own mist. They do seem oblivious to their surroundings, as if in a zombified state, so maybe they won't notice you...<br />
<br />
You crouch and crawl amidst the creepy fog, and as it surrounds you from head to tow you feel your body grow colder and colder. You start shivering but press onward, trying to figure out if this is actual cold or something else entirely... the paranormal isn't meant to make sense and none of this does.<br />
One benefit of the mist is that the Jellicent really don't seem to notice you, at least the first of the six you are now carefully crawling under. But the downside is that it clouds your own vision and it's impossible to tell if there are any door nearby without raising your head to see...<br />
<br />
Heart-wrenching moans fill the corridor, and the further your progress the mroe convinced you are that what you feel isn't a simple drop in temperature at all, but an intense lingering fear that's penetrating your very core as if made of ice. The ghosts' wordless cries speak of untold suffering, misery and loss, making you wonder what happened here and who they might have been in a past life. You also wonder why Pokemon so well-known for their voratious appetite choose to dwell in a lifeless ship where the only apparent means of sustenance are glowing mushrooms... what's keeping them here?<br />
<br />
After you successfully pass under the second Jellicent, the moans appear to intensify and the ghosts' movements become more frantic and erratic (at least judging by their fins, the only part of their body you can make out through the fog). They are growing increasingly agitated for some reason... did they sense your life force, or is it something else? There's no way to tell!<br />
<br />
More importantly, do you keep crawling forward towards the door at the far end, or do you risk peeking above the mist for a nearby shortcut out of this hall? </span></span> <br />

Bill was slowly crawling towards the doorway, he made a mental note that if he did get caught by them to bring back Silver and Shelly and get back at them for ruining his trip this early. At least wait till the treasure gets discovered and haunt at that time sheesh. Have these ghosts not ever done a haunting before? These thoughts continued to fill Bill's mind to keep him from thinking about the actual, very dangerous situation he was put in. Eventually, he'd also have to handle those Wingull too. Though at that point he'd be outside, and thus able to use Savage to fight with. Slowly, carefully, suddenly his arm shuffled a bit and the ghosts above started to stir about. Bill suddenly froze in place. He hoped that they wouldn't notice him, but he still had no idea if they even noticed him. There couldn't have been someone else on the boat...could there? It was secure, though Bill felt like he could've gone by those guards if he really wanted to. He shook his head; there was no need to think about this right now, if someone else was there, he'd look later, right now he would have to rely on stealth and hope for the best.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on,&quot; he whispered to himself, &quot;j-just a little bit further.&quot; He just continued to crawl, not even bothering to look up, because hey, who doesn't like a nice surprise if they did find him. At least, ghosts usually come in one of two flavors too, either he'd have a quick and painless death, or a very convoluted curse that would end up with his eventual escape....hopefully.<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> Fueled by thirst for revenge, Gemini and Mustard assume battle positions with the same fearlessness as if their opponent was a common Scatterbug. Alas, it is not, as you’re about to be reminded...<br />
<br />
Heatran, Lord of the Mountain, stands idly for a while much like his servant had before, when Magmortar was testing the limits of Helga’s strength. Determined to prove how badly they want to topple the “god”, the Weezing duo lets loose a cloud of smoke, but unlike its usual foul smell, this gas has a seemingly soothing property. Heatran looks amused and purposefully inhales deep, sucking in all of the misty substance at once. He laughs audibly, both entertained by Gemini’s attempt and genuinely relaxed after smelling the Sweet Scent – adding that to his massively inflated ego, Heatran isn’t going to be attempting to dodge any time soon.<br />
<br />
His confidence boosted, Gemini takes aim and charges up, creating a huge ball of intense electrical energy in front of him, though it dwarves in comparison to the foe it’s meant to hit. The Poison-Type releases the unstable blast, which spins and twists as it flies through the air; however, with Heatran not looking to evade much of anything, you’re fairly confident it’s going to hit! The God of the Mountain stares at the incoming attack, visibly entertained, and just as the Zap Cannon is about to hit, a <b>Lava Plume</b> shoots up from the ground between Heatran and the orb! The lightning sphere explodes on contact with the magma barrage, and both attacks are nullified… and now it seems the Great One is about to strike back!<br />
<br />
The towering figure lets out a roar that resembles a loud chuckle, and it may well have been. The creature of legend unleashes a burst of burning hot wind from its gaping mouth that blasts Gemini&amp;Mustard and propels them several feet back, while their skin burns from the intense heat but fortunately doesn’t seem to leave any lasting effects. However, the sheer force of the blow is enough to strike the Weezing down and leave the duo barely conscious – such is the power of a Legendary Pokemon!<br />
<br />
Having decided to put Gemini out of his misery, the Great One slowly makes his way towards your downed partner. With what little strength he has left, the Weezing channels his Hidden Power through the platform and strikes Heatran with a materialized pillar of earth that sprouts from the ground, briefly stopping the legend in his tracks but not nearly enough to stop him permanently. Aggravated further by your partners stubbornness, Heatran hastens his pace and lifts one of his immense claws, determined to bury Gemin and Mustard underfoot for their insolence… until something rams into his side and makes him temporarily lose his balance, distracting him!<br />
<br />
Heatran turns to find the Heatmor leader glaring at him in defiance. It seems the anteater, fueled by revenge himself for his fallen comrades, has decided to join in and help you take down the God! Gemini is severely injured but still has some fight left, and you can now issue orders to Heatmor as well – will it be enough to level the playing field?<br />
<br />

Gottfried, the immense elder, keeps his eyes locked on you nd his arms crossed, looking on from his throne in the main balcony. Pietro looks enraged at your nerve, and Luther has a distinct smile on his face, as if proud of your attitude.<br />
<br />
The undefeated Champion leaned to the side, consulting the taller, thinner old man to his left, the one they called &quot;God's Gatekeeper&quot; and member of the northern Elite Four. Drago, Gottfried's long-time advisor and the last obstacle on the road of many hopeful challengers, was a man of few words much like the Champion himself, but his presence was much more subtle - however, whatever advice he whispered to Gottfried was seemingly well-received.<br />
<br />
The elder rose from his seat and walked to the edge of the balcony to address you and the restless crowd. His voice, deep and powerful as befitting his massive frame, echoed through the arena with unquestionable authority.<br />
<br />
- The games will continue. Your skill intrigues me far too much. Clarifying Trevor's attack will be handled by men of my trust. Pietro, your concern is noted... but the issue will be swiftly handled by Drago.<br />
<br />
The other elder nodded in silence, dutifully rose from his seat and left the balcony without a word. Pietro sat back down in visible discomfort, but didn't dare question Gottfried - it's clear he preferred a different course of action, but the Champion's will was absolute.<br />
<br />
Gottfried continued, althout it was evident he didn't care much for speeches at all and was growing tired of talking.<br />
<br />
- Luther, you seem to have taken an interest in the boy; you will fill in for Trevor. Give me something worth watching.<br />
<br />
The youngster sitting to Gottfried's right jumped up. He was so silent and unremarkable throughout the whole thing it was hard to believe he'd just been appointed as the new Champion... Johan hurried to formally wrap up the first morning of the tournament, his voice trembling slightly with concern but fully focused on his task. Being Gottfried's student must take a huge toll on someone, let alone being tasked with continuing the man's legacy...<br />
<br />
- Ethan has passed the first round! He will continue the gauntlet in the afternoon; his opponent will be Gym Leader Luther. We will see you all again at 2pm everyone!<br />
<br />
The crowd began to disperse in a wave of excitement, hurriedly leaving the arena until nobody remained in the stands. Sean exchanged a look of concern with you briefly before heading backstage, and you decide to do the same - you need to grab something to eat and clear your head before the next challenge. You feel concerned with the recent events, and although you pleaded for the tournament's interruption, the show must go on - the gauntlet was held in Gottfried's honor, and the legend himself declared interest in seeing you fight... what choice do you even have? Still, if that other elder is someone Gottfried trusts, maybe he's good enough to get to the bottom of it quickly while you focus on your battles...<br />
<br />
An assistant is backstage ready to escort you back to your tournament residence. It sems you're not going to make your way back to the locker room - instead you're guided straight back home. Security measures perhaps? The walk back is fairly uneventful and leaves you plenty of time to think back on the events of the day. When you reach the front door, the assistant leaves, and you walk inside.<br />
<br />
As soon as you open the door and step into the entry halway, something on the floor peaks your interest - it's something wrapped in white cloth. You kneel down and pick it up, to find a pleasant-scented

</div>
<b>1x Meadow Plate</b> and a note attached to it!<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;By now, they'll all know what you did!&quot;</i><br />
<br />
You can't believe your eyes. This is the Grass Plate! Someone's really trying to pin Trevor's assault on you! How on earth are you going to explain this now?!<br />
<br />
- So... Pietro was right after all?<br />
<br />
The familiar voice startles you. Someone followed you! You turn around to face the person at the door, a young man with roughly your age, blonde hair, clear eyes and fair complexion, who stares at you in disbelief - the newly-elected Champion, Johan.<br />
<br />
Gottfried's student doesn't know what to think, and instinctively goes to grab one of the Pokeballs in his belt. Can you try to reason with the man, or will you engage him?<br />
<br />
What do you do now? </span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> You're banking it all on this phone call. If the person on the other side hangs up you have nothing to go on! You pour your heart out, as well as the contents of your bag, hoping to somehow convince the listener. But even after your emotional outburst, there is no reply from the other side... although the call is still ongoing.<br />
<br />
After what feels like ages, you hear the one on the other side of the line nervously clearing their throat, before finally gracing you with a reply.<br />
<br />
-... Voice of unrest?<br />
<br />
It seems that, more than anything, it was that line that stuck with him. And maybe that's why the mysterious man wrote it on the paper he gave you. Whichever the reason, you have your listener's undivided attention.<br />
<br />
- Didn't know there were any left. Calling from the Pokemon Center, I see... You're in danger; meet me at the old ice-cream factory a block away from where you are. Hurry!<br />
<br />
The more the person speaks, the more it tells of the speaker - a man, with a raspy voice and exhausted tone; you wouldn't be surprised if this was an elder speaking. Whoever he may be, he seems to agree that you're in some sort of peril, and with nothing else to go on, following his instructions is the only lead you have.<br />
<br />
You hurriedly make your way back to the counter on the ground floor, thank Nurse joy and leave the Pokemon Center, hoping nobody will intercept you on the way. Finding the factory is easy enough - a large, abandoned-looking building within walking distance of your current location. Not the most hospitable meeting point you can think of, but at least it's a destination - something you lacked up until now. Even if it's a trap, it's worth the risk, for Oscar and Dana's sake.<br />
<br />
The front door is unlocked, but requires considerable strength to push open. When it gives in, it does so with a very loud creak - if you were hoping to sneak inside undetected, your chances just dropped dramatically. Still, nobody rushes to meet you ,so you might be in the clear for now.<br />
A wide, poorly-lit room filled with long-forgotten, obsolete machinery and dusty crates greets you. Not a sound is heard after the door closes behind you, which is mildly unsettling. Despite most of the equipment being naturally switched off, the area is still incredibly cold, as you would expect if the factory was still running.<br />
<br />
You scout the perimeter, looking for any other doors or staircases that might lead you to the man on the phone. Indeed, a stairway can be seen on the far end of the room, and is seemingly the only way to progress, so you head towards it. As you do however, an incredibly cold feeling washes over you, a sensation even more unpleasant than the previous temperature of the room, as if your blood was freezing in your veins. The area suddenly seems much colder than it did seconds ago, and you soon understand why.<br />
<br />
Materializing out of the minuscule ice crystals in suspension, a creature takes shape between you and the staircase. Sharp edges, a glistening glass-like surface and unreadable eyes meet you in the form of an unmoving

<b>Cryogonal</b>.<br />
<br />
It doesn't make a move, but it's not budging either. There's no way to tell if it'll suddenly become aggressive or if it has no interest in you whatsoever - as it is, the Ice-Type is simply standing idly in your way.<br />
<br />
Do you charge the being preemptively or try to walk around it, hoping it means no harm? If Cryogonal turns hostile, its innate powers can spell certain death for any warm-blooded creature...<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span><br />

<br />
As you keep going, you think back to the green Jellicent at the end of the hall - even if you make it all the way over there, how are you going to get the door open and pass through that one? The deeper in you go, the more this feels like a lost cause. And even so, the ghosts' unrest seems to have nothing to do with you after all... otherwise they'd have jumped you by now, but haven't.

<b>Piplup</b> rubbing its own head!<br />
<br />
You hurry to hush the Water-Type, only to find it does the same to you. Smartass... You notice the Pokemon dropped something when it collided with you, and even through the mist it's easy to identify the object as a very old-looking, rusty can of tuna... how many decades has it been in this ship? And was Piplup seriously considering eating <i>that</i>? No, there's something else...<br />
<br />
The penguin, sticking close to the ground much like you to avoid detection, points to the door where you came in from, signaling it was intending to get over there. Is it taking food to someone else then? Could it be... the bloody door?...<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the layer of mist above you splits apart and the massive head of one of the male Jellicent peers beneath the haze. The commotion, contained as it was, seems to have alerted them after all! It takes a while to realize what's happening, but upon sensing your life force, the Ghost-type lets out an ear-splitting moan! The mist fades and every single Jellicent in the room turns its attention to the two of you, save for the green one who keeps staring at the door at the far end. You're in trouble now!!<br />
<br />
You have to make a choice quickly now... Piplup blew your cover but it didn't mean to; the Water-Type seems even more terrified than you do, and for good reason! It's fight or flight time. Will you try to engage the multiple Jellicent or run away, now that you're square in the middle of the corridor? If you try to flee, which way do you go - the door you intended to reach or the one you came in from? And what about Piplup - will you take it with you or will it just weigh you down? You did have different destinations after all...<br />
<br />
Quick, what do you do?!</span></span> <br />

<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> Fueled by thirst for revenge, Gemini and Mustard assume battle positions with the same fearlessness as if their opponent was a common Scatterbug. Alas, it is not, as you’re about to be reminded...<br />
<br />
Heatran, Lord of the Mountain, stands idly for a while much like his servant had before, when Magmortar was testing the limits of Helga’s strength. Determined to prove how badly they want to topple the “god”, the Weezing duo lets loose a cloud of smoke, but unlike its usual foul smell, this gas has a seemingly soothing property. Heatran looks amused and purposefully inhales deep, sucking in all of the misty substance at once. He laughs audibly, both entertained by Gemini’s attempt and genuinely relaxed after smelling the Sweet Scent – adding that to his massively inflated ego, Heatran isn’t going to be attempting to dodge any time soon.<br />
<br />
His confidence boosted, Gemini takes aim and charges up, creating a huge ball of intense electrical energy in front of him, though it dwarves in comparison to the foe it’s meant to hit. The Poison-Type releases the unstable blast, which spins and twists as it flies through the air; however, with Heatran not looking to evade much of anything, you’re fairly confident it’s going to hit! The God of the Mountain stares at the incoming attack, visibly entertained, and just as the Zap Cannon is about to hit, a <b>Lava Plume</b> shoots up from the ground between Heatran and the orb! The lightning sphere explodes on contact with the magma barrage, and both attacks are nullified… and now it seems the Great One is about to strike back!<br />
<br />
The towering figure lets out a roar that resembles a loud chuckle, and it may well have been. The creature of legend unleashes a burst of burning hot wind from its gaping mouth that blasts Gemini&amp;Mustard and propels them several feet back, while their skin burns from the intense heat but fortunately doesn’t seem to leave any lasting effects. However, the sheer force of the blow is enough to strike the Weezing down and leave the duo barely conscious – such is the power of a Legendary Pokemon!<br />
<br />
Having decided to put Gemini out of his misery, the Great One slowly makes his way towards your downed partner. With what little strength he has left, the Weezing channels his Hidden Power through the platform and strikes Heatran with a materialized pillar of earth that sprouts from the ground, briefly stopping the legend in his tracks but not nearly enough to stop him permanently. Aggravated further by your partners stubbornness, Heatran hastens his pace and lifts one of his immense claws, determined to bury Gemin and Mustard underfoot for their insolence… until something rams into his side and makes him temporarily lose his balance, distracting him!<br />
<br />
Heatran turns to find the Heatmor leader glaring at him in defiance. It seems the anteater, fueled by revenge himself for his fallen comrades, has decided to join in and help you take down the God! Gemini is severely injured but still has some fight left, and you can now issue orders to Heatmor as well – will it be enough to level the playing field?<br />
<br />
What do you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">An epic battle was about to unfold- the god of Mt. Aduro against one of the strongest Pokémon Keith Masters had ever trained. And as the Heatran's first act in this battle... it stood still?<br />
<br />
&quot;Gemini, Mustard, be careful,&quot; Keith advised his Weezing. &quot;He's got something up his sleeve.&quot; He recalled Magmortar doing this as well- standing idly by, welcoming his opponent making the first strike, so inflated was his ego. But an advantage was an advantage- it's not often a Weezing gets the first strike in battle, and this one's heads both agreed that they were gonna press this advantage. &quot;<b>Sweet Scent</b> attack!&quot; Keith ordered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weezing weez,&quot; groaned Gemini and Mustard simultaneously, as they unleashed a cloud of smoke- this one, most unusually for their species, gave off a sweet aroma, as opposed to a foul one. Seemingly amused, Heatran purposely inhaled the Sweet scent, and laughed loudly. Whether he was amused by Gemini's attack, or whether the attack was making him relax that much... maybe even both. What was clear at that moment in any case was, he was distracted, and a distracted opponent was an easy target.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gemini! <b>Zap Cannon</b> now!&quot; Keith commanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weeeeeeez!&quot; bellowed Gemini, a crackling orb of electricity forming before them. Keith smirked- Zap Cannon was a highly powerful Electric move, possibly the best Electric move at their disposal. It was an intense electrical blast that was guaranteed to induce paralysis. Only problem was, it was also incredibly easy to evade. Which is where the Sweet Scent came into play. Heatran was amused, distracted, whatever it was, and any way you slice it, it looked like he wasn't about to dodge it! Keith had to hold back a chuckle, certain that the Electric move would hit, turning the battle in their favor!<br />
<br />
Alas, Keith was abruptly proven wrong. Oh, Heatran didn't even try to dodge the Zap Cannon, true enough- it instead opted to unleash a powerful <b>Lava Plume</b> from the ground before it! The Fire and Electric attacks exploded on contact, each one nullifying the other! Keith's smirk vanished quicker than anything edible within 30 feet of his Swalot.<br />
<br />
Heatran roared loudly, in a manner that almost made it sound like it was chuckling, before acting once more- his next move was a blast of scorching wind from his mouth which blew Gemini and Mustard several feet back. They groaned as the <b>Heat Wave</b> made contact, but fortunately, no burns seemed to form on their purple skin. Nevertheless, to Keith's horror, they fell to the ground, struggling to remain conscious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gemini! Mustard!&quot; Keith cried out. &quot;Use <b>Hidden Power</b>, go!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Weeez.... Weezing...&quot; they groaned in response, but nevertheless, they were able to channel their latent power through the platform, and a pillar of earth erupted out of the ground, striking Heatran directly. It was a direct blow, super effective against the Fire/Steel-type, Keith knew, and yet, Heatran only seemed angrier. And then, to Keith's horror, Heatran stomped forward at a quick pace, and lifted one of his immense claws... and held it directly above the Weezing!<br />
<br />
No. No. Keith was not about to let happen what was about to happen. In the blink of an eye he grabbed Gemini's Poké Ball off his belt. The same ball that saved Gemini's life ten years ago was about to save his life once again-<br />
<br />
&quot;Mor!&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith watched, amazed, as the Heatmor leader rushed forward, this time Tackling Heatran directly, knocking it off-balance. Keith was rather amazed by Heatmor at this point- despite the obvious size and level difference, he still managed to knock the legendary Pokémon off course, make him lose his balance. Heatran turned to look, seeing the Heatmor glaring up defiantly at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wat's Heatmor doin'?&quot; Meowth asked, half amazed, half worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's avenging his fallen comrades,&quot; Keith murmured. &quot;This is just as much his battle as it is Gemini and Mustard's.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well, dis ain't gonna be deir battle fer much longer either, da state dey're in,&quot; Meowth noted, with a glance at the severely weakened Weezing.<br />
<br />
&quot;You let me worry about Gemini and Mustard,&quot; Keith replied, a confident look in his eyes. &quot;Even against a legendary Pokémon, they won't go down that easily. And if Heatmor's in the fight now, might as well see just what he can do,&quot; he added, taking out his Pokédex. He recalled from way back against the pair of Magmar when he scanned the Heatmor pack with his Pokédex that the Heatmor leader was level 8. He remembered distinctly, because all the others ranged from level 1 to level 2 or 3, he remembered vaguely thinking that this Heatmor might've been the leader of the pack even before it became evident.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heatmor's attacks,&quot; droned the device. &quot;Inferno; Hone Claws; Tackle, Incinerate; Lick; Odor Sleuth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dat ain't much,&quot; sighed Meowth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe not much, but it might be enough,&quot; argued Keith. Already, a plan was formulating in his mind. &quot;Gemini, <b>Bide</b>!&quot; he ordered. &quot;Heatmor, use <b>Hone Claws</b>, then follow up with a <b>Lick</b> attack!&quot; he added. This, he figured, was their best shot. Attacking Heatran outright wasn't getting them much of anywhere, so perhaps it would be a better idea to turn his own power against him. And as for Heatmor's orders, Keith figured that the Attack boost would help Lick to inflict just a little more damage, even if the damage wasn't the main reason he ordered the Fire-type to use Lick. He ruled out the Fire attacks right away- when he had scanned Heatran with the Pokédex, he saw that one of its possible Abilities was Flash Fire. No way in hell was he gonna risk making that thing's Fire moves even <i>more </i>powerful!</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> <b><i>IGNORANT FOOL. YOUR INSIGNIFICANT HERD WILL CRUMBLE AT MY FEET!</i></b><br />
<br />
Incensed by the Heatmor's nerve, Heatran turns his attention to the malnourished pack of anteaters, much to their leader's dismay. But he'd been with them up until now, protecting them as best he could, and he couldn't fail them now - not after being forced to witness the demise of some of his brothers in the previous chamber.<br />
Determined to see this through to the end, the Heatmor leader doesn't flinch; he stands up to the gargantuan beast, knowing he stood little chance against a god, but what else can he do?<br />
<br />
Knowing that there's strength in numbers, you feel your hopes somewhat renewed with Heatmor fighting at your side. However, the odds are always stacked against anyone who challenges a Legendary Pokemon...<br />
You have Heatmor sharpen his claws and follow it up with a Lick attack, to which the anteater readily complies. However, little good comes of that combination - no matter how razor-sharp his claws are, he strikes Heatran with his tongue, and while the Great One seems mostly upset by the degrading assault, it seems to barely have an effect on the monster.<br />
<br />
<b><i>AWAY WITH YOU!</i></b><br />
<br />
He summons a glimmering orb of arcane stone energy and hurls the <b>Ancient Power</b> right at Heatmor; the sphere strikes him in the chest and explodes violently, sending him tumbling several feet back, dangerously close to the edge of the platform much like Helga had been earlier.<br />
<br />
<b><i>AND DO NOT THINK I FORGOT YOU, INSOLENT MAGGOTS! I SAVED MY BEST FOR YOU.</i></b><br />
<br />
A loud rumble fills the main chamber. The rock platform starts to shake violently, so much so that you lose your footing and land on your back. As your body meets the stone floor, you immediately notice the ground temperature rising alarmingly fast, at the same time that deep cracks form all over the platform. With a deafening sound, streams of lava erupt from the cracks, essentially shattering the larger platform into dozens of smaller ones, drifitng in the liquid fire of the volcano's heart. The pillars of lava begin to spin and coalesce around Gemin and Mustard, and when they come together, a massive tower of fire shoots upwards in a spectacular spectacle of light and heat... but for you, it's simply a terrifying sight.<br />
<br />
As lava rains back down, fragments of molten rock falling dangerously close to you, you're rapidly confronted with the aftermath of Heatran's ravaging <b>Magma Storm</b> - your Weezing, a burnt heap of flesh, lies completely unconscious in the tiny stone structure that still supports his dead weight. His shallow breathing eases your doubs about the worst possible outcome, but it's obvious Geminin&amp;Mustard can no longer continue, Heatran's move having completely overpowered their Bide attempt - in their already frail condition, withstanding any attack at all would have been a miracle.<br />
<br />
While you struggle to come to terms with Weezing's critical condition, a rumbling noise coming from behind you snaps you back to reality. Briefly turning around out of instinct, you see some of the rocks that blocked off the tunnel behind you - the one where Kyle was buried alive... - come loose and fall over. Then, a familiar creature rears his two heads, one bloodied and unresponsive, the other equally as damaged but still conscious. Kyle's Doduo looks at you and drops the bag it came carrying in its beak, with the last of its remaining strength. Its final effort having paid off, and with one last pleading squeak, the Flying-Type rests its only functioning head on the warm rock and passes away.<br />
<br />
You walk over to the bag Doduo gave its life to bring to you, and recognize it as Kyle's backpack. Dazed by the recent turn of events, but aware of the severity of your situation, common sense tells you to rummage through Kyle's bag - if it was useless, Doduo wouldn't have struggled so much to bring it over. And indeed, despite being almost empty, two items remain at the bottom of the backpack: you retrieve

You turn back to the shattered battlefield, now a collection of small rock islands floating in a sea of magma. At the center of the round chamber is Heatran, the Great One, god of Mt. Aduro and bringer of this calamity. He faces you with a wide grin and poses you a question.<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> <b><i>IGNORANT FOOL. YOUR INSIGNIFICANT HERD WILL CRUMBLE AT MY FEET!</i></b><br />
<br />
Incensed by the Heatmor's nerve, Heatran turns his attention to the malnourished pack of anteaters, much to their leader's dismay. But he'd been with them up until now, protecting them as best he could, and he couldn't fail them now - not after being forced to witness the demise of some of his brothers in the previous chamber.<br />
Determined to see this through to the end, the Heatmor leader doesn't flinch; he stands up to the gargantuan beast, knowing he stood little chance against a god, but what else can he do?<br />
<br />
Knowing that there's strength in numbers, you feel your hopes somewhat renewed with Heatmor fighting at your side. However, the odds are always stacked against anyone who challenges a Legendary Pokemon...<br />
You have Heatmor sharpen his claws and follow it up with a Lick attack, to which the anteater readily complies. However, little good comes of that combination - no matter how razor-sharp his claws are, he strikes Heatran with his tongue, and while the Great One seems mostly upset by the degrading assault, it seems to barely have an effect on the monster.<br />
<br />
<b><i>AWAY WITH YOU!</i></b><br />
<br />
He summons a glimmering orb of arcane stone energy and hurls the <b>Ancient Power</b> right at Heatmor; the sphere strikes him in the chest and explodes violently, sending him tumbling several feet back, dangerously close to the edge of the platform much like Helga had been earlier.<br />
<br />
<b><i>AND DO NOT THINK I FORGOT YOU, INSOLENT MAGGOTS! I SAVED MY BEST FOR YOU.</i></b><br />
<br />
A loud rumble fills the main chamber. The rock platform starts to shake violently, so much so that you lose your footing and land on your back. As your body meets the stone floor, you immediately notice the ground temperature rising alarmingly fast, at the same time that deep cracks form all over the platform. With a deafening sound, streams of lava erupt from the cracks, essentially shattering the larger platform into dozens of smaller ones, drifitng in the liquid fire of the volcano's heart. The pillars of lava begin to spin and coalesce around Gemin and Mustard, and when they come together, a massive tower of fire shoots upwards in a spectacular spectacle of light and heat... but for you, it's simply a terrifying sight.<br />
<br />
As lava rains back down, fragments of molten rock falling dangerously close to you, you're rapidly confronted with the aftermath of Heatran's ravaging <b>Magma Storm</b> - your Weezing, a burnt heap of flesh, lies completely unconscious in the tiny stone structure that still supports his dead weight. His shallow breathing eases your doubs about the worst possible outcome, but it's obvious Geminin&amp;Mustard can no longer continue, Heatran's move having completely overpowered their Bide attempt - in their already frail condition, withstanding any attack at all would have been a miracle.<br />
<br />
While you struggle to come to terms with Weezing's critical condition, a rumbling noise coming from behind you snaps you back to reality. Briefly turning around out of instinct, you see some of the rocks that blocked off the tunnel behind you - the one where Kyle was buried alive... - come loose and fall over. Then, a familiar creature rears his two heads, one bloodied and unresponsive, the other equally as damaged but still conscious. Kyle's Doduo looks at you and drops the bag it came carrying in its beak, with the last of its remaining strength. Its final effort having paid off, and with one last pleading squeak, the Flying-Type rests its only functioning head on the warm rock and passes away.<br />
<br />
You walk over to the bag Doduo gave its life to bring to you, and recognize it as Kyle's backpack. Dazed by the recent turn of events, but aware of the severity of your situation, common sense tells you to rummage through Kyle's bag - if it was useless, Doduo wouldn't have struggled so much to bring it over. And indeed, despite being almost empty, two items remain at the bottom of the backpack: you retrieve

<b>1x Dire Hit</b>!<br />
<br />
You turn back to the shattered battlefield, now a collection of small rock islands floating in a sea of magma. At the center of the round chamber is Heatran, the Great One, god of Mt. Aduro and bringer of this calamity. He faces you with a wide grin and poses you a question.<br />
<br />
<b><i>WHO WILL BE THE FIRST TO GO? THE BELOVED WEEZING YOU TOSSED IN MY PATH TO DIE, THE HEATMOR YOU LED STRAIGHT TO ME, OR YOURSELF FOR DOOMING ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS?!</i></b><br />
<br />
What is your answer?</span></span>

<br />
The Heatran's roaring echoed all around the chamber, but Keith ignored it. The legendary was, he was convinced, just full of hot air, bad pun fully intended. Heatran turned his attention to the Heatmor pack, a fact their leader was quick to notice. In response, however, Helga defiantly stood in front of them. She respected the fact that she wasn't a part of this fight, but if Heatran was going to insist on it, then by Arceus, she would give that overgrown legendary a fight!<br />
<br />
It did not, however, come to that. Heatmor acted quickly, sharpening his claws before delivering a Lick, but the combination attack had almost no effect whatsoever. It seemed to irritate Heatran more than anything else.<br />
<br />
<b><i>AWAY WITH YOU!</i></b><br />
<br />
Keith opened his mouth, wanting to tell Heatmor to dodge it, to hide behind the Weezing who would absorb the Rock move for Bide purposes, to do something, anything, but alas, the opening of said mouth came too late- Heatran unleashed Ancient Power, the super effective move blasting Heatmor backwards, where he skidded to a stop just short of the edge of the platform. Dangerously close, yet still not over the edge. &quot;No! Heatmor!&quot; he exclaimed, but he sighed in relief as Heatmor not only didn't go over the edge, but in fact got right back up. His admiration for the Fire-type grew even further- Heatmor had now taken a direct hit from a super effective Ancient Power from this huge Heatran, and was still ready to fight back.<br />
<br />
<i><b>AND DO NOT THINK I FORGOT YOU, INSOLENT MAGGOTS! I SAVED MY BEST FOR YOU.</b></i><br />
<br />
There it was, Heatran's booming voice again, this time directed at the Weezing, who glared back up at the Fire/Steel-type, intent on turning any attack he could dish out back against him at twice the power. But then, the rock platform started shaking violently. Very violently. Keith lost his footing almost immediately and fell on his back. Mercifully, he was OK and able to get right back up. Decidedly less mercifully, however, was what came next. Keith realized the ground's temperature was rising at an alarming rate, as cracks formed all over the platform. And then, streams of lava shot out from under the rock platform, and the cracks deepened, until the platform split apart, split into dozens of smaller platforms. And then, the lava streams started spinning, started combining into one, all around Gemini and Mustard. And then, there came a massive tower of fire shooting upwards. Keith supposed it would've been more of a spectacular sight were that not his Weezing right in the middle of this... this... what the Distortion World was Heatran even using here?<br />
<br />
&quot;Magma Storm- Heatran's special attack,&quot; the Pokédex piped up by way of an answer. &quot;Heatran attacks with a horrifying maelstrom of fire and magma for massive damage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lava rained back down, Keith making sure to not get hit by the fragments that fell closest to him, and then he saw it- his Weezing, lying burnt and unmoving, on the small stone structure still supporting the Poison-type's weight as it floated on the lava. Keith's mouth fell open, his eyes widening in fear. No. No. It couldn't be, they couldn't be-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dey're still breathin'!&quot; Meowth exclaimed, interrupting Keith's decidedly morbid train of thought.<br />
<br />
Indeed, as Keith looked again, he realized Meowth was right- Gemini and Mustard were still breathing. Shallowly, yes, and they were still burnt and unconscious, but they were still alive, and that alone filled Keith with relief.<br />
<br />
And then, a rumbling noise sounded from behind Keith. On instinct alone, he wheeled around, and as he did, he saw that some of the rocks blocking off the tunnel behind him were shifting, coming loose. Keith's eyes widened- had the reporter and his Doduo survived the cave-in? More rocks came loose, and Keith could see that he was half right. Well, one third right. Kyle's Doduo was rearing up, only one of its heads still among the living, and even then, by the looks of it, not by too much. As the Twin Bird Pokémon dropped the bag it held in its beak, it gave a pleading squeak... and was no more.<br />
<br />
Keith's mind was swimming with emotion, with feelings. The battle was going very badly, very fast; his Weezing, his best hope against this beast, was completely unconscious; and now he had to watch Kyle's Doduo pass away before his eyes, its last act having been to free some backpack from the rubble-<br />
<br />
The backpack. Keith's eyes fell on the bag Doduo had expended its last ounce of strength to bring him. Almost automatically, he stepped forward, approaching the bag, ignoring Meowth's confused looks. He recognized this now- it was Kyle's backpack. And surely, if Doduo had given its life to get this out to Keith, surely there had to be something in there, anything, that could help? Keith's mind swam with images- a Master Ball in which he could catch the Heatran and bury the ball somewhere where it would never be found again, a Champion's ransom in Rare Candies to give Heatmor a boost in power, things like that. Alas, as Keith opened the bag, he found no such quick fix, but nevertheless, his eyes widened at what he did see. There were but two items inside- one was a capsule Keith recognized as a Dire Hit, but the other one... Keith had never actually owned one of these before, but he still recognized the Max Revive on sight instantly. Pokémarts displayed these sorts of items quite prominently, so even if it had never occurred to Keith to actually buy one, he sure as hell knew what they were, and more to the point, what they could do.<br />
<br />
Keith turned back to the shattered, fragmented battlefield before him, to the small rock islands adrift in the lava lake, to the massive Heatran in the very center of it all. Heatran was giving a wide, evil grin as he posed to Keith a question.<br />
<br />
<b><i>WHO WILL BE THE FIRST TO GO? THE BELOVED WEEZING YOU TOSSED IN MY PATH TO DIE, THE HEATMOR YOU LED STRAIGHT TO ME, OR YOURSELF FOR DOOMING ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS?!</i></b><br />
<br />
Had that question been posed to Keith ten seconds earlier, he'd have felt helpless, he wouldn't have known what to say. But now... now that Doduo's last act had been to give Keith a few items that would definitely help the situation, Keith felt re-energized, almost as though he himself had had a Max Revive used on him, on his determination, on his spirit.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to know who will be the first to go, Heatran?&quot; Keith demanded, stepping forward, not even giving the beast the satisfaction of referring to him as &quot;the great one&quot;. His voice, once again, was ominously calm, the surest sign of all that he was beyond pissed. &quot;You really want to know? Because I know exactly who will be the first to go. But it's not going to be the beloved Weezing who fought you bravely. It won't be the Heatmor I still intend to save from your tyrannical whims, and it will most certainly not be me. No, the first to go will be you, Heatran,&quot; he said defiantly. &quot;For subjecting this island to your reign of terror, for turning its inhabitants against one another, for ending innocent lives on mere whims, and for trying to kill my Weezing,&quot; he concluded. And with that, he sprang into action, pulling the items out of Kyle's backpack. He hastened to administer the Max Revive to his Weezing, and as the revitalized Poison-type rose back up into the air, Keith administered the Dire Hit to the Heatmor leader.<br />
<br />
<i>Ahh, that's better,</i> a telepathic voice sounded in Keith's head. <i>OK, we can do this!</i> Meanwhile, the Dire Hit was surely doing its work on Heatmor, heightening its senses, making it more capable of seeking out and striking weak spots.<br />
<br />
Keith grinned, his mind working furiously. Doduo had given them a second chance at this, he wasn't about to blow it! Now, only two attacks were needed to take Gemini and Mustard out before, so Bide was sounding less and less like a good idea at this point. No, he realized, he was going to have to rely on the Weezing's own power, and he realized that he was OK with that. He believed in Gemini and Mustard. He believed in his Weezing.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK!&quot; Keith exclaimed. &quot;Heatmor, use <b>Lick</b>, then use your <b>Tackle</b> attack, then follow up with another <b>Lick</b>! And if you see a Fire move coming Gemini's way, intercept it! Gemini, use <b>Hidden Power</b>, then zap Heatran with <b>Thunderbolt</b>, and follow up with <b>Hidden Power</b> once again! And if it looks like Heatmor's about to fall in the lava, give him a lift!&quot; He figured the Heatmor couldn't weigh more than he did, maybe even a little less than him, so he was confident that if an emergency arose, Gemini and Mustard would at least be able to stop Heatmor from falling in the lava. And as for Heatmor, Keith vividly recalled that this one was the only one of the bunch with Flash Fire, so any Fire attacks he'd intercept would have no effect whatsoever. Most of all, he felt confident once more- they were about to turn this fight around!</span></span><br />

<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> You're banking it all on this phone call. If the person on the other side hangs up you have nothing to go on! You pour your heart out, as well as the contents of your bag, hoping to somehow convince the listener. But even after your emotional outburst, there is no reply from the other side... although the call is still ongoing.<br />
<br />
After what feels like ages, you hear the one on the other side of the line nervously clearing their throat, before finally gracing you with a reply.<br />
<br />
-... Voice of unrest?<br />
<br />
It seems that, more than anything, it was that line that stuck with him. And maybe that's why the mysterious man wrote it on the paper he gave you. Whichever the reason, you have your listener's undivided attention.<br />
<br />
- Didn't know there were any left. Calling from the Pokemon Center, I see... You're in danger; meet me at the old ice-cream factory a block away from where you are. Hurry!<br />
<br />
The more the person speaks, the more it tells of the speaker - a man, with a raspy voice and exhausted tone; you wouldn't be surprised if this was an elder speaking. Whoever he may be, he seems to agree that you're in some sort of peril, and with nothing else to go on, following his instructions is the only lead you have.<br />
<br />
You hurriedly make your way back to the counter on the ground floor, thank Nurse joy and leave the Pokemon Center, hoping nobody will intercept you on the way. Finding the factory is easy enough - a large, abandoned-looking building within walking distance of your current location. Not the most hospitable meeting point you can think of, but at least it's a destination - something you lacked up until now. Even if it's a trap, it's worth the risk, for Oscar and Dana's sake.<br />
<br />
The front door is unlocked, but requires considerable strength to push open. When it gives in, it does so with a very loud creak - if you were hoping to sneak inside undetected, your chances just dropped dramatically. Still, nobody rushes to meet you ,so you might be in the clear for now.<br />
A wide, poorly-lit room filled with long-forgotten, obsolete machinery and dusty crates greets you. Not a sound is heard after the door closes behind you, which is mildly unsettling. Despite most of the equipment being naturally switched off, the area is still incredibly cold, as you would expect if the factory was still running.<br />
<br />
You scout the perimeter, looking for any other doors or staircases that might lead you to the man on the phone. Indeed, a stairway can be seen on the far end of the room, and is seemingly the only way to progress, so you head towards it. As you do however, an incredibly cold feeling washes over you, a sensation even more unpleasant than the previous temperature of the room, as if your blood was freezing in your veins. The area suddenly seems much colder than it did seconds ago, and you soon understand why.<br />
<br />
Materializing out of the minuscule ice crystals in suspension, a creature takes shape between you and the staircase. Sharp edges, a glistening glass-like surface and unreadable eyes meet you in the form of an unmoving

<b>Cryogonal</b>.<br />
<br />
It doesn't make a move, but it's not budging either. There's no way to tell if it'll suddenly become aggressive or if it has no interest in you whatsoever - as it is, the Ice-Type is simply standing idly in your way.<br />
<br />
Do you charge the being preemptively or try to walk around it, hoping it means no harm? If Cryogonal turns hostile, its innate powers can spell certain death for any warm-blooded creature...<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver">Silence filled the room after Liza's emotional plea, though a bit embarrassed a tear still managed to form and drop from one of her eyes as she quickly wiped it away waiting for a response from the listener.<br />
<br />
It felt like an eternity...as she shook her head almost admitting defeat, <i>This was a mistake</i> she initially thought, gathering up her belongings, a snivel escaping her as she thought about making her way out, when the voice on the other side suddenly stopped her.<br />
<br />
“...Voice of unrest?” It said, “Didn't know there were any left. Calling from the Pokemon Center, I see... You're in danger; meet me at the old ice-cream factory a block away from where you are. Hurry!”<br />
<br />
Her face lit up when she was given a meeting place. Finally, she would be able to get to the bottom of who these people were, what they wanted and why they were doing this!<br />
<br />
Switching the telecom off, Liza threw her bag over her shoulder before rushing out of the room like a Tauros on a mission. She skipped the elevator she had originally taken to get up to the upper floor and jumped down a set of stairs before stopping by the counter, returning the keycard to the Nurse Joy and thanking her, exiting the building all together.<br />
<br />
The trainer thought about her Litwick still in the Nurse's care, hoping Lucy was doing okay...but Liza didn't have to time to wait, she would just have to ask about her Pokemon's condition once she got back.<br />
<br />
With adrenaline pumping in her veins, Liza ran down the block hoping to see anything resembling an old abandon- Bingo! Spotting it up ahead, the Lass ran towards it, keeping herself ever vigilant. With a seemingly uneventful trip, she reached her destination.<br />
<br />
The old abandon ice cream factory...it looked to be deserted, oh- if only her Vanillite and Snover saw the building that made many Pokemon and people happy with a cold, creamy, delicious treat; would they look sorrowfully at it, or would they look at it as it was, <i>at least it was here!</i><br />
<br />
Her hopes of sneaking in were quickly foiled by the large door she had entered from, creaking so loudly it made her feel disappointed. But even with that, nobody greeted her at the front...which meant either no one was here yet and no was lying in wait...of course that could of easily just been some wishful thinking on her part.<br />
<br />
Walking inside, the temperature inside was much different then it was outside. She began to shake slightly and even though it felt like it was below freezing she had to wonder how a place that was said to be abandon managed to stay so cool...thoughts of her having walked inside a trap were beginning to seem more real and if she had just walked into a trap, she was ready to make her stand right here.<br />
<br />
Around her, she noticed old out dated machinery, and as she looked for a place in which her contact might of been she came to find a stairway leading to an area of the facility on the other side of the room. Thinking that, that might of been a good place to start her search, she was suddenly stopped by a cold chill that seemed to pass right through her. <br />
<br />
Her jacket proved useless, as she was stopped died cold, and a figure emerged from out of thin air. Ice crystals coming together to form, a Cryogonal standing in front of her path.<br />
<br />
She couldn't tell however if it blocking her path because she was trespassing on it's territory (which would explain the constant cold) or if it might been trying to warn her...either way, she needed to get past it to move on.<br />
<br />
“H-hhhhhh-hi-hiiiiiii, there.” Liza stuttered to say, as the warm jacket she had been wearing didn't seem to provide much of a form of protection like it did moments ago...,“I-III can see, wwwwhhhy your blocking my path, yyyyyoooouuu probably think I'm trespassing.” Her teeth began to chatter now, while she began to rub her hands together for warmth, her breath visible in the air as she spoke, “I can understand that. Really. I didn't mean to come in like a raging Tauros making all that noise earlier, there was jusssssstttttt something I needed to do here. So, if you could...pleasssse let me pass, I can be on my way.” The trainer pleaded, but the Lass wasn't stupid. It's true part of her thought that this Cryogonal seemed to be just using this abandon ice cream factory as a home in these hot summer days and nights but something didn't feel right. The way this Pokemon presented itself in front of her...could there be someone else here? Besides the man she wanted to meet? Would her fears of the phone call being tapped be true? Had someone purposely not intervened on the way here to get her away from the crowds, so there wouldn't be any witnesses?<br />
<br />
If this Pokemon turned hostile, she knew what she had to do. She didn't know how long her contact would wait or worse, what if they were in terrible trouble and she was here wasting her time.<br />
<br />
She needed to think of a counter measure...<br />
<br />
It was common knowledge that a pure Ice Type like Cryogonal was weak to Fighting, Steel, Rock, and Fire type moves.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately she didn't have either of the first three types, so that was out. But Fire she had plenty of...the problem was though...in such a space as the one she was in, in the climate she was experiencing right now, Fire types would probably still have a hard time winning any battle...She had only remembered watching her Charmander's Life Force grow dim once and she wasn't about to risk her Charizard so early on. No. What she needed was a Pokemon that could gain an advantage but still be able to take what this Pokemon had in store.<br />
<br />
But before the Lass could think of a strategy to combat the cold, one of the Pokeballs in her pocket began to shake and out of nowhere her loyal pup Growlithe popped out and stood in between her and the ominous Ice Type watching her.<br />
<br />
“Leo! What are you doing out of your Pokeball?”<br />
<br />
“Growlithe!” He barked, turning his head towards her slightly, as if saying ‘I got this.’<br />
<br />
She was a little hesitant, originally having only wanted to talk her way out of this...but she was running out of time. Maybe fighting would be a better option.<br />
<br />
“Cryogonal. I'm sorry for my Pokemon's behavior but if he shot of his Pokeball it's because he feels something's off. Of course it could always just be his overprotective side coming out.”<br />
<br />
<i>If there's no way to avoid this, a quick strategy like- a <b>Howl</b>, an <b>Iron Tail</b> and an <b>Ember</b> attack should give us a clear advantage.</i> Coming to terms that she might have to fight her way out of this she came up with a plan, but how long would her contact wait? <br />
<br />
“Let us pass or else.”<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px">Ion Island is made of almost entirely iron ore and magnetic substances that conduct electricity easily. It is said that long ago, a huge battle which pitted two powerful electric Pokemon electrically charged the island, causing most Pokemon that lived here to die. However, electric types thrive here, and recently people have learned how to use the electricity to their own use. <br />
<b><span style="color: yellow">Eletron Plant </span></b>- A large power plant at the center of the island, large metal rods are drilled into the ground, causing the electricity to flow up into and through large thick wires that go along the bottom of the sea the entire way to Brine Island, and power Salin City. Electric Pokemon hang around here, as well as scientists who will often ask for help in finding something.</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: yellow">&quot;May I see your trainer card again, please?&quot; the frustrated trainer grabbed more of his documents from his backpack and showed it to the border officer. Security was heightened recently in Cascadia and nearby regions due to reports of increased activity of gangsters arriving from Hoenn. For Rayzen's case, the homebase of his employer coincides almost exactly with the locations of Team Magma hotspots in the database. It had been almost 2 hours since he got off the ship, and he was still at the port of entry. &quot;Well, you seem to have all the documentation and your identity was verified but we will watch you closely,&quot; the suspicious guardian told the trainer while bashfully giving hand symbols pointing at their eyes.<br />
<br />
Upon arrival at Ion island, Rayzen got a brief look at the route signboard, but he already knew exactly where he wanted to travel. &quot;Go, Smartphone!&quot; Rayzen sent out his claydol. After that happened, the claydol blinked its many eyes and his pokegear hummed a quick 8-bit chime tune. &quot;Alright, Smartphone. Be careful while we trod through the mud,&quot; the trainer advised his pokemon while confidently showing his movement with his sleak trekking shoes. The claydol seemingly did not care as it just levitated itself across rods and wires on the path. The trainer and his claydol then walked together to the Eletron Plant.</span></div>

<span style="color: darkorange"><i><span style="font-size: 12px">Ruin Island</span></i></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px">One of the more interesting areas of the archipelago, Ruin Island is also the most mysterious. Giant stone statues and buildings, eroded by time, stand in the overgrowing vegetation of the area, providing a home to many Pokemon, especially those who prefer dark, enclosed spaces. Studies done by researches show that this island was once under water, or flooded, or something. At the very least, they have established that it is the oldest of the areas. An eerie feel of foreboding rushes over one the second they set forth on the land, provoking myths and legends...<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: darkorange">Ordial Shrine </span></b>- Dubbed as so by explorers, the Ordial Shrine is, or was, at least, a stone shrine used by the ancient peoples to honor their gods. The rock is stained red with the blood of those sacrificed for the ancients' rituals.</span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: darkorange"><span style="font-size: 9px">The silence of the past is broken by the heavy footsteps of combat boots, slamming against the eroded stone path meandering toward the Ordial Shrine - the path itself seems to shudder under the weight of the young woman's furious stride, as if it may crumble not simply from age, but from the sheer force of will the young woman exerts. The woman's long, dark hair swishes from side to side behind her like a black war banner, her plaid skirt riding up her fast-moving legs, beginning to reveal the edge of the Umbreon boxers that lurk underneath. The young woman begins to reach with black-painted nails to adjust the wayward fabric, but seems in too great of a hurry to even bother. Without a sound, her Pokemon companion flaps his violet wings beside her, his yellow eyes scanning the area carefully. The old hunter's expression seems just as alert for predators as he is for prey. The trainer's seemingly relentless push forward is ceased at the sight of the temple entrance, which seems to inspire even in this determined creature and her winged partner a moment's hesitation. Turning to the Crobat, she narrows her eyes slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can still sense enough to know you think I am afraid, Sangre,&quot; the young woman snarls. &quot;I insist you set those beliefs aside immediately.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Crobat shakes his head, and mutters a few words in Pokemon language. She pauses for a moment, a bit of a frustrated look on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damned- ugh, it is so hard to understand you these days. Repeat, more slowly.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Crobat merely turns away, his body drifting such to create distance between himself and the young woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see. Whatever you said was not something you wanted me to hear, is that it?&quot; The young woman smirks a bit. The poison type pauses a moment and turns back to the young woman, a few slow, measured utterances escaping his lips. The young woman practically growls in frustration.<br />
<br />
&quot;'No need for anger, Coselle.' Is that what you have to say? Do I have that right? Oh, it is <i>so</i> easy for you-&quot; before she finishes her sentence, she makes note of Sangre's narrowed eyes, and shakes her head, releasing her vicious tone with a small sigh. &quot;...Perhaps you are correct.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking up at the shrine, the young woman takes a resolute step forward. The Crobat hangs back. A few more soft cries, though their tone seems oddly concerned for such a gruff-looking creature.<br />
<br />
&quot;To tell you the truth, old friend... I cannot say. I do not know if now, I seek a means to more power... or a means to redemption. I do not know what I seek.&quot; The young woman grins. &quot;I only know that I am called here. Of that much, I am certain.&quot; The young woman tilts her head back, admiring the sunset-streaked sky. She had made it to the ruins just before nightfall... It stood to reason that the darker hours would compel stronger forces in a location this thick with shadow, both within its walls and deep within its mysterious stone heart. For a moment, she seems to consider taking a step back, to return to where her companion now hovered, silently. The Crobat seems about to say something, but appears to think better of it. The dark-haired woman marches resolutely into the temple, and the bat-like creature merely glides on in behind her.<br />

<br />
<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> <i>((A word of caution - Magma Storm shattered the platform into several smaller ones so neither walking towards Gemini nor Heatmor should work, but then again, I didn't specify if you were in the same rock as your Pokemon. Let's assume you tossed the items and it's all good <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite7" alt=":p" title="Stick Out Tongue    :p" data-shortname=":p" />))</i><br />
<br />
Your confidence renewed thanks to Kyle and Doduo's parting gift, you revive Gemini back to full health and toss the Dire Hit booster over to Heatmor.<br />
<br />
<b><i>AN ENTERTAINING EFFORT... BUT YOU WILL FIND YOUR HUMAN FRIEND TO BE AS USELESS IN DEATH AS HE WAS IN LIFE!</i></b><br />
<br />
Heatran dashes forward straight at Gemini, each step causing the crater to shake; the beast doesn't care whether he steps on rock or lava, unaffected by either, and focused only on grinding your Weezing to dust. It seems his goal of eliminating the Heatmor he considers unfitting for his realm has taken a temporary backseat in favor of annihilating you and your partner for interfering in his affairs.<br />
<br />
With their vigor renewed, Gemini and Mustard face the incoming threat head on. They focus their latent energy and shape it into myriad dirt-colored spheres, which are hurled straight at Heatran! His massive size ensures all projectiles hit, each exploding like a bullet of sand on contact, causing the Great One to wince but unfortunately not powerful enough to stop the giant's momentum.<br />
The foe rams into Gemini with his <b>Iron Head</b>, an impact so severe that the Weezing goes flying back and crashes into the wall of the main chamber, where he remains lodged in a hole on the rock surface!<br />
<br />
<b><i>AS FOR YOU... I WILL ERASE YOU FROM MY MOUNTAIN ONCE AND FOR ALL.</i></b><br />
<br />
With the Weezing out of the way, Heatran turns to face the Heatmor pack once again. The leader has managed to roll away from the edge, invigorated by the Dire Hit boost, but is still fighting to get to his feet whn the Legendary Pokemon charges. Heatran looks to ram Heatmor into the lava once and for all with another Iron Head, but before making contact, the Great One is struck from behind with a bolt of lightning that causes him to stop in his tracks, somewhat dazed and definitely enraged. He turns to face the still-stuck Weezing with a murderous stare.<br />
<br />
<b><i>DO NONE OF YOU KNOW YOUR PLACE?! FINE, YOU WILL JOIN THE CORPSES OF YOUR FRIENDS IN THE TUNNEL!</i></b><br />
<br />
Heatran opens his gaping maw and releases a stream of spiraling flames, a massive <b>Fire Spin</b> that threatens to incinerate the rock-bound Weezing. In their current predicament, Gemini and Mustard do resemble the many dead Weezing that lined the walls of that tunnel from before... and try as you may, you can't erase that picture from your head, especially now that your friend is seconds away rom being burned to the core once again!<br />
<br />
However, at the last possible moment, Heatmor leaps in and shields Gemini with his body, allowing the Fire Spin to crash into him! The flames are quick to subside, absorbed by Heatmor's special Ability, and now it's time for the anteater to fight back as he can. Drawing in close, fearlessly, he runs his harsh tongue across the Great One's iron helmet; and although he is immediately brushed away, it seems as if Heatmor's special corrosive saliva seeps into a crack in the armor deep enough to numb Heatran's muscles!<br />
<br />
<b><i>Wh... WHAT IS THIS? WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!</i></b><br />
<br />
Grinning at his hunter's frustration, Heatmor jumps back into action and rams his body into Heatran's leg; the damage is minimal, but the mythical creature seems even more aggravated. So much so that, with a mighty roar, the Mountain God summons a pillar of rock to rise with his <b>Earth Power</b>, striking Heatmor so hard that the anteater almost passes out from the hit. The smaller Fire-Type crashes down hard, unable to get back up and strike back for the moment, but his incredible willpower prevents him from fainting.<br />
<br />
When Heatran shifts his attention back to Gemini and Mustard, he assumes a stance very similar to that which heralded the coming of the first Magma Storm. Your Weezing remains stuck to the rock wall and can only watch helplessly... but when the Great One goes to summon the maelstrom, he seems freeze in place temporarily, unable to move!<br />
<br />
Seizing his opportunity, Gemini unleashes a second barrage of Ground Hidden Power orbs that hit home hard, crashing into the foe's body with impressive force. And for the first time since the start of the bout... Heatran seems to falter!<br />
<br />
His footing is weaker, his breathing slightly heavier, and his movements hampered by the nagging paralysis of Heatmor's lick.<br />
However, Gemini is still stuck and the anteater is on the verge of collapse... can you find a way to capitalize? Is this duo enough to take down such a mighty beast?</span></span> <br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> Conflicted between engaging the motionless Cryogonal or walk around it, you weigh your options should things go south for you. But as is often the case between humans and their loyal Pokemon, one of your partners simplifies your decision making by jumping into action on his own! Leo seems willing to fight, barking menacingly at a Pokemon who unfortunately cannot feel fear.<br />
<br />
The Ice-Type hovers in place, glimmering ice crystals forming and falling all around it in a pretty sight to behold. How would such a Pokemon fair in Beauty Contests, you find yourself wondering? But isn't the time for such musings. The potential threat before you is very real, and letting your guard down could be a mistake.<br />
The living crystal has no apparent intentions of picking a fight, but at the sight of the belligerent Leo eyeing it aggressively, the Cryogonal finally reacts. Whether because it was its intention all along, or perhaps out of simple survival instinct, the Ice-Type raises one of his chains and <b>Slash</b>es Leo's torso with it!<br />
<br />
As if reading your mind, the Growlithe fights back with a clear plan. The pup Howls audibly, definitively ensuring you won't go by unnoticed by anyone inside the abandoned building, and pumps himself up in the process. He proceeds to channel Steel energy into his tail and striking his foe with it after leaping into an impressive somersault; the force of the blow causes the living crystals to shatter into several pieces, some of which Leo is quick to melt down with a stream of Embers.<br />
<br />
Your Growlithe's offensive display is an impressive display of battle prowess for such a young cub. The enemy seems to have been quickly disposed of... until the ice fragments and pools of liquid begin to coalesce and Cryogonal <b>Recover</b>s its previous form without a hint of a flaw in its crystalline structure! Emotionless but with a clear purpose now, it wraps its crystal chains around Leo and <b>Bind</b>s him helplessly, constricting the poor Growlithe in its tight grip while the shards dig into his flesh.<br />
<br />
The situation has just taken a turn for the worse - what do you do now?!</span></span><br />

<b><u>Eletron Plant</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>Rayzen</u>:</u></b> <i>((Thanks for giving Cascadia a shot! Hope you have fun!))</i><br />
<br />
Many things can be said about Ion Island. How peculiar its charged atmosphere feels, how picturesque the sights around Iridi Beach are, how rich its history is. But no one will ever say that the outskirts of the Eletron Plant are pretty.<br />
<br />
A largely industrial area, the Plant has the admittedly-easy task of providing electrical power to Brine Island's Salin City - electricity which isn't exactly hard to get around these parts. But as you and the Claydol codenamed Smartphone approach the main entrance of the complex, something seems... off. Those people at the door are <i>way</i> too many for a tourist group - and who would ever hold an expedition to this part of the island anyway?<br />
Upon closer inspection, the men near the entrance - fifteen in total, you notice - are all wearing identical dark-blue uniforms. These are all police officers...<br />
<br />
- Halt! Restricted access beyond this point. There is a situation in the Power Plant.<br />
<br />
One of the men has come rushing to stop you. He seems to be in his fifties, with an exasperated look on his face that reads &quot;I'm getting too old for this&quot;. Whatever happened inside the Eletron Plant, it seems that the authorities are still struggling to handle it...<br />
<br />
- I'm sorry sir, but there's been an accident in the Plant. We can't risk anyone going inside except for aid in ongoing investigations. There's... been a casualty. Unless you're an experienced Trainer and you're willing to help, we can't let you past this point.<br />
<br />
The police are clearly grasping at straws here. But an actual casualty? It's no wonder they look so concerned - it's easy to imagine accidents happening in such a place, but one would expect general safety measures to be in place to protect the Power Plant workers. If someone died all the same, either protocol was breached or there's something else to this story...<br />
<br />
Are you sure you want to get involved, or do you turn back and choose another destination on Ion Island to explore? </span></span><br />

Hope you enjoy yourself and that I can live up to your standards <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite2" alt=";)" title="Wink    ;)" data-shortname=";)" /> ))</i><br />
<br />
Without really knowing why, you have been drawn to Ruin Island, more specifically the old site of worship known as Ordial Shrine. The deities honored within its halls are foreign to you, but the oppressive aura that surrounds the structure itself is a testament to the old forces that were once present. Sangre seems to sense it as well, and is visibly reluctant to go any further, but does so at your insistence – after all, this journey is about redemption… or so you tell yourself.<br />
<br />
Other temples around Ruin Island were designed to keep people out – impossibly-heavy stone doors bar the entrance to most religious sites. Ordial Shrine is quite possibly unique in that it has no gates; the once-elaborately sculpted stone arch welcomes all those who wish to venture into the heart of the building… almost beckoning them to. Although the entire structure has been called Ordial Shrine for generations, the shrine itself is concealed within the depths of the temple, and rumored to be covered in the blood of countless sacrifices. If there is any truth to those tales, you can’t tell, but if fate wills it, you might just find out.<br />
<br />
The arch leads to a flight of downwards stairs which opens into a wide square hall. Hundreds of Litwick sleep on large chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, and lend the place an eerie purple lighting. And despite all the flames that light up the main hall, it feels cold. So very cold.<br />
You run your eyes through the sprawling room, taking in the details of ancient architecture – regardless of how you feel about art, there is no denying this is an incredible piece of work. Four huge pillars, shaped like Origin Giratina, coil upwards and sustain the full weight of the ceiling. The walls are lined with faded gravures, depicting millennia-old rituals too eroded to make sense of. There are four statues depicting strange creatures on each edge of the room – certainly not human effigies, although if they depict Pokemon, their species were lost in time and do not feature in any known PokeDex records.<br />
<br />
-	They expected Abel, and it’s Cain who comes! What a lovely little twist.<br />
<br />
A deep, soothing male voice snaps you out of your reverie. Instinctively shifting your gaze to the source of the sound, you find a middle-aged man sitting comfortably against one of the pillars, absent-mindedly staring at the Litwick above, with a smile plastered on his face. His outfit is as strange as his very presence here – a short-sleeved white shirt with a pattern of crimson roses, light-brown pants, a white fedora and black flip-flops. As he finishes his sentence, he starts humming a strange tune to himself, easily audible from where you stand in the otherwise complete silence of the chamber. Finally, he tilts his head slightly and stares at you with clear blue eyes.<br />
<br />
-	Hey there Pollux. I’m afraid Zeus is gone… how is Castor doing?<br />
<br />
His tone is both amused and strangely teasing. He doesn’t seem nearly as interested in your response as he is in your immediate reaction, and goes on with his musings.<br />
<br />
-	Strange days in the world out there. Everyone shouting “bloody murder”… if I was in their place, I’d fear the ones that murder without shouting. But what do I know, right?<br />
<br />
He casually looks over to another stone arch, similar to the one you just crossed, on the far end of the room. You notice it lacks a door of any kind as well…<br />
<br />
-	Fun times ahead. Tell me, which one of you likes blood the most? Oh, I guess I’ll find out soon enough…<br />
<br />
A strange man to be sure, and some of things he says are unsettling, nevermind the way he says them. The temple seems to invite explorers to delve as far as they want to go, and there’s a lot of ground to cover ahead. Do you approach the misplaced stranger, or will you avoid his apparent craziness and press onward?</span></span></div>

<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> <i>((A word of caution - Magma Storm shattered the platform into several smaller ones so neither walking towards Gemini nor Heatmor should work, but then again, I didn't specify if you were in the same rock as your Pokemon. Let's assume you tossed the items and it's all good <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite7" alt=":p" title="Stick Out Tongue    :p" data-shortname=":p" />))</i><br />
<br />
Your confidence renewed thanks to Kyle and Doduo's parting gift, you revive Gemini back to full health and toss the Dire Hit booster over to Heatmor.<br />
<br />
<b><i>AN ENTERTAINING EFFORT... BUT YOU WILL FIND YOUR HUMAN FRIEND TO BE AS USELESS IN DEATH AS HE WAS IN LIFE!</i></b><br />
<br />
Heatran dashes forward straight at Gemini, each step causing the crater to shake; the beast doesn't care whether he steps on rock or lava, unaffected by either, and focused only on grinding your Weezing to dust. It seems his goal of eliminating the Heatmor he considers unfitting for his realm has taken a temporary backseat in favor of annihilating you and your partner for interfering in his affairs.<br />
<br />
With their vigor renewed, Gemini and Mustard face the incoming threat head on. They focus their latent energy and shape it into myriad dirt-colored spheres, which are hurled straight at Heatran! His massive size ensures all projectiles hit, each exploding like a bullet of sand on contact, causing the Great One to wince but unfortunately not powerful enough to stop the giant's momentum.<br />
The foe rams into Gemini with his <b>Iron Head</b>, an impact so severe that the Weezing goes flying back and crashes into the wall of the main chamber, where he remains lodged in a hole on the rock surface!<br />
<br />
<b><i>AS FOR YOU... I WILL ERASE YOU FROM MY MOUNTAIN ONCE AND FOR ALL.</i></b><br />
<br />
With the Weezing out of the way, Heatran turns to face the Heatmor pack once again. The leader has managed to roll away from the edge, invigorated by the Dire Hit boost, but is still fighting to get to his feet whn the Legendary Pokemon charges. Heatran looks to ram Heatmor into the lava once and for all with another Iron Head, but before making contact, the Great One is struck from behind with a bolt of lightning that causes him to stop in his tracks, somewhat dazed and definitely enraged. He turns to face the still-stuck Weezing with a murderous stare.<br />
<br />
<b><i>DO NONE OF YOU KNOW YOUR PLACE?! FINE, YOU WILL JOIN THE CORPSES OF YOUR FRIENDS IN THE TUNNEL!</i></b><br />
<br />
Heatran opens his gaping maw and releases a stream of spiraling flames, a massive <b>Fire Spin</b> that threatens to incinerate the rock-bound Weezing. In their current predicament, Gemini and Mustard do resemble the many dead Weezing that lined the walls of that tunnel from before... and try as you may, you can't erase that picture from your head, especially now that your friend is seconds away rom being burned to the core once again!<br />
<br />
However, at the last possible moment, Heatmor leaps in and shields Gemini with his body, allowing the Fire Spin to crash into him! The flames are quick to subside, absorbed by Heatmor's special Ability, and now it's time for the anteater to fight back as he can. Drawing in close, fearlessly, he runs his harsh tongue across the Great One's iron helmet; and although he is immediately brushed away, it seems as if Heatmor's special corrosive saliva seeps into a crack in the armor deep enough to numb Heatran's muscles!<br />
<br />
<b><i>Wh... WHAT IS THIS? WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!</i></b><br />
<br />
Grinning at his hunter's frustration, Heatmor jumps back into action and rams his body into Heatran's leg; the damage is minimal, but the mythical creature seems even more aggravated. So much so that, with a mighty roar, the Mountain God summons a pillar of rock to rise with his <b>Earth Power</b>, striking Heatmor so hard that the anteater almost passes out from the hit. The smaller Fire-Type crashes down hard, unable to get back up and strike back for the moment, but his incredible willpower prevents him from fainting.<br />
<br />
When Heatran shifts his attention back to Gemini and Mustard, he assumes a stance very similar to that which heralded the coming of the first Magma Storm. Your Weezing remains stuck to the rock wall and can only watch helplessly... but when the Great One goes to summon the maelstrom, he seems freeze in place temporarily, unable to move!<br />
<br />
Seizing his opportunity, Gemini unleashes a second barrage of Ground Hidden Power orbs that hit home hard, crashing into the foe's body with impressive force. And for the first time since the start of the bout... Heatran seems to falter!<br />
<br />
His footing is weaker, his breathing slightly heavier, and his movements hampered by the nagging paralysis of Heatmor's lick.<br />
However, Gemini is still stuck and the anteater is on the verge of collapse... can you find a way to capitalize? Is this duo enough to take down such a mighty beast?</span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote>OOC: Ah, OK- yeah, true enough, I was picturing it as though Gemini/Mustard and Heatmor were on the same rock as Keith, without realizing you never specified either way. I'll try to be more careful, thanks for the heads-up.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">Once Keith had made use of the items Doduo had given its life to provide him with, Heatran's booming voice sounded again.<br />
<br />
<b><i>AN ENTERTAINING EFFORT... BUT YOU WILL FIND YOUR HUMAN FRIEND TO BE AS USELESS IN DEATH AS HE WAS IN LIFE!</i></b><br />
<br />
With that, the Fire/Steel-type charged forward, shaking the large chamber of the volcano with each step, not giving a Raticate's ass whether he stepped on rock or magma, with only one goal apparently in mind- it seemed, Keith realized, that Heatran's higher priority at the moment, was annihilating the Poison-type Trainer and his faithful starter, as punishment for meddling in his affairs. But the Weezing was ready, and so was Keith. &quot;Use Hidden Power!&quot; Keith bellowed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weeeeez!&quot; replied both Gemini and Mustard simultaneously, the Weezing firing off multiple spheres of Ground energy. The supremely super effective move met its mark, but while Heatran winced, his momentum was unaffected. And then came the Iron Head, an impact so harsh that it made <i>Keith</i> flinch despite him not even being the attack's target. The powerful blow sent the Poison Gas Pokémon flying backwards, crashing into the wall, and getting lodged into a hole in the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gemini! Mustard!&quot; Keith cried out.<br />
<br />
<i>We're OK,</i> a reassuring yet pained telepathic voice sounded in Keith's head. <i>But that Iron Head was no picnic... Ow...</i><br />
<br />
<b><i>AS FOR YOU... I WILL ERASE YOU FROM MY MOUNTAIN ONCE AND FOR ALL.</i></b><br />
<br />
Keith's eyes widened in horror- with the Weezing dealt with for the time being, Heatran turned to face the Heatmor pack, the leader still ready to fight. He charged forward, another Iron Head likely to be his intent. But as Keith managed to exchange glances with his Weezing's heads, he knew they were still good to go. &quot;Like hell you will!&quot; Keith shouted to the Heatran. &quot;Now! Gemini, Thunderbolt him!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Weezing WEEEEEEZ!&quot; bellowed the Weezing- despite still being stuck, they blasted Heatran with a powerful bolt of lightning. As Keith had hoped, Heatran stopped in his tracks from the attack, dazed. As Keith had not hoped, however, Heatran was also enraged- he turned back to glare at the Weezing.<br />
<br />
<b><i>DO NONE OF YOU KNOW YOUR PLACE?! FINE, YOU WILL JOIN THE CORPSES OF YOUR FRIENDS IN THE TUNNEL!</i></b><br />
<br />
Keith's eyes widened in horror at the very mention of that Arceusforsaken tunnel, the tunnel full of the Koffing and Weezing corpses he promised to avenge, the tunnel that made him sick to his stomach, and not from the poison. And Heatran unleashed a powerful Fire Spin, threatening to render Gemini and Mustard not unlike the twisted, mutilated Weezing corpses from that tunnel, which they already were threatening to resemble thanks to being stuck in the wall. Indeed, Keith could not banish that horrible mental image from his mind, try as he might...<br />
<br />
And then, the Heatmor leader jumped in, taking the Fire Spin in its entirety, saving Keith and his friends for... Keith didn't even know how many times this made now that that Heatmor had saved them, he'd long since lost count. Whatever time this made, Heatmor's Flash Fire allowed it to take the Fire Spin with no ill effects.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! Heatmor, awesome!&quot; Keith cheered. &quot;Now! Use Lick!&quot;<br />
<br />
Heatmor was only too happy to oblige. He charged forward fearlessly, and ran his tongue across Heatran's metal helmet. As was generally expected, the attack was mostly ineffective, Lick not being an attack known for its power, but then, something seemed to happen, something that made Keith's heart leap with joy and hope- Lick's secondary effect seemed to have kicked in! Heatmor's saliva must have gotten in through some sort of crack in Heatran's helmet, gotten through to its very muscles! Heatran was paralyzed!<br />
<br />
<b><i>Wh... WHAT IS THIS? WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!</i></b><br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! YES!&quot; Keith cheered. &quot;Heatmor, Tackle it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, Heatmor happily obliged, ramming into Heatran's leg once more. The attack seemed to not do a lot of damage, however, more irritating Heatran than anything else. The irate legendary was quick to strike back with a super effective Earth Power, which Heatmor took hard. Keith gritted his teeth as he saw Heatmor collapse to the ground, and yet, not only was he still alive, but the Fire-type's remarkable willpower was actually still keeping him conscious. Keith had never seen a Pokémon with so much sheer willpower, and the more he saw this Heatmor in action, the more he was impressed with him.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Heatran seemed satisfied with Heatmor's condition for the moment, for he shifted his attention back to the Weezing wedged into the wall, and assumed a stance that sent a chill down Keith's spine, in spite of their volcanic location- that stance was the same one he assumed just before the last Magma Storm he used! However, before any terrifying swirling vortex of fire and magma could start to materialize, Heatran froze in place, the paralysis getting the better of him, and all because of a single Lick to his helmet... Wait, the helmet... If Heatmor's Lick could get through some sort of crack on there... Then maybe...<br />
<br />
&quot;Gemini! Hidden Power! Go!&quot; Keith shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weeeeeez!&quot; bellowed the Weezing's two heads- even in their stuck positions, they were able to unleash more orbs of Ground energy, striking Heatran for major damage. And this time, the major damage was starting to show. Heatran was starting to falter, his footing weaker, his breathing heavier, movement hindered by the paralysis. Keith couldn't hold back his excited smile, for he truly seemed to be gaining the upper hand in this bout. And what was more, he had an idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Meowth, help Gemini!&quot; Keith ordered the Scratch Cat Pokémon on his shoulder. &quot;Aim a <b>Swift</b> attack at the rock wall around Gemini and Mustard, try and break them free!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Youse gots it,&quot; Meowth nodded- seeing Heatran get weakened so much was strengthening the Normal-type's resolve.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gemini,&quot; Keith added, addressing his Weezing. &quot;Try your best to get free, and once you are, or if you have a good shot otherwise, use <b>Hidden Power</b> once more, but try and aim it all at Heatran's iron helmet. Then follow up with a <b>Hyper Beam</b> to that exact same place! Heatmor,&quot; Keith then said, turning to the Anteater Pokémon, &quot;<b>Tackle</b> its front legs, try to make it lose its footing, and if you get a clean shot, use <b>Tackle</b> on its iron helmet!&quot; Hopefully, Heatran's weakened footing was weak enough that some good, solid blows to the legs would make them buckle. Especially if the Dire Hit helped Heatmor hit weak points on the legs. And the helmet... Heatmor's Lick had already proven that that iron helmet had some sort of weak point to it. Any cracks on it were small and imperceptible, but it had already proven to be a weak spot once... perhaps repeated attacks to it would be the key.<br />
<br />
<i>We get it,</i> a telepathic voice sounded in Keith's head. <i>Heatmor's Lick got through that helmet, so you think there's a weak point to be exploited there.</i> Keith nodded to his Weezing. Indeed, that was his line of thinking exactly, and it pleased him that his oldest friend was so quick to think the exact same way.</span></span><br />

<br />
<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> Having been at the Great One’s mercy throughout your entire journey, you feel especially confident now that you seem to be in control for the first time since you crossed paths with Heatran. The colossal lord of the mountain is stumbling at the beating you’re putting him through, but fact remains that both your Weezing and the Heatmor are still in a very precarious position – no doubt more damaged than the God of Mt. Aduro is. With Gemini, Mustard and the anteater leader all in such injured states, is there any way you can keep up the pressure?!<br />
<br />
You remind yourself that this isn’t an official one-on-one match, it’s a fight for survival – any and all help is welcome if it means taking down the tyrant! To that effect, you employ Meowth’s aid to tilt the odds in your favor once again: the feline’s golden star shower explodes against the volcano wall, sending rubble flying everywhere, but Meowth’s Technician expertise ensures no projectiles hit Gemini at all – in fact, when the dust settles, the Weezing is once again able to hover freely above the lava, released from his rock prison!<br />
<br />
Seeing the result of Meowth and Weezing’s cooperation, Heatmor <i>yet again</i> rises to his feet, nearly passing out as he does, and stumbles over to stand right next to Gemini for the first time since the start of the battle. It was clear enough that he was on your side already, but now he’s determined to work in tandem with the Poison-Type!<br />
Both Pokemon realizing what you have in mind, they concentrate their efforts of toppling the giant once and for all by exploiting what you hope might be Heatran’s only weak point. Gemini once again summons his Hidden Power, and you can’t help but notice there are much fewer orbs this time around – it seems that the Weezing’s Ground energy has just become depleted! <br />
<br />
Gemini shoots what few spheres of earth element he can still conjure, and the Hidden Power finds its mark, crashing against the stunned Great One’s forehead with a violent blast… unfortunately revealing no obvious kinks in the armor still. Heatran growls and shakes his head in pain, the damage obviously piling up well beyond his tolerance. With a roar, he unleashes another <b>Heat Wave</b> out of desperation, but Heatmor once again stands between the mass of burning air and its intended target, shielding Gemini from most of the impact!<br />
<br />
This is the opening that the Weezing needs, even if it’s mostly a gamble at this point – he firmly believes in you and your conviction that the helmet has a weak spot to be exploited, and is willing to expend the last of his reserves to expose that weakness! Gemini and Mustard gather their collective power into a massive sphere of light in front of them, charging uo for the strongest Hyper Beam they can muster… and at exactly the same time, Heatmor struggles to take a running start straight at the Great One! Though he stumbles along the way, on the verge of collapsing, the anteater doesn’t let up and continues to dash at the same time that Weezing unleashes his blast of destruction! The beam passes Heatmor overhead and collides violently with Heatran’s metal head, creating another huge explosion as a result! And at the precise moment of impact, Heatmor lunges itself straight at the titan’s front leg, putting everything he has into the Tackle to deal a <i>critical hit</i> so strong that Heatran loses its balance from the simultaneous forces that hit him! The leg gives out under him and the lumbering giant tumbles forward with a thud, falling over! His immense body mass narrowly misses the anteater below, who gazes at his accomplishment with glazed-over eyes and a grin before passing out from sheer exhaustion.<br />
<br />
Meowth excitedly points at the conquered giant, and you understand why: with a loud cracking noise, a large fissure spreads across Heatran’s helmet from top to bottom! You were right!! The Great One seems unable to get back up, due to the combination of intense damage and the nagging paralysis, and would be at your mercy if only Weezing wasn’t recharging and Heatmor hadn’t fainted. Still, he seems to realize his dire situation and the humiliation he is suffering at your hands, and all of a sudden reveals one last trick up his sleeve…<br />
<br />
The waving lava that runs between the shattered rocks begins to move, rumble and spin around the platform where the remaining Heatmor stand. In a familiar sight, pillars of liquid fire shoot up from the depths of Aduro and start to converge on the anteaters’ location, the second <b>Magma Storm</b> this time threatening to incinerate the few remaining survivors you’ve tried so hard to protect!!<br />
<br />
<b><i>THIS… THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE!… LEAVE ME BE, DEPART FROM THIS MOUNTAIN IMMEDIATELY AND I WILL SPARE THEM! BUT IF YOU TRY TO STRIKE ME DOWN NOW… THEY ALL DIE! CAN YOU LIVE WITH EVEN MORE BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS, HUMAN?!</i></b><br />
<br />
In his absolute despair, Heatran issues you an ultimatum: If you stop the assault, he promises to let the Heatmor live in Mt. Aduro… but can you really trust this monster? On the other hand, do you even have a choice?<br />
<br />
Quick, make your call!</span></span> <br />

<span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>Aduro Island</i></span><br />
<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> Having been at the Great One’s mercy throughout your entire journey, you feel especially confident now that you seem to be in control for the first time since you crossed paths with Heatran. The colossal lord of the mountain is stumbling at the beating you’re putting him through, but fact remains that both your Weezing and the Heatmor are still in a very precarious position – no doubt more damaged than the God of Mt. Aduro is. With Gemini, Mustard and the anteater leader all in such injured states, is there any way you can keep up the pressure?!<br />
<br />
You remind yourself that this isn’t an official one-on-one match, it’s a fight for survival – any and all help is welcome if it means taking down the tyrant! To that effect, you employ Meowth’s aid to tilt the odds in your favor once again: the feline’s golden star shower explodes against the volcano wall, sending rubble flying everywhere, but Meowth’s Technician expertise ensures no projectiles hit Gemini at all – in fact, when the dust settles, the Weezing is once again able to hover freely above the lava, released from his rock prison!<br />
<br />
Seeing the result of Meowth and Weezing’s cooperation, Heatmor <i>yet again</i> rises to his feet, nearly passing out as he does, and stumbles over to stand right next to Gemini for the first time since the start of the battle. It was clear enough that he was on your side already, but now he’s determined to work in tandem with the Poison-Type!<br />
Both Pokemon realizing what you have in mind, they concentrate their efforts of toppling the giant once and for all by exploiting what you hope might be Heatran’s only weak point. Gemini once again summons his Hidden Power, and you can’t help but notice there are much fewer orbs this time around – it seems that the Weezing’s Ground energy has just become depleted! <br />
<br />
Gemini shoots what few spheres of earth element he can still conjure, and the Hidden Power finds its mark, crashing against the stunned Great One’s forehead with a violent blast… unfortunately revealing no obvious kinks in the armor still. Heatran growls and shakes his head in pain, the damage obviously piling up well beyond his tolerance. With a roar, he unleashes another <b>Heat Wave</b> out of desperation, but Heatmor once again stands between the mass of burning air and its intended target, shielding Gemini from most of the impact!<br />
<br />
This is the opening that the Weezing needs, even if it’s mostly a gamble at this point – he firmly believes in you and your conviction that the helmet has a weak spot to be exploited, and is willing to expend the last of his reserves to expose that weakness! Gemini and Mustard gather their collective power into a massive sphere of light in front of them, charging uo for the strongest Hyper Beam they can muster… and at exactly the same time, Heatmor struggles to take a running start straight at the Great One! Though he stumbles along the way, on the verge of collapsing, the anteater doesn’t let up and continues to dash at the same time that Weezing unleashes his blast of destruction! The beam passes Heatmor overhead and collides violently with Heatran’s metal head, creating another huge explosion as a result! And at the precise moment of impact, Heatmor lunges itself straight at the titan’s front leg, putting everything he has into the Tackle to deal a <i>critical hit</i> so strong that Heatran loses its balance from the simultaneous forces that hit him! The leg gives out under him and the lumbering giant tumbles forward with a thud, falling over! His immense body mass narrowly misses the anteater below, who gazes at his accomplishment with glazed-over eyes and a grin before passing out from sheer exhaustion.<br />
<br />
Meowth excitedly points at the conquered giant, and you understand why: with a loud cracking noise, a large fissure spreads across Heatran’s helmet from top to bottom! You were right!! The Great One seems unable to get back up, due to the combination of intense damage and the nagging paralysis, and would be at your mercy if only Weezing wasn’t recharging and Heatmor hadn’t fainted. Still, he seems to realize his dire situation and the humiliation he is suffering at your hands, and all of a sudden reveals one last trick up his sleeve…<br />
<br />
The waving lava that runs between the shattered rocks begins to move, rumble and spin around the platform where the remaining Heatmor stand. In a familiar sight, pillars of liquid fire shoot up from the depths of Aduro and start to converge on the anteaters’ location, the second <b>Magma Storm</b> this time threatening to incinerate the few remaining survivors you’ve tried so hard to protect!!<br />
<br />
<b><i>THIS… THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE!… LEAVE ME BE, DEPART FROM THIS MOUNTAIN IMMEDIATELY AND I WILL SPARE THEM! BUT IF YOU TRY TO STRIKE ME DOWN NOW… THEY ALL DIE! CAN YOU LIVE WITH EVEN MORE BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS, HUMAN?!</i></b><br />
<br />
In his absolute despair, Heatran issues you an ultimatum: If you stop the assault, he promises to let the Heatmor live in Mt. Aduro… but can you really trust this monster? On the other hand, do you even have a choice?<br />
<br />
Quick, make your call!</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">Meowth set to work straightaway, firing a barrage of golden stars at the volcano wall, chipping away at the rock while not striking the trapped Weezing at all. And as the dust settled, Keith saw to his delight that the Swift had done its job- Gemini and Mustard were floating in midair once more, freed from the rock wall! &quot;Way to go, Meowth!&quot; Keith grinned. &quot;Now, Gemini, Heatmor, attack together!&quot; he added, the Fire-type standing beside Gemini and Mustard for the first time in this fight- of course, Keith was sure from the start that Heatmor was on his side, but this seemed to be the Anteater Pokémon's first time demonstrating a willingness to work in tandem with the Weezing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go get 'im!&quot; Meowth cheered them on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gemini, Hidden Power! Do it!&quot; Keith exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weeeeez...&quot; groaned the Weezing's heads as several orbs of energy formed around them- fewer than usual! Keith gritted his teeth- that move must have been using up what remained of the Weezing's Ground energy! But nevertheless, the Poison-type stubbornly unleashed the powerful move, slamming the spheres into Heatran's forehead. Keith grinned, for the spheres hit their mark, but the grin faded slightly as no obvious cracks made themselves visible in the metal plate. However, Heatran was growling, shaking his head in pain- the damage was racking up, clearly going well beyond the legendary's tolerance for pain. He then unleashed a powerful Heat Wave, but Heatmor shielded Gemini and Mustard, absorbing the Fire attack once again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heatmor, awesome!&quot; Keith exclaimed. &quot;Now! Gemini, Hyper Beam! Heatmor, Tackle!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two Pokémon acted simultaneously, Heatmor charging forward as best he could, clearly running off of pure determination and nothing else at this point, while Gemini and Mustard unleashed a powerful beam of pure destructive force. Keith looked on in pure astonishment and awe. The Hyper Beam passed above Heatmor, creating a massive explosion as the move struck the piece of iron just above Heatran's face. At the same time, Heatmor rammed into Heatran's front leg, and the Dire Hit's effects showed themselves at last- Heatmor had scored a critical hit, and Heatran actually lost his balance from the impact, the struck leg giving out altogether. Heatran collapsed to the ground, just narrowly missing the Heatmor leader, who passed out anyhow, from pure exhaustion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look!&quot; Meowth exclaimed, pointing at Heatran. At first, Keith couldn't see what Meowth was getting so worked up about... and then the dust settled, and a loud crack echoed through the air. Keith's eyes widened- a huge fissure was visible in Heatran's helmet, the crack going from top to bottom! Keith grinned- he was right! Targeting that helmet exposed a weak spot! Now, he figured- no, he knew- that just one more attack would likely end the whole thing. One well-placed attack... if only Heatmor hadn't fainted, if only Gemini and Mustard didn't have to recharge! And then, to Keith's horror, the lava started moving, started spinning around the rock platform containing the other Heatmor. Keith's eyes widened- a Magma Storm attack was imminent! And then-<br />
<br />
<b><i>THIS… THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE!… LEAVE ME BE, DEPART FROM THIS MOUNTAIN IMMEDIATELY AND I WILL SPARE THEM! BUT IF YOU TRY TO STRIKE ME DOWN NOW… THEY ALL DIE! CAN YOU LIVE WITH EVEN MORE BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS, HUMAN?!</i></b><br />
<br />
So this was it. This was Heatran's last desperate bid for survival. If Keith spared his life, he would spare the Heatmor, but if Keith tried to strike Heatran down... the remaining Heatmor would die. Keith could not speak, partly out of horror, and partly out of sheer fury. Did Heatran think he was stupid? He expected Keith to just trust him now, after all the crap he had put them through?<br />
<br />
<i>We don't trust him,</i> Gemini and Mustard's telepathic voices echoed in Keith's head. <i>He'll try to kill the Heatmor no matter what your answer, we're sure of it.</i><br />
<br />
Keith nodded. He agreed completely- if he spared Heatran's life, the second he let his guard down Heatran would murder the Heatmor anyway. He wanted those Heatmor dead something fierce, and after all the horrible deaths he caused, whether Keith saw them happen or just saw the gruesome aftermath, no way in hell was he gonna put one ounce of trust into the Fire/Steel-type. Moreover, this wasn't just about the Heatmor... It was very much about them, there was no mistaking that, but this was also about the ensured safety and happiness of Aduro Island as a whole. Keith had promised to try and keep the Heatmor safe, but he also promised to try and end the Great One's reign of terror. And furthermore, Keith realized, the Heatmor weren't necessarily doomed if he acted, and acted quickly- Heatran was, after all, paralyzed. Even if it wasn't gonna stop his Magma Storm, it was sure as hell gonna slow it down, and that could make all the difference. Surely the best way to prevent Heatran's Magma Storm would be to put an end to its source. But he had to act-<br />
<br />
&quot;-Now!&quot; Keith exclaimed, turning to the one Pokémon still in any condition to act on his orders and act on them fast- his Hariyama. Helga had been trying to keep the non-Flash Fire Heatmor safe, but until now could only look on in horror at the swirling magma threatening to converge on the famished Fire-types. &quot;Helga, <b>Focus Blast</b>, aim for the head, and quick!&quot; he exclaimed urgently, pointing right at the crack in Heatran's helmet. Helga nodded, getting the idea, and prepared the move, working as fast as she possibly could. And now all Keith could do was hope, hope and pray to Arceus that Helga's fastest would be fast enough.</span></span><br />

<br />
<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> Conflicted between engaging the motionless Cryogonal or walk around it, you weigh your options should things go south for you. But as is often the case between humans and their loyal Pokemon, one of your partners simplifies your decision making by jumping into action on his own! Leo seems willing to fight, barking menacingly at a Pokemon who unfortunately cannot feel fear.<br />
<br />
The Ice-Type hovers in place, glimmering ice crystals forming and falling all around it in a pretty sight to behold. How would such a Pokemon fair in Beauty Contests, you find yourself wondering? But isn't the time for such musings. The potential threat before you is very real, and letting your guard down could be a mistake.<br />
The living crystal has no apparent intentions of picking a fight, but at the sight of the belligerent Leo eyeing it aggressively, the Cryogonal finally reacts. Whether because it was its intention all along, or perhaps out of simple survival instinct, the Ice-Type raises one of his chains and <b>Slash</b>es Leo's torso with it!<br />
<br />
As if reading your mind, the Growlithe fights back with a clear plan. The pup Howls audibly, definitively ensuring you won't go by unnoticed by anyone inside the abandoned building, and pumps himself up in the process. He proceeds to channel Steel energy into his tail and striking his foe with it after leaping into an impressive somersault; the force of the blow causes the living crystals to shatter into several pieces, some of which Leo is quick to melt down with a stream of Embers.<br />
<br />
Your Growlithe's offensive display is an impressive display of battle prowess for such a young cub. The enemy seems to have been quickly disposed of... until the ice fragments and pools of liquid begin to coalesce and Cryogonal <b>Recover</b>s its previous form without a hint of a flaw in its crystalline structure! Emotionless but with a clear purpose now, it wraps its crystal chains around Leo and <b>Bind</b>s him helplessly, constricting the poor Growlithe in its tight grip while the shards dig into his flesh.<br />
<br />
The situation has just taken a turn for the worse - what do you do now?!</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver">Despite the freezing atmosphere the battle was certainly starting to heat up! Adrenaline started to pump inside Liza's veins and suddenly she didn’t feel so cold anymore.<br />
<br />
The battle even seemed to be going their way for a while, but like with anything, you can never just assume things will <i>always</i> go your way. And right now, Liza’s Growlithe was trying to fight off the icy grip of his predator...<br />
<br />
“Leo! No!” The young women cried out, worried that her pup and even she might've been a little over their heads on this opponent...<br />
<br />
<i>But...this is what Leo wants...</i> The puppy Pokemon enjoyed being spoiled and loved by his trainer but what good did it do him to never be there to show her how much he had grown too! How much he appreciated everything she did for him.<br />
<br />
Struggling through the pain from the earlier Slash attack and now the freezing, gripping pain he felt now, Leo turned slightly towards Liza, giving her a confident wink, as well as a reassuring but very weak bark that gave Liza the confidence to continue on with the match.<br />
<br />
<i>Leo...</i> She thought to herself, <i>You're not a baby anymore...are you...but I’m never going to stop babying you, but I do have to give you a chance to grow, and that starts now.</i> With a little more resolve her head was right back in the game...no more getting distracted. What she needed to do now was get her pup free from his little predicament...Fire Type Moves would probably be best here given the situation but she had a better idea in mind that didn't exhaust Leo's Fire Type Moves too much too soon. <br />
<br />
<i>Every battle...was like a dance, it took two to tango and one needed to lead.</i><br />
<br />
“Alright! Quick, concentrate all your energy on a single point...use <b>Rock Smash</b> to break the chain of command and set yourself free! If it works, <b>give yourself some distance</b> to trap it in a <b>Fire Spin</b>!”<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>Rayzen</u>:</u></b> <i>((Thanks for giving Cascadia a shot! Hope you have fun!))</i><br />
<br />
Many things can be said about Ion Island. How peculiar its charged atmosphere feels, how picturesque the sights around Iridi Beach are, how rich its history is. But no one will ever say that the outskirts of the Eletron Plant are pretty.<br />
<br />
A largely industrial area, the Plant has the admittedly-easy task of providing electrical power to Brine Island's Salin City - electricity which isn't exactly hard to get around these parts. But as you and the Claydol codenamed Smartphone approach the main entrance of the complex, something seems... off. Those people at the door are <i>way</i> too many for a tourist group - and who would ever hold an expedition to this part of the island anyway?<br />
Upon closer inspection, the men near the entrance - fifteen in total, you notice - are all wearing identical dark-blue uniforms. These are all police officers...<br />
<br />
- Halt! Restricted access beyond this point. There is a situation in the Power Plant.<br />
<br />
One of the men has come rushing to stop you. He seems to be in his fifties, with an exasperated look on his face that reads &quot;I'm getting too old for this&quot;. Whatever happened inside the Eletron Plant, it seems that the authorities are still struggling to handle it...<br />
<br />
- I'm sorry sir, but there's been an accident in the Plant. We can't risk anyone going inside except for aid in ongoing investigations. There's... been a casualty. Unless you're an experienced Trainer and you're willing to help, we can't let you past this point.<br />
<br />
The police are clearly grasping at straws here. But an actual casualty? It's no wonder they look so concerned - it's easy to imagine accidents happening in such a place, but one would expect general safety measures to be in place to protect the Power Plant workers. If someone died all the same, either protocol was breached or there's something else to this story...<br />
<br />
Are you sure you want to get involved, or do you turn back and choose another destination on Ion Island to explore? </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: yellow">Upon arrival near the electron plant itself, Rayzen saw a crowd surrounding the area. Apparently, access was restricted so he was not able to go through as he had planned. Later, an exhausted elder man came to him and it seemed that there was a fatality after gathering several explanations. He gauged the surroundings and waited until he wasn't served anymore, then he loudly spoke up to one of them. Rayzen showed his badges in their small case that contained mostly Sinnoh, Kalos and Unova badges. &quot;Look, I have official badges by the Pokemon League from other regions. This validation should be enough proof that I am experienced right? Although, I am sure that other experienced trainers have like 48 badges or something,&quot; he ended his introduction with a trollfaced smirk.<br />
<br />
Everyone else could see his claydol loitering around the electrified fence. &quot;You want experience? Well, my claydol is old, but whose isn't?&quot; Rayzen hummed a brief tune for his claydol. &quot;Beep... ... ...beep ... ... ...beep beep!&quot; his pokegear slowly sounded again, to which he pointed his claydol to the person, &quot;See? Old.&quot; He looked at his claydol which appeared to be internally smiling to its trainer, then back at the person. &quot;Besides, when I say that I am entering the area, I can escape whenever I want, right? Even if I don't travel far inside, at least I might get new information to help with your investigation,&quot; Rayzen tried to convince the police officer one more time before giving up.</span></div>

Hope you enjoy yourself and that I can live up to your standards <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite2" alt=";)" title="Wink    ;)" data-shortname=";)" /> ))</i><br />
<br />
Without really knowing why, you have been drawn to Ruin Island, more specifically the old site of worship known as Ordial Shrine. The deities honored within its halls are foreign to you, but the oppressive aura that surrounds the structure itself is a testament to the old forces that were once present. Sangre seems to sense it as well, and is visibly reluctant to go any further, but does so at your insistence – after all, this journey is about redemption… or so you tell yourself.<br />
<br />
Other temples around Ruin Island were designed to keep people out – impossibly-heavy stone doors bar the entrance to most religious sites. Ordial Shrine is quite possibly unique in that it has no gates; the once-elaborately sculpted stone arch welcomes all those who wish to venture into the heart of the building… almost beckoning them to. Although the entire structure has been called Ordial Shrine for generations, the shrine itself is concealed within the depths of the temple, and rumored to be covered in the blood of countless sacrifices. If there is any truth to those tales, you can’t tell, but if fate wills it, you might just find out.<br />
<br />
The arch leads to a flight of downwards stairs which opens into a wide square hall. Hundreds of Litwick sleep on large chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, and lend the place an eerie purple lighting. And despite all the flames that light up the main hall, it feels cold. So very cold.<br />
You run your eyes through the sprawling room, taking in the details of ancient architecture – regardless of how you feel about art, there is no denying this is an incredible piece of work. Four huge pillars, shaped like Origin Giratina, coil upwards and sustain the full weight of the ceiling. The walls are lined with faded gravures, depicting millennia-old rituals too eroded to make sense of. There are four statues depicting strange creatures on each edge of the room – certainly not human effigies, although if they depict Pokemon, their species were lost in time and do not feature in any known PokeDex records.<br />
<br />
-	They expected Abel, and it’s Cain who comes! What a lovely little twist.<br />
<br />
A deep, soothing male voice snaps you out of your reverie. Instinctively shifting your gaze to the source of the sound, you find a middle-aged man sitting comfortably against one of the pillars, absent-mindedly staring at the Litwick above, with a smile plastered on his face. His outfit is as strange as his very presence here – a short-sleeved white shirt with a pattern of crimson roses, light-brown pants, a white fedora and black flip-flops. As he finishes his sentence, he starts humming a strange tune to himself, easily audible from where you stand in the otherwise complete silence of the chamber. Finally, he tilts his head slightly and stares at you with clear blue eyes.<br />
<br />
-	Hey there Pollux. I’m afraid Zeus is gone… how is Castor doing?<br />
<br />
His tone is both amused and strangely teasing. He doesn’t seem nearly as interested in your response as he is in your immediate reaction, and goes on with his musings.<br />
<br />
-	Strange days in the world out there. Everyone shouting “bloody murder”… if I was in their place, I’d fear the ones that murder without shouting. But what do I know, right?<br />
<br />
He casually looks over to another stone arch, similar to the one you just crossed, on the far end of the room. You notice it lacks a door of any kind as well…<br />

-	Fun times ahead. Tell me, which one of you likes blood the most? Oh, I guess I’ll find out soon enough…<br />
<br />
A strange man to be sure, and some of things he says are unsettling, nevermind the way he says them. The temple seems to invite explorers to delve as far as they want to go, and there’s a lot of ground to cover ahead. Do you approach the misplaced stranger, or will you avoid his apparent craziness and press onward?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: darkorange"><span style="font-size: 9px">((I have no doubt that you will not only meet my standards, but far exceed them. I apologize, also, if I take some time to respond - Coselle as a character is not as easy to write for as some of the others I've created for other RPs, so it takes me some time to get into her headspace and write for her appropriately. So please don't take it personally if these responses take me some time!))<br />
<br />
<i>Cold.</i> True cold. It was a sensation Coselle had not felt in a long time. Sure, there were those who would argue that her aura - that her very heart and soul - were consumed by it, but her own coldness, the winters that had come and gone, the night's frigidity - nothing compared to the chill that death left in its wake. Oh, it was true. She knew the heat of blood, the fading warmth of a fresh corpse, but by the time the cold had set in, she was long gone. She had been running from that horrid chill for as far as her human legs could carry her... but it was catching up. And here, in this silent shrine, it was waiting for her. Distant, yet familiar. Now was not the time to show fear, and her partner knew this just as well as she did. The stoic Crobat maintains a somber, yet fearless expression as he silently soars behind her, while his trainer takes in the beautiful, yet eerie architectural marvels that surround her. Giratina was a Pokemon which Coselle had strong, yet mixed feelings about, but seeing it here, depicted in all of its ghostly power and might, inspired nothing but awe in the strange woman. The odd, unidentifiable statues and depictions of lost rituals evoke similar interest, and the dark-haired girl thinks with some amusement about how her sister would be squealing with delight, taking hundreds of photos, recording observations... Coselle, however, was merely content to admire them, at peace with the idea that their stories and purpose would likely remain a mystery to her for as long as she lived.<br />
<br />
-	They expected Abel, and it’s Cain who comes! What a lovely little twist.<br />
<br />
Coselle immediately narrows her eyes, regarding the oddly-dressed man with immediate suspicion; perhaps she could have hid it better had his words not cut so deeply. Sangre regards the man with a wary gaze and cautious stance, ready to strike at a moment's notice. Though Coselle attempts to hide the emotional reaction the man's words provoke, he persists:<br />
<br />
-	Hey there Pollux. I’m afraid Zeus is gone… how is Castor doing?<br />
<br />
The dark-haired woman was no dunce when it came to mythology. His thinly-veiled references made immediate connections in her mind; did he know about her sister? Did he know what existed between them - the intense bond, now marred by hatred and conflict - and could he tell her where her sister was now? Was &quot;Zeus&quot; a reference to their mother, or to the absence of the god this temple revered? It was not far-fetched that psychics would call this place home, but it was also not far-fetched that the police was on her tail and looking to corner her for her ever-accumulating list of misdeeds. She had to be careful, lest he figure out-<br />
<br />
-	Strange days in the world out there. Everyone shouting “bloody murder”… if I was in their place, I’d fear the ones that murder without shouting. But what do I know, right?<br />
<br />
<i>Damn.</i> Either this guy was really lucky with his Barnum effect or he had her utterly nailed. The murders in the Adoption Center, her past involvement in impassioned crimes of death and destruction - was he there to bring her salvation, drag her further down that dark path, or force her to pay for what she had done? The imbalance of personal knowledge between the two of them irritated her more and more...<br />
<br />
-	Fun times ahead. Tell me, which one of you likes blood the most? Oh, I guess I’ll find out soon enough…<br />
<br />
The words send chills down Coselle's spine. Sangre emits a low warning cry, but Coselle motions for him to remain calm. She gives the man a rather unsettling grin of her own - as self-assured and eerie as she can muster given how shaken she is internally. It was her nature to act boldly, even in the face of danger, and this frighteningly perceptive man was no exception.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that a question you really want to be asking? One wonders why you ask it at all...&quot; She takes a bold step forward, her grin remaining plastered on her face. &quot;Enlighten me. What is your purpose? Your intent? Hell, what's your name? Admittedly... you have me somewhat intrigued, and that's no small feat.&quot;</span></span></div>

<br />
<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> Trust is something you're not willing to place on the fallen God. He tried to murder you and the pack of Heatmor more times than you can count, and with you out of the way Heatran has all the time in the world to impose &quot;his&quot; natural order once again. You're tried too hard to keep them safe so far, so to gamble it all on the word of a tyrant is something you can't afford to do. Either way your choice needs to come fast, as the Magma Storm continues to coalesce and threatens to consume every single anteater when the pillars of lava merge together. If the move's effect on your fully trained Weezing is anything to go by, survival isn't an option if the malnourished anteaters are devoured by the flames.<br />
<br />
Gemini and Mustard breathe heavily, exhausted and unable to move after the ultimate strain of using Hyper Beam; at the same time, Heatmor is lying unconscious at Heatran's feet after his last successful effort to topple the giant. The scenario looks bleak, and the Mountain God knows it - despite lacking the strength to oppose your ranks, he has played his last card and hopes to be spared thanks to it. With only two choices remaining - give in to Heatran's demands or keep fighting and risk the consequences -, you look around for an alternative that doesn't involve bowing to the Great One's will. And again you remember that this isn't a regular Pokemon battle - lives are at stake, and you have to do whatever it takes to preserve them, no matter how many allies you have to rely on to bring down your foe!<br />
<br />
Having done her best to shield the debilitated Heatmor pack from the downpour of lava and stone during the course of Gemini's clash with Heatran, Helga has been raring to go for a long while now. Still recovering from the brutal match against Magmortar, but with an unparalleled fighting spirit, the Hariyama looks on enraged at the Great One's antics while shielding the anteaters with her body, hoping for the tremendous impact of the oncoming Magma Storm. However, the second she hears your final orders, she grins and focuses every last ounce of power she has, as quickly as she can muster, into a sphere of <i>ki</i>. She realizes she needs to stop shielding the Heatmor to do so, and prays that she can find it in her to finish charging before the magma pillars converge on them... and she does! Holding a massive blue Focus Blast sphere in her equally huge hand, she takes aim at the downed Heatran from behind the spiraling lava columns. She breathes heavily from the energy expended, and her vision blurs regularly, but she tries her hardest to remain conscious and, in one final desperate attempt, hurls the orb through the Magma Storm in the fraction of second that separates two consecutive spinning lava pillars. The Focus Blast passes through the liquid fire prison and flies towards its intended target, while an infuriated Heatran focuses as well to hasten the convergence of the Magma Storm upon its helpless victims.<br />
<br />
<i><b>FOOL! YOU HAVE BROUGHT THIS UPON YOURSELF!</b></i><br />
<br />
Both you and the God have played your hand. Now all each of you can do is watch the events unfold. The Magma Storm ravages the platform where Helga and the Heatmor stand, at the same time that the sapphire orb home sin on Heatran. And just when the all lava is about to coalesce into the same vile tower that incinerated Gemini before, the Focus Blast hits Heatran on his cracked helmet, crashing violently in a shockwave of pure energy that causes a tremendous explosion!<br />
<br />
Hellfire and brimstone indeed - smoke, molten rock and embers fly all over the volcano's main chamber, obscuring your vision. What happened?!<br />
When the dust settles, the scenario before you is hard to believe... The Magma Storm pillars have stopped spinning, mere inches away from a close-eyed Helga bent over the Heatmor pack, shielding them with her last fragments of strength; the towers of lava come crashing down into the pit again, dissolving into the sea of fire around the tiny rock platform... the attack subsided!! Then that has to mean...<br />
<br />
Your eyes instinctively shift over to the titan - and find Heatran's eyes glazed over, its helmet falling to pieces, massive iron fragments falling in the lava below. The Lava Dome Pokemon's breathing is shallow, his body no longer moving. With the last remnant of its consciousness, it gazes at you attempting to look defiant still, but manages to utter nothing more than a weak cry. You watch Heatran's body merge with the surrounding magma, vanishing into the liquid flames, becoming one with Mt. Aduro once again. You wonder if mythical beings such as him ever truly die, but when the platforms start to lower due to the magma beneath cooling down, you have your answer:<br />
<br />
The God of Mt. Aduro is gone, and with it, the volcano's activity. Aduro is no longer live, its burning heart has cooled off, and for the first time in millennia, it is now an inactive volcano. The long term repercussions on Cascadia's ecosystem remain to be seen, but one thing is certain - Heatran's reign of terror is over, and you have saved not only the pack of Heatmor, but the entire population of Aduro whom the Legendary Pokemon held in slavery!<br />
<br />
<b><i>[Helga has gained 2 Levels!]</i></b><br />
<br />
Helga lets go of the group she was protecting, and they rush over to their fallen leader. After much insistence he comes to, blinking in confusion at first, but quickly realizing what just happened. He struggles to his feet and gazes over at you with immense gratitude in his eyes. Just then, Meowth tugs at your leg and points to a nearby spot on the ground, to an area where lava has just turned to basalt. Something glimmers in the middle of the black rock, and the feline goes to retrieve it. He comes back with a decidedly burning hot, but otherwise easily identifiable item - a piece of Heatran's helmet partially molten into a spherical shape. Meowth hurriedly hands you the

<b>1x Iron Ball</b>, glad to get rid of the incandescent slump of metal.<br />
<br />
Commotion stirs behind you, and you look back to find the tunnel previously blocked off by the landslide be reopened by the collective efforts of several Pokemon - among them Numel, Magby, Magmar, even the occasional Koffing. They have all come to see the miracle for themselves, and stare in amazement and disbelief at the now-quiet chamber where lava once flowed and Heatran ruled with an iron fist.<br />
<br />
Doduo's corpse is picked up by some of the Pokemon and put to rest beneath a heap of rocks, as if giving the brave bird a proper burial; still, no sign of Kyle, who probably couldn't be found anywhere in the collapsed tunnel. The inhabitants of Aduro approach you, fearful at first but unquestionably grateful. One of the older-looking of the group, a Magmar, approaches the Heatmor leader and helps him to his feet. By their exchange, it seems the Spitfire Pokemon is apologizing to the anteater, and both shake hands to seal the reconciliation.<br />
<br />
The Magmar then turns to you speaks in its native language, which Meowth promptly translates, explaining that the Aduro natives want you to have what Heatran considered his crown jewel and the mark of his absolute dominion. They want nothing to do with the memory of such a tyrant and will be glad if you would accept it as a parting gift, ridding the mountain of the last remnant of Heatran's reign. Magmar signals to a group of Numel and they start digging through the solidified magma where the Lava Dome Pokemon once slept. After a while they return, rolling something along the ground - a sphere emitting a red glow and intense warmth. Unlike the Iron Ball Meowth retrieved earlier, this sphere had a dormant power of its won, an active core filled with energy; it's easy to see why Heatran regarded it as his most prized possession. You kneel down and pick up the

<b>1x Flame Orb</b>, contemplating its beauty and, most of all, the significance of the item...<br />
<br />
It seems your adventure has come to an end, after a grueling battle of wits and power against a Legendary Pokemon from which you emerged victorious. You faced loss along the way, having to witness the deaths of a Magmar, some of Heatmor, and even Kyle and his silly, yet gutsy Doduo...If it weren't for them, who knows if you had been successful. But now, when all is said and done, you and your prized Pokemon have accomplished something very few Trainers can claim to have done - come face to face with a Legend and defeat it. What this means for Aduro and Cascadia as a whole remains a mystery, but a monster such as Heatran had to be stopped, no questions asked.<br />
<br />
Your duty fulfilled, and your partners thoroughly exhausted, you decide it's time to leave this place and finally go home. When you turn around to say your goodbyes, you find the Heatmor leader standing right in front of you, looking down at the ground, at a loss for words, while the rest of his family seem to be egging him on to do something. And although you can't speak their language, you get the feeling you know what this is about....<br />
<br />
Is there anything you want to say to Heatmor before you leave? </span></span> <br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> Watching the sharp crystals pierce your pup’s flesh feels almost as painful to you as it does to Leo. But through his suffering you also see a burning determination to win, and reality forcefully sets in – your Growlithe isn’t a small cub anymore, but a fiery warrior eager to prove himself. And it falls on you give him such an opportunity!<br />
<br />
Despite struggling to set himself free, your orders still reach Leo’s ears, and he roars in approval before carrying them out. He tenses his muscles and finds just enough strength to kick one of the chains with his hind leg, shattering the ice crystals that kept him bound! Then, using his free right paw, he breaks the remaining chain and leaps away from Cryogonal, taking a moment to recover from the intense strain.<br />
Meanwhile, the frozen creature simply freezes more moisture from the atmosphere, rebuilding his crystal chains effortlessly. After all, this is its environment, and there’s nothing more dangerous than fighting an aggressive Pokemon in its favored habitat. However, you seem to have a plan…<br />
<br />
Leo growls, heats up inside and spits out a spiral of fire aimed at the ground beneath Cryongonal. Upon making contact with the floor, the flames twist, turn and shoot upwards, creating a spinning blaze pillar that progressively causes the foe to melt! The sudden increase in temperature causes parts of Cryogonal to liquefy, to which the foe responds by forcefully freezing the water again to reform itself, only to be molten again by the abnormally-hot air. It’s trapped in a loop!<br />
<br />
Leo roars in excitement, pumped up by his obvious success; no matter how quickly Cryogonal regenerates, the raging fire melts it right back down. However, elated by his temporary victory, the Growlithe fails to notice the commotion rising around him – there is movement around the ice-cream crates, and when a barrage of <b>Icicle Spear</b>s hits the pup’s side from out of nowhere, Leo looks around puzzled – there is no way that hit came from the trapped Cryogonal!<br />
<br />
You spot them first – one by one, four creatures hover from behind the abandoned crates and band together. Their bodies are white and round in shape, and their eyes are all locked on the one who picked a fight with their Cryogonal lord – it’s a Horde of

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>Rayzen</u>:</u></b> The officer looks on while you show him your badges; the more you plead your case, the more obvious it seems you don’t have to try too hard at all – the police are desperate for help, so you probably had them convinced the minute they saw your Claydol. Still, you don’t want to get in trouble with the authorities, and reiterate that you will pull out at the first sign of trouble you can’t handle.<br />
<br />
-	Yes, I can see you’ve been around. To be frank, you’re the best nbet we’ve come across all day; we got some men inside, but we can’t even reach them because communications go all sorts of crazy once you get inside. It’s like something’s jamming the line… Look, see what you can do okay? We got three officers in there we can’t contact, a dead employee for Arceus knows what reason and the entire Power Plant seems to be against us. We don’t expect any miracles, but maybe you can get to the bottom of this.<br />
<br />
The elder cop kneels down next to a military-issue iron suitcase and opens it. He pulls out a red garment of sorts and hands it to you.<br />
<br />
-	Here, it’s the least I can give you for troubles – everyone on the force uses these in hostile environment missions. Hopefully it’ll keep you safe in there…<br />

His tone is anything but reassuring, and he looks a bit crestfallen while he hands you

<b>1x Assault Vest</b>. It seems he’s neither too happy to be here, nor too confident in your success. Either way, you can tell he appreciates your willingness to help.<br />
With permission from the old police officer, the rest of the group let you through, muttering something under their breath. The front gate is wide open, so you boldly walk inside followed closely by Claydol.<br />
<br />
The main lobby is barren, loose wires hanging from the ceiling and not a single light bulb lit. Contrary to what one would expect, the Power Plant is decidedly dark – for some reason, not a single active source of light can be found anywhere, save for the emergency neon signs that provide little lighting to the spacious room. It feels like nobody has been here in decades, but you know that’s not the case. What the hell happened here?...<br />
<br />
There are three doors leading out of the lobby. One on the far wall, as wide open as the front gate was; one on the wall to your right, partially open but not enough for a man to pass through without forcing the rest open; and one on the wall to your left, tightly shut, with a single red button next to it. The longer you stay here the more time you waste in finding out what happened here, so the best thing to do is move on ahead… but which door will you go through?</span> </span><br />

<br />
-	Oh, I don’t <i>ask</i>… I just wonder. Have you ever had the answer to a question just a tiny glance away, but refuse to peek? Sometimes having the answers is just no fun…<br />
<br />
Out of the blue, you hear the crystal-clear song of a bird echoing though the hall, a soft melody that lasts mere seconds but is enough to capture your attention. You fail to spot the origin of the chirping, but when you look back to face the man… he’s gone.<br />
<br />
A low-pitched rumble replaces the chirping, and before you know it the ground is shaking ever-so-slightly. The eyes of the Giratina pillars glow ruby-red and a crimson liquid flows from them, running down the spiral columns like tears; they coalesce at the bottom of each pillar, forming growing red pools around each of them. The man’s voice is then heard from the open door ahead, as calm and simultaneously-unnerving as before.<br />
<br />
-	Do they cry for you… or <i>because</i> of you?<br />
<br />
Sangre looks at the liquid with a mixture of hunger and curiosity. Is it really blood? If so, who does it belong to, if anyone? Fresh blood in a long-abandoned temple… The shrine known to hold sacrifices to the Gods eons ago seems to have awakened once more. But as the mysterious man himself hinted… are there any Gods left in this place?<br />
<br />
You gaze at the red fluid absent-mindedly while you ponder on these questions. When your gaze refocuses and you truly look at the blood again, you find it has already dried up, with one particular pool having turned into a solid crystal-like substance. Wait, how is that even possible? How long have you been here? Looking up, you see large cracks all over the heavily-eroded Giratina pillars… but weren’t they perfectly sculpted just now, unlike the poorly preserved images on the walls? What’s going on here?<br />
You instinctively pick up the blood crystal, as if hoping it’ll give you any clues, but there is nothing revealing about the

<br />
Alarmed, you look at Sangre, but the Crobat doesn’t look to have aged at all. And staring at your own hands, it seems neither have you… But how long will it stay that way? Something tells you need to get off this chamber, and there’s only one way to go – through the open door on the wall ahead, from whence the man’s voice came just now…<br />
<br />
You pass through the stone arc, leaving the pillar hall behind, and find yourself in a dimly-lit corridor with no end in sight. The walls are unadorned and the ceiling is mere inches above your head, making for a very claustrophobic experience. With little room to fly around, Sangre seems to be having a hard time as well, but he manages to spread his wings just enough to stay airborne.<br />
Walking further down the tunnel, you spot something ahead – and upon drawing near, you realize it’s a

<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> Trust is something you're not willing to place on the fallen God. He tried to murder you and the pack of Heatmor more times than you can count, and with you out of the way Heatran has all the time in the world to impose &quot;his&quot; natural order once again. You're tried too hard to keep them safe so far, so to gamble it all on the word of a tyrant is something you can't afford to do. Either way your choice needs to come fast, as the Magma Storm continues to coalesce and threatens to consume every single anteater when the pillars of lava merge together. If the move's effect on your fully trained Weezing is anything to go by, survival isn't an option if the malnourished anteaters are devoured by the flames.<br />
<br />
Gemini and Mustard breathe heavily, exhausted and unable to move after the ultimate strain of using Hyper Beam; at the same time, Heatmor is lying unconscious at Heatran's feet after his last successful effort to topple the giant. The scenario looks bleak, and the Mountain God knows it - despite lacking the strength to oppose your ranks, he has played his last card and hopes to be spared thanks to it. With only two choices remaining - give in to Heatran's demands or keep fighting and risk the consequences -, you look around for an alternative that doesn't involve bowing to the Great One's will. And again you remember that this isn't a regular Pokemon battle - lives are at stake, and you have to do whatever it takes to preserve them, no matter how many allies you have to rely on to bring down your foe!<br />
<br />
Having done her best to shield the debilitated Heatmor pack from the downpour of lava and stone during the course of Gemini's clash with Heatran, Helga has been raring to go for a long while now. Still recovering from the brutal match against Magmortar, but with an unparalleled fighting spirit, the Hariyama looks on enraged at the Great One's antics while shielding the anteaters with her body, hoping for the tremendous impact of the oncoming Magma Storm. However, the second she hears your final orders, she grins and focuses every last ounce of power she has, as quickly as she can muster, into a sphere of <i>ki</i>. She realizes she needs to stop shielding the Heatmor to do so, and prays that she can find it in her to finish charging before the magma pillars converge on them... and she does! Holding a massive blue Focus Blast sphere in her equally huge hand, she takes aim at the downed Heatran from behind the spiraling lava columns. She breathes heavily from the energy expended, and her vision blurs regularly, but she tries her hardest to remain conscious and, in one final desperate attempt, hurls the orb through the Magma Storm in the fraction of second that separates two consecutive spinning lava pillars. The Focus Blast passes through the liquid fire prison and flies towards its intended target, while an infuriated Heatran focuses as well to hasten the convergence of the Magma Storm upon its helpless victims.<br />
<br />
<i><b>FOOL! YOU HAVE BROUGHT THIS UPON YOURSELF!</b></i><br />
<br />
Both you and the God have played your hand. Now all each of you can do is watch the events unfold. The Magma Storm ravages the platform where Helga and the Heatmor stand, at the same time that the sapphire orb home sin on Heatran. And just when the all lava is about to coalesce into the same vile tower that incinerated Gemini before, the Focus Blast hits Heatran on his cracked helmet, crashing violently in a shockwave of pure energy that causes a tremendous explosion!<br />
<br />
Hellfire and brimstone indeed - smoke, molten rock and embers fly all over the volcano's main chamber, obscuring your vision. What happened?!<br />
When the dust settles, the scenario before you is hard to believe... The Magma Storm pillars have stopped spinning, mere inches away from a close-eyed Helga bent over the Heatmor pack, shielding them with her last fragments of strength; the towers of lava come crashing down into the pit again, dissolving into the sea of fire around the tiny rock platform... the attack subsided!! Then that has to mean...<br />
<br />
Your eyes instinctively shift over to the titan - and find Heatran's eyes glazed over, its helmet falling to pieces, massive iron fragments falling in the lava below. The Lava Dome Pokemon's breathing is shallow, his body no longer moving. With the last remnant of its consciousness, it gazes at you attempting to look defiant still, but manages to utter nothing more than a weak cry. You watch Heatran's body merge with the surrounding magma, vanishing into the liquid flames, becoming one with Mt. Aduro once again. You wonder if mythical beings such as him ever truly die, but when the platforms start to lower due to the magma beneath cooling down, you have your answer:<br />
<br />
The God of Mt. Aduro is gone, and with it, the volcano's activity. Aduro is no longer live, its burning heart has cooled off, and for the first time in millennia, it is now an inactive volcano. The long term repercussions on Cascadia's ecosystem remain to be seen, but one thing is certain - Heatran's reign of terror is over, and you have saved not only the pack of Heatmor, but the entire population of Aduro whom the Legendary Pokemon held in slavery!<br />
<br />
<b><i>[Helga has gained 2 Levels!]</i></b><br />
<br />
Helga lets go of the group she was protecting, and they rush over to their fallen leader. After much insistence he comes to, blinking in confusion at first, but quickly realizing what just happened. He struggles to his feet and gazes over at you with immense gratitude in his eyes. Just then, Meowth tugs at your leg and points to a nearby spot on the ground, to an area where lava has just turned to basalt. Something glimmers in the middle of the black rock, and the feline goes to retrieve it. He comes back with a decidedly burning hot, but otherwise easily identifiable item - a piece of Heatran's helmet partially molten into a spherical shape. Meowth hurriedly hands you the

<b>1x Iron Ball</b>, glad to get rid of the incandescent slump of metal.<br />
<br />
Commotion stirs behind you, and you look back to find the tunnel previously blocked off by the landslide be reopened by the collective efforts of several Pokemon - among them Numel, Magby, Magmar, even the occasional Koffing. They have all come to see the miracle for themselves, and stare in amazement and disbelief at the now-quiet chamber where lava once flowed and Heatran ruled with an iron fist.<br />
<br />
Doduo's corpse is picked up by some of the Pokemon and put to rest beneath a heap of rocks, as if giving the brave bird a proper burial; still, no sign of Kyle, who probably couldn't be found anywhere in the collapsed tunnel. The inhabitants of Aduro approach you, fearful at first but unquestionably grateful. One of the older-looking of the group, a Magmar, approaches the Heatmor leader and helps him to his feet. By their exchange, it seems the Spitfire Pokemon is apologizing to the anteater, and both shake hands to seal the reconciliation.<br />
<br />
The Magmar then turns to you speaks in its native language, which Meowth promptly translates, explaining that the Aduro natives want you to have what Heatran considered his crown jewel and the mark of his absolute dominion. They want nothing to do with the memory of such a tyrant and will be glad if you would accept it as a parting gift, ridding the mountain of the last remnant of Heatran's reign. Magmar signals to a group of Numel and they start digging through the solidified magma where the Lava Dome Pokemon once slept. After a while they return, rolling something along the ground - a sphere emitting a red glow and intense warmth. Unlike the Iron Ball Meowth retrieved earlier, this sphere had a dormant power of its won, an active core filled with energy; it's easy to see why Heatran regarded it as his most prized possession. You kneel down and pick up the

<b>1x Flame Orb</b>, contemplating its beauty and, most of all, the significance of the item...<br />
<br />
It seems your adventure has come to an end, after a grueling battle of wits and power against a Legendary Pokemon from which you emerged victorious. You faced loss along the way, having to witness the deaths of a Magmar, some of Heatmor, and even Kyle and his silly, yet gutsy Doduo...If it weren't for them, who knows if you had been successful. But now, when all is said and done, you and your prized Pokemon have accomplished something very few Trainers can claim to have done - come face to face with a Legend and defeat it. What this means for Aduro and Cascadia as a whole remains a mystery, but a monster such as Heatran had to be stopped, no questions asked.<br />
<br />
Your duty fulfilled, and your partners thoroughly exhausted, you decide it's time to leave this place and finally go home. When you turn around to say your goodbyes, you find the Heatmor leader standing right in front of you, looking down at the ground, at a loss for words, while the rest of his family seem to be egging him on to do something. And although you can't speak their language, you get the feeling you know what this is about....<br />
<br />
Is there anything you want to say to Heatmor before you leave? </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">This was it. The lives of the Heatmor pack- hell, probably the lives of everyone in that chamber- hung in the balance, everything depending on this last gambit on Keith and Helga's part. A last-ditch effort, and whether it would work, whether it would spare the Heatmor, whether it would do as Keith was desperately hoping it would, remained to be seen. Helga had fired her Focus Blast, and the next couple of seconds were the longest hours of Keith's life. Heatran noticed the oncoming fire move, and was nothing short of pissed.<br />
<br />
<i><b>FOOL! YOU HAVE BROUGHT THIS UPON YOURSELF!</b></i><br />
<br />
Keith could only watch at this point- he and Heatran had both gone for their last-ditch efforts, and all that remained was to see which last-ditch effort would triumph. As the Magma Storm threatened to utterly destroy the poor Heatmor... the Focus Blast hit its target! Keith watched, not moving, not blinking, holding his breath, as the Fighting move resulted in a violent explosion. Smoke flew everywhere, Keith's vision completely obscured as he desperately tried to see what had happened... and the first thing he saw was the pillars of magma crashing back down into the pit. The attack had stopped! And that had to mean...<br />
<br />
Keith turned his eyes on Heatran. The helmet was crumbling away, chunks of metal splashing in the magma. His eyes were glazed over, his breathing shallow, his body unmoving. And yet, with what remained of his consciousness- of his life!- Heatran tried to look defiant, but could only squeak out a weak grunt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fool,&quot; Keith smirked, as it started to sink in just what this meant, just what was happening here. &quot;<i>You</i> have brought this upon <i>your</i>self,&quot; he said to the Lava Dome Pokémon, echoing Heatran's final words as the Fire/Steel-type's body started to vanish into the magma.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa,&quot; Meowth remarked, for as Heatran melted into the lava, the lava itself started to cool.<br />
<br />
&quot;'Whoa' just about covers it,&quot; Keith nodded. &quot;I... We... We did it. We... We did it!&quot; A broad smile crept up his face as it finally hit him- Heatran was no more, his tyrannical reign over Mt. Aduro ended at long last! And with this came an unexpected side effect- the end of Mt. Aduro's volcanic activity. Keith wasn't exactly sure how that'd impact the environment, but considering the alternative was the continued tyrannical reign of Heatran, right now he wasn't too worried!<br />
<br />
Helga released her protective grip on the Heatmor pack, who rushed over to rouse their fallen leader. The Heatmor leader awoke after a while, initially confused, but Keith smiled as the truth seemed to dawn on the Fire-type. The Heatmor gave Keith a look of immense gratitutde, which Keith returned- that adventurous anteater's antics saved him and his Pokémon on more than one occasion. This victory was just as much his doing as it was Keith's.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Meowth murmured, jumping down off of Keith's shoulder. He walked over to something glimmering amidst the black rock that was once lava, and raced back to Keith, gingerly juggling a dark-colored orb made of heavy metal. Quickly, he handed it off to Keith, who likewise started juggling it gingerly, but it was already cooling down to the point where he could hold it without getting incinerated. Satisfied that it wouldn't set his equipment on fire, Keith stowed the Iron Ball away in his backpack. It was, he realized, a trophy- a piece of Heatran's corpse he could keep for himself as kind of a trophy, though honestly, he had saved (most of) the Heatmor and the entirety of Mt. Aduro, and that in and of itself was enough for him.<br />
<br />
Keith then heard a commotion behind him and wheeled around- numerous Pokémon were gathering, mostly Fire-types with a few Koffing in the mix, looking on in awe and disbelief. They could hardly believe that Heatran, the tyrant who for the longest time ruled over them, was now dead. As some of them stared, others set to work burying Doduo. There was no sign of Kyle, however... had the cave-in obliterated him that utterly that there was nothing left to bury? Or did he somehow make it out alive? Keith didn't know either way, but hoped for it to be the latter, even if the former was far more likely.<br />
<br />
One of the Pokémon, an older Magmar, helped the Heatmor leader to his feet and they began conversing. Meowth translated their speech- the Magmar was apologizing to Heatmor, and Heatmor was accepting said apology. Keith couldn't be sure, but was it possible that this Magmar was the surviving member of the pair that had attacked the Heatmor pack when Keith first encountered them? Either way, whatever this Magmar had done to Heatmor was forgiven and forgotten... and then Magmar turned to Keith and started speaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Magmar's sayin' dat da natives here wants youse ta have Heatran's crown jewel,&quot; Meowth translated. &quot;Dey don't want nuttin' ta do wit da memory of dat tyrant, but tink it'll make a nice partin' gift fer youse.&quot; As he finished speaking, a group of Numel came to Keith, rolling an orange sphere along the ground. Keith picked it up, feeling a heat coming from within. Unlike the Iron Ball, this was heated by its own mysterious power.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; Keith murmured, as he gazed at the Flame Orb. &quot;I can see why Heatran considered this his crown jewel... Still, it's a pretty cool item. Thank you,&quot; he said to the Magmar and Numel.<br />
<br />
With all that, it seemed to finally be time to go. As Keith turned to say his goodbyes to the now-safe Heatmor pack, he saw the leader standing right in front of him, looking down, speechless. What was more, the other Heatmor seemed to be egging him on to do something. And Keith's eyes widened as he realized what they might be getting at. Meowth looked- sure enough, there was that gleam in Keith's eyes, but for once, the Scratch Cat Pokémon didn't roll his eyes. He knew what Keith was about to ask Heatmor, and he for one heartily approved.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heatmor,&quot; Keith said, crouching down to address the leader of the pack of incendiary anteaters. &quot;First off, I want to thank you. You saved our asses just as many times as we saved yours. If you hadn't been helping us out, no way we could've ended Heatran's reign of terror.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya got dat right,&quot; Meowth nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;And second,&quot; Keith added, rummaging through his backpack. &quot;I think I speak for my entire team when I say we'd love to have you come with us.&quot; At that point, he extracted from his backpack the third spherical object he'd held in his hands in the past few minutes- a <a href="http://forums.upnetwork.net/showpost.php?p=432963&amp;postcount=252" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.upnetwork.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D432963%26postcount%3D252&amp;hash=811d4609fb052a07e33ceef4b332990f" rel="nofollow noopener">Level Ball</a>. He held the Apricorn-made sphere out to the Heatmor leader, the button facing the Fire-type. &quot;You and me, we make an awesome team, and you're an incredible Pokémon. I'm sure you'll get along with the rest of my Pokémon, too. So, what do you say?&quot; Keith asked, still holding out the Level Ball, waiting anxiously for Heatmor's answer. Meowth, meanwhile, was smiling and nodding at Heatmor, making it clear that he too would welcome the Fire-type onto the team.</span></span><br />
