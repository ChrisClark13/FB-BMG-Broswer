<b>Uhhhh:</b> Harry comes up to you and examines you from head to toe. He goes around you one circle before saying, “Yeah, I think Tom has an extra coat that might fit.” As though on cue, the other man heads toward a small group of bags off to the side. He quickly pulls out a black coat. It looks very thick, but when you put it on, you at least feel a bit warmer. Gaspard quickly climbs inside the coat clinging to your belly. You can feel him shaking.<br />
<br />
“Well, since you're here, wanna help us?” Tom outright stated with much gusto in his voice.<br />
<br />
“Don't be rude, now,” Harry replied. “So sorry about that, Tom can get a bit....impatient. You see, we're here to find some sort of meteor that fell down around here the day before yesterday. My friends and I are astronomers and we wanted to investigate it.”<br />
<br />
Tom quickly came up to you and finished, “So that's our story. Unfortunately, tomorrow's snowstorm may cover it up to the point where we may not even be able to find it. And we will need all the help we can get to look for it tonight. What do you say, you in?”<br />
<br />
The man does seem very eager to recruit you, but then again there is a snow storm tomorrow according to him. <i>What will you do?</i><br />

<b><u>Geyser Park </u></b>- please reply in <b>red </b><br />
<b>Hayward:</b> Keo nods his head ready to fight. The Magmar gets up and his fist glows with a bright flame. Both Keo and the Magmar charge towards one another. Keo stops and <b>Leers</b> at the Magmar, who at first gets a bit set back by the attack, but then he continues his charge, unleashing a <b>Fire Punch</b> on the Kingler. Keo just shakes off the not-very-effective attack as he charges his next attack. The Magmar delivers a quick <b>Smokescreen</b> inside the cave. In such an enclosed area, the smoke covers you and the man too. You look toward the battlefield to see some sort of glow followed by a definite “THWAK!”<br />
<br />
The smoke rises to reveal that the Magmar is lying on the ground unconscious while Keo stands victorious over its opponent. The man looks flabbergasted at this sight. He recalls the Magmar and starts to back away into his cave. He turns to run when you start to feel an <b>Earthquake</b> from somewhere. The cave starts shaking violently as the path that the older man was going to take starts to cave in, leaving him in a dead end with you blocking his only exit. <br />
<br />
“What are you going to do with me?” the man asks. He gets into some sort of strange fighting pose as he continues, “You can try to silence me, but I won't go down easy.” He charges to you and trips over a rock. <br />
<br />
<i>What will you do?</i><br />
<i>Keo gains a level for defeating Magmar.</i><br />

<b><u>Aduron Chasm </u></b>- Please reply in <b>Red </b><br />
<b>Charminions</b>: You head closer to the four legged Pokemon. Some <b>Embers</b> flew from its direction to you. Apollo quickly responds by rushing into the fray. Its claws slightly glow as it <b>Scratches</b> the Pokemon, but he is quickly shot down by a powerful <b>Tackle</b>. The attack causes Apollo to fly back toward you. The Pokemon jumps down the cliff and as you rush up to said cliff to see what was going on, an Ember whizzes by your face. You can now much more clearly see the Pokemon. It appears to be a Numel, and it looks scared. The Fire-/Ground-type Pokemon is standing on a little extension jutting from the mountain.<br />
<br />
Apollo jumps onto your shoulder to get a better view; however, as soon as he does, the Numel begins panicking. It runs into a nearby cave just below you. You cannot tell just how big this cave is from your angle, but you can see two ways to get down there. The first way is that there is an extension to the side of the mountain that can let you safely traverse it, but it looks like it would take a while to get there. The other way is the same way the Numel took, sliding down the face of the cliff and hope that you can catch yourself onto the extension. <br />

<b><u>The Lithogic River</u></b> – Please reply in <b>Red</b><br />
<br />
<b>Flame Mistress</b>: You decide to head into the Litogic River in hopes to find some rare gems and whatnot, however your bickering with Charlotte does take away some of your concentration. As soon as you two agree to stop your bickering, you trip over your own two legs. Thankfully, you didn't trip into the lava, otherwise your adventure would have been cut...very short. You also see something shiny at the ground. As you pick it up, it looks like a very valuable gem of some sort. This thing that makes you and your Vulpix notably happy and excited. Before you can place it some place safe, a Growlithe jumps on you, causing you to drop the gem. <br />
<br />
The Growlithe rushes off you and grabs the gem. It looks just as happy as you did a moment ago. Its tail starts wagging looking at you with its cute eyes. The Growlithe then turns around and starts running in the opposite direction with your newly found gem.<br />
<br />

<span style="color: darkorchid"><span style="font-size: 10px">Venom Island</span><br />
<br />
<b><u>Plague Swamp</u></b> – Please reply in <b>Dark Orchid</b><br />
<b>Missingno. Master:</b> “Now where's the fun in that?” asked Renegade. He was still leaning by that tree as though he was either tired or bored. “But I'll tell you what. I am feeling a bit generous. Behind me is a pathway into the swamp. I placed a cage not too far down that path with your Weezing in it. If you want him back, you'll have to defeat my Gengar.”<br />
<br />
Your Qwilfish begins its <b>Frost Breath</b> attack, but a flash of light appears from one of your Pokeballs. It was the Grimer you caught not too long ago. He gets between Qwilfish and the other Grimers trying to stop the attack. You can tell that your Grimer does not want you to fight the others, even in its weakened state. Renegade just laughs at this before starting, “One last thing I forgot to mention. This fight will be one-on-one, the Grimers here are to make sure that you don't do any funny business. Should you try anything on my watch...well let's just say I won't have mercy.” Qwilfish looks confusedly at you awaiting your orders.<br />
<br />
Skuntank on the other hand, was ready to fight its opponent. It begins to <b>Focus</b> some <b>Energy</b>. It then charges in with its fangs glowing a dark black; however, the Gengar has other ideas, it slinks back into the shadows for a moment. Skuntank looks around for its opponent when it gets <b>Sucker Punched</b> on the side. It tries to attack with Crunch, but missed its opponent. Skuntank's claws started to gain a purple aura about it. The <b>Shadow Claw</b> was met up with the Gengar's own <b>Shadow Punch</b>. The two attackers tried to overpower the other one, at first it appeared that Gengar was going to have the upper hand, but Skuntank's attack finally burst through the punch, scoring a direct hit. The Gengar is flown back into its master, both of whom fall on the ground. You notice that despite the fact that the Gengar quickly got back up, Renegade continued to lay there, motionless.<br />

<br />
<b><u>Oniero Ruins</u></b> – Please reply in <b>Dark Orange</b><br />
<b>Celebii151:</b> You look into the hole, you notice that there is a slope that is just steep enough to allow you enough room to not to bump your head, but at the same time, it is not too steep for you to keep your balance on. You and Neptune slide slowly down the ramp, while Boing tries to keep steady, but it ultimately ends up rolling down the slope instead. The place around you appears to be a chamber of some sort, you see several chains on the walls and floors, but no skeletons. There appears to be no exit at first, but you soon hear something, <br />
<br />
<i>clatter, clatter, clatter</i>...<br />
<br />
You turn toward the source to see a skeleton walking toward you. It speaks in a very raspy voice, “Ah, so you are the trespasser, hmm. I thought we rid you years ago, Celes.” He holds up a Pokeball of some sort, “well, no longer will that be a problem. Yamask, take care of our...guest.” A gray pokemon with red eyes and a large mask sitting on its tail stares at you. <br />
<br />
“Yamask...” it says almost dreadfully. This weird skeleton definitely seems like he wants to battle you, but there is still the option of escape through the way you came, if you run. <br />
<br />

<span style="color: yellow"><span style="font-size: 10px">Ion Island</span><br />
<b><u>Eletron Plant</u></b> – Please reply in <b>Yellow</b><br />
<br />
<b>Xander Ketsu</b>: You decide to go to the Eletron Plant on Ion Island, and while your Pokemon are obviously here for pleasure rather than business, you are not subject to such privileges as much. You walk up to the powerplant, security let you through without much trouble. The powerplant is very large. One of the first things you notice is the large amounts of electricity arcing from the roof, giving you an idea on how much power is being generated in this island. Several scientists and Pokemon alike are located all around you. One of the scientists gives you a glance before approaching you. He stands a bit taller than you, but he has a friendly demeanor. He starts, “Oh hello, I haven't seen you here before.” He looks at your Pokemon for a moment before he continues, “Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Dr. Cox. I'm one of the scientists that work here. Mind if I ask why you're here.” He pushes up his glasses and continues, “Because if you're not too busy, I'd like some help.”<br />
<br />
This guy is asking for some help, but there appears to be other things you can do. <br />

<br />
<b><u>Salin City</u></b> – Please reply in <b>Silver</b><br />
<b>Empoleon Dynamite</b>: You head into Salin City in hopes to get your sense of adventuring back into gear. After your ride to the Salin City Gym, you see several buildings lining this city, one in particular was massive compared to the others with a sign reading, “SALIN CITY GYM! COME ONE COME ALL!” This place is crowded today, several trainers are lining up for fighting.<br />
<br />
A person next to you says, “Hey, newbie. What're you doing here?” You look towards the direction of the voice, but instead of seeing some sort of person, you see a Chatot, pecking at its wing. It continues, “Because if you're not busy, you should challenge the gym.” You notice a banner hanging from its leg, reading about it. You notice that several other Chatot are lined up the streets like this. Each of them sounding like they are advertising the gym, for some reason. The banner reads, “Come fight the original Gym Leaders. This week only.”<br />
<br />
Something seems very festive about the stadium itself though. Upon closer inspection, you see several streamers and balloons tied up around. “Hard to believe that it's been 10 years,” a different voice says. This time you see an older gentleman standing behind you. He stands at just a bit shorter than you. You notice that he is wearing a musty, brown trench coat and a fedora. “Pardon me, sir,” he says as he passes by you. This place is pretty crowded, but you could see what the commotion is about with these “original gym leaders”.<br />

These islands contain the some of the most diverse typing of Pokemon in the entirety of Fizzy Bubbles. All of these islands are actually volcanoes, but the majority of them have gone dormant. As many Pokemon spend all their lives here, many fossils of Pokemon and plants are buried in the depths of the volcanic ground, maybe some of these may be worth a look? You start out on the island that you first choose, via a ferry. In order to change areas afterward, Surf or Fly is a necessity.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><i><span style="color: green">Lily Island</span></i></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px">With a totally different landscape from the first, Lily Island is the second largest of the archipelago. Completely covered with vegetation, this island was also formed by a volcano. However, erosion has taken this island down to almost flat, and giving many homes to all types of grass and bug Pokemon among others. Inside the dense jungle, which takes up about a half of the island, there is a very small lake. There are two different forests on the island, and you can tell when you've gone from one forest to another. Besides being divided by the Diamond River, some strange force causes them to have completely different climates as well...<br />
<b><span style="color: green">The Silver Forest</span></b> - The forest which takes up a bit more than half of the island, Silver Island is named for the silver veins the leaves are adorned with.

</blockquote><span style="color: green"><span style="font-size: 9px">Hugo and Krabby wander aimlessly through the large forest. Hugo seems entertained by the adventure, but Krabby seemed less than impressed, even a bit annoyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you look at these trees? Have you ever seen trees like this before?&quot; Hugo said to the crab Pokemon.<br />
<br />
*click...click* responded Krabby unenthusiastically with it's large pincers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, you don't have to get an attitude,&quot; Hugo retorted.<br />
<br />
*click* <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, is that so?&quot; Hugo argued. <br />
<br />
Krabby seemed to be winning this battle of wits. Hugo knew Krabby and knew his sardonic attitude. Perhaps Krabby was just bored. Krabby wouldn't be all that enthused by trees to begin with. Why would he? Or maybe he was just hungry. Either way, Hugo tried not to take it personally. After a few minutes more of wondering, Hugo cleared a little brush off the ground and plopped down, pulling a sandwich from his bag. He ate the sandwich and tossed a bag of potato chips to Krabby. Krabby liked eating the chips almost as much as he liked tearing the bag to shreds. <br />
<br />
Hugo looked up from his sandwich and gave a sly smirk to Krabby, who responded with a...smile...I guess. If Krabby could smile, that's what he was doing. The duo continued their lunch, taking a break from searching for adventure. They would let the adventure come to them.</span></span></div>

<b>Charminions</b>: You head closer to the four legged Pokemon. Some <b>Embers</b> flew from its direction to you. Apollo quickly responds by rushing into the fray. Its claws slightly glow as it <b>Scratches</b> the Pokemon, but he is quickly shot down by a powerful <b>Tackle</b>. The attack causes Apollo to fly back toward you. The Pokemon jumps down the cliff and as you rush up to said cliff to see what was going on, an Ember whizzes by your face. You can now much more clearly see the Pokemon. It appears to be a Numel, and it looks scared. The Fire-/Ground-type Pokemon is standing on a little extension jutting from the mountain.<br />
<br />
Apollo jumps onto your shoulder to get a better view; however, as soon as he does, the Numel begins panicking. It runs into a nearby cave just below you. You cannot tell just how big this cave is from your angle, but you can see two ways to get down there. The first way is that there is an extension to the side of the mountain that can let you safely traverse it, but it looks like it would take a while to get there. The other way is the same way the Numel took, sliding down the face of the cliff and hope that you can catch yourself onto the extension. <br />
<br />
<i>What will you do?</i></span></span>

<br />
&quot;Holy ****!&quot; Charm yelled out as Apollo charges forward to scratch the foe, only to get knocked back by a powerful tackle. The pokemon proceeds to jump down a cliff but just as they follow in pursuit, more embers fly by Charm's head. He quickly ducked away in fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;This place is either super dangerous or super awesome,&quot; Charm mumbled, thinking the fire attacks that almost burned his face off was also very awesome looking as well. He looks to see that the four legged pokemon was actually a Numel, who seems quite scared that a trainer and his little pokemon are trying to attack him. Charm almost began feeling bad that they were attacking an innocent pokemon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, it's a scared little guy,&quot; he said as Apollo hopped onto his shoulder, causing the Numel to freak out and slide down the cliff he's standing on. The camel Pokemon then scurries off to a cave nearby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm should we follow him?&quot; Charm asked his partner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Torchi-tor,&quot; the Torchic merely replied. Probably meaning that he'll go wherever his trainer wants. Charm examined the area and realized they had two options if they want to follow the Numel. One way was to go around on a safe looking extension, although it could take some time before they reach there. The other way was to slide down the cliff just like Numel. He considers if it's even worth it to follow the frightened Numel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... let's take the long way, Apollo. I'm not quite interested in that Numel, so maybe we can find some more interesting pokemon as we move along this longer route,&quot; Charm finally decided. Apollo nodded and puts on a serious face, ready to protect his trainer from any more unexpected attacks. The duo marched on towards the side extension, looking forward to the already exciting adventure that awaits them.</span></span></div>

<b><u>Plague Swamp</u></b> – Please reply in <b>Dark Orchid</b><br />
<b>Missingno. Master:</b> “Now where's the fun in that?” asked Renegade. He was still leaning by that tree as though he was either tired or bored. “But I'll tell you what. I am feeling a bit generous. Behind me is a pathway into the swamp. I placed a cage not too far down that path with your Weezing in it. If you want him back, you'll have to defeat my Gengar.”<br />
<br />
Your Qwilfish begins its <b>Frost Breath</b> attack, but a flash of light appears from one of your Pokeballs. It was the Grimer you caught not too long ago. He gets between Qwilfish and the other Grimers trying to stop the attack. You can tell that your Grimer does not want you to fight the others, even in its weakened state. Renegade just laughs at this before starting, “One last thing I forgot to mention. This fight will be one-on-one, the Grimers here are to make sure that you don't do any funny business. Should you try anything on my watch...well let's just say I won't have mercy.” Qwilfish looks confusedly at you awaiting your orders.<br />
<br />
Skuntank on the other hand, was ready to fight its opponent. It begins to <b>Focus</b> some <b>Energy</b>. It then charges in with its fangs glowing a dark black; however, the Gengar has other ideas, it slinks back into the shadows for a moment. Skuntank looks around for its opponent when it gets <b>Sucker Punched</b> on the side. It tries to attack with Crunch, but missed its opponent. Skuntank's claws started to gain a purple aura about it. The <b>Shadow Claw</b> was met up with the Gengar's own <b>Shadow Punch</b>. The two attackers tried to overpower the other one, at first it appeared that Gengar was going to have the upper hand, but Skuntank's attack finally burst through the punch, scoring a direct hit. The Gengar is flown back into its master, both of whom fall on the ground. You notice that despite the fact that the Gengar quickly got back up, Renegade continued to lay there, motionless.<br />
<br />
<i>What will you do?</i><br />

</blockquote><span style="color: darkorchid"><span style="font-size: 9px">&quot;Funny how it's the thief who wants to play fair,&quot; growled Missingno. Master as he assessed the situation. Renegade was unconscious, but his Gengar was not. He briefly considered fleeing the fight and just making a break for Weezing's cage, but then remembered Gengar's Mean Look. No, a fight was inevitable.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, Grimer, return,&quot; started Missingno. Master, as he held out the Rocket Ball and withdrew Grimer. &quot;I was gonna have you negotiate with the other Grimer, but if they're under hypnosis like I think they are, it won't do any good anyway. Qwilfish, I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait. I don't want to take the chance that the Grimer won't attack just because Renegade is out cold. If he even is, anyway. The sneak could be faking for all I know. Watch Noctowl, make sure it stays unconscious. If it wakes, attack it at once with <b>Frost Breath</b>. Skuntank, change tactics. Hit Gengar with your <b>Sweet Kiss</b> to confuse it, then follow up with <b>Fire Spin</b>. Once Gengar is good and trapped in the flames, pour on a <b>Flamethrower</b> attack.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two Pokémon nodded their acknowledgement of these orders and began to carry them out.<br />

These islands contain the some of the most diverse typing of Pokemon in the entirety of Fizzy Bubbles. All of these islands are actually volcanoes, but the majority of them have gone dormant. As many Pokemon spend all their lives here, many fossils of Pokemon and plants are buried in the depths of the volcanic ground, maybe some of these may be worth a look? You start out on the island that you first choose, via a ferry. In order to change areas afterward, Surf or Fly is a necessity.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><i><span style="color: green">Lily Island</span></i></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px">With a totally different landscape from the first, Lily Island is the second largest of the archipelago. Completely covered with vegetation, this island was also formed by a volcano. However, erosion has taken this island down to almost flat, and giving many homes to all types of grass and bug Pokemon among others. Inside the dense jungle, which takes up about a half of the island, there is a very small lake. There are two different forests on the island, and you can tell when you've gone from one forest to another. Besides being divided by the Diamond River, some strange force causes them to have completely different climates as well...<br />
<b><span style="color: green">The Silver Forest</span></b> - The forest which takes up a bit more than half of the island, Silver Island is named for the silver veins the leaves are adorned with. A deciduous forest, you'll mainly see flying and bug types here, due to the lack of ground vegetation. There is a rest stop somewhere in the forest, helping trainers on their way.</span>

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: green">Chad and his little fire mouse Cyndaquil entered the forest. Having just got off the ferry to Lily Island, the pair were eager to explore this new land. Chad was particularly excited with this adventure because he knew he'd get to fulfill a promise to one of his Pokemon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold up Cyndaquil,&quot; he called out. He reached for a Pokeball. He tossed it in the air after enlarging it, and the ball clicked as it opened. With a flash of white light a dark blue Pokemon appeared. &quot;Come on out Heracross.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heracross yawned as he looked around to see his surroundings. As soon as he noticed all the trees around him, he perked up and turned back at Chad. &quot;Cross?&quot; Heracross asked.<br />
<br />
As if he knew exactly what Heracross said Chad answered, &quot;Yes really. Happy birthday buddy. I figured you'd like it here better than the lake a while back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cyndaquil walked over wanting to celebrate, but his flame was still lit. Heracross saw the flame and got a little worried. He began to get defensive. He stepped back, got in a battle stance. <br />
<br />
&quot;Cyndaquil! <i>Again</i> with the flame? C'mon now!&quot; Chad stepped between the two. Cyndaquil extinguished his flame immediately. &quot;Thank you. Let's get going. We're going to find Heracross a tree with some sweet sap or perhaps a Combee hive.&quot; He turned around towards the interior of the forest. He could tell the notion of a Combee hive made Heracross happy.<br />
<br />
The trio trekked further in the forest. Cyndaquil was beside him, and Heracross was fluttering around looking at the trees they passed. Chad walked over to one tree that had some low-hanging leaves. &quot;Look at these leaves,&quot; he showed Cyndaquil and Heracross some leaves. &quot;See that silver? My parents told me about this place. This is why it's called the 'Silver Forest.' Ok, let's keep going.&quot;</span></span><br />

First off I'd like to say, I'm so so sorry for how late I am. Secondly, welcome newcomers, Please remember to post using [noparse][/noparse] tags.<span style="font-size: 9px"><br />

<b><u>Geyser Park </u></b>- please reply in <b>red </b><br />
<b>Hayward:</b> Keo nods his head ready to fight. The Magmar gets up and his fist glows with a bright flame. Both Keo and the Magmar charge towards one another. Keo stops and <b>Leers</b> at the Magmar, who at first gets a bit set back by the attack, but then he continues his charge, unleashing a <b>Fire Punch</b> on the Kingler. Keo just shakes off the not-very-effective attack as he charges his next attack. The Magmar delivers a quick <b>Smokescreen</b> inside the cave. In such an enclosed area, the smoke covers you and the man too. You look toward the battlefield to see some sort of glow followed by a definite “THWAK!”<br />
<br />
The smoke rises to reveal that the Magmar is lying on the ground unconscious while Keo stands victorious over its opponent. The man looks flabbergasted at this sight. He recalls the Magmar and starts to back away into his cave. He turns to run when you start to feel an <b>Earthquake</b> from somewhere. The cave starts shaking violently as the path that the older man was going to take starts to cave in, leaving him in a dead end with you blocking his only exit. <br />
<br />
“What are you going to do with me?” the man asks. He gets into some sort of strange fighting pose as he continues, “You can try to silence me, but I won't go down easy.” He charges to you and trips over a rock. <br />
<br />
<i>What will you do?</i><br />
<i>Keo gains a level for defeating Magmar.</i></span><span style="color: silver"><br />

<span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">In a cavern beneath Aduro Island's Geyser Park in the Cascadia archipelago, the young trainer known as William Hale hollers out encouragement to his Kingler Keo as the overgrown river crab continues to trade blows with their mysterious adversary's antagonistic Magmar. As Keo rushes in for a Crabhammer, the Spitfire Pokemon retaliates by belching out a thick cloud of black smoke which in such a tiny enclosed space, instantly envelops the battlefield, severly obscuring Will's vision and causing him to cough and splutter and cover his mouth with his forearm.<br />
<br />
The din of combat echoes throughout the rocky catacomb however and as Will tries to avoid breathing in any more of the noxious smoke, he </span></span><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px"> strains his ears trying to make sense of the sounds he hears and </span></span><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">wonders how his cantankerous crustacean comrade is fairing</span></span><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">. Just then, a flash of light catches the lad's eye followed closely by the sound of a deafening blow as it connects with its intended target before the room fades into total silence. All Will can do is hold his breath, hope for the best, and wait for the smoke to clear.<br />
<br />
And clear it does. Moments later, the dark cloud dissipates and Will lets out a grateful sigh, relieved to see that Keo has emerged victorious and now stands above the fallen form of the mysterious man's Magmar. On the contrary, Will's opponent stands along the opposite wall, a look of complete astonishment on his face at this unexpected turn of events. Scowling, the man quickly recalls his fainted partner and makes a mad dash for the far end of the tunnel. Before Will can react and give chase however, the whole place gives one giant lurch and pieces of the stony wall and ceiling suddenly rain down to block the passageway and seal off the man's only escape route.<br />
<br />
Turning to face Will, the man adopts a combat stance and shouts out a threat, before running straight for the lad, who bolts in shock at the man's aggressive attitude. Before the man can attack however, he trips over some of the jagged rubbles that are strewn about the ground and lands face first on the cavern's rocky floor where he lays without moving. Seeing the man's predicament, Will softens his face then turns to Keo and the two momentarily share a look. With a shrug, Will motions for Keo to follow him and the two friends trot over to help the man to his feet. Perhaps now, Will reasons, their foe will be a bit more civil...or at least willing to talk...</span></span><br />

As many Pokemon spend all their lives here, many fossils of Pokemon and plants are buried in the depths of the volcanic ground, maybe some of these may be worth a look? You start out on the island that you first choose, via a ferry. In order to change areas afterward, Surf or Fly is a necessity.</span><br />

It is said that long ago, a huge battle which pitted two powerful electric Pokemon electrically charged the island, causing most Pokemon that lived here to die. However, electric types thrive here, and recently people have learned how to use the electricity to their own use. <br />

</blockquote><span style="color: yellow"><span style="font-size: 9px">Melissa and her Cyndaquil, Wildfire, could see the lake from where they stood, slightly above it and still some distance away. The reflection of the sun off the surface of the curving lake had Melissa squinting against the light, before she turned her attention back to the path that would, apparently, lead them there. The girl trudged along the path in silence for a few moments, the Cyndaquil perched comfortably on her left shoulder and glancing around curiously, before she sighed and nudged Wildfire.<br />
<br />
&quot;D'you think we'll get there soon, Wildfire?&quot; she wondered idly, squinting in the direction of the lake again. &quot;I figured we'd be there by now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Qui-il&quot; was the response she received, along with a movement that she supposed was a shrug. &quot;Cyndaquil.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh, can't be helped.&quot; The teen made sure to only lift her right shoulder in a shrug, before she lifted the Cyndaquil off her shoulder and placed him on the ground. She grinned in response to his questioning &quot;Quil?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Race ya there,&quot; she told him, taking off in a sprint. Her starter blinked after her bemusedly, before he squealed indignantly and gave chase.</span></span></div>

<span style="color: yellow"><b>SW</b> - <i>Electron Plant</i><br />
<i>Please reply in <b>Yellow</b>.</i><br />
<br />
As the boat docked at the Electron Plant, you decide to give Jolteon some briefing when you notice the shady character had already dashed off towards the island. As you exit the boat to meet up with her, you suddenly collide with a stranger, causing both parties to fall to the ground. You open your eyes to see the shinning sun and papers flying everywhere, when one of them suddenly lands in your face. <i>“Damn it! Get back here!!”</i> shouted a disgruntled feminine voice. Pulling the paper off your face you see that it is a flyer. <i>“Pack up and ship out! This is the Pokemon’s land without a doubt!”</i> As you read the flyer, a hand viciously snatches it out of your hand. <i>“Watch where you’re going! I nearly lost all my flyers!”</i> scolded a woman with the same voice you heard just moments ago. She appeared to be tall with chocolate brown hair that was messily styled into a bun, wavy strands fluttering in the light ocean breeze, and her eyes were a bright crystal blue. Her style was very relaxed, a white flowing top just thin enough to see a black bra underneath, black short shorts that were cuffed at the ends, and navy blue slip-ons with grey stripes. <i>“On top of all that, you’re making me late by not helping me!”</i> raged the woman as she stressfully chases all the remaining papers to save them from being lost forever. It seems as through she's gesturing you to give her a hand.<br />
<br />
<i>Whatever will you do?</i><br />
<br />
<b>Myahoo</b> - <i>Storm Lake</i><br />
<i>Please reply in <b>Yellow</b>.</i><br />
<br />
As you and your Cyndaquil playfully race towards the lake, you begin the see the massive body of water shimmering from the sun’s refection. After just a few moments the two of you end up at the shore of Storm Lake. The water was near completely still, and the sand under you was as soft as a tempurpedic mattress. As you gaze at the scenery, you suddenly hear footsteps coming towards you. You turn around to see a man, “Sure is beautiful isn’t it?” he rhetorically asked as he also admired the landscaping. This man was young, but not nearly as young as you. He had some scruff on his face and wore what appeared to be some sore of uniform. Tan top with short sleeves, and green handkerchief tied around the collar of his shirt, a pair of green shorts that matched his handkerchief, and black boots. On his shirt was a badge that read “Ranger”. “Sorry for intruding on you Miss, I just can’t help but get lost in the shimmering water of this lake… Oh! My name is Cam, nice to meet you,” he greeted, “may I ask what brings you to this neck of the woods? We don’t tend to get that many visitors as of late.”<br />
<br />
<i>What will you do?</i></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: green"><b>King G</b> - <i>Silver Forest</i><br />
<i>Please reply in <b>Green</b>.</i><br />
<br />
After trekking through the forest, you and your snappy Krabby decide to take a meal break and see what the forest has to offer you. Suddenly the bushes start rumbling and a small grey head pops out. You hear a cooing sound coming from the small creature, slowly the cooing sound multiplies from all around you. The bushes begin the rustle more violently. The small grey Pokemon pops out from the bush and reveals itself to be none other a Pidove. One by one more Pidove hop out from the bushes, continuously cooing at you. They begin to flap their wings violently, some even ascending just off the ground. As they become more impatient, the cooing becomes more demanding. Suddenly, the first one you saw swoops in and steals your sandwich. It's coo becomes more of a mocking coo and the flock of Pidove begin to fly off into the forest.<br />
<br />
<i>Hmmm, will you follow?</i><br />
<br />
<b>Jolteonjak</b> - <i>Silver Forest</i><br />
<i>Please reply in <b>Green</b>.</i><br />
<br />
Upon entering the forest with your Cyndaquil and the happy birthday boy, Heracross, you've made it your mission to find the perfect tree sap for the birthday bug to suck on. While searching, you take a moment to show your pokemon the indigenous silver leaves of Silver Forest. You are taken by surprise when you are barely missed by an arrow that is now embedded in the tree, and pretty deep at that. Attached to the arrow was a note that read:<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;GET OFF OUR LAND!!!!&quot;</i><br />
<br />
As you read the note, another arrow is shot at you, landing right below the previous arrow, and this time the arrow dug even deeper. Another note was attached, this one read:<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;OR FACE THE WRATH OF GOD!!!!&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Just as you finished reading the note and heavy booming sound echoed throughout the forest, suddenly you hear a faint rumbling sound coming from within the deep dark forest. The sound becomes louder and louder as you realize a stampede is coming your way. <br />
<br />
<i>Don't just stand there, do something!</i><br />

<br />
The Lithogic River:<br />
<br />
Haradion steped of the ferry with great anticipation.His shuckle sat on his shoulder looking at the black beaches as Haradion stepped up the beech and madse his way to the steady glow which was the Lithogic river. Shuckle did not stay in his pokeball at times, although sometimes he would go there to sulk... Small chance of that today though.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Shuckle, what do you think?&quot; He asked Shuckle as the disembarked ferry pulled away from the Island.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shuck... Shuckle Shuck...&quot; He murmered. he was clearly unimpressed with the Island.<br />
<br />
Shuckle, were not here to make a holiday home, were here to fianance our traveles, and build a team, remember?<br />
<br />
&quot;Shuckle Shuck. Shuck Shu...&quot; <br />
<br />
Was all shuckle said in reply. The Lava gems, from where the river had cooled were his main goal, and the goal of many people... Those gems could fianance his traveles. How some reainers could just get up and leave hom was beyound him. Traveling was expensive, and he had no desire to gamble away his food. Still the Lithogic River would sui him... A Number of Fire pokemon moved around in the distance. He looked away from them. By the time he reached the place they would be long gone, but it did remind him of his second objective. His journey could not be completed with just his Shuckle, he needed to catch some more pokemon, and Cascadia, with its huge diversity of pokemon was just the place - This made the river Ideal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lets go then Shuckle!&quot; And with that he turned his back on the sea and made his way to the bank of the river.</span></span></div>

Upon entering the forest with your Cyndaquil and the happy birthday boy, Heracross, you've made it your mission to find the perfect tree sap for the birthday bug to suck on. While searching, you take a moment to show your pokemon the indigenous silver leaves of Silver Forest. You are taken by surprise when you are barely missed by an arrow that is now embedded in the tree, and pretty deep at that. Attached to the arrow was a note that read:<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;GET OFF OUR LAND!!!!&quot;</i><br />
<br />
As you read the note, another arrow is shot at you, landing right below the previous arrow, and this time the arrow dug even deeper. Another note was attached, this one read:<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;OR FACE THE WRATH OF GOD!!!!&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Just as you finished reading the note and heavy booming sound echoed throughout the forest, suddenly you hear a faint rumbling sound coming from within the deep dark forest. The sound becomes louder and louder as you realize a stampede is coming your way. <br />
<br />
<i>Don't just stand there, do something!</i><br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: green">Chad was showing his Pokepals the unique silvery leaves the forest produces, when all of a sudden an arrow lodged itself in the very tree he was inspecting. Chad noticed a note attached to the arrow. He took the note off and read it, &quot;GET OFF OUR LAND!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Before he had a minute to react to the warning, another arrow plunged into the same tree just below the first arrow even deeper than the first. Chad jumped back quickly. &quot;What the deuce?&quot;<br />
<br />
The second arrow also had a note on it. He took the note, and it read, &quot;OR FACE THE WRATH OF GOD!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you kidding me?&quot; Chad asked annoyed. &quot;Looks like someone doesn't want us here guys.&quot; He looked at Cyndaquil and Heracross, the latter softly growling. &quot;Don't worry Heracross, I don't scare that easily. There were no warnings given to us on the ferry over. We just need to... Wait what's that sound?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad started to hear a loud booming sound. It eventually felt like the sound was coming from all directions in the forest, as the sound echoed all over. Next, Chad could hear light rumbling coming from a deeper part of the forest. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, this situation seems to be deteriorating quickly,&quot; Chad said worried. He looked at Cyndaquil and Heracross. &quot;The rumbling is getting louder.&quot; He turned to the source of the rumbling. His eyes widened as he realized what was happening. He withdrew a Pokeball. &quot;Cyndaquil, I think you should return to your Pokeball. I want you to be safe.&quot; He quickly aimed the ball at his little fire mouse, and it emitted a red beam which caused Cyndaquil to disappear. &quot;Heracross, let's get out of here!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad and Heracross began running away from the rumbling sound, dodging any trees that may be in their way. As he was running, Chad yelled out to his beetle, &quot;It's a stampede! We'll be crushed if we can't get any height between them and us! We need to find a sturdy-enough tree to climb and get out of danger! When we find a tree to climb, I'll need you to help guide me up the tree! I'm not sure you'll be strong enough to fly us both up!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad kept running, and Heracross began to fly now. 'This is all too strange,' he thought to himself. 'What caused the stampede? Are they Pokemon or this god from that note?'</span></span><br />

After trekking through the forest, you and your snappy Krabby decide to take a meal break and see what the forest has to offer you. Suddenly the bushes start rumbling and a small grey head pops out. You hear a cooing sound coming from the small creature, slowly the cooing sound multiplies from all around you. The bushes begin the rustle more violently. The small grey Pokemon pops out from the bush and reveals itself to be none other a Pidove. One by one more Pidove hop out from the bushes, continuously cooing at you. They begin to flap their wings violently, some even ascending just off the ground. As they become more impatient, the cooing becomes more demanding. Suddenly, the first one you saw swoops in and steals your sandwich. It's coo becomes more of a mocking coo and the flock of Pidove begin to fly off into the forest.<br />
<br />
<i>Hmmm, will you follow?</i><br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: green">&quot;YOU SON A BI---&quot; Hugo screamed at the birds as they began to fly off. &quot;THAT WAS MY LUNCH!&quot; <br />
<br />
Hugo's stomach growled in anger. He looked down at Krabby who was both unimpressed and a bit despondent. Krabby was always skeptical of Hugo and his training abilities, and this was something Hugo was painfully aware of. He knew that he would never be able to earn Krabby's respect if he continued to let this kind of stuff happen over and over again. So he knew there was really only one thing he could do; chase after the Pidove and get his sandwich back. Obviously he was going to need Krabby's help. <br />
<br />
&quot;You don't think we're going to let this just happen and not do anything about it, do you?&quot; he asked Krabby. The crab Pokemon perked up. &quot;We have to go after them. Jump on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hugo knew his best chance was to chase after them. Krabby was a capable fighter, but could he scuttle fast enough to catch up with a flock of birds? Doubtful. He crouched down and the crab Pokemon leaped onto his back, clutching onto his jacket with a strong grip from his pincer. In a few seconds, they were off.<br />
<br />
Hugo chased through the forest, ducking branches, jumping over holes, and avoiding tree trunks. Soon enough, they were actually not far behind the flock of Pidove who obviously wrote them off. He could clearly see the one that that stole his sandwich.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright...&quot; he said to Krabby, in between gasps for air. &quot;We can handle this. I want you to use <b>Harden</b> and protect yourself, then when I say &quot;three&quot; I'm going to toss you at them. I want you to quickly halt them by using <b>Icy Wind</b> and then show them whose boss by knocking them out of the sky with <b>AncientPower.</b> You got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Krabby's face said he was ready.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, here we go...one....two....THREE!!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Hugo grabbed Krabby off his back and launched him into the air headed straight for the Pidove. All while still running, somehow.</span></span></div>

<i>Please reply in <b>Yellow</b>.</i><br />
<br />
As you and your Cyndaquil playfully race towards the lake, you begin the see the massive body of water shimmering from the sun’s refection. After just a few moments the two of you end up at the shore of Storm Lake. The water was near completely still, and the sand under you was as soft as a tempurpedic mattress. As you gaze at the scenery, you suddenly hear footsteps coming towards you. You turn around to see a man, “Sure is beautiful isn’t it?” he rhetorically asked as he also admired the landscaping. This man was young, but not nearly as young as you. He had some scruff on his face and wore what appeared to be some sore of uniform. Tan top with short sleeves, and green handkerchief tied around the collar of his shirt, a pair of green shorts that matched his handkerchief, and black boots. On his shirt was a badge that read “Ranger”. “Sorry for intruding on you Miss, I just can’t help but get lost in the shimmering water of this lake… Oh! My name is Cam, nice to meet you,” he greeted, “may I ask what brings you to this neck of the woods? We don’t tend to get that many visitors as of late.”<br />
<br />
<i>What will you do?</i></span></span>

</div>
</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: yellow">By the time they reached the lake, both human and Pokemon were grinning and out of breath. Melissa walked along the sand, stumbling a bit as it shifted under her feet, and sat down facing the lake. Her Cyndaquil came over and sat on her lap, also facing out towards the lake, as they both caught their breath.<br />
<br />
<i>Storm Lake's a beautiful place,</i> Melissa thought, watching the sunlight reflect off of the lake's surface. She dug her hands into the soft sand and mused aloud, <b>&quot;I wouldn't mind coming here just for the view. It's really amazing, don'tcha think, Wildfire?&quot;</b> The little fire mouse nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
Footsteps behind the pair had them both looking towards the sound and quickly spotting the man approaching them. As he got closer, it became clear that he was wearing some sort of uniform and the badge on his shirt read &quot;Ranger&quot;; Melissa assumed that that was the man's job.<br />
<br />
<b>&quot;Sure is beautiful isn't it?&quot;</b> he said, and Melissa agreed softly. She'd never been very comfortable around people she didn't know and she didn't really like that he was currently towering over her, so she got to her feet, placing Wildfire back on her shoulder.<br />
<br />
<b>&quot;Sorry for intruding on you Miss, I just can't help but get lost in the shimmering water of this lake... Oh! My name is Cam, nice to meet you,&quot;</b> he said next, <b>&quot;may I ask what brings you to this neck of the woods? We don't tend to get that many visitors as of late.&quot;</b><br />
<br />
<b>&quot;Um, it's alright; the water <i>is</i> really beautiful,&quot;</b> Melissa replied politely. <b>&quot;I'm Melissa. It's nice to meet you, Cam.&quot;</b> She smiled at him briefly before continuing. <b>&quot;Well, I'd heard about the legend of the two powerful Pokemon being the reason this island's magnetic, so I got curious and got on the first ferry I could to get over here.

Melissa grinned back at him, before remembering something the Ranger said and turning back towards him. <b>&quot;Why don't you get many visitors? The view's amazing!&quot;</b> she asked curiously.</span></span></div>

<b>Uhhhh:</b> Harry comes up to you and examines you from head to toe. He goes around you one circle before saying, “Yeah, I think Tom has an extra coat that might fit.” As though on cue, the other man heads toward a small group of bags off to the side. He quickly pulls out a black coat. It looks very thick, but when you put it on, you at least feel a bit warmer. Gaspard quickly climbs inside the coat clinging to your belly. You can feel him shaking.<br />
<br />
“Well, since you're here, wanna help us?” Tom outright stated with much gusto in his voice.<br />
<br />
“Don't be rude, now,” Harry replied. “So sorry about that, Tom can get a bit....impatient. You see, we're here to find some sort of meteor that fell down around here the day before yesterday. My friends and I are astronomers and we wanted to investigate it.”<br />
<br />
Tom quickly came up to you and finished, “So that's our story. Unfortunately, tomorrow's snowstorm may cover it up to the point where we may not even be able to find it. And we will need all the help we can get to look for it tonight. What do you say, you in?”<br />
<br />
The man does seem very eager to recruit you, but then again there is a snow storm tomorrow according to him. <i>What will you do?</i></span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: lightblue">After Connor requested for a coat, Harry examined the young photographer from head to toe while going around you in a circle before saying, “Yeah, I think Tom has an extra coat that might fit.” And as if on cue, Tom went through their group's pile of bags and pulled out a black coat and handed it to Connor for him to put on. While it still seemed a bit too big for him, despite what Harry had said, he didn't want to complain since they did just help him keep himself warm. Gaspard quickly went into the zipped coat from underneatch, managing an &quot;Oh!&quot; from Connor before popping his head on the other end, just below Connor's head while clinging to his belly. Connor felt Gaspard shivering so he immediately hugged him from his position, trying to keep him warm. &quot;Wow, thanks so much!&quot; Connor said while showing his gratitude by bowing.<br />
<br />
“Well, since you're here, wanna help us?” Tom outright stated to the photographer. Connor and Gaspard were confused, &quot;Um, help you with what exactly?&quot; Connor asked while tilting his head in confusion. “Don't be rude, now,” Harry replied. “So sorry about that, Tom can get a bit....impatient. You see, we're here to find some sort of meteor that fell down around here the day before yesterday. My friends and I are astronomers and we wanted to investigate it,” he finished as Tom continued. “So that's our story. Unfortunately, tomorrow's snowstorm may cover it up to the point where we may not even be able to find it. And we will need all the help we can get to look for it tonight. What do you say, you in?” <br />
<br />
Connor replied to him, &quot;Wow, astronomers huh? That sound a pretty cool job you guys have there!&quot; he said to the three with a wide smile, &quot;Well if I wander around any further on my own, I'll just guarantee to get myself lost again in these parts. And you guys said something about a snowstorm right? Well, that would really make things worse for the both of us here, so might as well stay with you guys. Sure, count me in!&quot; he said with a grin with Gaspard smiling at them with his trademark toothy smile. &quot;Although... I'm not sure how an aspiring photographer such as myself can help with your work though, hehe,&quot; he said as he scratched his head.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Oniero Ruins</u></b> – Please reply in <b>Dark Orange</b><br />
<b>Celebii151:</b> You look into the hole, you notice that there is a slope that is just steep enough to allow you enough room to not to bump your head, but at the same time, it is not too steep for you to keep your balance on. You and Neptune slide slowly down the ramp, while Boing tries to keep steady, but it ultimately ends up rolling down the slope instead. The place around you appears to be a chamber of some sort; you see several chains on the walls and floors, but no skeletons. There appears to be no exit at first, but you soon hear something, <br />
<br />
<i>clatter, clatter, clatter</i>...<br />
<br />
You turn toward the source to see a skeleton walking toward you. It speaks in a very raspy voice, “Ah, so you are the trespasser, hmm. I thought we rid you years ago, Celes.” He holds up a Pokeball of some sort, “well, no longer will that be a problem. Yamask, take care of our...guest.” A gray Pokémon with red eyes and a large mask sitting on its tail stares at you. <br />
<br />
“Yamask...” it says almost dreadfully. This weird skeleton definitely seems like he wants to battle you, but there is still the option of escape through the way you came, if you run. <br />
<br />
<i>What will you do?</i></span></span>

<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: darkorange"><span style="font-size: 9px">Cele slid down the slope with confidence, hoping to find some answers about this strange place. Boing bounced down, but lost his balance, rolling down the rest of the way. Cele caught him, fortunately, before any serious damage could occur. After taking a head count and making sure everyone was together, Cele headed out. He decided to return Neptune to his Pokeball to prevent him from experiencing anymore mind control from anything that may happen – it had already happened, so Neptune could be more vulnerable. He instead grabbed another Pokeball from his belt, and released the beast held inside. Cele was greeted by a mighty roar, as Nahkriin the Druddigon emerged, ready to rampage. “Nahkriin, calm down!” Cele yelled. “We don’t want to awaken anything that may be lurking in here. Afterwards, I’ll find you a rock you can tear to pieces.” “Drud.” She answered, agreeing to that settlement. Nahkriin, Boing and Cele make their way deeper into the chamber, noticing a mass amount of chains scattered everywhere. “This must be some kind of ancient dungeon or torture chamber. Wonder what we’ll find down here?” Cele wonders as he hears a noise from behind him.<br />
<br />
<i>Clatter, clatter, clatter…</i><br />
<br />
Boing bounces up in surprise from the sound, while Nahkriin prepares to fight. Cele calms both down, and turns around, facing the source. To Cele’s horror and surprise, a skeleton is slowly approaching him. It opens its ‘mouth’ and begins to speak in a raspy tone. “Ah, so you are the trespasser, hmm. I thought we rid of you years ago, Celes.” Celes. There was that name again. First the ghost woman, and now this skeleton. Coincidence? Not likely. The skeleton holds up a weird-looking Pokeball and continues, “Well, that will no longer be a problem. Yamask, take care of our… guest.” Cele now faces another foe, a gray shadow-like Pokemon, with tendril-like arms, large red eyes, and a yellow human-faced mask that it was holding with its tail. Cele brought out his blue and silver Pokedex from his bag, and scanned the creature. The machine instantly came to life: <i>Yamask, the Mummy Pokemon. Each of them carries a mask that used to be its face when it was human. Sometimes they look at it and cry.</i> “So that’s a Yamask, huh? Nahkriin, looks like we don’t have to wait for something that you can rip to pieces. How do you feel about a battle?” “Drudi!” was Nahkriin’s response.&quot;Okay, then Boing, I want you to use <b>Odor Sleuth</b> on the Yamask. Then we'll let Nahkrrin handle it from there.&quot; “Nahkriin, start out with a fearsome <b>Leer</b> to show your superiority. Follow up with a <b>FlameThrower – Aerial Ace</b> combo!” Cele ordered. He hoped that after this was over, he would receive some answers.</span></span></div>

<b><span style="color: green">The Diamond River</span></b> - A fast flowing river that cuts through the two forests, the Diamond River is named so because of the crystals in the lake bed, which cause the water to seem to sparkle. These crystals look very valuable, though the fast running currents many make them hard to reach. The river is about 8 feet deep, and 10 feet wide. Its source is the mysterious lake in the Red Forest, while it empties into the Silver Ocean.

</blockquote>Standing at the edge of the river, TA stared at the glittering bank. As his feet, sand sparkled like diamonds, and he had to squint to avoid hurting his eyes. &quot;How do you think we'll be able to do this, Nav?&quot; he asked his Treecko.<br />
<br />
&quot;Treecko, tree.&quot; The Grass-Type stepped farther away from the water. He was more comfortable in the trees around the bank, and would never have come out to the water by choice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you don't like the current, but if you don't go anywhere near the water, there's no way we're going to get those crystals.&quot; TA smiled at the Treecko. &quot;And you know we need the coins we could get from those.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tree,&quot; Nav sighed. He walked over to his trainer's feet and shot a nervous glance at the rushing river.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know what you're so scared of,&quot; TA said. &quot;You're strong enough to pull yourself out if you fall in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Co,&quot; Nav said. He wasn't happy about this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Nav. If we can get some of these crystals out, I'll buy you a Wacan Berry with the coins, and make you a Poffin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nav perked up when he heard this. &quot;Tree!&quot; He pointed at a tree branch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great idea, Nav!&quot; TA said. &quot;If we can find a fallen branch long enough, we'll knock a few crystals out and pick them up downstream!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tree!&quot; Nav said excitedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's go!&quot;<br />

<br />
<b><u>Salin City</u></b> – Please reply in <b>Silver</b><br />
<b>Empoleon Dynamite</b>: You head into Salin City in hopes to get your sense of adventuring back into gear. After your ride to the Salin City Gym, you see several buildings lining this city, one in particular was massive compared to the others with a sign reading, “SALIN CITY GYM! COME ONE COME ALL!” This place is crowded today, several trainers are lining up for fighting.<br />
<br />
A person next to you says, “Hey, newbie. What're you doing here?” You look towards the direction of the voice, but instead of seeing some sort of person, you see a Chatot, pecking at its wing. It continues, “Because if you're not busy, you should challenge the gym.” You notice a banner hanging from its leg, reading about it. You notice that several other Chatot are lined up the streets like this. Each of them sounding like they are advertising the gym, for some reason. The banner reads, “Come fight the original Gym Leaders. This week only.”<br />
<br />
Something seems very festive about the stadium itself though. Upon closer inspection, you see several streamers and balloons tied up around. “Hard to believe that it's been 10 years,” a different voice says. This time you see an older gentleman standing behind you. He stands at just a bit shorter than you. You notice that he is wearing a musty, brown trench coat and a fedora. “Pardon me, sir,” he says as he passes by you. This place is pretty crowded, but you could see what the commotion is about with these “original gym leaders”.<br />
<br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver">Wes rolled off the coach with the strongest sense of excitement. The long journey in the poorly airconditioned vehicle had barely phased him as he stood on the main street for Salin City Gym. Throwing his backpack over his shoulders, the kid broke into a stride as he past the several tall buildings lining the bustling mainstreets. One eyesore in particular stood out for the trainer – Salin City Gym. Wes pressed on towards it, dodging the traffic and busy commuters to find a large sign reading <b>SALIN CITY GYM! COME ONE COME ALL!</b> A fire ignited in Wes’s chest, his burning ambition spurring him towards the building past the hoard of trainers.<br />
<br />
“Hey, newbie. What’re you doing here?” Squarked a shrill voice, breaking Wes’s chain of thought.<br />
<br />
“Hey I’m no newbie!” he replied matter-of-factly, turning to seek out the source of the voice. There was nobody there though, nobody speaking to him at least. Instead fluttered a Chatot, pecking at its wing impatiently. Wes was taken aback slightly, but he’d owned a Chatot a few years ago and knew that they could be trained to mimic human speech.<br />
<br />
“Because if you're not busy, you should challenge the gym.” Wes nodded silently, tilting his head sideways in a struggled attempt at reading the inscription on the macaw’s banner. It looked like this Chatot wasn’t alone, dozens of the colourful birds littering the busy streets with the same announcement – it sure beat the flocks of Pidove he’d come accustom to in densely populated cities. Wes read the inscription back to himself “Come fight the original Gym Leaders. This week only.” The teenager felt both a mixture of intrigue and excitement. Who were these gym leaders?<br />
<br />
As Wes entered the grande stadium he circled in awe of the festive streamers and balloons hung up around the ceilings. Today must’ve been a good day to visit! Wes paused as he mulled over his squad choices, only for an elderly gentlemen to approach from behind, “Hard to believe that it’s been 10 years”. Wes revolved on the spot, the man was sporting a musty brown trench coat with a fedora that reached no higher than the kid’s eyebrows. The boy nodded politely, it’d be an intimidating thought that these <i>original gym leaders</i> were in there prime before Wes had even received his starter Pokémon. The elderly man makes his way past Wes in the busy arena – the kid now trying to work out where to go from here. The elderly man seemed quite clued up on what was going on. <br />
<br />
“Wait up a second!” Wes yelled beaming with confidence, “How do I go about challenging the original leaders? I can take any one of these oldtimers”<br />

These islands contain the some of the most diverse typing of Pokemon in the entirety of Fizzy Bubbles. All of these islands are actually volcanoes, but the majority of them have gone dormant. As many Pokemon spend all their lives here, many fossils of Pokemon and plants are buried in the depths of the volcanic ground, maybe some of these may be worth a look? You start out on the island that you first choose, via a ferry. In order to change areas afterward, Surf or Fly is a necessity.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><i><span style="color: deepskyblue">Crater Island</span></i></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px">Like the other islands of the archipelago, Crater Island is an inactive volcano. After what seems to be an excessively violent eruption, the empty crater filled with water, forming a lake. Many water types of many types live in the fresh water lake, and there are legends that some things lie in the depths of the lake...Possibly underwater caverns?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: deepskyblue">Iridi Beach </span></b>- Formed by some strange mineral, Iridi Beach's sand is a very bright, sparkly white. Rather than black, like most volcanic sand, this is more of the sand you might find at a normal beach. A few sunbathing Pokemon who venture from the water may be found here, but mostly, this is just a tourist attraction.<br />
</span>

<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: deepskyblue">Bright sun, white sand and ocean as far as the eyes could see. This was Iridi Beach in all its summer glory! The beach was populated by tourists and Pokémon alike, all eager to soak in the sun and have a splash in the ocean. Noriko had seen this place in a television special and decided to have look for herself. The sun was shining as brightly as ever, but Noriko was stationed on the beach under a large umbrella. Lightly clothed, wearing sunglasses and sunblock and a book about Grass Pokémon in hand, Noriko was relaxing on a beach towel while her partner, a small Skitty, was rolling around in the sand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Skitty! Don't go too far!&quot; Noriko kindly warned her partner. She'd already applied some sunblock on Skitty in fear of the Pokémon possibly getting sunburns. The Trainer herself got herself burned in the sun pretty easily, leading her to get an umbrella as protection against the offensive sunlight. <br />
<br />
The duo was taking a breather from their journey, which Noriko had thought would be a good idea...until she found herself stuck on a beach, under the scorching sun, with nothing to do. On the other hand Skitty could entertain herself just fine. Her Trainer sighed beneath her umbrella, a little jealous of Skitty's ability to have a good time nearly anywhere. Setting her book aside, Noriko lay on her back on the blue towel. She was already trying to figure out what their next destination would be - on this island and beyond.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, we've been to the ice cream stand, the Pokémon Center, the Pokémart...is there anywhere else we should go before we move on?&quot; Being a beginning Trainer set its limits on the places the two could travel to. For the time being, Noriko would have to try and make the best of Iridi Beach.<br />

<br />
Reminders for everyone:<br />
1. No self-updating. Meaning, you can't update regarding stuff other than you, your Pokemon, your stuff and feelings. ^^.<br />
2. Please feel free to PM me any inquiry about your adventure.<br />
3. It's okay to bump me since I'm not much of a BMGF checker. I'm most active in UPN, but almost equally active in SPPf.<br />
4. Please don't be rude~<br />
5. Enjoy your adventure as much as you can. I'll try not to make your lives horrible~<br />

It looks like it could be checked if one of your Pokemon can <b>Surf</b> over there.<br />
<br />
What will you do?<br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: deepskyblue">With Skitty strolling right by her side Noriko moved along the beach. The Crater Island was sitting in the distance, catching her attention. She recalled it to be a spot Fire Pokémon liked to hang around – definitely a place of interest for any Trainer or Specialist. Skitty started chasing her tail while waiting for Noriko to think of something to do. Two natures of these two seemed to be polar opposites, which could have been what drew them together in the first place, like magnets.<br />
<br />
Dragged from her thoughts by a small sound, Noriko looked up at the Crater Island. The sound returned, a faint but painful sound, right before it was covered by a wave. After a bit of looking around, Noriko stopped something: a creature, big and blue, some distance away. Could it be a Pokémon? It wailed in pain again. Noriko looked at Skitty, who was looking back at the Trainer. Now what?<br />
<br />
Skitty started jumping at Noriko’s hips – to be precise, at her Pokéball belt. After a few whacks Noriko understood her partner. “You’re right Skitty, this is the perfect opportunity to bring out Callias!” She picked Callias’ Pokéball and threw it at the water. A Finneon came out, calmly watching his surroundings. Noriko called Skitty back into her Pokéball before walking into the water over to Callias. “Hey there, you can hear that noise over there? That’s a Pokémon I want to help out, so could you use <b>Surf</b> and get me over there?”<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><span style="color: green">The Red Forest</span></b> - Quite possibly the most dangerous of all of the areas in Cascadia, the Red Forest was named after the savage conditions it provides. Many ruthless and savage Pokemon live in this dense rainforest, of which many attack without warning. There's no telling what types of Pokemon you may find here. It is said that a small freshwater lake is somewhere in this forest as well.</span>

Karmas and Paine stood at the entrance of the dense forest, the pair of them not quite sure what to think of their surroundings. It had been a while for Karmas since he has partaken in any particular adventure, preferring to hang around his Base instead. Until finally, thanks to the prodding from Paine, who was raring for an adventure, he finally left. And here he was, at Cascadia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well this looks like an interesting place, doesn't it?&quot; said Karmas, looking over at the Gothorita.<br />
<br />
Paine merely stared back at him, she really wasn't one to talk unless it was really really necessary. She crossed her arms and rolled her eyes, what exactly was her trainer waiting for? She motioned with her head for them to get going, making Karmas roll his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry Paine, I'm just trying to generate some atmosphere,&quot; said Karmas, walking into the Red Forest.<br />
<br />
</span></span>OOC: Sorry about the horribad first reply, it has been long time since I've actually adventured myself.<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: green"><br />
