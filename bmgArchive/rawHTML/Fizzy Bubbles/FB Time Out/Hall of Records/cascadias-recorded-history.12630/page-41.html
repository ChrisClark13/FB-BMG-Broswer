A relaxing day under the warmth of morning sunlight is the reason why everyone visits Iridi Beach around this time of the year. To say that you’re not alone would be an understatement – up ahead, countless families populate the sandy shore, kids playing on the ticklish, mildly-electrified sand, adults sunbathing or going for a swim. Idyllic to be sure, but you didn’t come here to get stuck in a crowd – rather, you choose a nice spot some distance away from the nearest parasols and prepare to relax. The revolver you carry with you in case you’re disturbed – a decidedly curious choice of protection for a woman who adamantly refuses to let anyone die – turns out to be dead weight in your bag, as nobody dares approach you anyway, courtesy of the noisy, highly aggressive Binacle you brought along as company. Turns out his obnoxious personality is actually good for something.<br />
<br />
Just as you’re about to drift off in a welcome slumber, blocking out the noise from nearby groups of people and Pokemon and just feeling the warm, gentle breeze of seaside air, something disrupts your inner peace and yanks you from your peaceful relaxation – screams coming from the water. You pull yourself up and look ahead: countless people are rushing out of the water in a panic, encouraged to do so by a couple of equally distressed-looking lifeguards who look like they haven’t got a clue what the hell’s happening.<br />
<br />
You look over to Adrammelech and Farseer, but neither of them seem to understand what the commotion’s all about either, until you catch a bit of a fleeing man’s frantic talk on the phone.<br />
<br />
- Yes! I mean no, I’m not hurt, but they got at least three dudes! They <i>ate</i> them alive! Yes – are you even listenin’? A freakin’ school of

, yes! No, I’m not shittin’ you!<br />
<br />
But… how? There has never been an incident of this kind on such a heavily-populated beach; but indeed, upon closer inspections, you do notice a red stain on the water growing larger in the distance… and there are still people on the water, struggling to beat the current and make it back to shore!<br />
<br />
This is hardly the kind of break you had in mind. But there is chaos installed; there’s a bunch of very unfortunate folk still in the water, and an equally large number of wounded men and women on the shore bleeding out from Carvanha wounds.<br />
<br />
What will your role be amidst all this commotion, if any?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: deepskyblue"><span style="font-size: 12px">While Lillian had noticed the large amount of people on the beach today, since it was a popular tourist spot, the one thing she didn't notice was anyone disturbing her while she was relaxing. She figured that it was her Binacle that was the cause; his loud, aggressive personality would probably scare other people away for fear of being attacked by it. It sure wasn't because of a lack of feminine charm on her end, Lillian silently mused to herself as she felt the warm embrace of slumber take over her, ready to take a nap while Farseer and Adrammelech did their thing. Adrammelech was still trying in vain to deal any meaningful amount of damage, furiously <b>Scratch</b>ing and blasting Farseer with a <b>Water Gun</b>, before he finally quit and took a break. &quot;Your passion is admirable, Adrammelech, but again, I am simply too strong for you to fight alone. You must train before you can hope to defeat me.&quot; Adrammelech didn't respond, being thoroughly enraged by the Alomomola's words, but finding that he couldn't deny them. That Alomomola, for whatever reason, was shrugging off his attacks. He didn't know how.<br />
<br />
The sound of screaming stopped everyone's thoughts as they look into the water where the screaming was coming from. Lillian in particular was snapped out of her relaxed state of mind, the screams sounding like someone who was running for their life. But given that they were a pretty far distance from anyone in particular, Lillian wasn't able to see exactly what was going on. There were people running out of the water in pure panic, lifeguards evacuating the people out of the water as quickly as they could, and some kind of odd splashing. None of it made sense, and when Lillian looked over to Farseer and Adrammelech, neither of them knew what was going on either, both of them shaking their heads. It was the man who was running by, talking on the phone that finally delivered some sort of explanation to the situation. <br />
<br />
A school of Carvanha were attacking people in the water. Three people were already likely dead, and maybe more were likely to be injured from bite wounds. Lillian's mind was made up, and the stir in her emotions pointed that Nightingale thought of the same thing: we have to save those people. Lillian looked in her pack and picked out a Pokeball, throwing it into the air. &quot;Surgei!&quot; she said as the Pokeball opened, revealing a Yanmega that she had brought with her. &quot;Alright you three, there is a pack of Carvanha attacking people in the water. While we don't know what the cause of this is, we have to keep people from getting hurt and dying. I'll be on medical detail. Farseer and Adrammelech, you're duty will be to rescue people out of the water. Farseer, make sure you give yourself some <b>Aqua Rings</b> to keep yourself healthy, they likely won't be happy if you're in the water with them. Surgei, I need you to rescue them from the air, preferably children first given your light frame. If you're attacked by the Carvanha, blast them back in the water with a <b>Signal Beam</b>. Hopefully they won't be too offensive towards you guys. Now, let's go!&quot; <br />
<br />
Lillian immediately grabbed her medical bag, looked to make sure that the gun was still in there, before dashing off towards the group of people on the beach. She wondered if she had brought enough medical supplies to adequately help everyone, but figured that more help would come, since this was a popular spot. Meanwhile, Farseer, Surgei, and Adrammelech all moved towards the group of people in the water still, aiming to get them out. Except for Adrammelech, however, who seemed to have other intentions in mind, as he performed another <b>Shell Smash</b> and darted a little to the right of everyone else; aiming towards the pack of Carvanha. &quot;Adrammelech, no!&quot; Farseer yelled out, but there was nothing more he could do. Adrammelech was determined to fight off the pack of Carvanha, even if only by himself. Lillian heard the yell and looked over, seeing the Binacle change course. She cursed to herself that he was being such a hothead when he should be helping other people, but something else drew her interest. The growing red stain in the water off in the distance. 'Is that blood? Or something else? Regardless, we can't investigate it now.' </span></span></div>

<br />
What’s the worst that can happen? If you mess up, Cam will be there to give you a hand… won’t he? You study the intricacies of the Capture Styler; the basic concept is simple enough to grasp, the hard part should be controlling the Disc once it’s fired. Cam says nothing, smiling at you while you try to make sense of it all. For someone dealing with impending disaster, he sure likes to take his sweet time… but you get it, he’s testing you a bit more; he needs to be absolutely sure he can count on you before asking you to tag along.<br />
<br />
After a while of trying to figure out the contraption, you reason the Styler controls the Disc remotely. Finding the launch button is easy enough, and you decide to give it an honest shot. You press it, and sure enough, the Disc starts spinning in place and is released to the ground, twisting at high velocity.<br />
<br />
- The display is a touch screen. Use your finger to remotely direct the Disc where you want it to go, so guide it towards the Pidgey while it’s distracted!<br />
<br />
You follow Cam’s welcome, if a bit late, guidance on the matter and run yiur index finger along the screen, to which the spinning top-like Capture Disc responds by moving forward along the sandy ground like a remote control car kids used to play with. Hesitantly at first, then with more confidence as you get used to the fiddly control, you guide the Disc over to the avian Pokemon; the device starts glowing as it approaches, and starts leaving behind a glimmering trail…<br />
<br />
- Now just put what you told me into practice; you got the theory down, so let’s see you circle and befriend that Pidgey!<br />
<br />
Remembering the concepts you heard about in your youth about Ranger techniques, you move the Disc in a circular motion, as carefully as possible so as not to alarm the bird… but Cam intervenes.<br />
<br />
- That circle is too wide. Don’t be afraid to close distance, the Disc is already activated, Pidgey will be hard to scare.<br />
<br />
Heeding his instructions, you draw a smaller circular shape on the display, causing the Disc to spin around the pigeon in a tighter circle as well. When the first arc is closed, Pidgey looks around in confusion, wondering what’s going on…<br />
<br />
- Faster now, close another circle but you have to speed up before it flees!<br />
<br />
Pidgey suddenly spreads its wings, shakes them but doesn’t flap them immediately. It’s still trying to make sense of it all, but its escape is imminent… Should you do something different? What if you’re not skilled enough to close the second circle?<br />
<br />
Do you stick to the plan, despite your lack of experience with the Styler, or will you abandon this approach and try something else to keep the Pidgey in place instead?</span></span>

<br />
<span style="color: yellow"><span style="font-size: 12px">Melissa took another few moments to study the Capture Styler, idly thinking that Cam was being pretty patient after his vehement insistence that they had no time to waste. Understandable, though, if he was using it to see whether she was dependable and resourceful enough that he wouldn't have to worry about her.<br />
<br />
<i>So...assuming the part that moves is remote controlled...</i><br />
<br />
She found the launch button and took a deep breath before pressing it, sending the Disc spinning and dropping to the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;The display is a touch screen. Use your finger to remotely direct the Disc where you want it to go, so guide it towards the Pidgey while it's distracted!&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded absently at Cam's commentary and ran her right index along the screen, moving the Capture Disc forwards across the ground. Slowly, she tested the Disc's maneuverability, leading it right, left, in a circle, a figure-eight. Once she was satisfied with her control over the Disc, Melissa led it towards the Pidgey. Once it got close enough, the Disc began glowing and leaving behind a visible, glimmering trail. Did that mean...was it starting?<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, just put what you told me into practice; you got the theory down, so let's see you circle and befriend that Pidgey!&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh! Alright then. Made sense. Melissa started moving the Disc around the Pidgey, farther than she was originally planning to but not too close. Didn't want to scare the wild Pidgey away...<br />
<br />
&quot;That circle is too wide. Don't be afraid to close distance, the Disc is already activated, Pidgey will be hard to scare.&quot;<br />
<br />
...<i>that</i> would've been nice to know earlier. She tightened up her circle and completed one ring, which prompted the Pidgey to look around in confusion. Melissa felt her heartbeat beginning to pick up at the sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Faster now, close another circle but you have to speed up before it flees!&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Dammit, Cam!</i> The Pidgey was spreading its wings and preparing to flee!<br />
<br />
She immediately sped up, following the line that she'd put down earlier in the hopes that the Pidgey wouldn't take off before she could finish. While tightening her circle might've been a better idea, she didn't want to accidentally break the circle. That messed the entire thing up, she recalled.<br />
<br />
...hopefully, she'd managed it.<br />

<br />
<br />
A circle of white stones surrounding a black one, all shaped like imperfect obelisks, imposing and oozing with some strange magic… Mistral is not oblivious to this; not even you, always so easily excitable and a bit of an airhead at times, can ignore the mystical properties of the Oniero Ruins, and that’s getting you all pumped up!<br />
<br />
Your acidic-humoured Shuppet approaches the stones first; he’ll never openly admit it, but the very nature of the place calls to him, to his morbid curiosity. You follow close behind, eager to see what these Ruins are all about, so much so that you fail to notice Mistral going completely rigid in mid-air the second his body enters the perimeter formed by the white stones. But the exact second you walk into that same perimeter, you see a flash of light, lose all feeling in your body and afterwards, everything goes black.<br />
<br />
<i>“Let’s go Crasher!”</i><br />
<br />
<i>“Crasher sucks!”</i><br />
<br />
<i>“Let’s go Crasher!”</i><br />
<br />
<i>“Crasher sucks!”</i><br />
<br />
Spotlights burn your retinae as you come to, trying to open your eyes. You feel extremely dizzy, and for some reason, hurting all over. The sounds of the roaring crowd mix in with the referee’s count, and you somehow know you have to get up, it’s imperative that you do…<br />
<br />
<i>”Seven!.... Eight!....</i><br />
<br />
The title doesn’t change hands via count-out, but a loss is still a loss! You summon strength you never knew you had, place both hands on the ring apron and pull yourself back to your feet.<br />
<br />
<i>”… Nine!...”</i><br />
<br />
Through sheer force of will, you manage to roll back inside the ring at the last second, avoiding the ring-out loss to your opponent. As you struggle to get back to your feet, you finally manage to lock eyes with the number-one contender for your championship…<br />
<br />
<i>“Let’s go Crasher!”</i><br />
<br />
<i>“Crasher sucks!”</i><br />
<br />
Your mentor, the obviously crowd-polarizing Crasher Wake, stands across you breathing heavily, covered in sweat, but grinning at the progress his top student has made. Here you are, the World Heavyweight Champion, making your first title defense against the man who taught you everything you know about pro wrestling! Both of you run towards the center of the ring, lock up… and suddenly, someone else strikes you with a hard Clothesline to the back of the head!<br />
<br />
- What are you doing?! You said I could have this one!!<br />
<br />
Crasher Wake’s voice sounds off as he vents his frustration, but you’re too preoccupied with your current situation to give it any thought. Turning around to meet your attacker, you see it was another famous face you dropped with the lariat – Maylene, Veilstone City Gym Leader!<br />
<br />
- Come on, don’t be a sissy. Let’s make this a Triple Threat match! Can’t let <i>you</i> have all the fun with this one, he’s pretty tempting…<br />
<br />
- It was my turn to play and you know it! Stop invading!<br />
<br />
Maylene taunts a visibly upset Crasher, and the crowd roars in approval of the new stipulation – even if hitting a woman poses a definite problem for your ideals…<br />
<br />
You get up, still dizzy from the back attack, but ready to go; Crasher and Maylene surround you, each coming from an opposite turnbuckle… This all feels natural to you, yet completely strange in a way. Why can’t you remember anything you were doing before the match? Why can’t you even remember the wrestler you beat for the World Title?!<br />
<br />
Crasher moves first, bending over slightly and taking a running start, likely aiming for a spear tackle. Maylene also makes her move and starts dashing, arm stretched to the side <i>a la</i> Stan Hansen, indicating another lariat is on the way…<br />
<br />
Can you afford to dwell on these lingering questions any longer? Something feels definitely off, but what can you do about it?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: darkorange"><span style="font-size: 12px">The burning light of the floodlights focus on the body of Ricardo in the center of the ring, the young trainer facing off against his lifelong idol. Crasher Wake was stood with a spread stance, the hefty man challenging a forward assault, and Ricardo could do little but stand in awe of the sheer magnitude of the man stood before him in the ring. His head was swimming with possibilities, creating an almost haze like effect ... but wait. There was something ... something off. He wasn't meant to be here ... Mistral. Who was Mistral again? It hung there, at the edge of his consciousness, teasing and darting but ultimately remaining completely out of his grasp, tantalisingly close ... and then suddenly pain. <br />
<br />
Slamming into the canvas of the ring, Ricardo forces himself back to his feet with a practiced agility, well aware that even a second on the canvas could spell disaster for his championship hopes. He springs to one side as he eyes the newcomer, and grins at the sight of Maylene, knowing the Gym leader well. Although a face off against a lady was against his code of conduct, once he stepped into the ring, that went out of the window - the only thing which mattered was absolute victory in the face of all odds, proving to himself and his idol that he was as strong as he could be ... and yet ... there it was again. A moment of dizziness, a hand clapped to his forehead. Something was definitely, fundamentally wrong. The face of the wrestler he had beaten previously wouldn't form in his mind's eye, nothing about the situation would - what he had done before the match, how he had gotten this far in the wrestling world. Everything seemed like a black hole, an impossibility to draw information from ... and that name. Mistral. It seemed so familiar, yet so foreign. Shaking his head, Ricardo chases the images from his mind, determining instead to finish what was at hand. Across from him, his idol was preparing to spear him, while Maylene was coming in for another lariat. Given his physique, targeting Maylene first would be the logical choice ... but he couldn't back down from a challenge. Rushing forwards, he pivots on his left foot, preparing to slam a low swinging kick to the ankles of Crasher, hoping to sidestep the incoming charge and leave the larger man flat on his face.</span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> There is something inebriating about <i>finally</i> being in a position of power over someone else in this godforsaken place. The guard, who admittedly seems like a nice man backing the wrong team, needs you too much to even argue with your demands – if anything, it seems he actually wants you to succeed. Without a second thought, he points you to the right key.<br />
<br />
- It’s the smallest one, the copper key right next to the keyring. The Vice President himself gave me your Bag and told me to put it in the storage room.<br />
<br />
You locate the key with ease following the man’s instructions. As you turn to retrieve your belongings, he makes one final plea.<br />
<br />
- My sister’s Pokemon… it’s being kept together with every other Pokemon they confiscated, locked inside an Ultra Ball on the 5th floor lab, directly below the Vice President’s floor. Please, it… it’s my way to atone for the choices I made. Even if I can’t retrieve it myself, freeing that Pokemon from the Government would mean the world to my little sister.<br />
<br />
You take note of his indications and turn your attention back to the storage room. The copper key does indeed fit, and you hear a click upon turning it. The door opens effortlessly afterwards, and you find yourself in a tight little chamber, stuffed with countless Bags, most of them extremely old and dusty – it’s been a while since someone was locked away in here, it would seem… and many who were never retrieved their belongings. How reassuring.<br />
<br />
Your eyes soon catch a glimpse of a familiar color pattern amidst the chaos; sure enough, it’s your Bag, in near-mint condition compared to the degradation of most other items stashed away in the storage room. You hastily pick it up and prepare to leave; after all, time is against you, and besides, what’re the odds of finding anything usable in here? A quick glance reveals mostly torn bags, moldy Poffins and Contest Scarves, all of which you already own and in considerably better state – it makes sense, considering Layard’s crusade against Contests specifically. But just as you’re about to leave, a particular scarf catches your eye, one with a different fabric and coloration from all the others you already possess. Upon closer inspection, you conclude this one must’ve been tossed in here by mistake along with all the others… this one’s actually a

<b>1x Choice Scarf</b>!<br />
<br />
You decide to take the piece of loot with you, reasoning its previous owner likely has no more need for it, and rush out towards the elevator. You press the buttons in a hurry, but the goddamn thing insists on taking far too long to arrive… and while you wait, a terrible doubt emerges. You remember the guard’s words…<br />
<br />
<i>” The Vice President himself gave me your Bag…”</i><br />
<br />
You drop to one knee and open the backpack. Everything seems to be there, items and, for some reason, your Pokeballs too! But… wait… something’s missing. A Fire Ball!!<br />
<br />
Realization sinks in at the same time as the elevator arrives. Layard took one thing, one single thing from you – Samantha…<br />
<br />
The doors slide open and you rush inside, overcome by a swirl of conflicting emotions. The trapped man gave you all the information you needed – the lab on the 5th floor contains every Contest-specialist Pokemon confiscated by Layard’s administration, among which guard’s sister’s partner, while the Vice President’s quarters are one floor above, on the 6th…<br />
<br />
So, Liza… where to?</span></span>

<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: silver">Liza rushed into the elevator with a <b>Choice Scarf</b> in hand, her heart pumping and head full of thought. <br />
<br />
She didn’t think when she pressed the button to her desired destination, still processing what she had just learned. She knew the seriousness of what had happened and yet she wasn’t freaking out, she wasn’t panicking, she was furious! It definitely wasn’t a rampaging kind of anger, as it was a calm kind of anger. More focused.<br />
<br />
Usually, if at all, everyone that had ever had the pleasure of meeting Liza thought of her as a gentle, carefree spirit and sweet to a fault, but not a push over. No one however, had ever seen her angry. But that’s because she had controlled her anger by learning to take care of herself through training. <br />
<br />
She learned quite early on that if she wanted to be a trainer, that meant being able to survive even without the help of her family or even her own Pokémon. What the Vice President did by taking Sam away from her, in a nutshell- he took the safety off from the gun.<br />
<br />
There was nothing Liza wouldn’t do to get her Pokémon back. Now, she was going to rain hell for the way the Vice President had done things...she would start by paying back the debt she owed to the guard that had helped her and fulfill his wish.<br />
<br />
He was the only one to show her any compassion in this Arceus forsaken place, even going as far as telling her the information she needed to grab her belongings...she in turn showed no remorse, she needed to survive, she had already been tricked and lied to too many times. This was, after all a once in a life time opportunity. No one else would ever be as close as she was to bring this corrupt system to it’s knees...but what if it was a ruse, a trap, and the guard was merely feeding her information...giving her what she wanted, so she would believe in everything the guard said and blindingly walk ill prepared in to a trapped room. It’d all be over then, wouldn’t it?<br />
<br />
She took a breath, her nerves were starting to make her paranoid again, once those elevator doors opened there was a very good chance she would be faced with people from Laylard's administration.<br />
<br />
Oh...how she wished her Litwick was by her side, right about now. Lucy’s ghost powers would be a great assist to her, to scout ahead...suddenly that’s when an idea popped into her head. Retrieving a Luxuryball from her bag, Liza pointed the sphere to the ground and called out her trusty Meowth to the stage. <br />
<br />
The Lemon-chiffon cat, licked it’s paw and then commenced to rub his face before greeting his trainer with a gentle, “Meow!~”<br />
<br />
“Shh!” Liza whispered before bending low enough to be at eye level with her cat, “Listen Meow, I know all about your little adventures- sneaking off in the middle of the night and looting the cities/towns we rest in-”<br />
<br />
To this, the cat looked shocked. His trainer wasn’t as ignorant as he assumed.<br />
<br />
“That’s right. I’ll over look your little ‘hobby’ if you can help me make it through this building undetected, we got a deal?”<br />
<br />
The cat mulled it over, he was definitely licked. On the one hand he would of already helped even if he wasn’t being black mailed but because he was, he had a new found respect for his trainer and saw her in a completely different light. He nodded his head with a confident smile, “One more thing, if there are any obstacles in our way, we won’t fight them...we need to get to the 5th floor and get to the Lab where many Pokémon are being held captive...” Liza paused for a moment, “Sam might be there too...” Liza hesitantly said, to which the Meowth looked utterly shocked before a mean expression sat on his face...things had definitely turned serious. <br />
<br />
There was also the possibility that she would run right into Red Skull or some of Laylard’s other goons, if it came to it, Meowth could use his <b>Flash</b> or even <b>Hypnosis</b> to deal with them. If they needed to go on the offensive a <b>Night Slash</b> could allow them a chance to force their way through. <br />
<br />
Liza was even sure if it came to it, Meow would be able to pick a lock with little trouble. <br />
<br />
<i>Oh Sam...I hope you’re okay.</i> The trainer hoped as she waited for the elevator to stop and the doors to open to the <b>5th Floor</b>.<br />
<br />
OoC: Liza obtained a <b>Choice Scarf</b>! Thank you~<br />

These islands contain the some of the most diverse typing of Pokemon in the entirety of Fizzy Bubbles. All of these islands are actually volcanoes, but the majority of them have gone dormant. As many Pokemon spend all their lives here, many fossils of Pokemon and plants are buried in the depths of the volcanic ground, maybe some of these may be worth a look? You start out on the island that you first choose, via a ferry. In order to change areas afterward, Surf or Fly is a necessity.</span><br />

There is a small park in the middle, with a fishing pond and a few trees scattered about. Stands line the streets wishing to sell you things, and it'd be pretty hard to not find something to do. But if you would happen to find yourself in such a dilemma, there is a Pokemon Gym in the city which holds eight leaders, one each to symbolize the Cascadian Archipelago.

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: silver">Daniel &quot;Danny&quot; Hunter, professional skateboarder, and aspiring ground-type Pokémon master, stood on the deck of the ship that would help him take the first steps to realizing his goal. He held the railing as he looked to the horizon, smelling the salty air and feeling the gentle breeze through his black hair. Beside him laid his backpack, which he kept his prized Skateboard strapped to at all times, and a Swinub, napping at her trainer's feet. Snoring slightly, and with a small twitch, she let out a low grunt. Danny smiled at this, <i>must be dreaming </i> he thought, as he gripped the rails a little tighter. His destination had come into view. Salin City.<br />
<br />
Having been born and raised in Jubilife City, Danny was no stranger to tall buildings and bustling crowds, but even from way out here he could tell this place was ridiculous. &quot;I knew Salin was a plus sized gal, but I didn't think she'd be <i>this</i> big. We could probably spend months here, and not see everything.&quot; Although there was much he wanted to see, Danny could not let himself get distracted. He was here on a mission.<br />
<br />
After being rescued that day by a very skilled ground-type user, Danny made it one of his life's goals to become a ground-type master in his own right. And to do that Danny endeavored to learn as much as he could. He had listened to various Pokémon professors give lectures, he went to the trainers school, and the Canalave Library reading as much as he could. There was however, one book in particular that piqued his intetest.<br />
<br />
<u>The Mysteries of the Earth</u>. All Danny had was a title, and a few rumors that said there only a handful of copies floating around. As the story goes it was written by a gym leader from the Kanto region, who supposedly got caught up in some trouble with the local crime syndicate 'Team Rocket.' From what he's heard, this book is supposed to be the real deal. Supposed to teach about things the others don't.<br />
<br />
As Danny's head was filled with thoughts of unknown, but incredibly powerful combo moves, and training regimens, he noticed the ship was nearly at the dock. Coming back to reality, Danny turned his attention to the Pokétch on his wrist. He opened the Marking-Map, and a detailed map of Salin City appeared on the screen, complete with icons showing the locations of various points of interest around the city, there were restraunts and museums, parks, malls, airports, clothing stores, and even a gym. Danny was only interested in one at the moment. He tapped the icon of a book, and suddenly the locations of all the bookstores and libraries were highlighted. According to the map there were over a dozen places this book could be, and even then, there was no guarantee it would be at any of them. Still, he had to try.<br />
<br />
As the ship finally made port, Danny picked up his bag, and his still sleeping Swinub, ready to start his search...<br />

<b><u>Icy Cavern</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Raves</u>:</b> <i>((Hey man, nice to see you around these parts! Welcome aboard!))</i><br />
<br />
The blizzard outside forces you take drastic measures: run for the nearest semblance of a shelter, even if that potential haven comes in the shape of an uninviting crack on the icy surface of the iceberg-isle, like an open wound that can never close.<br />
<br />
Leaving the inhospitable frozen plains behind, you and Nothung delve into the pitch-black cave ahead, welcoming the suddenly stagnant air that replaces the violent winds outside. With nowhere to go but forward, you and your Infernape walk deeper into the cavern, astonished by how far it spreads – it’s more of a maze in here than an actual grotto, and the dark path seems to go on for quite a while, no end in sight!<br />
<br />
The deeper in you go, the colder it gets, and not even your Mareep-and-Camerupt pelt coat can completely shield you from the intense drop in temperature. It’s even chillier in here than it was outside, despite the lack of even the slightest breeze, and even Nothung is beginning to feel bothered by the subzero temperatures – his boiling-hot blood keeps him mostly protected, but this is a climate no Fire-Type enjoys, and the Infernape’s pacing becomes noticeably sluggish in his discomfort.<br />
<br />
It comes as no surprise, then, that you find no traces of life whatsoever as you trek along the cave; whereas at first glance, most living creatures would flock to such a sheltered location, few would ever be able to withstand this cold long enough to survive for an extended period of time. In fact, other than icy stalactites, there seems to be absolutely nothing noteworthy in the cavern-turned-tunnel, but seeing as the only alternative is going back to that windy hell, you figure you may as well find out where this unexpectedly long corridor leads.<br />
<br />
After a while longer, you wind up in a crossroads – another surprise for what should have been a boring old cave. Neither your lantern nor Nothung’s crown of flames illuminate the paths properly, making each branch seem almost identical, but there are other clues to be found in the previously deafening silence of the tunnel: there are very faint, yet notably distinct sounds coming from each road.<br />
<br />
From the path to your left, if you listen closely, you can feel the soothing echo of wind passing through a narrow tunnel, whereas you don’t feel so much as a light breeze where you currently stand. From the path to your right, a low-pitched rumbling can be heard, resembling a growl, varying in intensity the longer you listen to it…<br />
<br />
Which way do you go?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: lightblue"><span style="font-size: 12px">The descent into the frigid depths, away from the blizzard above, was welcomed by Alex as the pair began their venture into the darkened depths, with but a lantern and crown of fire illuminating their way. As they walked, the shade seemed to only increase, though still visible, as the mist of his breath puffed before him. It was a short while, and the trainer started to have some intrigued concern. Surely they would have found a clearing by now or something, and the path should be straighter...but indeed, as they snaked through the crisp yet stale air, Alex could only ponder on how labyrinthian the cavern was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rrrrr...&quot;<br />
<br />
A shiver. Despite the coat, he was cold. Very cold. But this was somehow expected, after all: the underground usually wasn't the warmest place, doubly so in the case of a icy cavern such as this, with exception to volcanic climes. Looking back at Nothung, he felt a little guilty, the starter getting a bit sluggish in movement, the cold getting to the fire type, but even then the Infernape was soldiering on, time having given him a different, more pacifist outlook on life, though he was more than capable of putting up a fight. Still they trudged on, alone. With another shiver, he knew why, for little would survive in this temperature for an extended period, be they the most stalwart fire type or the hardiest Mamoswine.<br />
<br />
In the walk, he reflected on his decision to come to this isle of Cascadia. While it was not unusual for one island in a chain to be colder than others, the perpetual blizzards and snowstorms on Glacier Island were perplexing, given the latitude of the chain, and this wouldn't have been down to a high number of ice types. No, he felt there was something else on the isle, something deep within that granted the giant iceberg its everlasting chill. The walls didn't seem to be anything unusual, and the ice that Nothung's head passed by did glisten in the way ice does when melting, only to refreeze just as quickly.<br />
<br />
Then the pair found themselves at another oddity: crossroads. Given the circumstances, he'd have a look down each, but with the maelstrom above blocking out any vague trace of light, the only thing the pair had for them was sound. <i>Strange indeed.</i> To the left, a gentle wind, a probable sign of a passage to the surface, or a large clearing. To the right, a low rumble, much like growling, varying in intensity, as though something was moving. But even nearer, a strange chattering...<br />
<br />
&quot;W-wait...th-that's just...me...&quot; he gasped slightly, an attempt to chuckle at his chattering teeth giving way to bitter cold, as he trembled and clutched himself. <i>This was not a good idea...if something goes wrong and I end up hurt, I'm very much a goner...</i><br />
<br />
A grunt from his side, and he felt a bit warmer. Turning his head, Nothung was providing him a little more warmth by use of a burning fist, the heat from the restrained <b>fire punch</b> doing little to thwart the chill, but a kindly sentiment nonetheless from the worried pokemon.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm f-f-fine...just feeling th-th-the cold...is all...&quot; he whispered back, before looking towards the gloomy <b>right, where the rumble emanated.</b> &quot;This has to...b-b-beat running into the blizuh-zuh-zurd...&quot; the young man stammered as he made towards the rumble source, trying to be careful. For all he knew, this could be something hungry, something mechanical or even a tremor, which could cause a cave-in, trapping him in a never-melting tomb, but it was a better alternative than dealing with severe windchill. Who knows, maybe it would lead to a clearing that's hopefully not as frigid as the icy tunnels...</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Emi</u>:</b> You can’t stand by idly while everyone on the beach goes into a panic. Your primary instinct is to step in and help out in any way you can which, while admirable, can prove too much to handle given the current commotion…<br />
<br />
Not unlike a field general, you instruct your troops to move out and rescue as many people as possible – Farseer and Adrammelech via water and Surgei via air – before the Carvanha claim any more victims.<br />
<br />
The Alomomola surrounds himself with four rings of blue energy and rushes off towards the crowd still struggling to get back to land, and the Yanmega darts off after him, beating the Water-Type in quickness and arriving first. Both Pokemon begin to carry who they can, prioritizing infants, but the third soldier you deployed doesn’t prove quite as obedient: the Binacle changes course, powering up considerably with his trusty Shell Smash while leaving him exceedingly frail defensively, and instead of aiding in the task of rescuing victims, instead aims straight at the Carvanha group!<br />
<br />
You are alerted by Farseer’s cries, having meanwhile already reached the injured tourists on the sand. One of them, an elderly man in his seventies, has a nasty wound in his right leg, bleeding profusely. Another man you assume to be the elder’s son looks on horrified, blaming himself for what happened.<br />
<br />
- I should have never encouraged him to go so deep in the water! Is-is there anything you can do?!<br />
<br />
You split your attention between the injured man and the events unfolding at sea – because soon after Adrammelech reaches the red stain on the water, five Carvanha leap out and come crashing down on the reckless, yet underpowered Binacle, dragging him into the depths of the ocean as Farseer looks on horrified with an unconscious woman draped across his back.<br />
<br />
There is someone on land who desperately needs whatever healing expertise you might possess, while one of your partners is in peril at the same time. Farseer and Surgei are both in the middle of rescuing swimmers...<br />
<br />
What’s your plan of action?</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> Your mind is made up and your intentions are clear, even with the silent rage burning within you at the realization of Samantha’s abduction. Other than Oscar and Dana, nobody in this entire journey had shown any sympathy for you – especially not the man who betrayed you, turning out to be Layard’s agent Whisper – but that guard… there was good in him. Finding his sister’s Pokemon is something you feel you owe him.<br />
<br />
The elevator takes you straight to the 5th floor without a hiccup, something you were half-expecting in a building where all but one person is against you. The doors slide open and you find yourself in the middle of a huge complex, through which the elevator passes right in the middle. Everywhere you look there are work desks, turned-off laptops, papers scattered across the tables and floor… the research floor seems completely abandoned. And that’s when you realize that, lining the walls, inside countless ceiling-tall glass pods filled with liquid… there are Pokemon!<br />
<br />
These must have been the creatures apprehended under the Layard Administration orders… All of these Pokemon, at some point, were successful Contest participants, good enough that they caught Layard’s attention… good enough that they were caught and trapped like criminals, locked away until they were forgotten, until they became irrelevant.<br />
<br />
You take a while to look at these poor creatures, all unconscious as if in stasis, their vitals maintained by the nutrients within the fluid and the electrical power that continuously filtered and maintained the liquid’s life-prolonging qualities. In here are some of the most beautiful and the toughest-looking Pokemon you’ve ever seen, obviously having been taken excellent care of while under their original owners’ care…<br />
<br />
Suddeny, you’re startled by a noise coming from behind – the elevator’s door is opening once again! You turn to face whoever comes out: a woman with long, wavy red hair, probably in her fifties, wearing a bordeaux leather jacket and matching pants and classy black boots… She walks in with a smile on her face, which only widens at the sight of you.<br />
<br />
- Oh my, look at this. You were exceedingly easy to find after all… looks like he wasn’t lying after all.<br />
<br />
“He”? Does she mean… the guard from the cell? Did he trick you after all?!<br />
<br />
- Now now, don’t make that face, I know what you’re thinking dear. You made a good friend down there, you really did! He’s a gem of a young man. But you see… I <i>had</i> to make him talk! I’m sure you understand.<br />
<br />
This has to be the one mentioned by the guard. This woman… is Red Skull.<br />
<br />
- And, you see, he really didn’t want to talk at first! He really took a liking to you, and I can see why with such a pretty face you got… but all men break sooner or later. In his case, it took a bit more… persuasion.<br />
<br />
She enlarges the Pokeball she’s been holding all along and tosses it to the floor. The creature that materializes makes your stomach turn – a very large

with a crazed look on its face, its horns tinted red, liquid still dripping from them.<br />
<br />
- You know, when he joined Layard’s guard he wanted to be our Vice President’s right-hand man. I can still remember the fire in his eyes when he first enlisted! But since his loyalties have changed so drastically since then, and Layard doesn’t need a treacherous man for a right hand… I took your friend’s right hand away. And boy, did he ever talk after that!<br />
<br />
Her smile turns into a wick grin as she goes on.<br />
<br />
- One of the things he let slip, other than that he asked for your help, was that he never got a chance to tell you which of these Pokemon belonged to her sister! So…<br />
<br />
She picks up her cellphone, makes a call, and upon uttering the words <i>”Go ahead”</i> the entire research floor goes dark, the only light coming from the emergency lamps scarcely scattered along the walls. The power has been cut, which means that the Pokemon’s life-support systems….<br />
<br />
- I want to have some fun with you. But since it’s always more interesting when something tangible is on the line, why don’t we put a timer on our little game? The Pokemon inside the pods can hold out a bit longer until the nutrient fluid becomes saturated with impurities… but do make haste dear, or they all die! Here are your options…<br />
<br />
The Pinsir snaps its bloodied protrusions together, raring to go…<br />
<br />
- Play with me until you break like your guard friend, or just turn yourself in and I’ll make the call to power the lab back on. What do you say, lovely?<br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Pud’n</u>:</b> You’ve come to Salin City with a purpose – an elusive book written by an even more elusive man, that many claim was more myth than real… the creator of the defunct yet legendary Team Rocket.<br />
<br />
The ship arrives at the Salin Port after an uneventful voyage. A Ground-Type enthusiast such as yourself is more than happy to set foot on firm land at last, but at the same time, you’re easily overwhelmed by the confusion that awaits you. Salin City is a bustling metropolis, the capital of the entire archipelago, and naturally the meeting point for thousands of residents and tourists. The Port is absolutely crowded and impossibly noisy at this time of day, and the arrival of another ship is always cause for even more commotion, with families reuniting in teary welcomes and all manner of lost foreigners looking to find his bearings, asking directions to any and all passersby. At the same time there’s quite a bit of convenient commerce going on, many savvy merchants having set up shop in the Port itself to attract people right off the boats – something you guess might not be entirely legal, but what do you know of politics? – and, truth be told, some of these tents do have interesting and useful-looking products for Trainers about to embark on a journey. Maybe you should check these out, if you can cut through the crowd to reach the vendors…<br />
<br />
- Hey there! You’re not from around here, are you?<br />
<br />
A cheerful-looking woman about your age, with shoulder-long silver hair, greets you warmly out of nowhere. She carries pamphlets with her and tries to hand you one.<br />
<br />
- How can I tell you’re not from around here? Simple, you’re carrying your Bag like a regular backpack instead of clutching on to it for dear life. Not everyone here’s an honest fellow, so really, you should wear it on your back or someone might relive you of some possessions before you even reach the nearest Center!<br />
<br />
Her advice is rather sound, now that you think of it. And despite not carrying much, since you’re just starting out, you’d hate to think you could lose your skateboard out of carelessness…<br />
<br />
- My name’s Silvia, I’m a tour guide! Well, a recently-graduated one to be honest… Can I help you with anything? Is this your first time to Cascadia? Maybe I can point you in the right direction!</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 12px"><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u><u>Myahoo</u>:</u></b> Cam smiles at your approach; he was waiting to see if you’d try to keep Pidgey down by other means, namely the use of force, and is visibly glad you decide to work harder on your Styler technique instead. As you try your best to control the device, the spinning top-like contraption draws a second circle beneath the first, though considerably faster than before. It starts wobbling violently midway, causing you to hold your breath in anticipation, but soon resumes its course without falling over or straying from the drawn path. And just as Pidgey begins to take flight, you manage to complete the second circle, immediately upon which the avian is engulfed in a bright light and calmly returns to the floor.<br />
<br />
- Way to go Melissa! You got it!<br />
<br />
The bird Pokemon turns around, looking confused at first, then hops over to where you’re standing without a hint of hesitation. It flies onto your shoulder, where it perches itself casually like it’s known you for years…<br />
<br />
- Sorry for telling you Pidgey would be hard to scare earlier, I wanted to see how you handled the unexpected. You got the hang of it, it seems. I’d say you’re a natural! Melissa…<br />
<br />
After a moment of pondering, Cam walks over to the Styler disc, picks it up and hands it back to you.<br />
<br />
- Keep it, you’ve earned both the Styler and my trust. As much as I hate to get anyone else involved in this, you’re my best bet at getting the Isle’s Pokemon out of here before…<br />
<br />
Cam is interrupted by the sudden, deafening roar of thunder. After what seems like no more than five seconds, the sky becomes filled with dense, dark rainclouds that completely obscure the sun…<br />
<br />
- N-no way… already?! Damnit!! Melissa, we have to get moving. You can handle yourself in battle too, so we’ll go on separate ways to cover as much ground as possible and evacuate the Isle before it’s too late! Take the Styler and head South towards the Thunder Fields, I’ll head to the Eletron Plant. You can reach me via the Styler’s phone function should you need anything! Now go!<br />
<br />
You store the <b>1x Capture Styler</b> in your Bag and prepare to follow the Ranger’s hasty instructions, but Cam remembers one last thing.<br />
<br />
- Melissa… please don’t forget the purpose of Rangers befriending Pokemon. That Pidgey is still a free creature, despite listening to you now. Don’t take advantage of the Styler’s properties for your own gain, keep the greater good in mind!<br />
<br />
Without waiting for an answer, he dashes towards the center of the Isle, where Eletron Plant is located, leaving you no choice but to head to the Thunder Fields by yourself. You remind yourself that your mission is to befriend any wild Pokemon you meet in order to convince them to flee the Island before the two Legendary Pokemon begin to wage their war…<br />
<br />
After a while of running, you leave Storm Lake behind and now find yourself in a sprawling meadow, covered in grass as far as the eye can see. You best start looking around for wild Pokemon in need of rescuing… but just as you set your mind to the task, a violent thunderstorm suddenly begins! Lightning bold upon lightning bolt come crashing down on the plains, and while the Thunder Fields take their name from the frequent atmospheric discharges, this is one storm unlike anything Ion Island has seen in centuries – and before you know it, after <i>three</i> consecutive lightning strikes set apart by mere seconds, the grass around you is set ablaze and a wildfire starts spreading across the fields!<br />
<br />
Do you press onwards through the flames to rescue who you still can, or will you stop and try to put out the fire instead?</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</u></b> In the middle of the barren, non-functional massive complex, you decide your best (or perhaps only) option is to follow the curious little critter that unknowingly helped you escape. Reasoning that it can’t have gone far, nor changed trajectory all that much since it fled the room in a haste, you and your partners do your best to follow its assumed path.<br />
<br />
There is, however, one flaw in your plan, as tracing a flying Pokemon who leaves no prints and having had no chance to let Hermione pick up its scent in advance, proves no more than a guessing game once the wide corridors start spreading in several directions the deeper you delve into the evacuated facility.<br />
<br />
A building this large, with no indications and barely any light, is effectively much like a maze, you come to realize. Backtracking will do you little good if any, but each step forward you take is complete uncertainty, and after a long while of wandering aimlessly, you stomach starts to rumble and your mouth feels dry. It’s hard to tell how much time now you’ve been braving the Power Plant, but you have long lost any leads that might help you find the winged creature from before, and by the thirst and hunger you’re feeling, several hours must have gone by for sure. How much longer can you keep this up? Could you even trace your steps back to the entrance now if you wanted?<br />
<br />
You end up in a open-space area with a deactivated reactor in the center; judging by its size, there’s no way this is the main machine that generates electricity for Salin City and its vicinities, but likely an auxiliary battery of sorts that has died out as well. Still, at least it’s different from the million identical hallways from before…<br />
<br />
Just as you plan on exploring the room a bit more in-depth, a speaker on a nearby wall suddenly start buzzing and, to your amazement, begins to emit a faint sound – indicating that there is indeed some power left running through some of the cables around here, at least… however, the volume suddenly shoots all the way up, the speaker unleashing a horrifying noise of an intensity you have <i>never</i> heard before, so unbearably loud your head feels like it’s about to burst! The hyper-intense soundwaves blasting through the room make you dizzy and you fall to your knees, instinctively clutching your ears to little avail…<br />
<br />
In your state of weakness you can’t take much more of this abuse – quick, what can you do before you pass out?!</span></span><br />

<b><u>Icy Cavern</u></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Raves</u>:</b> The cold is really starting to get to you, despite not having been careless in any way when preparing for this journey – these just aren’t temperatures compatible with survival for any extended period of time. Still, you reason that pressing onwards is a gamble with better odds than backtracking at this point, knowing what awaits you on the surface.<br />
<br />
Faced with an unexpected choice, you pick the tunnel from which a rumbling sound is heard. After all, movement of any sort is unlikely in this barren cave, and all the more unlikely to come from a living creature, but the noise has you intrigued… You venture down the tunnel to your right, followed closely by Nothing who continues to provide you with as much heat as he can, and as you proceed the tunnel begins to widen. You notice the walls, whose surface was initially smooth, become progressively edgier and missing chunks as the path grow wider, as if something forcefully tore it open as it went along to make room to pass…<br />
<br />
After a while of further enduring the unforgiving cold (even your head is starting to hurt at this point…), the tunnel comes to an end – a large opening leads to a huge cave, a huge hole within the depths of the icy mountain. You notice that, somehow, it is decidedly warmer in here, and it soon becomes apparent why: purple flames burn atop ice-made chandeliers, a physical impossibility if you ever saw one. The blazes provide light and heat to the clearing, and at the center of the cave something massive catches your eye – the source of the rumbling sound, varying in intensity… it’s a gigantic slumbering

<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Connor</u>:</b> Despite the lingering questions you find yourself struggling with in your head, you decide it’s best to try and put them behind you and focus on the task at hand for now. After all, if you don’t, it’s likely you’ll be broken in half by Crasher’s spear and beheaded by Maylene’s lariat!<br />
<br />
You feel that the best approach would probably be to take on Maylene first, given her stature, but the appeal of besting Crasher Wake himself is too powerful to resist. You you’re your sights to your idol and quickly devise a plan to overcome his offense: the big man comes rushing madly towards you, but you telegraph the move and sidestep out of reach, throwing a low kick for good measure which <i>doesn’t</i> cause Crasher to fall on his face, given his impressive momentum, but instead makes the man lose his footing and tumble clumsily forward, trying to futilely compensate with progressively larger steps… until he runs straight into the incoming Maylene, spearing <i>her</i> instead!<br />
<br />
The female Gym Leader, downed for good measure, growls in anger… but her words make very little sense in this context.<br />
<br />
- What the hell was that for? You cheat! You have no right to do this to me, you should have learned to share by now!! Fine, if that’s how you’re going to be, I’m taking the other one all for myself! Put him through a proper <i>nightmare</i>, I will!<br />
<br />
And with those words, against all reasonable expectations… Maylene’s body <i>vanishes</i> from the canvas! Crasher Wake is left on his knees, looking distraught, seemingly having forgotten all about the ongoing match…<br />
<br />
None of this makes any sense, this is the weirdest wrestling match you’ve ever seen and your head’s bursting with questions. But on the other hand, Crasher Wake is <i>right there</i>, kneeling on the canvas with his back turned to you, in prime position to be finished off so you can retain the World Title…<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</u></b> In the middle of the barren, non-functional massive complex, you decide your best (or perhaps only) option is to follow the curious little critter that unknowingly helped you escape. Reasoning that it can’t have gone far, nor changed trajectory all that much since it fled the room in a haste, you and your partners do your best to follow its assumed path.<br />
<br />
There is, however, one flaw in your plan, as tracing a flying Pokemon who leaves no prints and having had no chance to let Hermione pick up its scent in advance, proves no more than a guessing game once the wide corridors start spreading in several directions the deeper you delve into the evacuated facility.<br />
<br />
A building this large, with no indications and barely any light, is effectively much like a maze, you come to realize. Backtracking will do you little good if any, but each step forward you take is complete uncertainty, and after a long while of wandering aimlessly, you stomach starts to rumble and your mouth feels dry. It’s hard to tell how much time now you’ve been braving the Power Plant, but you have long lost any leads that might help you find the winged creature from before, and by the thirst and hunger you’re feeling, several hours must have gone by for sure. How much longer can you keep this up? Could you even trace your steps back to the entrance now if you wanted?<br />
<br />
You end up in a open-space area with a deactivated reactor in the center; judging by its size, there’s no way this is the main machine that generates electricity for Salin City and its vicinities, but likely an auxiliary battery of sorts that has died out as well. Still, at least it’s different from the million identical hallways from before…<br />
<br />
Just as you plan on exploring the room a bit more in-depth, a speaker on a nearby wall suddenly start buzzing and, to your amazement, begins to emit a faint sound – indicating that there is indeed some power left running through some of the cables around here, at least… however, the volume suddenly shoots all the way up, the speaker unleashing a horrifying noise of an intensity you have <i>never</i> heard before, so unbearably loud your head feels like it’s about to burst! The hyper-intense soundwaves blasting through the room make you dizzy and you fall to your knees, instinctively clutching your ears to little avail…<br />
<br />
In your state of weakness you can’t take much more of this abuse – quick, what can you do before you pass out?!</span></span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: yellow"><span style="font-size: 12px">The strange, unidentified creature who had been their way out of that room- that, Keith felt, was their best lead at the moment. Unfortunately, while a decent idea in theory, they'd overlooked one minor detail...<br />
<br />
&quot;...Hey, Keith,&quot; Meowth said after a little while of wandering around to no avail. &quot;Maybe next time youse wants ta track down sometin' dat don't leave no prints and whose scent Hermione ain't got... maybe come up wit a way ta actually track it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I know, not my best moment,&quot; Keith grumbled. &quot;Let's just keep looking, see what we can find.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If we can find anyting,&quot; Meowth muttered.<br />
<br />
Choosing to ignore this particular piece of pessimism, Keith pressed on, wandering the many, <i>many</i> corridors. The many, maddeningly identical, corridors. Between how similar the corridors all were, the sheer size of the building, and the lack of light, Keith started to feel like a Rattata in a maze.<br />
<br />
Time marched on. And on. And on. Exactly how long they'd been at this Keith neither knew nor found himself inclined to find out. All he knew was he'd been walking for a long while, and he was starting to get hungry and thirsty. How much longer would he last in this Arceusforsaken power plant? Would he even be able to find his way out?<br />
<br />
Eventually, they found themselves in an open area- something decidedly different from the countless conforming corridors they'd traversed thus far. This room was very spacious, and contained what appeared to be a deactivated reactor. &quot;Now what have we here?&quot; Keith murmured.<br />
<br />
&quot;Judgin' by da size, I tink we can rule out da main generator,&quot; said Meowth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, for sure,&quot; Keith agreed. &quot;Probably a backup. Though if this is one of their backups, and they've burned through this one as well, who knows how much time we got left?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe it's da hunger talkin', but dat sounded way more morbid den I'm sure youse meant it,&quot; Meowth groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, yeah, sorry,&quot; Keith said, shaking his head. &quot;Glad I packed berries this time. I'm thinking we could stop for a snack at some poi- hello, what's this?&quot; For as he spoke, a faint buzzing met his ears. As he turned to locate the source, it was revealed to be coming from a speaker on a nearby wall. &quot;Huh,&quot; Keith murmured, eyeing the speaker. &quot;I guess there's still some power left in this area after all- AAAAAAGH! WHAT THE FU-&quot;<br />
<br />
For at that moment, the speaker's volume was suddenly cranked way up. What started as a faint buzzing was now an agonizing auditory assault, the likes of which Keith had never had the distinct displeasure of hearing before in his life, and indeed, it was his hope that he lived to hear anything again after this ordeal. He clapped his hands over his ears, a woefully futile move. Meowth was doing likewise with his paws. &quot;GAAAAH! MAKE IT STOP!&quot; he wailed.<br />
<br />
&quot;WEEDLE WEEDLE!&quot; Hermione screamed- unlike the others, Hermione had no appendages with which to cover her ears. She had to think quickly- the speaker was the source of this horrible noise, so attacking the speaker seemed like the most logical course of action as far as stopping the noise went. So, focusing as best she could amid the dreadful noise, Hermione took aim, preparing to launch an <b>Ice Beam</b> at the speaker.</span></span><br />

<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> Your mind is made up and your intentions are clear, even with the silent rage burning within you at the realization of Samantha’s abduction. Other than Oscar and Dana, nobody in this entire journey had shown any sympathy for you – especially not the man who betrayed you, turning out to be Layard’s agent Whisper – but that guard… there was good in him. Finding his sister’s Pokemon is something you feel you owe him.<br />
<br />
The elevator takes you straight to the 5th floor without a hiccup, something you were half-expecting in a building where all but one person is against you. The doors slide open and you find yourself in the middle of a huge complex, through which the elevator passes right in the middle. Everywhere you look there are work desks, turned-off laptops, papers scattered across the tables and floor… the research floor seems completely abandoned. And that’s when you realize that, lining the walls, inside countless ceiling-tall glass pods filled with liquid… there are Pokemon!<br />
<br />
These must have been the creatures apprehended under the Layard Administration orders… All of these Pokemon, at some point, were successful Contest participants, good enough that they caught Layard’s attention… good enough that they were caught and trapped like criminals, locked away until they were forgotten, until they became irrelevant.<br />
<br />
You take a while to look at these poor creatures, all unconscious as if in stasis, their vitals maintained by the nutrients within the fluid and the electrical power that continuously filtered and maintained the liquid’s life-prolonging qualities. In here are some of the most beautiful and the toughest-looking Pokemon you’ve ever seen, obviously having been taken excellent care of while under their original owners’ care…<br />
<br />
Suddeny, you’re startled by a noise coming from behind – the elevator’s door is opening once again! You turn to face whoever comes out: a woman with long, wavy red hair, probably in her fifties, wearing a bordeaux leather jacket and matching pants and classy black boots… She walks in with a smile on her face, which only widens at the sight of you.<br />
<br />
- Oh my, look at this. You were exceedingly easy to find after all… looks like he wasn’t lying after all.<br />
<br />
“He”? Does she mean… the guard from the cell? Did he trick you after all?!<br />
<br />
- Now now, don’t make that face, I know what you’re thinking dear. You made a good friend down there, you really did! He’s a gem of a young man. But you see… I <i>had</i> to make him talk! I’m sure you understand.<br />
<br />
This has to be the one mentioned by the guard. This woman… is Red Skull.<br />
<br />
- And, you see, he really didn’t want to talk at first! He really took a liking to you, and I can see why with such a pretty face you got… but all men break sooner or later. In his case, it took a bit more… persuasion.<br />
<br />
She enlarges the Pokeball she’s been holding all along and tosses it to the floor. The creature that materializes makes your stomach turn – a very large

with a crazed look on its face, its horns tinted red, liquid still dripping from them.<br />
<br />
- You know, when he joined Layard’s guard he wanted to be our Vice President’s right-hand man. I can still remember the fire in his eyes when he first enlisted! But since his loyalties have changed so drastically since then, and Layard doesn’t need a treacherous man for a right hand… I took your friend’s right hand away. And boy, did he ever talk after that!<br />
<br />
Her smile turns into a wick grin as she goes on.<br />
<br />
- One of the things he let slip, other than that he asked for your help, was that he never got a chance to tell you which of these Pokemon belonged to her sister! So…<br />
<br />
She picks up her cellphone, makes a call, and upon uttering the words <i>”Go ahead”</i> the entire research floor goes dark, the only light coming from the emergency lamps scarcely scattered along the walls. The power has been cut, which means that the Pokemon’s life-support systems….<br />
<br />
- I want to have some fun with you. But since it’s always more interesting when something tangible is on the line, why don’t we put a timer on our little game? The Pokemon inside the pods can hold out a bit longer until the nutrient fluid becomes saturated with impurities… but do make haste dear, or they all die! Here are your options…<br />
<br />
The Pinsir snaps its bloodied protrusions together, raring to go…<br />
<br />
- Play with me until you break like your guard friend, or just turn yourself in and I’ll make the call to power the lab back on. What do you say, lovely?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: silver">&quot;Is there, just something wrong with you people?! Do you just like being stuck in the past, holding on to this thought that thinks Contests are just about putting on a beautiful show- like some side show?! It's about so much more, these Pokémon that were so lovingly raised are in the best shape of their lives! And yet, here they are kept like prisoners and held as hostages as the world continues to move around them! Just look at Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova and Kalos- they all accept that battles aren't the only way to show the bonds a trainer and Pokémon have; I'll show you, I'll show Layard, that this belief you so strongly <i>cling</i> on to is over! Your time, is over. I'm going to show you by freeing <b>every single one</b> of these Pokémon with the bond I share with my Pokémon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Meowwww!&quot; the lemon chiffon scratch cat was pacing, getting a feel of it's crazy eyed opponent, trying to learn what best angle to strike it's enemy when the time finally came.<br />
<br />
With the lights cut off, Liza's Meowth was in it's element...darkness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Meow quickly, a <b>Fake Out</b> to a <b>Screech</b> to disorient them, straight into an <b>Aerial Ace</b>!&quot;<br />
<br />
Liza was pressed on time, there had to be some sort of emergency button somewhere in this Arceus forsaken room in case a situation called to let all the Pokémon loose. It was the only think she could take a chance on- &quot;Snub, come on out!&quot; Liza produced another Pokéball- a Loveball from her bag and a light revealed her pink bull dog Pokémon to her side once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Snub!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Snub, I need you to help me find a switch and while your at it...&quot; She said grabbing the keys, she snatched from the guard, earlier to open up the locked cabinet, &quot;Sniff this and see if you can't sniff out the location of the owner's Pokémon...&quot; It was a stretch, training extensively with her dogs she raised them to be able to track just like Pokémon from the Police Acadmey, going as far as asking professionals for advice. The longest time she had heard that a dog could still sniff out a scent was approximately a year or so...any longer...and the process was slim to none that she'd get any sort of connection. <br />
<br />
A sweat dropped from the side of her face, <i>Maybe I was wrong...</i> Liza looked at the blood dripping from the Pinsir's claws, <i>Maybe the guard did have good in him and something, something made him change from wanting to be Layard's right hand man...that something could be the way he saw his sister's Pokémon kept hostage like this...if he ever bothered to visit his sister's Pokémon's pod...his scent would be around here...</i><br />
<br />
But would this be enough to stop these people? They were relentless, every step she took closer to the top a new obstacle presented itself. If only <i>Sam...I wish you were here...</i> but she wasn't and Liza needed to face facts. If she ever wanted to see her Pokémon again...if she ever wanted to free all these Pokémon, Dana and Oscar, if she ever wanted to see Ethan or the sunlight again...she needed to keep going.<br />
<br />

<span style="color: silver"><b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Pud’n</u>:</b> You’ve come to Salin City with a purpose – an elusive book written by an even more elusive man, that many claim was more myth than real… the creator of the defunct yet legendary Team Rocket.<br />
<br />
The ship arrives at the Salin Port after an uneventful voyage. A Ground-Type enthusiast such as yourself is more than happy to set foot on firm land at last, but at the same time, you’re easily overwhelmed by the confusion that awaits you. Salin City is a bustling metropolis, the capital of the entire archipelago, and naturally the meeting point for thousands of residents and tourists. The Port is absolutely crowded and impossibly noisy at this time of day, and the arrival of another ship is always cause for even more commotion, with families reuniting in teary welcomes and all manner of lost foreigners looking to find his bearings, asking directions to any and all passersby. At the same time there’s quite a bit of convenient commerce going on, many savvy merchants having set up shop in the Port itself to attract people right off the boats – something you guess might not be entirely legal, but what do you know of politics? – and, truth be told, some of these tents do have interesting and useful-looking products for Trainers about to embark on a journey. Maybe you should check these out, if you can cut through the crowd to reach the vendors…<br />
<br />
- Hey there! You’re not from around here, are you?<br />
<br />
A cheerful-looking woman about your age, with shoulder-long silver hair, greets you warmly out of nowhere. She carries pamphlets with her and tries to hand you one.<br />
<br />
- How can I tell you’re not from around here? Simple, you’re carrying your Bag like a regular backpack instead of clutching on to it for dear life. Not everyone here’s an honest fellow, so really, you should wear it on your back or someone might relive you of some possessions before you even reach the nearest Center!<br />
<br />
Her advice is rather sound, now that you think of it. And despite not carrying much, since you’re just starting out, you’d hate to think you could lose your skateboard out of carelessness…<br />
<br />
- My name’s Silvia, I’m a tour guide! Well, a recently-graduated one to be honest… Can I help you with anything? Is this your first time to Cascadia? Maybe I can point you in the right direction!</span></span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: silver">The sound of the ship's horn rang loud through the air, followed by the squeal of a Swinub that had been rudely awoken. &quot;Attention all passengers&quot; the captain's voice sounded through the loudspeaker, clearly audible over the din of the busy port. &quot;We've arrived at Salin City, please collect all belongings, and head towards the nearest exit. Enjoy your stay.&quot; Danny scooped up his backpack and Swinub, took a deep breath, and made his first steps into Salin City.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa. I didn't realize this many people even <i>existed</i>.&quot; Danny said, a little awestruck. Salin's port was busier than he'd ever seen Jubilife. Taking in the entire scene, Danny could see people running towards one another, no doubt having been seperated by a long trip, there were people with cameras around their necks, already snapping souvenir photos for their albums, and even a couple of people that had the unmistakable look of trainers seeking a new challenge.<br />
<br />
Pushing his way through the crowd, Danny's eyes fell upon some crowded merchant stands a few yards away. He couldn't tell exactly what they had from where he was standing, but he was almost positive he saw someone buy a zoom-lens. Shaking himself back to reality, Danny remembered why he was standing in the middle of this busy port. <i>I've gotta find that book...but then again...maybe somebody at one of those stands knows something. It would be dumb not to at least check it out, and I have always wanted a metal-coat... </i><br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there!&quot; A voice cried out to Danny through all of the noise. Turning to see the person calling to him, Danny saw the best sight he'd seen all day. A cheerful-looking girl, who looked to be in her early twenties, greeted Danny with a warm smile. And she was a looker. &quot;You're not from around here are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Feeling his face growing warm, Danny tried to act cool as he said. &quot;No, I just got off the boat actually.&quot; He gave a slightly embarrassed chuckle and asked. &quot;Is it that obvious?&quot;<br />
<br />
She explained that the way he was carrying his belongings was what tipped her off, and that he should be more careful of thieves. If he wasn't embarrassed before, he was now. Just as he secured his bag tighter, and situated Swinub into a better position, the pig Pokémon in his arms suddenly sneezed all over his chest.<br />
<br />
Danny could tell she was trying to hold back laughter, as he wiped Swinub boogers off of his shirt. She introduced herself as Silvia, and went in to explain that she was a tour guide, and offered to help with anything. Grateful for a change of subject, Danny introduced himself, and told Silvia what he knew about the book he was looking for. &quot;Do you know any place that might have something like that? Maybe an old bookstore, or library or something?&quot;<br />

<span style="color: yellow"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>Ion Island</i></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>Storm Lake</u></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u><u>Myahoo</u>:</u></b> Cam smiles at your approach; he was waiting to see if you’d try to keep Pidgey down by other means, namely the use of force, and is visibly glad you decide to work harder on your Styler technique instead. As you try your best to control the device, the spinning top-like contraption draws a second circle beneath the first, though considerably faster than before. It starts wobbling violently midway, causing you to hold your breath in anticipation, but soon resumes its course without falling over or straying from the drawn path. And just as Pidgey begins to take flight, you manage to complete the second circle, immediately upon which the avian is engulfed in a bright light and calmly returns to the floor.<br />
<br />
- Way to go Melissa! You got it!<br />
<br />
The bird Pokemon turns around, looking confused at first, then hops over to where you’re standing without a hint of hesitation. It flies onto your shoulder, where it perches itself casually like it’s known you for years…<br />
<br />
- Sorry for telling you Pidgey would be hard to scare earlier, I wanted to see how you handled the unexpected. You got the hang of it, it seems. I’d say you’re a natural! Melissa…<br />
<br />
After a moment of pondering, Cam walks over to the Styler disc, picks it up and hands it back to you.<br />
<br />
- Keep it, you’ve earned both the Styler and my trust. As much as I hate to get anyone else involved in this, you’re my best bet at getting the Isle’s Pokemon out of here before…<br />
<br />
Cam is interrupted by the sudden, deafening roar of thunder. After what seems like no more than five seconds, the sky becomes filled with dense, dark rainclouds that completely obscure the sun…<br />
<br />
- N-no way… already?! Damnit!! Melissa, we have to get moving. You can handle yourself in battle too, so we’ll go on separate ways to cover as much ground as possible and evacuate the Isle before it’s too late! Take the Styler and head South towards the Thunder Fields, I’ll head to the Eletron Plant. You can reach me via the Styler’s phone function should you need anything! Now go!<br />
<br />
You store the <b>1x Capture Styler</b> in your Bag and prepare to follow the Ranger’s hasty instructions, but Cam remembers one last thing.<br />
<br />
- Melissa… please don’t forget the purpose of Rangers befriending Pokemon. That Pidgey is still a free creature, despite listening to you now. Don’t take advantage of the Styler’s properties for your own gain, keep the greater good in mind!<br />
<br />
Without waiting for an answer, he dashes towards the center of the Isle, where Eletron Plant is located, leaving you no choice but to head to the Thunder Fields by yourself. You remind yourself that your mission is to befriend any wild Pokemon you meet in order to convince them to flee the Island before the two Legendary Pokemon begin to wage their war…<br />
<br />
After a while of running, you leave Storm Lake behind and now find yourself in a sprawling meadow, covered in grass as far as the eye can see. You best start looking around for wild Pokemon in need of rescuing… but just as you set your mind to the task, a violent thunderstorm suddenly begins! Lightning bold upon lightning bolt come crashing down on the plains, and while the Thunder Fields take their name from the frequent atmospheric discharges, this is one storm unlike anything Ion Island has seen in centuries – and before you know it, after <i>three</i> consecutive lightning strikes set apart by mere seconds, the grass around you is set ablaze and a wildfire starts spreading across the fields!<br />
<br />
Do you press onwards through the flames to rescue who you still can, or will you stop and try to put out the fire instead?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: yellow"><span style="font-size: 12px">All of her focus was on encircling the wild Pidgey with the Capture Disc, so Melissa missed Cam's reaction. Wildfire, however, wasn't so occupied and silently took note, while he patiently waited to see how his trainer did.<br />
<br />
Melissa sped up her circling, leading the Disc right back over the glowing line it'd left behind on its first go-around. For a moment, it wobbled dangerously at about the halfway point and she held her breath, silently hoping it would find its balance again. Somehow, it did and the Disc resumed its course, finishing off the second circle before the Pidgey manages to take off. There was a moment of bright light as the Disc did its job...and then the wild Pidgey settled calmly back onto the beach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Way to go Melissa! You got it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Qui-il!&quot;<br />
<br />
She grinned widely at Cam and Wildfire as the relief flowed over her, but motion from the Pidgey ahead of her had her turning back to watch the wild Pokemon curiously. It looked momentarily confused, before hopping towards her without hesitation and casually flying up to perch on the shoulder not occupied by a tired Cyndaquil. Melissa had to squish the excitement squirming in her chest at the way the Pidgey was behaving. It was all an illusion created by the Capture Disc's functions, after all, and there were more important things to be worrying about right now, like the looming battle of Legendaries.<br />
<br />
...still. <i>Pidgey</i>.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry for telling you Pidgey would be hard to scare earlier, I wanted to see how you handled the unexpected.&quot; Cam's voice broke her out of her thoughts, bringing her back to the current, more serious situation, and she nodded. She'd figured it was something like that and it was understandable, given what was going to happen. &quot;You got the hang of it, it seems. I'd say you're a natural! Melissa...&quot;<br />
<br />
Cam fell silent for a moment, clearly thinking <i>something</i> through, before he walked over to the Styler disc, picked it up, and handed it back to her. She and Wildfire blinked at it, the both of them glancing up at him in question as she automatically took it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep it, you've earned both the Styler and my trust.&quot; The duo blinked at him again and glanced at each other, a grin beginning to tug at Melissa's lips as Cam continued. &quot;As much as I hate to get anyone else involved in this, you're my best bet at getting the Isle's Pokemon out of here before...&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Melissa and Wildfire flinched as Cam was interrupted by a sudden, deafening roar of thunder. Bare moments after the sound, dense, dark rainclouds rolled across the sky, completely obscuring the sun and casting a shadow across everything in sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no way...already?! Damnit!! Melissa, we have to get moving. You can handle yourself in battle too, so we'll go on separate ways to cover as much ground as possible and evacuate the Isle before it's too late! Take the Styler and head South towards the Thunder Fields, I'll head to the Electron Plant. You can reach me via the Styler's phone function should you need anything! Now go!&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa hesitated for a fraction of a moment, before nodding once and tucking the Styler into her Bag. Turning towards where she thought the Thunder Fields were located, she was about to hurry off when Cam called her name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Melissa... please don't forget the purpose of Rangers befriending Pokemon. That Pidgey is still a free creature, despite listening to you now. Don't take advantage of the Styler's properties for your own gain, keep the greater good in mind!&quot;<br />
<br />
He then dashed off, without waiting for an answer, leaving Melissa feeling somewhat conflicted as she headed towards the Thunder Fields. She quickly shook her thoughts off, though; it was something that she could think on when there weren't more immediate concerns, like evacuating wild Pokemon from the proximity of a Legendary battle.<br />
<br />
She ran for a while, leaving the Storm Lake behind as she quickly approached a sprawling, grass-covered meadow. <i>Okay, this looks as good a place as any to start,</i> she thought, already scanning the grass for Pokemon. <i>Remember. Befriend and evacuate. Befriend and evacuate.</i><br />
<br />
She repeated the mantra to herself as she reached for a Pokeball, thinking that she could use some help spotting the wild Pokemon, but before she could call anyone out, a thunderstorm hit the area. Melissa reflexively ducked, covering her ears and squinting out at the scenery as lightning bolt after lightning bolt hit the plains. The thunder rattled her bones and made her heart thud with each boom and roll, making her wonder how she was gonna get anything done when three lightning strikes lit a blaze on the plains. The fire began spreading before she even managed to gather her thoughts and she cursed herself at the oversight. Why hadn't she brought out a Pokemon with Lightning Rod before this? With the Electrical Legendaries around and actively fighting, was it no wonder the number of thunderstorms had skyrocketed?<br />
<br />
Melissa immediately decided to rectify her oversight, calling out her Blitzle, Storm, and her Cubone, Layla, both of whom had Lightningrod. The equine materialized with a haughty shake of her head, while Layla huddled closer to Melissa's leg, eyeing the dark skies warily. <i>That should take care of the nearest lightning strikes...</i><br />
<br />
Melissa shrugged the shoulder Wildfire was sitting on, which prompted the Cyndaquil to hop down to the ground, and released her Houndour, Prince. She then raised her voice to be heard over the noise, motioning for Storm to come closer when the Blitzle looked stubborn. &quot;Wildfire, Prince. I'm gonna need the two of you to go past the fire and see whether there's any wild Pokemon who're caught up in it. Use Foresight and Odor Sleuth, if you guys have to, and stick to non-Fire-type attacks, if worst comes to worst. If you guys find anyone, tell them to get out ASAP or herd them my way, if they refuse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her two Fire-types gave her an acknowledging cry and a bark, before turning and heading out into the plains. She turned to the two left behind, one of whom was looking determinedly bored. &quot;Storm.&quot; Melissa's voice was sharper than it was with her Cyndaquil and Houndour, but her Blitzle had always been more willful. Maybe it was because Storm'd been born wild; maybe it was just her personality. Whatever the case, Melissa couldn't afford for Storm to test their boundaries in the middle of a situation like this. &quot;I need to you see whether we can start to put this fire out. I want you to use a <b>Rain Dance</b> to see if we can put the fire out with just water, but if that doesn't work, I want you to use <b>Sand-Attack</b>. See if we can smother the fire, instead.&quot; Melissa watched Storm with a sharp eye as the Blitzle shifted her weight, eyeing Melissa back. After a moment, Storm snorted, shook her head again, and did as she was told.<br />
<br />
Her difficult Pokemon dealt with, Melissa looked down at her Cubone, who was hovering close to her leg and glancing hesitantly up at her. Melissa shot her a small, hopefully-reassuring smile. &quot;Don't stick too close, Layla. Don't wanna accidentally electrocute <i>me</i>, do you?&quot; Layla shook her head, looking torn between stepping closer for reassurance and stepping farther away, so as to reduce the chances of catching Melissa in the Lightningrod effect. &quot;Just stay a few steps away, okay?&quot; Layla hesitated and then took another few steps away.<br />
<br />
<i>Okay. That should be everything...oh. Nope. One more.</i> She bumped her arm against the wild Pidgey's talons to get it to climb onto her arm and tried not to wince at its claws. &quot;What about you? You're from here, right? Do you want to help?&quot;<br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> Red Skull is visibly amused at your outburst.<br />
<br />
- See, that’s why you’re a child and we’re the adults! It’s <i>business</i>, dear. There’s no money to be made on Contests that we can’t easily make twice of in a simple Battle Tournament. It’s called return on investment, darling. I could say you’d learn about it when you grew older, but well… you living to grow up at all is looking rather unlikely right now!<br />
<br />
Pinsir steps forward. You’d never really taken the time to notice how terrifying one can be up close, especially one this large and covered in blood stains all over… But your resolve is stronger than any fear. You decide to recruit the aid of another partner while keeping Meowth as your battler – putting to use what you trained extensively over the last years, you ask Snub to sniff out the guard’s scent from the keychain and then locate his sister’s Pokemon, if any trace of his odor lingered on or around the right pod… it’s a great plan, admittedly, but you have no way of knowing whether it’ll actually work. Trail by error, as they say, especially since you also vaguely instruct her to look for a switch…<br />
<br />
- Oh that’s precious! Go on you ugly mutt, smell around all you want, have your fun! Because the only way out of here is through me, whether you actually find anything or not. And my friend here doesn’t look too keen on letting you survive, let alone pass…<br />
<br />
Meow hesitates briefly in the face of such an imposing enemy, but knows it’s do or die time, and letting you down isn’t an option! He bolts forward and slaps Pinsir with an unexpected Fake Out, then takes advantage of the enemy’s staggering to let out an ear-piercing Screech! Pinsir brings his hands to his head in an attempt to block out the noise, exposing himself for a physical strike, which is exactly what you had in mind – Meow runs up to Pinsir again and strikes with an upward strike of his claws resembling the old samurai sword technique <i>Swallow Return</i>, an unavoidable slash that proves very effective against Red Skull’s partner, who definitely felt that one! But even so, the woman in red’s smile persists…<br />
<br />
- Cute, your cat has guts. But really now, don’t you value the life of your friend? Any Trainer worth their salt knows what kind of moves Pinsir prefer… but let me remind you why you just sentenced your Normal-Type buddy to death! <b>Close Combat</b>!<br />
<br />
Capitalizing on Meowth’s proximity even in the poorly-lit room, Pinsir has no trouble reaching the Scratch-Cat… He unleashes a violent barrage of punches and kicks that seems to go on forever, and as a result fells the much smaller feline who is left barely conscious…<br />
<br />
- This is the difference in power between the two of us, darling. But I’m not in a hurry to end it, so by all means, keep flailing about! I do love watching them <i>squirm</i>…<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Snub is sniffing around for that switch you mentioned to no avail; there doesn’t seem to be one anywhere around here, meaning the power supply to the lab must be controlled remotely from somewhere else… Trying its absolute best to ignore the beating handed to Meow and focusing on its other task, Snub starts heading to each pod, carefully trying to pick traces of the same scent it got from the guard’s keychain… the whole searching and sniffing process is going to take time. Time you might not be able to afford if Red Skull keeps wiping the floor with you…<br />
<br />
What will you do now?!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Pud’n</u>:</b> Silvia seems to take an instant liking to your Swinub obviously amused at its antics. Ironically, it seems your partner sneezing all over you was a fantastic ice breaker, so you decide to make the most of the young woman’s offer and ask her specifically about the one thing who brought you to Salin.<br />
<br />
She listens carefully, and her expression turns somber at the mention of the book’s title. Something’s off…<br />
<br />
- That’s… funny. You’re not the first one to ask me about that book recently. Just yesterday, actually…<br />
<br />
She stops briefly, as if contemplating something. She’s a difficult person to read, but you can tell there’s something about your request that troubles her, which is definitely odd.<br />
<br />
- I’m not sure why people are after that book, to be honest. I’ve had to do my fair share of reading to become a tour guide, and although I never saw that particular book, anyone who’s studied the history of Kanto and Viridian City has heard of it… or at the very least its author. Are you sure you want to find that book? I… I’m not sure it’s a good idea to be digging up that particular remnant of the past. You know who the author was, right?...<br />
<br />
She looks down at her feet, bites her lip and finally seems to make a decision.<br />
<br />
Listen, there are plenty of bookstores around Salin. But if you’re absolutely sure that’s the <i>only</i> book you want, you should search the Cascadia Central Library in the historical district. It’s to the North of here, just past the Pokemon Center. Look Danny, I told the other person who asked me about the “Mysteries of the Earth” the exact same thing yesterday: I’m pretty sure that’s a dangerous tome to be asking around for. People might get the wrong impression… all sorts of people. There are so many other great things to do and see here in Salin!<br />
<br />
Silvia seems insistent that you don’t find the “Mysteries of the Earth”, for whatever reason, but at least now you got some pointers. So now what: will you try to squeeze some more information on the subject from the young tour guide, follow her directions or abandon your pursuit as advised and do something else entirely?</span></span></span><br />

<br />
Keeping a cool head amidst the chaos that surrounds you is in of itself a remarkable feat. That you’re able to conjure such a solution to the multi-variable equation that is the clashing of two Legends and the subsequent disarray of natural balance is nothing short of prodigious, but your plan seems to cover everything! You watch as every nearby electrical discharge is harmlessly diverted and absorbed by Layla and Storm with their Lightningrod Ability; Prince and Wildfire have no trouble jumping into and beyond the flames to search for wild Pokemon to herd and protect; and despite the move possibly worsening the already violent thunderstorm above, the Rain Dance produces a heavy downpour that indeed starts putting out the fire after a little while. So well-oiled is your team strategy that Pidgey doesn’t even have to move from your shoulder! Cam would be proud.<br />
<br />
With the situation firmly under control, you see your Houndour and Cyndaquil return from amidst the smoke of the doused fire, three Bunnelby running ahead of them, frightened by both the weather and Prince’s scary-looking figure. They dash towards you and suddenly stop, trapped between you and your Pokemon and unsure of what to do next! If only they were already Diggersby, they might have an easier time withstanding the impending electrical disaster, but as it stands, there is no possible hope for the three bunnies to walk out of the Legendary clash unharmed. This is what Cam sent you out here for, anyway: as you keep telling yourself, <i>”Befriend and evacuate”</i>!<br />
<br />
Just as you bring out your Styler, another lightning bolt comes crashing down, this one falling dangerously close to you… but wasn’t that why you had Layla stand nearby?! Why didn’t her Lightningrod work?! You turn around to ask your Cubone for an explanation, only to find her much farther than where you left her, apparently chasing something along the grassy fields of the Thunder Plains. Where on earth is she going? What could have caught her attention like that to make her forget your instructions so easily?!<br />
<br />
The Bunnelby grow restless by the minute, and Layla walks farther away. Oh, the conflicts of living the lives of Trainer and Ranger at the same time… Well, what will you do now?</span><br />

Hermione’s reaction proves more timely than either yours or Meowth’s, and she’s having the worst of it! The Bug-Type aims an Ice Beam at the hellish speaker and shoots, hitting its mark and causing the blasted thing to fall from the wall in a chunk of ice, the noise ceasing immediately.<br />
<br />
You take a while to regroup, head still bursting with pain and your ears hardly recovered from the merciless assault they were subjected to. Something’s very wrong here, no simple malfunction should cause a loudspeaker to be so freaking loud, name considered and all. No, someone or something was behind it, controlling the facility and definitely trying to keep you from progressing any further! But they weren’t able to stop you this time… you have to press onwards and find out what’s causing all this chaos, you promised Bolt after all!<br />
<br />
The backup generator room only has one exit, mercifully. It’s the only way to go, so you leave the area behind and see what lies beyond: another corridor, leading straight ahead, with two left turns possible – one in the middle of the hallway, and the other at the very end. Curious also is how there is <i>light</i> coming from the left at the center of the corridor, indicating a possible still-functioning source of power…<br />
<br />
You decide to head along the hallway and choose which left turn to follow , the closest one or the one at the end, when you get closer. But as you traverse the hallowed tunnel, the light coming from the nearest left turn starts to flicker… and then goes out! Another backup generator that just dried out?

are still crackling with electricity, as if they’d just fed, which would explain the localized blackout you just witnessed. You half-hoped they’d ignore you and roll along until the end of the corridor you’re in, meaning you could follow them stealthily from a safe distance… but they are quick to notice your presence and stop in their tracks, barring your way and beginning to charge up, taking on a golden glow that could mean anything, from an imminent Explosion to an incoming bolt of lightning….<br />

Hermione’s reaction proves more timely than either yours or Meowth’s, and she’s having the worst of it! The Bug-Type aims an Ice Beam at the hellish speaker and shoots, hitting its mark and causing the blasted thing to fall from the wall in a chunk of ice, the noise ceasing immediately.<br />

You take a while to regroup, head still bursting with pain and your ears hardly recovered from the merciless assault they were subjected to. Something’s very wrong here, no simple malfunction should cause a loudspeaker to be so freaking loud, name considered and all. No, someone or something was behind it, controlling the facility and definitely trying to keep you from progressing any further! But they weren’t able to stop you this time… you have to press onwards and find out what’s causing all this chaos, you promised Bolt after all!<br />
<br />
The backup generator room only has one exit, mercifully. It’s the only way to go, so you leave the area behind and see what lies beyond: another corridor, leading straight ahead, with two left turns possible – one in the middle of the hallway, and the other at the very end. Curious also is how there is <i>light</i> coming from the left at the center of the corridor, indicating a possible still-functioning source of power…<br />
<br />
You decide to head along the hallway and choose which left turn to follow , the closest one or the one at the end, when you get closer. But as you traverse the hallowed tunnel, the light coming from the nearest left turn starts to flicker… and then goes out! Another backup generator that just dried out? What could be the cause of…<br />

You half-hoped they’d ignore you and roll along until the end of the corridor you’re in, meaning you could follow them stealthily from a safe distance… but they are quick to notice your presence and stop in their tracks, barring your way and beginning to charge up, taking on a golden glow that could mean anything, from an imminent Explosion to an incoming bolt of lightning….<br />

What now, Keith?!</span></span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: YeLlOw"><span style="font-size: 12px">All three of them were taking the horrible noise rather badly, but of them, only Hermione took action. The remarkable little Weedle, unable to cover her ears, knew that her only hope for relief lay in attacking the source. She therefore unleashed an Ice Beam at the offending speaker, and to general relief, disabled it. The mercifully muted machine fell to the floor, encased in ice, and more to the point, totally silent. &quot;Whew,&quot; Keith sighed in relief. &quot;Oh, man... Hermione, you're awesome,&quot; he chuckled weakly, managing a small smile as he looked at the Bug/Poison-type.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weedle, Weedle,&quot; Hermione replied modestly, blushing slightly at the praise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gaaah... Let's keep movin',&quot; Meowth suggested, still shaken up by the awful auditory assault.<br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed,&quot; Keith nodded.<br />
<br />
Hermione, meanwhile, was eyeing the speaker curiously. &quot;Weedle... Weedle Weedle weed, Weedle Weedle...&quot; she murmured thoughtfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hermione makes a good point,&quot; Meowth piped up. &quot;She's wonderin' just wat da hell got dat speaker makin' such a noise. Dat ain't sometin' dat can happen just because o' some malfunction. It almost seemed deliberate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like someone's trying to stop us from making progress,&quot; Keith murmured. &quot;Not exactly the most pleasant notion. Whatever's messing this place up... somehow I don't think it's doing so by accident. Whoever or whatever this is knows what they're doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yer right- dat ain't a pleasant notion,&quot; Meowth agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well, we still promised Bolt,&quot; Keith reminded the Normal-type. &quot;We don't give up, do we?&quot;<br />
<br />
Meowth sighed. &quot;I couldn't if I wanted ta,&quot; he nodded. &quot;Youse sees ta dat well enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn straight,&quot; Keith nodded. &quot;Now let's move!&quot;<br />
<br />
There was only one exit to the room, so the way ahead was pretty clear. As they entered yet another corridor, Keith could see they had two options from there- two left turns, one in the middle of the corridor, and another at the very end. He headed forward, wondering which turn to make, when they could see light coming from the first of the left turns. Another source of power...?<br />
<br />
...Not for long, it wasn't. The light flickered and shut off completely as they drew nearer. &quot;What the...&quot; Keith murmured, but then, he learned exactly &quot;what the&quot;. A pair of spherical creatures rolled into view from the very corridor they had been eyeballing. Keith stopped in his tracks and took out his Pokédex- muting it, out of fear of attracting unwanted attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Electrode, the Ball Pokémon, and the evolved form of Voltorb,&quot; read the text that scrolled across the screen. &quot;Electrode's short temper and tendency to use moves such as Self-Destruct and Explosion with little or even no provocation, in addition to its spherical shape, have earned it the nickname, 'the Bomb Ball'. Electrode feeds on electricity, and can explode as a result of eating too much of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ohhh, this was not good. Keith recalled Nitro, a Voltorb he once owned, and knew well enough that the evolution line did in fact feed on electricity. That said, however, Nitro was remarkably laid back for its species, and Keith never knew it to explode, but Keith had a grim feeling Nitro was the exception, rather than the rule. He silently stood there, Pokédex still out, still aiming it at the Electrode in the hopes of gaining any more pertinent information about them should a fight break out, but honestly, he was hoping they wouldn't notice him. The pair were crackling with electricity- they must have just fed off of whatever generator was powering that light they'd seen!<br />
<br />
Alas, no such luck- the Electrode noticed the newcomers almost immediately, and to Keith's horror, they started glowing a bright yellow. Whether this meant an Electric attack or an Explosion attack remained to be seen, but Keith did not want to find out either way! He had seconds to react, literally seconds-<br />
<br />
&quot;Weedle! Weedle Weedle!&quot; Hermione interrupted, hastily pointing her jet-black tail stinger at one of Keith's Poké Balls. Keith knew exactly which one this was, and moreover, he had a shrewd idea as to what kind of idea Hermione had conceived.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course!&quot; Keith murmured, plucking the sphere off his belt. If it was an Electric move he had to defend against, this would do the trick quite nicely indeed. And if it was an Explosion, the contents of the ball had a way to defend against that as well. But in order for either of those things to apply, the ball's occupant had to be sent out, and so he enlarged the ball and threw it. &quot;Rowena, <b>Reflect</b>!&quot; Keith exclaimed as his Nidoqueen materialized before him. And judging by the approving nod he got from Hermione, he had the feeling this was exactly what the Weedle had in mind.<br />
<br />
As soon as Rowena caught sight of the ominously glowing Electrode, she knew exactly what Keith was getting at- she too couldn't tell whether it was impending Explosions or some sort of Electric attack, but she set to work casting her Reflect, just in case it was the former, taking comfort in her natural immunity to the latter.</span></span><br />

Keeping a cool head amidst the chaos that surrounds you is in of itself a remarkable feat. That you’re able to conjure such a solution to the multi-variable equation that is the clashing of two Legends and the subsequent disarray of natural balance is nothing short of prodigious, but your plan seems to cover everything! You watch as every nearby electrical discharge is harmlessly diverted and absorbed by Layla and Storm with their Lightningrod Ability; Prince and Wildfire have no trouble jumping into and beyond the flames to search for wild Pokemon to herd and protect; and despite the move possibly worsening the already violent thunderstorm above, the Rain Dance produces a heavy downpour that indeed starts putting out the fire after a little while. So well-oiled is your team strategy that Pidgey doesn’t even have to move from your shoulder! Cam would be proud.<br />
<br />
With the situation firmly under control, you see your Houndour and Cyndaquil return from amidst the smoke of the doused fire, three Bunnelby running ahead of them, frightened by both the weather and Prince’s scary-looking figure. They dash towards you and suddenly stop, trapped between you and your Pokemon and unsure of what to do next! If only they were already Diggersby, they might have an easier time withstanding the impending electrical disaster, but as it stands, there is no possible hope for the three bunnies to walk out of the Legendary clash unharmed. This is what Cam sent you out here for, anyway: as you keep telling yourself, <i>”Befriend and evacuate”</i>!<br />
<br />
Just as you bring out your Styler, another lightning bolt comes crashing down, this one falling dangerously close to you… but wasn’t that why you had Layla stand nearby?! Why didn’t her Lightningrod work?! You turn around to ask your Cubone for an explanation, only to find her much farther than where you left her, apparently chasing something along the grassy fields of the Thunder Plains. Where on earth is she going? What could have caught her attention like that to make her forget your instructions so easily?!<br />
<br />
The Bunnelby grow restless by the minute, and Layla walks farther away. Oh, the conflicts of living the lives of Trainer and Ranger at the same time… Well, what will you do now?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: yellow"><span style="font-size: 9px">Melissa watched critically as the nearest lightning bolts ground themselves in Layla and Storm, both of whom seemed to be holding up well under the onslaught, while Wildfire and Prince disappeared into the flames. The Rain Dance looked like it was helping, the fire shrinking after a bit...and it only now occurred to her that it could've made the lightning worse. Thankfully, that didn't seem to have been the case, so she let the Pidgey resettle on her shoulder as she kept a sharp eye for any other possible problem that could crop up.<br />
<br />
Three unfamiliar rabbit-like Pokemon with probably-prehensile ears emerged from the smoke, just ahead of Wildfire and Prince, and stopped abruptly upon spotting Melissa. The trio of wild Pokemon must not have wanted to leave, if her two Fire-types had to herd them towards her, so she reached back to pull out the Capture Styler. It'd probably be a good idea to keep them between her two Lightning Rods--<br />
<br />
A lightning bolt crashed dangerously close to them, inside the perimeter she thought Storm and Layla had set up, and she flinched. Melissa quickly shook off her impending panic, forcing herself to remain calm, and searched for the two Pokemon she'd assigned the job. She spotted Storm almost immediately, but Layla seemed to have left a greater distance than Melissa had expected between them, chasing after something in the fields. That was...odd. Layla tended to be clingy whenever she was in unfamiliar territory and this <i>more than</i> qualified, so what could've caught her attention like that?<br />
<br />
Melissa couldn't see whatever it was and, after a moment of straining, decided it didn't matter. There were more important things to deal with at the moment. &quot;Layla!&quot; She tried to yell as loud as she could, but she was almost immediately drowned out by another roll of thunder. Shaking her head, she turned to her duo of Fire-types instead. &quot;Prince. Layla.&quot; The Houndour barked an affirmative and bounded off to retrieve the wayward Cubone. &quot;Storm, circle in.&quot; The Blitzle tossed her head almost irritably, but trotted closer, so her Lightningrod ability would hopefully catch any lightning bolts coming in their direction. Turning her attention back to the trio of Bunnelby, Melissa took a breath. &quot;Okay. And heere we go.&quot;<br />
<br />
She pressed the button that would deploy the Capture Disc and led it forwards. <i>Circle tight and fast. Don't let them break the line. Not too close and not too far.</i> The moment the Disc started putting down the glowing line, she went for it, focus narrowing down to the touch screen, the Capture Disc, and the Bunnelby.

<b><u>Iridi Beach</u></b><br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Emi</u>:</b> You can’t stand by idly while everyone on the beach goes into a panic. Your primary instinct is to step in and help out in any way you can which, while admirable, can prove too much to handle given the current commotion…<br />
<br />
Not unlike a field general, you instruct your troops to move out and rescue as many people as possible – Farseer and Adrammelech via water and Surgei via air – before the Carvanha claim any more victims.<br />
<br />
The Alomomola surrounds himself with four rings of blue energy and rushes off towards the crowd still struggling to get back to land, and the Yanmega darts off after him, beating the Water-Type in quickness and arriving first. Both Pokemon begin to carry who they can, prioritizing infants, but the third soldier you deployed doesn’t prove quite as obedient: the Binacle changes course, powering up considerably with his trusty Shell Smash while leaving him exceedingly frail defensively, and instead of aiding in the task of rescuing victims, instead aims straight at the Carvanha group!<br />
<br />
You are alerted by Farseer’s cries, having meanwhile already reached the injured tourists on the sand. One of them, an elderly man in his seventies, has a nasty wound in his right leg, bleeding profusely. Another man you assume to be the elder’s son looks on horrified, blaming himself for what happened.<br />
<br />
- I should have never encouraged him to go so deep in the water! Is-is there anything you can do?!<br />
<br />
You split your attention between the injured man and the events unfolding at sea – because soon after Adrammelech reaches the red stain on the water, five Carvanha leap out and come crashing down on the reckless, yet underpowered Binacle, dragging him into the depths of the ocean as Farseer looks on horrified with an unconscious woman draped across his back.<br />
<br />
There is someone on land who desperately needs whatever healing expertise you might possess, while one of your partners is in peril at the same time. Farseer and Surgei are both in the middle of rescuing swimmers...<br />
<br />
What’s your plan of action?</span>[/SIZE]</span>

<span style="color: deepskyblue"><span style="font-size: 10px">Lillian darted down towards the beach, looking to try and and save as many people as possible. It wasn't just something like a wish for Lillian, it was really more like a compulsion for her. It was unthinkable that she would shirk in that duty; the spirit of Nightingale was pushing her just as much as she was. She looked over and saw Farseer putting up the rings of energy around him in order to give him some extra protection if he was attacked. Lillian was confident that Farseer was going to be able to handle himself; outside of Hades, he was one of the strongest members of her team due to his extensive time being on it. As was Surgei, who was darting towards the water faster than she was. It was probably the Pokemon's Speed Boost ability that allowed him to move with such speed, and both Farseer and Surgei reached the remaining people from the water and started to bring people back to shore. Lillian had just gotten to the beach and saw some of the injured tourists, immediately getting ready to do some impromptu medical treatment. She didn't really have a field hospital in order to best treat everyone, so she had to do with what she had in order to help people. <br />
<br />
There was an elderly man sitting on the beach, with a large wound on his right leg; Lillian couldn't tell at immediately glance if it was just a bit wound or if they really dug into them. But she had to treat this man immediately, if she didn't, there was a pretty big chance he would lose too much blood given the rate of his bleeding. She bent down, pulling a roll of medical gauze, cursing to herself that she didn't have something more that could stop the bleeding. But she was distracted by Farseer's cries, and she looked at the water, seeing a pack of Carvanha jump out of the water and strike Adrammelech, dragging him down into the water. She didn't know what Adrammelech had went out on his own in order to fight the Carvanha, but she cursed again. Now she had to worry about him, as well as all the people who were dealing with the pack of ravenous fish. She didn't have long to make a decision, but she quickly took a Pokeball from her bag and threw it into the air. The Pokeball opened in a bright flash and released a Starly by the name of Bora. <br />
<br />
&quot;The Spear Rises!&quot; Bora proudly announced as he looked around his surroundings. &quot;Bora, listen to me. You're going to have to help Surgei getting these people get back to land, even if its just leading them. You're to relieve Farseer and tell him that he needs to go rescue Adrammelech. I don't want to send him alone, but we don't have anyone who can do underwater combat as well as Farseer. Can I trust you, Bora?&quot; Lillian immediately spoke to him, ignoring his usual antics. Bora nodded and flew into the air almost immediately. &quot;Bora will perform the mission with great success! Do not worry, for The Spear is here!&quot; He flew down and flew in front of Farseer, who was just dragging back an unconscious woman from the waters. &quot;Farseer, Lillian has instructed that you go and rescue Adrammelech, while Surgei and I help get these people back to shore!&quot; Bora was enthusiastic as usual, despite his small size. Farseer nodded briefly, before diving into the water. All he had to do was keep the Carvanha occupied in order to allow Adrammelech to escape, and he figured that he could absorb their attacks long enough to allow that chance to happen. Maybe with an application of a <b>Pound</b> or a <b>Doubleslap</b> to convince them to flee. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Lillian focused on the old man in front of her once again. &quot;Don't worry, I'll do the best I can for him. He's going to need something to stop the bleeding, something I don't have, but I can dress the wound for now and ask you to put pressure on it. It's going to hurt for him, but you have to do it.&quot; She immediately unrolled a lot of the gauze and wrapped it around the man's leg, the blood already dirtying the gauze as she was wrapping it. A wound like this was going to need its dressing changed frequently, and Lillian knew that. But there were definitely more people who were going to need some help, and she couldn't just constantly look over this man. &quot;If you have a towel or something, try to put him on it and get him out of the sand, I don't want sand getting into the wound. I'm going to have to help the other people, I'm sorry, but I'll be back as soon as I can.&quot; Lillian didn't like leaving the old man there, but she knew she had to. <br />
<br />
She was worried about Adrammelech too. There was so much going on.</span></span></div>

<b><u>Icy Cavern</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Raves</u>:</b> The cold is really starting to get to you, despite not having been careless in any way when preparing for this journey – these just aren’t temperatures compatible with survival for any extended period of time. Still, you reason that pressing onwards is a gamble with better odds than backtracking at this point, knowing what awaits you on the surface.<br />
<br />
Faced with an unexpected choice, you pick the tunnel from which a rumbling sound is heard. After all, movement of any sort is unlikely in this barren cave, and all the more unlikely to come from a living creature, but the noise has you intrigued… You venture down the tunnel to your right, followed closely by Nothing who continues to provide you with as much heat as he can, and as you proceed the tunnel begins to widen. You notice the walls, whose surface was initially smooth, become progressively edgier and missing chunks as the path grow wider, as if something forcefully tore it open as it went along to make room to pass…<br />
<br />
After a while of further enduring the unforgiving cold (even your head is starting to hurt at this point…), the tunnel comes to an end – a large opening leads to a huge cave, a huge hole within the depths of the icy mountain. You notice that, somehow, it is decidedly warmer in here, and it soon becomes apparent why: purple flames burn atop ice-made chandeliers, a physical impossibility if you ever saw one. The blazes provide light and heat to the clearing, and at the center of the cave something massive catches your eye – the source of the rumbling sound, varying in intensity… it’s a gigantic slumbering

<b>King’s Rock</b>. The gargantuan beast seems to be holdng on to something, protecting it in his arms as it rests, but you can’t quite get a clear view of what it is the polar bear is guarding…<br />
<br />
On the wall opposite to you is another opening, no doubt leading to a tunnel further into the mountain. Now it’s time to choose… Will you approach the Beartic silently, engage it while it sleeps, backtrack to the windy tunnel ,or try to go around the slumbering giant and keep moving on to the opening behind it?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: lightblue">The chill making the decision for him, and reluctant to head towards a chill wind, Alex ventured right, down the grumbling tunnel, Nothung providing some heat as even the chimp trembled slightly, the cold not designed for habituation in the long term, never mind short term. As the pair ventured, the human noted the thinner path seemed to strangely be widening, and the smooth walls becoming more and more roughened, as though something had gouged and carved a path...towards the wind?<br />
<br />
Some time passed, and Alex's movement became sluggish as his head began to throb, the bitter chill starting to numb his mind, as though inviting him to a frigid sleep, which he forced away, for slumbering in this location would be akin to entering a sealed coffin...and then the pair found themselves in something they didn't expect. Not the giant chasm, no, that was a welcome sight, and te trainer felt he could breathe a little easier, but the fact it was warmer, due less towards the spacious area and more towards what lay around.<br />
<br />
Giant ice chandeliers, crowned with unusual purple flames, crackling gently within the chamber. Even though it was still very cold, it was a sign of some comfort, even with the constant rumbling, the source of which lay in the middle of the room. A colossal white furry thing, clutching something, with what was unmistakably a King's Rock cresting its head, the much bigger Beartic's echoing snore was what created the rumble.<br />
<br />
Beyond, across the chamber, another opening, which would doubtlessly lead further into the mountain. Alex looked at the bear, then at Nothung, the Infernape eyeing the purple fire, and Alex didn't have to think twice on his planned course of action. While the King's Rock was a valuable trinket in this day, that bear didn't get that big on a diet of ice and Snoverberries, and probably reached that girth from foolish treasure hunters, which could explain the flames, to a lesser extent: soulfire, he surmised. Looking up at the flames, he shook his head, before looking back at the Beartic and whatever it was guarding. To engage with a beast like this would be a fool's errand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothung,&quot; he whispered to the Infernape, mist emanating from him as he spoke quietly, &quot;I think w-w-we should k-k-keep moving...let the buh-big guy enjoy his sleep-p-p...&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking his backpack off, he opened it and took out a chunk of wood with a knot of cloth on one end, a simple unlit torch. &quot;C-could you try and...g-g-get this lit with one of those fires? I k-k-kinda want a closer look...no worries if-f-f-f-f not, I just want to see if they're as warm as th-th-they look...we'll stick near the outside and h-h-head for that opening, leaving the big guy alone...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If he seems like he'll wake up, g-g-give him a <b>yawn</b> to try and keep him doc-c-cile...but be ready to run if he gets angry...&quot;<br />
<br />
With that said, Alex handed his starter the torch and began to quietly make his way round the outskirts of the chamber aiming for the far opening...</span><br />

<br />
<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Pud’n</u>:</b> Silvia seems to take an instant liking to your Swinub obviously amused at its antics. Ironically, it seems your partner sneezing all over you was a fantastic ice breaker, so you decide to make the most of the young woman’s offer and ask her specifically about the one thing who brought you to Salin.<br />
<br />
She listens carefully, and her expression turns somber at the mention of the book’s title. Something’s off…<br />
<br />
- That’s… funny. You’re not the first one to ask me about that book recently. Just yesterday, actually…<br />
<br />
She stops briefly, as if contemplating something. She’s a difficult person to read, but you can tell there’s something about your request that troubles her, which is definitely odd.<br />
<br />
- I’m not sure why people are after that book, to be honest. I’ve had to do my fair share of reading to become a tour guide, and although I never saw that particular book, anyone who’s studied the history of Kanto and Viridian City has heard of it… or at the very least its author. Are you sure you want to find that book? I… I’m not sure it’s a good idea to be digging up that particular remnant of the past. You know who the author was, right?...<br />
<br />
She looks down at her feet, bites her lip and finally seems to make a decision.<br />
<br />
Listen, there are plenty of bookstores around Salin. But if you’re absolutely sure that’s the <i>only</i> book you want, you should search the Cascadia Central Library in the historical district. It’s to the North of here, just past the Pokemon Center. Look Danny, I told the other person who asked me about the “Mysteries of the Earth” the exact same thing yesterday: I’m pretty sure that’s a dangerous tome to be asking around for. People might get the wrong impression… all sorts of people. There are so many other great things to do and see here in Salin!<br />
<br />
Silvia seems insistent that you don’t find the “Mysteries of the Earth”, for whatever reason, but at least now you got some pointers. So now what: will you try to squeeze some more information on the subject from the young tour guide, follow her directions or abandon your pursuit as advised and do something else entirely?</span></span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: silver">Danny told Silvia as much about the book as he knew, which admittedly wasn't much, but something seemed off. When he mentioned the title, Silvia's personality seemed to do an instant one-eighty. The cheerful-looking girl who greeted him just a moment ago suddenly looked...was she sad? Why?<br />
<br />
&quot;That's...funny. You’re not the first one to ask me about that book recently. Just yesterday actually...&quot; Danny's heart missed a beat. Could he really be that lucky? Wait. Something’s off. Why'd she stop? &quot;Are you sure you want to find that book? You know who the author was right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny was a little confused by that last question. Didn't everyone know Giovanni? &quot;Yeah, he was the gym leader in Viridian. He was the strongest in the region, then Team Rocket attacked, and he disappeared.&quot; <i>What's there to know?</i> He thought. <i>Obviously he drove off Team Rocket.</i> He was probably hunting down any remaining members right now.<br />
<br />
The look Silvia was giving Danny cut right through him. If he had one weakness, it was pretty girls. Under any other circumstance, he'd have given in to the pleading look in her eyes, but he was here on a mission.<br />
<br />
Danny closed his eyes trying to gain composure. Surely it would be easier to disappoint Silvia if he couldn't see her. He let out a sigh, and opened his eyes. Apparently she was following Danny's train of thought, because when he finally looked at her, she was staring at her feet, biting her lip.<br />
<br />
There was a part of him that wished he'd left his eyes closed. When Silvia returned his gaze, she looked like she could have been fighting back tears. There was a pleading note in her voice as she told him where the book was, and that she had given the information to another man just yesterday.<br />
<br />
Her pleads for Danny to give up his search fell on deaf ears. Danny was already in his own head. A sense of urgency now came over him. <i> Damn. This guy could have already taken it! But if she only told him about it yesterday, there's still a good chance he's still on the island. Maybe there's even a chance he didn't even go for it right away! </i><br />
<br />
Danny tried his best to sound calm, despite the mixture of nervous excitement he was feeling. &quot;Look Silvia...I know it might be dangerous, but I didn't travel halfway across the world to give up. Especially when I'm this close. So, please...what can you tell me about the man from yesterday? What did he look like? Did he mention where he was going?&quot; <br />
<br />
Suddenly a thought struck Danny. Silvia, seems to know a lot about the history of this book; not to mention being a tour guide. She should know this city like the back of her hand. She could be a useful ally. &quot;Hey! Why dont you come with me? I mean, you don't have to, of course. I just thought you'd like to find out what all of this is really about for yourself. Plus, I <i>am </i> a tourist, and you <i>are </i> a tour guide...&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny waited for Silvia's response. Comforted that he had all the knowledge he needed to start his his search. Anything Silvia had to offer after this was just icing on the cake, and despite any answer she gave. He knew his next stop was that Library.<br />

<br />
<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> Red Skull is visibly amused at your outburst.<br />
<br />
- See, that’s why you’re a child and we’re the adults! It’s <i>business</i>, dear. There’s no money to be made on Contests that we can’t easily make twice of in a simple Battle Tournament. It’s called return on investment, darling. I could say you’d learn about it when you grew older, but well… you living to grow up at all is looking rather unlikely right now!<br />
<br />
Pinsir steps forward. You’d never really taken the time to notice how terrifying one can be up close, especially one this large and covered in blood stains all over… But your resolve is stronger than any fear. You decide to recruit the aid of another partner while keeping Meowth as your battler – putting to use what you trained extensively over the last years, you ask Snub to sniff out the guard’s scent from the keychain and then locate his sister’s Pokemon, if any trace of his odor lingered on or around the right pod… it’s a great plan, admittedly, but you have no way of knowing whether it’ll actually work. Trail by error, as they say, especially since you also vaguely instruct her to look for a switch…<br />
<br />
- Oh that’s precious! Go on you ugly mutt, smell around all you want, have your fun! Because the only way out of here is through me, whether you actually find anything or not. And my friend here doesn’t look too keen on letting you survive, let alone pass…<br />
<br />
Meow hesitates briefly in the face of such an imposing enemy, but knows it’s do or die time, and letting you down isn’t an option! He bolts forward and slaps Pinsir with an unexpected Fake Out, then takes advantage of the enemy’s staggering to let out an ear-piercing Screech! Pinsir brings his hands to his head in an attempt to block out the noise, exposing himself for a physical strike, which is exactly what you had in mind – Meow runs up to Pinsir again and strikes with an upward strike of his claws resembling the old samurai sword technique <i>Swallow Return</i>, an unavoidable slash that proves very effective against Red Skull’s partner, who definitely felt that one! But even so, the woman in red’s smile persists…<br />
<br />
- Cute, your cat has guts. But really now, don’t you value the life of your friend? Any Trainer worth their salt knows what kind of moves Pinsir prefer… but let me remind you why you just sentenced your Normal-Type buddy to death! <b>Close Combat</b>!<br />
<br />
Capitalizing on Meowth’s proximity even in the poorly-lit room, Pinsir has no trouble reaching the Scratch-Cat… He unleashes a violent barrage of punches and kicks that seems to go on forever, and as a result fells the much smaller feline who is left barely conscious…<br />
<br />
- This is the difference in power between the two of us, darling. But I’m not in a hurry to end it, so by all means, keep flailing about! I do love watching them <i>squirm</i>…<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Snub is sniffing around for that switch you mentioned to no avail; there doesn’t seem to be one anywhere around here, meaning the power supply to the lab must be controlled remotely from somewhere else… Trying its absolute best to ignore the beating handed to Meow and focusing on its other task, Snub starts heading to each pod, carefully trying to pick traces of the same scent it got from the guard’s keychain… the whole searching and sniffing process is going to take time. Time you might not be able to afford if Red Skull keeps wiping the floor with you…<br />
<br />
What will you do now?!</span></span>

<br />
Liza was feeling all sorts of emotions running through her veins. Watching her opponent so unfazed by their assault, was unsettling. The Lass knew they were at a disadvantage but she didn't care, she thought that the fire burning in her cat's stomach would be enough. That just trying would be enough, but now, she realized the horrible truth. That no matter how much they tried, there was always the possibility of losing and losing wasn't on Liza's agenda.<br />
<br />
There were too many lives broken from this corrupt system, she held too many people's dreams in the palm of her hand. The thought of how the people of this city have been oppressed for so many years and they're loyal companions stripped away from them was heart breaking. Liza could feel the pain tightening in her chest, <i>SAM!</i> that's what her heart was screaming for. <i>JUST SET THEM ALL FREE!</i><br />
<br />
Maybe Meowth didn't score such a direct hit as the trainer had hoped but he managed to lower down the Pinsir's defensive stats, so why wasn't Red that concerned about it...? <br />
<br />
Liza knew she couldn't draw out the battle for very long, she didn't have that many options either and time was literally against her...she had no idea how long the Pokémon in their isolation pods would last! And she wasn't about to find out first hand, not after coming so far!<br />
<br />
<i>It would be too irresponsible of me to keep Meow in with no real game plan in mind, even if he were to channel his frustration- his fuel would burn out too quickly.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;M...me...meow!&quot; Meow struggled to get up, his body already feeling heavy from just one blow...<br />
<br />
But no matter how riled up Meowth got, none of that compared to a seasoned battler. Liza had to go to plan B and fast!<br />
<br />
The trainer picked up her cat from the floor, anger in his eyes with a hint of pain he tried to conceal. &quot;That's enough, you've done what I've needed of you by lowering their defenses, you've given us a fighting chance but right now, I need you to help Snubull look for a way to unlock the pods.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;M...meow?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only an expert thief such as yourself would be capable of finding a way to unlock their cages.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her Meowth didn't like admiting defeat, but he knew when he was licked. &quot;Meow!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know I can depend on you and Snub to find a way!&quot; After freeing her lemon chiffon cat to help his companion, Liza retrieved a single Chocolateball from her bag. She held it before flinging it across the room, which popped open to reveal a pink bipedal Pokémon with feelers ears, &quot;Audino!&quot;<br />
<br />
The Lass was sure that her opponent was probably thinking, 'what's the point of replacing one normal type for another?' but Liza had a hunch that her nurse Pokémon would be able to finish the job right.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ashley, let the bond we share give life to your true form...it's time darling, Mega Evolve!&quot;<br />
<br />
Liza and Audino both rised their respective stones, a <a href="https://forums.bulbagarden.net/index.php?threads/pokemart.172029/page-5#post-5740168" class="link link--internal" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.bulbagarden.net%2Findex.php%3Fthreads%2Fpokemart.172029%2Fpage-5%23post-5740168&amp;hash=8e8eb6c94b88b323ff3530c445442835" rel="nofollow noopener">Key Stone</a> (that Liza had hidden in her bag) and a Mega Stone <a href="https://forums.bulbagarden.net/index.php?threads/pokemart.172029/page-5#post-5738718" class="link link--internal" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.bulbagarden.net%2Findex.php%3Fthreads%2Fpokemart.172029%2Fpage-5%23post-5738718&amp;hash=ea500358fbf6fcc031128d39c8b781bd" rel="nofollow noopener">Audinite</a> (which her Pokémon had hidden inside her fluffy tail), both stones soon reacted to one another, casting a glimmering light from each other before the lights began to intertwine! Allowing for a brighter light to take over her Pokémon and before Liza knew it, a brand new Audino was standing right before her!

<br />
<br />
Audino was no longer pink, but a more creamy white color with a pink shade on the edges of her coat and ears. Her ears resembled fairy wings with longer curled feelers and her coat was even longer and more flowing, with her tail having grown in size. Her eyes were no longer a gentle sea blue but a burning hot pink! Audino even don'ed what appeared to be little boots with fluffs of fur on the heels, allowing for better mobility. And finally a tuft of fluff on her chest with smaller feelers. She was no longer just another Nurse Pokémon, she was Brawler!<br />
<br />
&quot;There's something special that connect Audino's heart with my own. Unlike my Charizard, who I trained extensively to understand. Me and Audino have been in sync since the moment we've met. We can't stand bullies. We'd do anything for the need of others. And no one and I mean no one hurts some one in our family and thinks they can get away with it!&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Now...We have a fighting chance!</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Audino use <b>Disalarming Voice</b> to buy yourself enough time to send a <b>Flamethrower</b> their way! Finish by giving them a taste of your <b>Hidden Power (Rock)</b>!&quot;<br />
<br />
In the heat of battle, that's when a thought occurred to Liza, she looked around frantically at every pod, <i>I didn't think about it before, c-could Dana's Arcanine also be in this very room?</i><br />

<br />
Commanding your Pokemon like you would an army, you switch up roles to try and solve all three disasters at the same time: the wounded on the beach, the imperilled in the water and your idiot Binacle.<br />
<br />
Dutiful and to-the-point as Surgei and Farseer are in taking instructions, Adrammelech proves too unruly in the face of a challenge and now he’s gone and gotten himself overwhelmed by the Carvanha you never ordered him to attack. Bora, eccentric and apparently self-centered as he may be, is your choice to replace Farseer in the task of guiding people out of the water – you need the Alomomola’s services elsewhere, namely underwater where Adrammelech unwillingly requires assistance.<br />
<br />
While your troops mobilize, you shift your attention back to the wounded elder and patch him up as best you can before moving on to other wounded tourists. Fortunately mostly everyone else bears only superficial cuts and bite marks, and you’re quick to provide assistance with what limited tools you have available. Surgei keeps bringing in people from the water, while Bora is quick to realize he’ll have more success sticking to helping people who can already swim – there’s no way he’s big enough to actually carry anyone to shore, but he proves really good at setting the lost adults on the right path back to the sand.<br />
<br />
A sudden noise catches your attention, a loud bubbling sound coming from where Adrammelech was caught. You look over just in time to see at least a dozen Carvanha come to surface and swim frantically <i>away</i> from the shore, far off into the ocean until you lose them from sight… and then, Farseer emerges.<br />
<br />
The Alomomola’s expression says it all. On his back, Adrammelech is barely conscious, covered in severe wounds. Although he should be conserving his strength, he can’t stand still atop the larger Water-Type, instead flailing about hopelessly, intent on getting a message across, something he absolutely wants you to hear… as if he’s just discovered something incredible, or terrifying, while he was being dragged down into the depths of the sea before Farseer came to the rescue.<br />
<br />
Whereas most people seem safe thanks to you and your team’s efforts, there are still several tourists left with superficial physical scars, and many with deep psychological ones – though effectively helping every single one of them is almost impossible. And now, a new concern arises – Adrammelech’s health. Will you leave Iridi Beach to seek specialized medical help for your partner, or do you have anything in your possession that can help him out on the spot? Considering everything that’s happened in such a short amount of time, you can’t help but wonder now: is staying in Iridi Beach any longer a wise decision, or is it best to leave for another area?...</span><br />

<br />
Time has come to step up your game. Red Skull, the whip-wielding, crimson leather-dressing woman who serves as Layard’s torturer, isn’t going to stop hurting Meowth any time soon; it falls on you to switch up roles to keep your friend safe from the opponent he can’t hope to defeat. Instead, someone else will have to do it for you: Ashley, a very special Audino.<br />
<br />
Red Skull grins upon watching you switch battlers. And her grin only widens once you demonstrate the skill that sets you apart from so many other Trainers: Mega Evolution!<br />
<br />
If Pinsir looks in any way intimidated, the blood-soaked insect doesn’t show it. It snaps its red stained pincers together in challenge, while Meow welcomes the sudden break and joins Snub in her search for the guard’s sister’s Pokemon. At least that way he isn’t being pummelled mercilessly, and he can still contribute!<br />
<br />
- Cute trick for a brat like yourself. But maybe it’s not such a great idea to give dangerous toys to small children… are you sure you know what you’re doing? Careful not to hurt yourself dear!<br />
<br />
As if moving in retaliation towards Red Skull’s taunting, Ashley lets out a soundwave that staggers Pinsir, and quickly follows up with a powerful Flamethrower that engulfs the insect! Before the Bug-Type can do anything to counter or fight back, the Mega Audino summons several boulder-shaped orbs of energy and hurls them at Pinsir, each of them connecting with frightening force! Red Skull’s partner falls over on its back, but the torturer doesn’t seem all that concerned. In fact, that nauseating grin is still there are she reaches for her cellphone…<br />
<br />
- Yes, it’s me boss. She can use it. Yeah, saw it with my own eyes. Seems you’re in luck. I know what I have to do, don’t worry.<br />
<br />
While Red Skull wraps up her phone call, Meow and Snub suddenly start calling incessantly, looking to grab your attention. You turn to face them and find the Snubbull and Meowth pointing frantically to one of the pods… they found it! The creature inside is a strange one, a Pokemon you take a while to recognise given its rarity – but you’ve definitely seen more of its kind on television several times. A mall quadruped with golden fur… Legendary Coordinators like the foreigners Elle and Serena are known to use similar partners. Yes, that’s definitely a

, the Pokemon that guard asked you to find for his sister!<br />
<br />
- Took you long enough! Too long, to be honest. Pinsir, get a move on!!<br />
<br />
The man-sized insect rises to its feet with visible effort, struggling for breath. Then, channeling its remaining force, it forms a <b>Focus Blast</b> orb in its hands and throws it! But it passes several inches away from Ashley… it missed! Or… did it?<br />
<br />
The sphere travels across the laboratory all the way to where Meow and Snub are standing! Both Pokemon jump away on time, but the Focus Blast hits Fennekin’s pod, shattering the glass and releasing the unconscious Pokemon within, which tumbles to the floor… Just then, Red Skull reaches for her whip and uses it to wrap the small fox, then pull it toward her!<br />
<br />
- This one’s coming with me. Pinsir, return!<br />
<br />
The woman recalls her exhausted partner and runs towards the elevator, just as power seems to come back on! Someone had this entire operation perfectly coordinated! Red Skull passes through the elevator door and blows you a kiss…<br />
<br />
- This little creature here, the one you were looking for, we’ll take great care of it where I’m going… but no, we’re not re-rooting energy back to any of those pods. So go ahead, break as many of them as you want, the Pokemon inside are as good as dead by now. They all drowned. Bye lovely! Tell your guard friend I send him a handshake, will you?<br />
<br />
She vanishes as the door closes. Where did she go now?! And where does it all leave you? You’re faced with a choice… do you rush after her, if you can guess where she went? Will you stay on the lab longer, even after Red Skull’s horrifying revelation? Will you head back to the prison floor?<br />
<br />
So, Liza… where to?</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Pud’n</u>:</b> You refuse to let go. The <i>Mysteries of the Earth</i> is a far too important book for you to just abandon your pursuit like that, despite Silvia’s reluctance.<br />
<br />
- You’re not gonna let this go, are you? I can’t stop you, but…<br />
<br />
She pauses for a moment, pondering on your offer. There’s no denying it makes sense, but something seems to be weighing on the girl’s mind.<br />
<br />
- I can’t come with you. Not yet, at least. There’s something I have to do first, so… well, I already told you the way, so go ahead and I’ll meet up with you later okay?<br />
<br />
Without really waiting for an answer, she turns around and prepares to leave. She stops briefly, remembering something, and talks without facing you again.<br />
<br />
- Oh, as for the man from yesterday… I couldn’t get a good look at him, he was wearing a gray hoodie. He clearly didn’t want to be recognized, and I didn’t press the subject either. I… told him the exact same thing I told you. As far as I know, he might already be at the Central Library. If it means that much to you, you should hurry up; that guy was as insistent as you were.<br />
<br />
She then walks away, visibly conflicted, but there’s no persuading her to stay just as there’s no persuading you not to go.<br />
<br />
Remembering Silvia’s instructions, you leave the Port behind and head for the Historical District. The place feels decidedly different from the rest of cosmopolitan Salin – there are old buildings all around, indicating this is likely the most ancient part of the city, and very few youngsters roaming the streets…<br />
<br />
Finding the Cascadia Central Library proves easy enough – it’s quite simply the largest construction in the entire district, and probably one of the biggest in all the city! The building rises several stories high, imposing, carved in elaborately sculpted stone as was typical of most architectural works of art dating back several centuries. Well, only one way to go, and that’s inside!<br />
<br />
You approach the pair of heavy front doors and push them open. It’s decidedly darker inside; it feels more like a cathedral than any library you’ve ever been in, come to think of it… Impossibly tall bookcases form long corridors to your left and right, and all the way at the end of the main hall is a desk, someone sitting behind it and, even from a distance, you know that person is staring straight at you…<br />
<br />
You haven’t even taken two steps and already an elderly male voice echoes across the hall inquisitively.<br />
<br />
- How may I help you?!<br />
<br />
The librarian’s voice becomes high-pitched at the end of the question, the inquiry repeating itself several times over thanks to the unsettling echo of the massive library…<br />
<br />
Will you ask the bookkeeper at the end of the hall for help in finding <i>Mysteries of the Earth</i>, or will you start looking around on your own?</span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u><u>Myahoo</u>:</u></b> Even the best-laid plans can be compromised by a single stray element, and in this case, it’s Layla. The usually-clingy Cubone has surprised you by willingly leaving your side at such a critical juncture, but you decide you can’t abandon your current task – in essence, you can’t abandon the promise you made to Cam. In your stead, you send Prince to fetch Layla, hoping the Houndour returns soon from the rescue mission.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, you focus on the issue at hand: befriending the rabbits so you can convince them to flee. Bunnelby are surprisingly good swimmers (“Surfers” even, some would say) so perhaps they can be persuaded to take to the sea once you earn their trust… but in order to do that, you’ll have to put your Styler to use one more time! Making use of the knowledge you earned when befriending Pidgey under Cam’s guidance, you deploy the Disc and begin circling the bunnies using the touch screen… not too close and not too far, not too fast so as not to scare them but not too slow that they’ll lose interest and flee. It’s intricate but oddly not too far from your comfort zone any longer, and the proof of that is how the Disc begins to lay down a perfectly circular line around the group of wild Pokemon, who stare at the sparkling trail with curiosity.<br />
<br />
Thunder roars above, and a spear of lighting comes crashing down. The pillar of electricity is immediately diverted to Storm’s horn, fading as it connects, and you’re thankful the unruly Blitzle is sticking to the plan or else you’d be in seriously bad shape by now. You stick to the task at hand, and with determination guide the Disc to close the circle. When the device meets the start of the ion trail, the first ring is formed successfully, but you can still see some distrust in the Bunnelby’s faces – another circle is needed to befriend them!<br />
<br />
As you keep going, you hear barking in the distance, a familiar sound you recognize as Prince making his way back to you. But something is off, he sounds concerned… Hopefully you can worry about it once he returns. You go for the second ring, thankful neither Bunnelby attempts to flee as Pidgey did earlier – likely discouraged by Wildfire’s proximity – and the new circle comes out just as well as the first! Once it closes, the Normal-Types lose all trace of apprehension and quickly hop over to you, clinging to your legs in a sudden display of affection.<br />
<br />
The barking intensifies as Prince finally returns… without Layla. He growls and barks in visible preoccupation, just as the storm intensifies further; lightning comes crashing down at shorter intervals, your Blitzle barely fast enough to catch all of them, and thunder becomes louder. There’s a lot of ground still to cover, and the quick worsening of atmospheric conditions can’t be a good sign. At the same time, Layla is nowhere to be found, or at least Prince couldn’t persuade her to come back…<br />
<br />
Your Cubone’s typing is likely to keep her safe from the electrical disasters ahead, so you don’t have to worry too much on that front; her disappearance, however, is uncharacteristic… Should you stop gathering wild Pokemon and seek her out, or do you stick to the promise you made to Cam and look for Layla later?</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</u></b> <i>((3 of 6 Pokemon declared: Meowth, Weedle, Nidoqueen))</i><br />
<br />
Electrode are exceedingly dangerous Pokemon. Not that they’re particularly powerful; what they are is unpredictable, unstable and volatile. They live mostly on instinct, moving from power source to power source in search of electrons for nourishment, draining generators with complete disregard for consequences. And the smallest of disturbances can trigger massive explosions, making them as hazardous as Pokemon go.<br />
<br />
Aware of the dangers the two Electric-Types pose, you and Hermione are quick to agree on the most effective means of protection, now that both creatures are starting to glow ominously: Rowena can effectively neutralize electrical discharges thanks to her typing, and her ability to raise Reflect walls can provide cover in case your worst fears come to fruition.<br />
<br />
The large Poison-Type materializes between you and the Electrode duo, quickly realizing the severity of the situation. Despite her bulk and favourable typing, she knows the enemy holds one distinct advantage over her – Electrode, with their ability to store huge amounts of pure electrical energy inside them, are among the fastest of all Pokemon; at top speed, they are practically electric currents themselves. Rowena tries her hardest to raise a Reflect shield, struggling with the intricacy of the move and the bothersome Psychic energy it requires to build – a resource she isn’t too keen at manipulating. If either Electrode was to explode now, it would no doubt do it faster than she could protect her Trainer and friends…<br />
<br />
But none of the Electric-Types blow up. In fact, they seem to do nothing at all, letting their yellow glows fade in apparently inconsequential fashion. Rowena finishes weaving her translucent veil, thankful your concern didn’t match the foes’ intentions. Meanwhile, you start to wonder what exactly is going on… only one option seems feasible: the Electrode have just finished draining the electricity from the nearby room. Bustling with newfound power, could it be they were using <b>Charge</b> to channel the electrons they absorbed? That would explain why they neither exploded nor unleashed lightning.<br />
<br />
What does come as a shock, pun intended, is the sudden high-pitched noise they suddenly emit – not nearly as bad as the ear-wrecking audio devastation from the speaker in the previous room, but painful nevertheless, especially for your Pokemon companions. Both Electrode begin to flee down the corridor as they continue to <b>Screech</b>, and just when they’re about to reach the final stretch of the hall and take the left turn at the very end, one of them stays behind… and <i>then</i> explodes!<br />
<br />
The blast is intense; though too far away from your location to cause you any harm, the shockwave unleashed by the exploding orb causes the walls and ceiling to collapse, obstructing the hallway with debris and effectively preventing you from chasing after the remaining Electrode! It’s uncommon for instinctual Pokemon such as this to be so deliberate, but there’s virtually no way to deny that the Electric-Type actively prevented you from giving chase. Wherever the other one is going, it doesn’t want you tailing it!<br />
<br />
It seems you’re on the right track, considering all the obstacles you keep running into – first the malfunctioning speaker, and now the exploding Electrode. Turning back doesn’t seem to make much sense, now that you’re seemingly making progress down the maze that is this Power Plant, but what can you do? There’s the corridor to your left, from whence the Electrode appeared, that you can always try and explore even if there’s a risk of finding nothing useful at all; or you can try to muscle your way past the blockade created by the rubble obstructing the main hallway, but that will no doubt cost time and energy…<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Raves</u>:</b> Disturbing such a massive creature feels wrong on several levels, chief among them your desire for prolonged survival. Even among those of its kind, this Beartic is especially large, and who knows where it even got that King’s Rock, or those strange flames to light up the room? Nothing about this feels like a good omen.<br />
<br />
Still, curiosity is part of the human nature. You hand Nothung an unlit torch, asking the ape to try and set it ablaze on one of the chandeliers. Your partner gives you a look, as if inquiring why the hell he couldn’t simply use his <i>own</i> fire to light up the damn thing – he has literal flames for hair, for Arceus’s sake. Still, he knows better than to question your ideas, having been together so long, and promptly obeys without complaining (out loud, at least). The Infernape approaches one of the ice chandeliers hanging from the cave’s ceiling, leaps and swipes the torch above one of the purple blazes. Immediately the stick catches fire, producing a beautiful violet flame…<br />
<br />
Suddenly, all the chandeliers’ flames light up, burning intensely as if something triggered after Nothung’s meddling. The blazes danced vividly, filling the clearing with a very bright, eerie purple light; the fires then began to <i>float</i> and spin around in a circle in mid-air, six violet fireballs in total, and from the nothingness of the chilly air an equal number of ghostly creatures materialized, each grabbing a flame – six

moaning loudly, their wailing echoing around the cave.<br />
<br />
The blood-curdling spectacle of light and sound is more than enough to awaken the slumbering beast, as the Beartic comes to its senses and unleashes a mighty roar! The Ice-Type rises to its feet, King’s Rock firmly perched atop its head, and the six Froslass bow, each still holding its respective <b>Will-o-Wisp</b>. As the titan stands up, you finally catch a good glimpse of what it was guarding while it slept – a large cradle sculpted out of ice… an empty cradle, no infant inside.<br />
<br />
Quick to follow your command, Nothung fights back his own fear and musters a poorly-convincing Yawn, the Infernape himself far from sleepy and, as such, unable to play the part properly. Recognizing the gesture as an attack towards their king, the six Froslass turn to Nothung, each materializing pointy <b>Ice Shards</b> dangerously close to the Fire-Type’s neck! One simple motion from the ghostly court and Nothung can find himself impaled on the icy lances… Beartic, meanwhile, has rage-filled eyes locked firmly on <i>you</i>, not Nothung, and although he isn’t oblivious to the Infernape’s weak attempt at putting him back to sleep, it’ll be a while before he’s afflicted by any sort of drowsiness… you can’t help but notice there’s way too much anger towards you in the beast’s eyes for a Pokemon you literally <i>just</i> met.<br />
<br />
The situation’s turned very complicated all of a sudden… What will you do?</span></span><br />

<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</u></b> <i>((3 of 6 Pokemon declared: Meowth, Weedle, Nidoqueen))</i><br />
<br />
Electrode are exceedingly dangerous Pokemon. Not that they’re particularly powerful; what they are is unpredictable, unstable and volatile. They live mostly on instinct, moving from power source to power source in search of electrons for nourishment, draining generators with complete disregard for consequences. And the smallest of disturbances can trigger massive explosions, making them as hazardous as Pokemon go.<br />
<br />
Aware of the dangers the two Electric-Types pose, you and Hermione are quick to agree on the most effective means of protection, now that both creatures are starting to glow ominously: Rowena can effectively neutralize electrical discharges thanks to her typing, and her ability to raise Reflect walls can provide cover in case your worst fears come to fruition.<br />
<br />
The large Poison-Type materializes between you and the Electrode duo, quickly realizing the severity of the situation. Despite her bulk and favourable typing, she knows the enemy holds one distinct advantage over her – Electrode, with their ability to store huge amounts of pure electrical energy inside them, are among the fastest of all Pokemon; at top speed, they are practically electric currents themselves. Rowena tries her hardest to raise a Reflect shield, struggling with the intricacy of the move and the bothersome Psychic energy it requires to build – a resource she isn’t too keen at manipulating. If either Electrode was to explode now, it would no doubt do it faster than she could protect her Trainer and friends…<br />
<br />
But none of the Electric-Types blow up. In fact, they seem to do nothing at all, letting their yellow glows fade in apparently inconsequential fashion. Rowena finishes weaving her translucent veil, thankful your concern didn’t match the foes’ intentions. Meanwhile, you start to wonder what exactly is going on… only one option seems feasible: the Electrode have just finished draining the electricity from the nearby room. Bustling with newfound power, could it be they were using <b>Charge</b> to channel the electrons they absorbed? That would explain why they neither exploded nor unleashed lightning.<br />
<br />
What does come as a shock, pun intended, is the sudden high-pitched noise they suddenly emit – not nearly as bad as the ear-wrecking audio devastation from the speaker in the previous room, but painful nevertheless, especially for your Pokemon companions. Both Electrode begin to flee down the corridor as they continue to <b>Screech</b>, and just when they’re about to reach the final stretch of the hall and take the left turn at the very end, one of them stays behind… and <i>then</i> explodes!<br />
<br />
The blast is intense; though too far away from your location to cause you any harm, the shockwave unleashed by the exploding orb causes the walls and ceiling to collapse, obstructing the hallway with debris and effectively preventing you from chasing after the remaining Electrode! It’s uncommon for instinctual Pokemon such as this to be so deliberate, but there’s virtually no way to deny that the Electric-Type actively prevented you from giving chase. Wherever the other one is going, it doesn’t want you tailing it!<br />
<br />
It seems you’re on the right track, considering all the obstacles you keep running into – first the malfunctioning speaker, and now the exploding Electrode. Turning back doesn’t seem to make much sense, now that you’re seemingly making progress down the maze that is this Power Plant, but what can you do? There’s the corridor to your left, from whence the Electrode appeared, that you can always try and explore even if there’s a risk of finding nothing useful at all; or you can try to muscle your way past the blockade created by the rubble obstructing the main hallway, but that will no doubt cost time and energy…<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: yellow"><span style="font-size: 12px">Perilous as the situation undoubtedly was, Keith couldn't help but grin as his Nidoqueen started working on a Reflect. Skilled as she was, Rowena wasn't the biggest fan of battling. Her various attacks, she saw them as a means to protect her friends and allies more than anything else. And that's exactly what she was doing here. Keith felt safer already, and the Reflect wasn't even up yet. And then, as the glow reached its brightest...<br />
<br />
...it stopped. Faded away. &quot;Wat da...&quot; Meowth murmured.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think they were using Charge,&quot; Keith stated. &quot;I've seen Nitro use that move before, I'm pretty sure that's how it looked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Charge?&quot; Meowth murmured. &quot;Dat don't sound like sometin' a wild Electrode would tink ta do first. Ain't dey all about actin' on impulse?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe they're not acting on impulse for some reason,&quot; Keith speculated. &quot;Maybe- AAAAGH!&quot; he cried out- now the Electrode were unleashing their Screech attacks in unison, and fleeing down the corridor. Well, one of them, anyway- the other Electrode remained behind... and exploded.<br />
<br />
Between Rowena's Reflect and the considerable distance between them, the blast wasn't able to harm any of them, the walls and ceiling were a whole other swarm of Yanma. The corridor collapsed as a result of the blast- not the part Keith and his Pokémon were in, thank Arceus, but they were nevertheless hindered from pursuing the Electrode.<br />
<br />
&quot;...WAT WAS DAT?!&quot; Meowth demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weedle! Weedle Weedle Weedle!&quot; Hermione declared.<br />
<br />
&quot;If Hermione's saying that they're probably doing this on purpose to stop us from following them, I'm inclined to agree,&quot; nodded Keith. &quot;We gotta be on the right track- that speaker back there, and now this? We're getting close.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We ain't gettin' much closer, though,&quot; Meowth objected, indicating the blocked corridor. &quot;Dat Electrode don't wanna be followed, I can see dat much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we gotta go that way anyway,&quot; Keith stated, stepping forward towards the blockage. &quot;That Electrode doesn't want to be followed, which means there's a reason for that, and if that reason has anything to do with what's going on with this place, we gotta figure it out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how do youse propose we do dat?&quot; Meowth demanded. &quot;Last I checked, youse wasn't enough of a Gastly ta pass trough solid objects.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, but you forget who we got with us,&quot; Keith grinned, indicating the Nidoqueen now standing beside him. &quot;Rowena, think you can help us clear a path through all this stuff?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;NIIIDOOOOH!&quot; Rowena growled, nodding in agreement.<br />
<br />
Keith grinned- Rowena wasn't the biggest fan of using brute strength, but she was still pretty darn good at it when the situation called for it, and as far as Keith was concerned, the situation right now most certainly called for it. &quot;Then let's do this,&quot; he stated. &quot;Rowena, use <b>Strength</b> to muscle past this wreckage. In fact, if you need to, try using <b>Dig</b> as well.&quot; He then turned to the Weedle on his shoulder. &quot;Hermione, Electrode will have gotten one hell of a head start on us. So get a good whiff of the unconscious Electrode- with any luck, we may be able to track its friend by scent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Weedle,&quot; nodded Hermione.</span></span><br />
