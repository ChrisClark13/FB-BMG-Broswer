One of the more interesting areas of the archipelago, Ruin Island is also the most mysterious. Giant stone statues and buildings, eroded by time, stand in the overgrowing vegetation of the area, providing a home to many Pokemon, especially those who prefer dark, enclosed spaces. Studies done by researches show that this island was once under water, or flooded, or something. At the very least, they have established that it is the oldest of the areas. An eerie feel of foreboding rushes over one the second they set forth on the land, provoking myths and legends...<br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Ruins had fascinated Jeri from a young age. Living amidst the home of legends, his childhood was filled with exploration of abandoned caverns, ruined towers, sunken ships and ghost towns. On his first ever Gym Challenge in the Hoenn Circuit, he spent two weeks training and living from the Abandoned Ship beyond Dewford. When he toured other regions, he always made it a point to explore the diverse remnants scattered about the landscape. During his time in the Indigo League, he even made the treacherous hike up to the Sinojoh Ruins, exploring its ancient and mysterious chambers.<br />
<br />
When he heard that the archipelago of Cascadia held the ruins of an ancient people, he passed up the shining beaches and tropical locales that most trainers flocked to, heading straight for the eponymous island. Traversing the overgrown paths, flanked by eroded statues and crumbling pillars, Jeri felt in his element. It had been quite a while since he had the opportunity to explore any mysterious structures, and he could feel the rush of excitement return as he pressed deeper into the depths of the jungle. As he grew closer, the deteriorated structures grew more numerous, eventually leading to a broken stone archway, tangled with vines and ivies, marking the entrance to the imposing <b>Amor Temple</b>.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah...&quot; Jeri gasped as he got a sight of the still-impressive structure.<br />
<br />
Despite its fallen walls and new verdant covering, Jeri thought it was one of the most remarkable buildings he had ever seen. Wasting little time, he walked right up to the temple and proceeded into its depths, ignorant to the danger that lurked inside...</span></span></div>

<b>The SS Leviathan Shipwreck</b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>CyberBlastoise</u>:</b> Weighing your options, you decide to take the middle ground here. Turning back would be giving up without a try, and sneaking past the Coastal Guard would be a crime, so… it stands to reason that swimming up to them and politely request their permission to transgress is the right thing to do. Swift rolls his eyes and swims after the more eager Billy and Savage.<br />
<br />
As you approach the two men, they spot you as well, and turn their speedboats’ engines on. They aren’t looking very friendly, but it’s unlikely they’ll arrest you on the spot. You hope.<br />
<br />
-	Excuse me! Sir!<br />
<br />
That’s a good way to address the authorities; at least, you’ve heard a lot worse. Granted, those other introductions came right after the person in question got busted committing a felony, and usually preceded a desperate attempt at fleeing the scene, so they’re not much of a comparison. Still, this one felt polite enough for someone who was about to ask to visit a restricted area.<br />
<br />
The officers turn their boats around and speed forward to meet you, stopping only a few feet away.<br />
<br />
-	This area is off-limits. We’ll have to ask you turn back; the SS Leviathan is in no condition to be open to tourists, so please leave.<br />
<br />
You begin pleading your case to them, explaining how you came a long way specifically to visit the shipwreck, but they’re having none of it; well, they’d be pretty terrible at their job if they let you through just like that, you figure. Still, you’re starting to feel kind of bummed.<br />
<br />
Just as you’re about to give up, a bird’s cry is heard in the distance. Looking up, squinting, you spot what seems to be a Wingull flying away from the mast. Then another cry follows, and another, and… another? All of a sudden, the air is filled with the sound of dozens of seagulls chirping, rather violently one might add. And before long, the respective number of Wingull fill the sky, in a rather impressive sight… until several of them start making their way toward you!<br />
<br />
At least five Wingull swoop down and begin pecking away at the two Coastal Guards, yourself and your two Pokemon, relentlessly giving chase as you try to ward them off, taken by surprise. The officers exchange a brief look of “screw this!” and rev up their engines, driving away on their speedboats before they’re assaulted to death. You have no such means of escape however, and are left at the mercy of the … well, angry birds. If you don’t do something quick, it’s likely that the three of you will sustain serious injuries; even if the Wingull aren’t particularly strong, they outnumber you and have a clear advantage in mobility, striking repeatedly from above as you struggle just to stay afloat.<br />
<br />
What do you do?!</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">OoC: I'm running under the assumption that my Lumineon can swim underwater, just not in the very deep portions.<br />
<span style="color: teal">Bill swam up to the two guards and explained his situation. He had intended to explore this ship and he came here just for that purpose. Unfortunately for him, the guards did their job and would not make an exception for the trainer, as he figured. Too bad, treasure and whatnot were calling his name, but sadly enough he couldn't go into the ship barring a miracle or something. Bill turned around to head to some different part of the ocean, he rented the equipment already better use it for something. Some Wingulls in the background were chirping, nothing unusual until he heard some screams. It was the two guards, at first Bill thought now was a good time to get by them, but then he realized what was going on, some Pokemon were attacking some guards and while that was an opportune moment, they were still people. However, many more Wingull were following behind. Soon, the two had enough and sped away on their boats, leaving behind Bill and his Pokemon to whatever fate and these birds had in store for them.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT THE HECK!?&quot; a livid Bill yelled at the two guards speeding away. &quot;YOU GUYS ARE HORRIBLE AT YOUR JOB!&quot; Right now was not the time as the massive plumage army...or would it navy? Air Force? Either way, this very large group of Wingull are trying to attack Bill and his two Pokemon. If it were one or two or heck even three or five, he could probably take them, but this is a much larger group and they could easily get themselves killed if they weren't careful. Unfortunately Bill couldn't outswim the Wingull's flight capabilities and he'd slow down his two Pokemon too much even if they combined their strengths. So swimming up top wasn't an option. These Wingull were also water types like both of his Pokemon traveling with him, but there was one option, going underwater and hope that the Wingulls won't follow. <br />
<br />
The more time he would spend debating meant more injuries. Reading his scuba gear, he commanded, &quot;Savage, Swift we gonna go underwater.&quot; He looked around for a landmark to go to, but sadly his mind was in a panic from the flocking threat, and the only piece of land he could see among the flying mess was the ship. As much as it'd be illegal and stupid as that ship was exactly where the Wingull originated, it was the only safe haven nearby. &quot;Just meet me at the ship. We'll have to sort it out later.&quot; Savage quickly dived underwater following his trainer's orders, Swift gave a look of disapproval at first but also obeyed the orders. Bill put his mask over his face and prayed to Arceus that he would be safe as he proceeded underwater, swimming as quickly as he could toward the ship.</span></span></div>

<br />
He removes his sunglasses again and points at the counter some feet away from where you're standing, where several people are gathered and a good number is walking away with a disappointed look in their faces.<br />
<br />
- Head over there and apply for registration. Heard they have some demanding criteria though... you can't just have anyone taking the Gym Leaders' precious time. They only accept some Trainers... why don't you go try your luck?<br />
<br />
Saying goodbye to Clyde, you hurry over to the counter. After waiting a good fifteen minutes in line, your turn arrives; the person before you had apparently been rejected as well...<br />
<br />
-Hello sir. Here for the Gym Challenge, yes? You need to meet some requirements, I'm afraid. First, we require an official Pokedex. Please place it on the counter. Next, you need to own at least two official Beginner Battle Trophies and one Advanced Battle Trophy. If you have these, please place them next to your Pokedex. Lastly, you will need to register a team of six Pokemon to enter the competition with - all of which at Level 50 or above. If you meet these requirements, please register them in the computer to your left.<br />
<br />
The lady then hands you a pen and paper.<br />
<br />
- And when you're done, please fill in this form.<br />
<br />
You glance at the paper; it consists of three simple questions, amidst all the bureaucratic text and emblems:<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;1) What are your favourite and least favourite Pokemon Type?<br />
2) What are your preferred and least preferred terrain for battle?<br />
3) What are your preferred and least preferred battle styles - Single, Double or Triple Battle?&quot;</i><br />
<br />
The selection criteria are indeed very strict... If you still meet all the requirements, show them to the woman at the counter and fill out the form to proceed!</span></span>

“Well, new blood wants to test his mettle against the veterans, heh? Well, it's been a while since I've done this, but... Hello! I'm Clyde. I used to be the guide for Trainers challenging the Pokémon Gym. Take this to commemorate the occasion!”<br />
<br />
“Nice to meet you I’m Wes-“ The adolescent stammered as the two broke eye contact, the old timer trailing off to a nearby vending machine. Wes strained to make out the jingle of coins above the busy atmosphere, followed by a <i>kerchunk</i> as a bottle of <b>Fresh Water</b> dropped into the dispenser. Wes sheepishly accepted the drink, cool against the tips of his fingers, the condensation on the bottle’s surface reminding the trainer just how thirsty he was – but it’d be a whole lot more useful on the battlefield. <br />
<br />
“Used to have more of these at hand, you know. I'm retired now, so... oh well. If you lose, you owe me 20 coins for the bottle”, Wes gave a nervous laugh. He wasn’t going to lose, not today. The trainer gripped the bottle of water before slipping it into his satchel for safe keeping, shifting his focus back to Clyde who’d lowered his shades and was facing ahead. The trainer followed his gaze, finding a crowd of trainers with several breaking away with a look of sheer disappointment on their faces. Wes gave a start – what if the tournament had been cancelled? Wes could just picture some unruly Tyranitar levelling the first dozen rows of the stadium in a battle-fuelled rampage. Before the adolescent could get carried away in his thoughts the old timer spoke up. <br />
<br />
“Head over there and apply for registration. Heard they have some demanding criteria though... you can't just have anyone taking the Gym Leaders' precious time. They only accept some Trainers... why don't you go try your luck?” Nerves barely settled, the kid pressed on. He’d won his fair share of battles in the past and was practically undefeated, but wasn’t quite sure if he’d qualify as <i>experienced</i>. He flashed a wave to Clyde, not really sure what to say as he joined the long queue of eager trainers. Time rolled by and minutes felt like hours as he worked his way down the line, ears straining to hear any conversation as he still wasn’t sure what he was signing up for. The building anticipation finally reached a climax as the kid made it to the front of the queue, eyes flickering with unease as the person in front dragged his feet in disappointment. <br />
<br />
“Hello sir. Here for the Gym Challenge, yes?” The receptionist raised an eyebrow, Wes quickly nodding, “You need to meet some requirements, I'm afraid. First, we require an official Pokedex. Please place it on the counter. Next, you need to own at least two official Beginner Battle Trophies and one Advanced Battle Trophy. If you have these, please place them next to your Pokedex. Lastly, you will need to register a team of six Pokemon to enter the competition with - all of which at Level 50 or above. If you meet these requirements, please register them in the computer to your left.” The kid paused as the information entered his brain at snail’s pace, a pen gripped tightly in his hand by the time it all sank in. The requirements were harsh, that was for sure, but nothing that Wes couldn’t handle. What really did the trainer over was the team requirement. Whittling down his squad to his six most powerful wasn’t something he was counting on, and with a queue of dozens at his rear he didn’t exactly have time to think it over. Face crumpled in deep concentration the trainer couldn’t shake off the feeling he should’ve thought this through. Pen inches from the paper, the trainer suddenly remembered he needed his Pokédex – a perfect chance to stall. He gripped the pen and shuffled around his jeans, drawing a scuffed Pokédex from his back pocket.

<br />
“And my battle trophies?” Wes laughed nervously, scratching his head as his eyes darted toward the brown satchel, “they ought to be in here somewhere...” Feeling his way through the bag the kid was able to feel his way through Heart Scales, stale Poffins and one Poison Barb that he pricked against his thumb... Biting his lip as his face turned pale the kid delved further, realisation that he hadn’t battled in a long time leaving a worse taste in his mouth than that Poison Barb. With his nails scratching against the bottom of the satchel Wes suddenly felt cold metal against the tips of his fingers. A few clunks later he prized four trophies from the bag and lined them up with a stark sense of pride. Then a wave of realisation hit him – if he wanted the best chances of winning he’d need his most experienced Pokémon. Wes grinned as he eyed up the golden plaques each telling a story of a hard fought skirmish.

Wes then laid a Leaf Ball, Chocolate Ball, Quick Ball, Pumpkin Ball, Rock Ball and Shadow Ball on the table – each containing a powerful ally with battle experience.

<span style="color: deepskyblue"><span style="font-size: 12px"><b>Pearl Lake</b></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>SugarPesticide</u>:</b> The scenery feels inviting, peaceful, idyllic. Casting all worries aside, you decide to sit down and do something different for a change – sketch the view. After all, how often do you get to kick back and relax?<br />
<br />
-	I say young woman, that is quite the portrait!<br />
<br />
Not often, clearly. Startled, you turn around and see… nobody. It isn’t until you remember to look <i>up</i> that you spot him, perched on top of the rock you’re leaning against. He nimbly leaps down and lands in front of you, and you quickly realize the unlikelihood of what you witnessed – in front of you is a man probably well in his eighties.<br />
<br />
-	Terribly sorry to sneak up on you like this, my dear… but you see, I might have just found the solution to my conundrum, if you’d be so kind!<br />
<br />
Still half-scared, half-awestruck, you look closer at the old man. He sports a neatly trimmed gray beard and wears a light-brown suit with matching suede leather shoes and a dark brown tie over a clean white shirt. On top of his head sits a black beret, and small round glasses rest on top of his nose. His posture is impeccable, particularly for a man of his age, but even so he holds a mahogany walking cane, its handle being the sculptured face of a Swanna.<br />
<br />
-	Now now, where are my manners? I’ve neglected to introduce myself. I am Jan Vogh, and you could call me an artist… years ago.<br />
<br />
You notice the sudden change of tone, as the man seems overwhelmed by sadness.<br />
<br />
-	I am sorry to intrude on your moment of rest my dear, I truly am. But it’s an exceedingly rare thing to come across someone so young who still nurtures an interest in carefree art! I am in dire need of assistance, and only someone who loves both Pokemon and art would be suitable to help me… because I have nothing to offer in return.<br />
<br />
You instinctively throw him an inquisitive look; hoe can a man who dresses so elegantly and presents himself with such decorum have <i>nothing</i> to offer in return for help? Vogh catches your glance and sighs before proceeding.<br />
<br />
-	I’ve made a living off of my paintings since I was a young lad. Around these parts, and throughout Cascadia, I was a renowned artist. Why, the entire land of Fizzy Bubbles was at least familiar with my name! Now, I’m afraid, no more… People your age, yourself included no doubt, have no idea who Jan Vogh is.<br />
<br />
He stops for a minute, then adjusts his glasses, as if reconsidering his approach.<br />
<br />
-	Still, like I said, I apologize for interrupting your moment of tranquility. As I understand, you’re probably on a journey with your Pokemon, yes? Most youngsters do so, as I myself did one day, and I know how important it must be for you. So, if you would rather go on your way, I won’t resent it. And as an apology for taking your time, I can most certainly tell you some places of interest nearby that may be worth looking into, if you’re so inclined…<br />
<br />
Vogh seems honest about his offer; it appears he’s been looking for help for so long, he’s used to being turned down by now. On one hand, you could offer to help the wandering artist with his problems, whatever they may be, aware that you’ll likely receive no reward from the broke painter. On the other hand, as a former traveler himself, seems to have valuable information about the Lake and its surroundings, if you’d prefer to seek adventure and potential rewards elsewhere.<br />
<br />
What do you do?</span></span>

<br />
<span style="color: deepskyblue">Smiling uncertainly at Vogh's sudden appearance, Pest's eyes darted briefly to her sketching as he spoke. Certainly it was better than the scribbling she usually produced, but it still seemed pretty basic to her. Primitive, even. That said, she understood that art held just as many schools of thought as writing, and she supposed this kind of work was up the man's alley. The knowledge certainly didn't stop her skin from crawling a bit as he called her &quot;my dear,&quot; despite his pleasant demeanor. Hard-learned memories of stranger danger still burned in her brain even after years of teaching, and it was difficult for the introverted girl to overcome her automatic desire to shun his presence.<br />
<br />
Still, once her reasonable side took a firm hold, she supposed there was no reason to decline. Clearly this man had reasons for being all the way out here, apparently making them the only two human beings around for miles. And what was she planning on doing for this vacation, anyway? There was no reason not to help somebody out, and it wasn't as if she would be missing out on anything important otherwise. Besides, it was always possible to find a neat pebble or something on the way. Keepsakes were always fun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I'd be glad to help you out, Mr. Vogh,&quot; she said after a moment's thought. &quot;Although as you can imagine, I think I'll need a better idea of what your plan is before I can do so. You know how it is. As long as it's not illegal or life-threatening, though, I don't see why not join you. Heck, even if you don't have anything to offer, the experience should be enough of a payment, right?&quot;</span></span></div>

I would like to welcome Jerichi into the group! Hopefully we'll have some good times together. *hides meat cleaver behind her back*<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px">uhhhhh, Missingno. Master &amp; Marion Ette: <i>With everyone aware of their part in this, Keith happily dives into the trash, followed by Marion, holding her breath. Connor got comfortable on his Girafarig while waiting for his friends to get to the other side…<br />
<br />
The heap of trash is not a pleasant path to take. Trying to follow Trubbish the best you can, you can feel everything from rotten food to wrapping papers and used electronics covering you both from head to toe. How long has this pile been here? Trying to think of spa trips and holiday resorts, you crawl your way through a particularly nasty batch of used cat litter (what Meowth or Skitty produces poop this big?!) and what seems to be used diapers. Keith makes it to the other side first, head popping out of the trash to take a breath of…well, not exactly fresh air, but air nonetheless. Trubbish looks at Keith emotionlessly but starts clapping enthusiastically at the sight of Marion. Both trainers somehow dig their way out, standing up to shake off the worst of it. Turning a pocket inside out, Marion discovers an apple core – maybe this could be used as <b>a Leftover</b> in battle? Well, at least that’s something positive out of this-<br />
<br />
Running a hand through her hair, Marion freezes suddenly. While Keith looks on in confusion, something purple starts moving in Marion’s hair. In a few moments, a grinning pile of goo emerges, hanging in front of Marion’s face. “Gri?” Trubbish doesn’t seem bothered, happily waving at what seems to be a friend of hers. The happy Grimer burps loudly, earning a laugh from Trubbish. With a quick look through a Pokédex, Keith announces the Grimer is male – and it doesn’t seem to have plans for moving out of Marion’s hair anytime soon…at least not voluntarily.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, bored of this display already, Myrtle dives back into the cave where Hebenon is waiting on coordinates to Teleport to. Upon receiving the instructions, Hebenon leaps on the Girafarig, causing the entire group and the luggage to disappear into thin air. Outside, Marion and Keith turn to look as Connor and his group appear on the dead grass…but where’s Hebenon?<br />
<br />
The question is shortly answered as Hebenon falls down from the sky, hitting Connor’s Girafarig square on the head. Absolutely not pleased with this, Biondello neighs and raises on his hind legs before darting for the woods with Connor screaming and trying to hang on for his dear life. Despite all efforts, the startled Girafarig seems to ignore all verbal reasoning while dashing through dead bushes deeper into the forest. Keith looks at Hebenon, who rolls his way over with an indifferent expression on his face – well he got the job done, right?!<br />

Sly, <b>Vine Whip</b> that chicken down!” Sly the Servine grinned wickedly as his vines reached out and quickly grabbed a hold of Wingy’s leg. Kenny seems to be encouraged by your words though, standing tall instead of quivering at the appearance of such a challenge. “Wingy, shake him off with <b>Gust</b> and then get close with <b>Quick Attack</b>!” The Pidgey doesn’t waste a second, immediately flapping his wings to create a powerful gust of wind, Sly visibly in pain from the super effective assault. As soon as the vines let up, Wingy dives in with high speed and proceeds to knock the Servine back to the bullies’ feet. Their leader stomps his foot in a very child-like manner, clearly not expecting a fight out of little Squeaky. “I’ve had it with you, you nerd! Sly, take that thing down already! <b>Leaf Tornado</b>!” Not fazed in the least by the bully’s command, Kenny seems to be at the top of his game: “Wingy, dodge it with another <b>Quick Attack</b>!”<br />
<br />
As you watch the leaves from Leaf Tornado utterly miss their mark, Wingy flying fast past the attack, your Pichu suddenly pulls on your cheek to get your attention. She points up to the sky right above Kenny – there’s a small shadow circling around you, a little bird you recognize as a Spearow. Now why would-<br />
<br />
Pichu points again, now at the bullies. One of the jerks in looking up at the Spearow and unable to contain his grin, clearly plotting something – are the Spearow and the bully in cahoots? Two on one wasn’t very fair…but it’d be best not to let Kenny know what’s up. A little stealth operation seems to be in order! You have a better look at the alleyway you’re stuck in: the buildings on either side of you are very tall, with no windows and only a couple of drainpipes running up to the roof. There’s also three trash cans behind the group of bullies.<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b>OkikuMew:</b> <i>Hershel happily obliges your wishes, wrapping himself up in a Defense Curl and rolling his way to the guard dogs. The duo notices the rolling object; staring at it for a minute…shaking with the sudden epiphany that they absolutely must catch this thing. It was their purpose of life- no, wait, they were supposed to be guarding the entrance. The puppies sit down and stare straight in front of them – or at least try to, as Hershel keeps rolling around them in the most attractive manner. One of the pups shivers, muscles tensing in preparation to pounce the ball he was being tempted with. His fellow guard dog growls a bit in warning, the little hypocrite looking even more ready to pounce after Hershel. The Spheal waggles back and forth, making a small noise, making the first pup’s eye twitch with all the overloading in his brain. You and Elena stare intensely, egging the puppies on in your minds.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the second pup cracks, woofing and happily sprinting after Hershel, who gleefully rolls away. The junior guard seems very annoyed by this hypocrisy only to forget it at the realization of there being A ROLLING BALL OH MY GOD IT MUST BE CAUGHT RIGHT THIS INSTANT.<br />
<br />
You and Elena watch as the Poochyenas run after Hershel, trying not to laugh at the cute display as you sneak into the entrance of the temple. Hiding behind a sharp corner, you wait for a while until Hershel comes rolling from behind the corner at a high speed. Jumping into your arms from mid-roll, Hershel looks up at you with a blissful expression that’s almost saying “I did real good, mommy!” You hear the guard Poochyenas arrive at the entrance, looking inside with utter confusion before strolling back to their posts; they’d get that ball next time…<br />
<br />
Sighing with relief, Elena turns to you and your brave Spheal. “Great job, guys! Mission Cute Roller seems to have been a success.” She gives you a double thumbs-up and winks like you’re undercover agents. “I guess the only way forward is further inside…better keep our eyes open. Never know what sort of traps might be in here.” As she says this, Elena starts walking ahead while looking back at you. Before you can even say “pooch”, you hear a small click noise right before Elena falls from your field of vision with a scream. You quickly run to the edge of a newly appeared hole in the floor – a deep hole containing quicksand. Despite your calls, there’s no reply from Elena or anything else from within the sand.<br />
<br />
The hole now horizontally covers the entire hallway you’re in, but you see a switch on the wall on the other side of the hole. Pressing it might get something to happen…but what about Elena?<br />
<br />
What will you do?</i><br />

<b>Jerichi:</b> <i>Happily making your way into the famous temple, you take in the atmosphere: with dusty walls and floors all around you and air that feels centuries old, you’re convinced you have arrived at the right place for you. Walking down the long, long hallway from the entrance, you at last arrive to what appears to be a crossroad. With doorways to all the directions imaginable, you look around for clues for a good way to go – when you see something weird. Looking above one of the doorways, you see what appear to be hieroglyphs. What’s strange though is the fact that the rather large markings seem to be spelling “OVER HERE”. No other such markings can be found anywhere else in this room, only over what seems to be the oldest doorway in the entire lobby you’ve found yourself in. Peering into the darkness of the hallway, your explorer’s instinct is urging you to go right in…but you decide to check the marking one more time. Looking at the big sign, you wonder if taking the hint would be a safe option. It’s not like there aren’t other doorways-<br />
<br />
Suddenly you hear a click and a rumbling noise. Turning around, you can barely see the door you came from get covered by a wall of stone as what seem to be small torches light up in bright flames inside the lobby. Well, that crosses out going back outside pretty effectively…<br />

I would like to welcome Jerichi into the group! Hopefully we'll have some good times together. *hides meat cleaver behind her back*<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px">uhhhhh, Missingno. Master &amp; Marion Ette: <i>With everyone aware of their part in this, Keith happily dives into the trash, followed by Marion, holding her breath. Connor got comfortable on his Girafarig while waiting for his friends to get to the other side…<br />
<br />
The heap of trash is not a pleasant path to take. Trying to follow Trubbish the best you can, you can feel everything from rotten food to wrapping papers and used electronics covering you both from head to toe. How long has this pile been here? Trying to think of spa trips and holiday resorts, you crawl your way through a particularly nasty batch of used cat litter (what Meowth or Skitty produces poop this big?!) and what seems to be used diapers. Keith makes it to the other side first, head popping out of the trash to take a breath of…well, not exactly fresh air, but air nonetheless. Trubbish looks at Keith emotionlessly but starts clapping enthusiastically at the sight of Marion. Both trainers somehow dig their way out, standing up to shake off the worst of it. Turning a pocket inside out, Marion discovers an apple core – maybe this could be used as <b>a Leftover</b> in battle? Well, at least that’s something positive out of this-<br />
<br />
Running a hand through her hair, Marion freezes suddenly. While Keith looks on in confusion, something purple starts moving in Marion’s hair. In a few moments, a grinning pile of goo emerges, hanging in front of Marion’s face. “Gri?” Trubbish doesn’t seem bothered, happily waving at what seems to be a friend of hers. The happy Grimer burps loudly, earning a laugh from Trubbish. With a quick look through a Pokédex, Keith announces the Grimer is male – and it doesn’t seem to have plans for moving out of Marion’s hair anytime soon…at least not voluntarily.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, bored of this display already, Myrtle dives back into the cave where Hebenon is waiting on coordinates to Teleport to. Upon receiving the instructions, Hebenon leaps on the Girafarig, causing the entire group and the luggage to disappear into thin air. Outside, Marion and Keith turn to look as Connor and his group appear on the dead grass…but where’s Hebenon?<br />
<br />
The question is shortly answered as Hebenon falls down from the sky, hitting Connor’s Girafarig square on the head. Absolutely not pleased with this, Biondello neighs and raises on his hind legs before darting for the woods with Connor screaming and trying to hang on for his dear life. Despite all efforts, the startled Girafarig seems to ignore all verbal reasoning while dashing through dead bushes deeper into the forest. Keith looks at Hebenon, who rolls his way over with an indifferent expression on his face – well he got the job done, right?!<br />
<br />
What will all of you do?</i></span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: darkorchid"><span style="font-size: 9px">Once everyone had agreed on the plan, Marion and Connor then took it upon themselves to inform Keith that if he kept trying so hard to gain the Trubbish's favor, he might very well end up pushing her away instead. Keith opened his mouth to argue, almost instinctively, but no words came out. He sighed instead, for the two of them were making far too much sense for him to ignore. &quot;Yeah, you're right,&quot; he admitted. &quot;I'll try to give her some space.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then, the plan was carried out. Keith and Marion proceeded to swim through the huge pool of trash, and though the smell didn't bother Keith, the nature of some of this stuff, on the other hand... Wrapping papers, used electronics, those weren't so bad... The rotten food wasn't so pleasant... And the used diapers and cat litter? Keith had to try very hard to not think about that stuff. Instead, he started to think about the possible alternatives they could've done... Lily could use Teleport as well, he could have brought both her and Hebenon out to Teleport the three of them.<br />
<br />
As this thought occurred to Keith, however, he found himself breathing in (relatively) fresh air once more. He saw Trubbish looking at him emotionlessly as he dug his way out of the garbage, and then he heard her clapping enthusiastically. He had a feeling he knew why- sure enough, as he turned around, Marion was climbing out of the pile of garbage. And then, Marion froze as she ran a hand through her hair. &quot;Marion? What's up?&quot; Keith asked. He got his answer, however, as something purple moved in her hair- a grinning Grimer showed itself, hanging in front of Marion's face. Keith pointed his Pokédex at the pile of sludge- he had seen Grimer during his last adventure on Venom Island, and even caught one of them, this was more out of habit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grimer, the Sludge Pokémon,&quot; droned the device. &quot;Grimer thrives by sucking up polluted sludge that is pumped out of factories. Its favorite food is anything filthy and disgusting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm,&quot; Keith remarked, looking at the Pokédex screen. &quot;Apparently this Grimer is male,&quot; he said. &quot;Hey, you OK, though, Marion?&quot; he added.<br />
<br />
Myrtle looked somewhat bored, though shot a look of concern at Marion- she was, after all, one of the few humans the Shuppet voluntarily showed respect to. Still, she had a role to play in all this, and so she re-entered the cave. She instructed Hebenon as to where to warp to, and the Qwilfish obligingly <b>Teleport</b>ed Connor, his Girafarig, the luggage... everything.<br />
<br />
Back outside, Keith looked as Connor and his group appeared out of nowhere. &quot;All right, we're all here,&quot; nodded Keith, satisfied. &quot;Good job, Hebenon- eh, Hebenon?&quot; he added, upon realizing he couldn't see his Qwilfish anywhere. Before he could start panicking, however, Hebenon's whereabouts became known extremely quickly- he himself seemed to have inadvertently Teleported himself into the sky, whereupon he then fell right down onto Biondello's head. Darn gravity.<br />
<br />
The Girafarig was, as could be expected, decidedly less than pleased with this blow to the head, and took off into the woods. Connor was still clinging to the Normal/Psychic-type (just what makes Girafarig more Normal than other Psychic-types, anyway?), but he didn't seem able to calm him down any. Hebenon rolled his way over to Keith, an indifferent expression on his face. In response, Keith picked up the Qwilfish in his hands (and after years and years of experience with this, he didn't even need to try to avoid the spikes anymore- it came naturally by now), brought him up to eye level, and spoke to him sternly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hebenon,&quot; he said. &quot;Listen to me. That wasn't nice, you hear me? Didn't even hear you try to apologize for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Qwil...&quot; mumbled Hebenon, now starting to look slightly ashamed of himself.<br />
<br />
Keith nodded. &quot;You can apologize to Biondello later. For now, you should take a rest in your Poké Ball.&quot; As he said this, he shifted Hebenon into one hand, and produced the Qwilfish's ball with another hand. He withdrew the Qwilfish into its Poké Ball, then looked off in the direction in which the Girafarig had fled. &quot;Alright, lemme think... he murmured to himself. &quot;Ah! Got it!&quot; he exclaimed as he took another ball off his belt. &quot;Go! Gemini!&quot; said Keith as he threw the ball into the air, unleashing his Weezing into the open. Gemini took two deep breaths simultaneously (one for each head), and sighed, very much enjoying the putrid environment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weezing weez,&quot; said both heads simultaneously as they turned to face Keith.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, Gemini, here's the situation,&quot; Keith explained. &quot;Connor's Girafarig ran off that way after being hit in the head by accident. I need you to go after it, calm it down with your <b>Sweet Scent</b>, alright? Then lead them back here. Can you do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Weezing,&quot; nodded Gemini as they went off after Biondello, as fast as they could float.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you cer-tain this is a good i-de-a, Meat Sack?&quot; snapped Myrtle as she showed up unexpectedly next to Keith. &quot;Would it not be a sa-fer bet to use Hed-wig? Cro-bat are fasss-ter, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax, Myrtle, I believe Gemini's got what it takes,&quot; Keith said to the perpetually negative Shuppet.<br />
<br />
Myrtle merely rolled her eyes in response, before floating over to Marion. She spoke up again, this time in Shuppet language. &quot;<i>Marion, I can lift that Grimer right out of your hair for you with <b>Psychic</b>,</i>&quot; she offered.</span></span></div>

<span style="color: darkorange">OOC: Thanks so much for picking me up; I honestly wasn't expecting an update in Cascadia for a while, but I'm glad you were willing. Cascadia has long been my favorite zone so I'm eager to get adventuring here!<br />
<br />
Entering the temple, Jeri could feel a rush of excitement wash over him. The stale air and dank passage gave him that unique thrill of adventure only found from ruin exploration, and he could feel it build as he proceeded further into the temple's depths. After quite a long walk through the lengthy entrance hall, he found himself in the temple's central atrium. The dusty chamber was just what he was hoping to find; an ancient and impressive passage filled with innumerable doorways from which to choose. One of the many, however, caught his attention. Above its threshold, a group of markings seemed to have been scrawled, distinctive in being the only markings on the walls. Though he couldn't be totally sure about it, the markings seemed to read &quot;OVER HERE&quot;. His first instinct lead him to consider choosing the door, its dark, unprobed passage rather tempting, but he hesitated. The markings were rather mysterious and could very well be a recent addition by a vandalizing interloper, but the apparent age of the doorway - something that such a vandal likely would not be privy to - suggested a possible deeper connection. Jeri knew well that ruins were not something to be explored with reckless abandon, but in spite of this, his decision was quickly made, unfortunately, not entirely under his free will. A click and rumble later, Jeri turned to see that his original (and the only certain) path in had been closed off by a stone door, likely a trap to discourage trespassers like himself. A few small torches lit around the lobby, revealing the grandness of the whole room. The vast number of doors was fully shown to him, which didn't make his decision any easier. But, with an equal chance of danger beyond any of the thresholds, he thought it best to stick to the one that at least held a clue. It could easily lead to an eventual exit, or just as easily to another trap; but that was one of the dangers of ruin exploration, wasn't it?<br />
<br />
He decided, though, that before he would proceed that it would be wise to have a bit of insurance. Pulling a Pokéball from his belt, he released one of the newer additions to his (or more accurately, Tetsu's) team, a timid little Chimecho.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, Dondon,&quot; he started, turning towards the chime as he looked around curiously, &quot;I know we haven't known each other long, but why don't you and I do some exploring?&quot; Dondon gave a slight nod and a little ring. &quot;Let's get started with a <b>Flash</b> for some light, shall we?&quot; Dondon nodded again, lighting up his yellow bulb to provide some light for Jeri as he took his first step into the shadowy passage...</span></span></div>

Hey everyone. First of all, I'm so sorry for the delay with this batch; I've prioritized the Arcane Realm and I hope nobody holds it against me, even if it did come at your expense. I can't promise more frequent Cascadia updates in the near future, since clearing people from the AR will still take precedence, but hopefully I can manage a more acceptable pace for you guys, especially since most of you aren't even bound to the AR in the first place.<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate it though if you could post a link confirming that you have indeed been cleared from the Arcane Realm in your next reply so I can continue updating you. Those of you who haven't gone through the zone yet naturally can't reply to this next batch, but if you've been given green light already (even if it was years ago) I'd like confirmation, please. If you can't find the link, I guess I'll just have to take your word for it. <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite7" alt=":p" title="Stick Out Tongue    :p" data-shortname=":p" /><br />
<br />
Now, let's get started.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>Aduro Island</i></span><br />
<br />
<b><u>Geyser Park</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>Hayward</u>:</u></b> It was one of those rare events that always feel so very special to any Trainer: through the accumulated stress, battle experience and sheer determination, Urséo became a massive, imposing Ursaring; and so shortly after you caught him too!<br />
<br />
You grin and compliment the bear on his once-in-a-lifetime achievement, feeling a rush of power running through your own veins as well: with an Ursaring at your disposal, you’ve just become a much more powerful Trainer, and feel like you can take on the world – or at the very least, see this adventure through to the end.<br />
Even so, you decide to spare the poor Croagunk, but you know better than to just let it go. Instead, you order Urséo to freeze the poison frog in its place with a Scary Face, and then pick it up and bring it with you. That way, you have a hostage of your own, which will hopefully give you some leverage.<br />
<br />
With renewed determination, you boldly step forward (limping, mind) and enter the Pokémon Centre head-on, followed closely by Urséo and your hapless captive. The site of you all just barging in, especially that gigantic bear no doubt, scares the remaining Croagunk in the room to the bone, making it jump and immediately flee through the front door of the Pokémon Center and leaving the entrance to the Recovery Wing unguarded.<br />
<br />
You glance at the two doors once again, now having all the time in the world. The room to the left, labeled “Emergency Room”, probably houses your severely-injured Skarméo, and who knows who – or what – is behind the door to the Recovery Wing. Tempted as you are to make your way over to the ER, the human hostages wave at you, calling you over; the relief on the family’s faces is evident, all three of them delighted to see you. You rush over to meet them and lean down next to Barry, the father.<br />
<br />
-	Thank God you made it, Will! Those damn frogs captured as soon as I set foot in here, and did the same to Terry… fortunately they didn’t hurt him, but they’ve been keeping us here for no discernible reason… what’s going on here?!<br />
<br />
Terry is looking terribly embarrassed about the mess he got himself into after disobeying both his father and your own orders, but luckily nobody was harmed. Barry’s wife was smiling in relief, but you can’t shake off the feeling that the smile isn’t entirely genuine… maybe she still blames you for what happened to Barry, even though her husband already vouched for you? Nevermind though, you need to focus on getting Skarméo back and taking the family away from this place, those are your only priorities.<br />
<br />
You pull yourself back up and motion for Urséo to head over to the Emergency Room. But before either of you can start moving, the door of the Recovery Wing slides open...<br />
<br />
A man walks out with a slow pace. Probably in his thirties, clean shaven with light blonde hair and thin, elegant glasses, wearing a white suit and matching white shoes, he casually moves inside the main hall as if you’re not even there. Following behind are two other men, much larger than the first, wearing denim jackets and worn-out jeans – dressed in as much blue as the other man is in white.<br />
The blonde one stops right next to Barry and his family and looks down at them, who continue to “hide” behind the row of benches where they’d been since you arrived, and smiles.<br />
<br />
-	So sorry to keep you waiting, friends. I’ve been trying to teach those Croagunk some manners, but it’s proving quite the ordeal. Anyway, so glad you could make it. I got almost everything I came for, there’s just that one little thing missing… right my dear?<br />
<br />
You fail to realize what the man means until Barry’s wife bursts into tears.<br />
<br />
-	Come now. We did have an arrangement, didn’t we love? Come on, tell them.<br />
<br />
She sobs and struggles to keep the tears back, and finally manages to speak.<br />
<br />
-	Son… Terry, give the man your Kangaskhan. You have to, dear, I’m sorry…<br />
<br />
Both father and son look at Kelly in disbelief. But it’s Barry that speaks first.<br />
<br />
-	Dear, what are you saying? Do… do you know this man? What are you not telling me? Are these… are these guys that new Team Aqua?!<br />
<br />
-	I’m <i>NOT</i> giving him Kangy, never! He’s mine!! We already lost his mommy, why do I have to let Kangy go too?!<br />
<br />
The man in white chuckles and nonchalantly runs a hand through his hair – a motion you’re familiar with, but for some reason watching him do it pisses you off.<br />
<br />
-	Now now, so much drama. Allow me to explain, dear Kelly here is in no condition to. My name is Archer. And that’s where the similarities with that defunct group end, Mr. Barry, you see… unlike them, I’m someone you need to fear.<br />
<br />
His eyes then shift over to you, unwavering, determined and cold. Seems he did notice you before.<br />
<br />
-	I work for myself. I have no delusions of grandeur, no need for a “team”. Those who believe in me will follow me, like these gentlemen behind me. Those that oppose me, well… I’m still here.<br />
<br />
He kneels down and rests a hand on Kelly’s shoulder.<br />
<br />
-	Your wife made, let’s say… a deal with the devil. See Mr. Barry, she was on to me ever since I took your first Kangaskhan. She begged and pleaded that I give it back, but I couldn’t very well do that, now could I? It was then brought to my attention that you still possessed the offspring of said Kangaskhan, and so I made her an offer of my own. I showed her my work.<br />
<br />
Kelly begins to cry again, and young Terry looks at her, confused and heartbroken. For a child, seeing their parents cry is always an emotionally scarring moment.<br />
<br />
-	When she saw what I was developing, the beauty of it and its frightening potential, well, the balance of power changed a bit, didn’t it love?<br />
<br />
-	He… oh Barry, he… he can control minds! Human or Pokémon, it doesn’t matter!! I had to do this, it was the only way, I…<br />
<br />
<br />
Archer stands back up, walks over to the Pokémon Centre counter where Nurse Joy usually works, and sits on it, as if getting ready to lecture a class.<br />
<br />
-	Indeed my dear! I can own the world, it is precisely as you said: human or Pokémon, <i>it does not matter</i>. But I need live subjects to test this discovery of mine. I need to know just how powerful my grip is on those minds. So I need both mothers and their offsprings, I need to… break those bonds. And that was the core of our little deal. Kelly would find a way to bring little Kangy over to me, and in return, I promised to leave all three of you alone and not to include you in my future experiments. You see, the last time I tested on human subjects, it… wasn’t perfect. Both Kelly and myself would <i>hate</i> to see it happen again. Well… - he hopped off the counter and held out his hand. – Now that introductions and explanations are out of the way, Terry dear, be a good boy and listen to mommy.<br />
<br />
Terry holds the Pokeball in his hands tightly and shakes his head.<br />
<br />
-	No, I can’t! She’s the only friend I have, don’t take her, please!!<br />
<br />
Barry suddenly sighs and turns to his son, puts his hand on his head and whispers.<br />
<br />
-	Son… do it. It’s the only way right now… but we’ll get her back, okay? Believe in daddy. Be strong, Terry, go on.<br />
<br />
The boy starts to cry but loosens the grip on the Pokeball, allowing Barry to take it and toss it at Archer.<br />
<br />
-	I mean it, you bastard: we’re going to take back everything you stole from us, and then some!<br />
<br />
Archer smiles as he tucks the Ball in his belt.<br />
<br />
-	Whatever you say, good sir. It was a pleasure doing business with you all, especially you Kelly dear. As for you, young man… you can take your Skarmory, it has nothing of value for me. But I’d very much like to see that Ursaring in the near future again… Hopefully you and Mr. Badass Barry here will know where to find me, yes? I’d hate to see a father break a promise to his child.<br />
<br />
He motions for his companions, who approach him immediately, then reaches for his belt again and releases an Abra from a different Pokeball. Before you know it, all three men are gone.<br />
<br />
Things got very complicated in a matter of minutes. Even if you wanted to give chase, you have no idea where the man went, even though he was clearly challenging you: on the other hand, this isn’t your concern anymore, maybe seeking revenge should be left up to Barry… and since the only one who can point you in Archer’s direction is Kelly, and her credibility is already seriously compromised, why should you even risk it? You weigh your options carefully in your mind, and… <br />
<br />
What do you do?</span></span> <br />

<br />
<br />
<b><u>Pearl Lake</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>SugarPesticide</u>:</u></b> Jan Vogh’s smile widens to impressive proportions as he hears your acceptance. The old man takes your hand in his, much to your discomfort, but you know he means no harm; he looks into your eyes, his own tearing up, and thanks you repeatedly.<br />
<br />
-	You have no idea how much this means to me, young lady! Thank you, from the bottom of my heart… Not many youngsters are as willing to help an old man out, especially with nothing in return… Thank you, my dear.<br />
<br />
He regains his composure, clears his throat and reaches for his belt. A single Pokeball rests attached to it, which Vogh retrieves and tosses in the air. From within emerges… a very old-looking Smeargle.<br />
<br />
-	This has been my trusty companion for the last 60 years of my life. He has made me an artist, and together we have perfected our art, competing with one another in hopes that our next masterpiece will outshine the other’s. Salvador here is the sole reason for my success, but as of late, he has been... unwell.<br />
<br />
The Smeargle wags his tail in disapproval, as if dismissing Vogh’s claims, but as he does so, you notice something odd – the tip of his tail is completely dry.<br />
<br />
-	Some disease must be afflicting poor Salvador, as he’s been unable to paint for almost a year now. His tail has dried up, and not a single Nurse Joy has been able to heal him! Without his help, I am unable to create new works of art either, and so we’re both facing a difficult conundrum… I consulted with Pokémon Professors in Cascadia and abroad to no avail, until one of my artist friends claimed to once have read about a similar malady in an old tome about Pokémon in the Renaissance era... The book spoke of a concoction made from specific plants that could restore a Smeargle’s pigment, but alas, I am too old to search for those ingredients myself…<br />
<br />
You can clearly see where this is going, but it’s hard not to feel sorry for both Vogh and Salvador. They’re both a ways away from their days of youth, but that shouldn’t stop them from creating new masterpieces! Many of the greatest painters of all time produced their greatest works well into their seventies… These two deserve another chance. You think about your own Smeargle, and how she’d feel in Salvador’s situation… you can’t quite put yourself in her shoes, but it must be devastating for any Smeargle to be unable to paint, and you give thanks that Vica Pota is as healthy as she can be. As unreliable as the source is – a book several centuries-old is hardly of any scientific value -, it’s the only lead you have…<br />
<br />
-	These are the plants I require … One Glistening Folium, one Aurea Blossom and one Rozz Bulb. From my own research, I gathered that all three of these plants can only grow next to water, but each of them requires specific temperatures to bloom... The Folium grows only at very low temperatures whereas the Bulb requires a particularly warm climate. The Blossom withers easily at both high and low temperatures; I’d say Crater Island is probably a good environment for it! But you might need to travel to more suitable places to find the Folium and the Bulb, I’m afraid…<br />
<br />
The man looks at the ground, disheartened; he’s aware of what he’s asking and the unlikelihood that you’ll still accept after the details have been laid out. While one of the plants might be found in the pleasant climate of Crater island, it seems a good deal of travelling and scavenging will be required to find the other two… and even then, there are no guarantees any of this will even work! Salvador also seems depressed, holding on to its tail as if trying to squeeze the non-existent pigment out of it, oblivious to the whole conversation…<br />
<br />
Under these new circumstances, what will you do?</span></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: silver"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>Brine Island</i></span><br />
<br />
<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>Arc_Angel &amp; lilbluecorsola</u>:</u></b> In the kitchen, the old man stands in silence after Stacey’s question. You knew it’d be a touchy subject, but the nagging feeling was too much to ignore, and it could be the key to this whole situation… or it could turn out to be nothing at all. You turn off the oven while you wait for a reply that may not come, but you keep your eyes locked on the elder to reassure him that you do expect an answer.<br />
<br />
After a while, he sighs and looks back at you. His eyes are red and tearing up, but he manages to keep his composure somewhat as he finally speaks.<br />
<br />
-	Rather dashing, wasn’t I? Took me forever to get that suit on right. My dear, that picture is… an unfortunate memento of an event that took place five years ago at Fizzytopia, of which I served as host. It’s… a day I would do anything to forget, <i>anything</i> at all. Why I haven’t disposed of that photo yet is beyond me…<br />
<br />
He says nothing more and turns his empty stare to the still-fuming pot. But does he need to say anything else? Pieces of the puzzle begin to come together, and the man himself suddenly looks as familiar to you as the photograph’s background: who is he after all?<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Alicia claps her hands in excitement upon hearing Jess’s suggestion for a game.<br />
<br />
-	Oh, I’ve never played that before, sounds like so much fun! Me first, me first! So… oh, I got one! Jess, what’s your sister like?<br />
<br />
Seems like a harmless enough question. Part of you was afraid she’d ask something embarrassing or overly personal in her state of childish excitement. You smile and give her your answer, followed by a question of your own.<br />
<br />
-	She's really sweet, probably the sweetest thing you've ever seen. She loves to draw, and is a huge fan of birds. Her favorite Pokémon is Swablu. What’s <i>your</i> sister like?<br />
<br />
Felicia’s eyes light up upon hearing your question, but suddenly hesitates, as if trying to remember...<br />
<br />
-	My sister? She's... younger than me, two years younger! Her name's Serena. She goes to school at... Salin City Elementary? Yeah, I think that's it! She used to draw a lot too, like your sis, but I haven't seen her do it in a long time... I'll have to ask her why when she gets home! Why isn't she here yet?... <br />
<br />
She falls into a brief silence, as if lost in thought, but quickly bounces back brimming with energy.<br />
<br />
-	Oh! My turn, sorry! Soo.... Hehe, I know! What did the Shadow Man tell you in your last dream?<br />
<br />
You’re completely taken by surprise. Shadow Man? What’s this crazy chick talking about now? Is it some kind of local folk tale, or has she <i>really</i> lost it? You try your best to answer adequately, so as not to lose her attention; you could run into valuable information any moment now, so it’s imperative that you keep playing along.<br />
<br />
-	The Shadow Man? <i>(Who could she be referring to? It couldn't be... Nah. She wouldn't know him. Still, that's the only Shadow I'm aware of. Guess it's worth a shot.)</i> He told me... To look after the Star Girl. That she'll be fine on her own, she doesn't need his protection anymore. He'll still be watching over her from the other side though….. That was a long time ago. Um, sorry if that doesn't make much sense... What about you? What did the Shadow Man say in your dream? Oh! Say, perhaps you can draw him for me? I kinda forget what he looks like, since I don't usually remember my dreams. I'm also curious about your sister's drawings. You wouldn't happen to have any around, would you? I can show you one my sis made when I first started my journey, if you like.<br />
<br />
Felicia looks at you with a confused but delighted look on her face. She’s loving this.<br />
<br />
-	Aw, the Shadow Man never told me about Star Girl! Are they a couple? Is she his sister? I have to ask him tonight... How come you don't remember him? Isn't he right there next to you every night while you dream too? Last night, the Shadow Man warned me about the big fire in that building... he said Sis might be there and I had to watch out for the people that did it.<br />
She gets up to fetch a notepad from her bedside table and scribbles something in it, then hands it to you. Drawn on it is simply the figure of a tall man, completely painted black with no discernible features.<br />
Suddenly, Felicia’s expression turns serious; she becomes tense and her eyes are locked on you.<br />
<br />
-	So now it's my turn... Did you start the fire, Jess?<br />
<br />
You sense something’s about to snap in that twisted head of hers, so you approach the topic carefully, rewinding the conversation a little back to Shadow Man and Star Girl to try and soothe Felicia somewhat.<br />
<br />
-	Their relationship is a bit... complicated. I consider them close comrades. Kinda like kindred spirits. Eh heh, I'm not very good at remembering faces, so thanks for the reminder. As for your question... no, I did not start the fire. Whatever gave you that idea? Do you know who could've done it?<br />
<br />
The girl blinks for a moment, all semblance of anger gone as quickly as it appeared.<br />
<br />
-	But you and your friend were there, and you knew exactly what to do to stop the fire, and... but wait, you saved me from the Electrode too! So it makes no sense at all, does it? I'm sorry, forget I said anything, I'm just... just a little confused, I guess, I... – she starts smiling again and looks at you warmly. – About a week ago, the Shadow Man said I should get to know you better once we met! Did he tell you about me in your dreams too? Is that why you wanted to play this game? You're so smart, Jess! Oh yeah, you wanted to see my sister’s drawings, right? Let me see if I can find some…<br />
<br />
She gets up again and rummages through the trunk once more; not long afterwards, she hands you a very worn-looking notebook. You skim through it, and sure enough, it’s filled with colorful sketches of flowers, birds and a huge number of butterflies. The traces are clearly those of a child, middle school-level at best, which is odd; if they really are only two years apart, you’d expect her sister’s drawings to be better than this. Either she topped practicing as she got older, or…<br />
<br />
-	She sketches in class all the time… Butterflies are her favourites, she’s even trying to get one of her own! See that one over there with the pink and white wings? She made it just last week, isn’t it great?<br />
<br />
No, it’s really not… whoever drew it could be no more than ten years old, no matter how bad they were at it. It just doesn’t add up…<br />
<br />
Just then, you hear a knock on the door. Damnit, already? You feel like you ended up with more questions than answers! You put the notebook down as Felicia opens the door to reveal a very determined-looking Golett – seems Dwemer was tasked with the important quest of calling you down for dinner! The solemn air of the ghostly construct makes you chuckle, and you thank him (her? It?) before heading downstairs, followed by the young girl.<br />

When you reach the kitchen, you find the old man looking very sad, eyes transfixed on what you assume is dinner in a fuming pot, with Stacey tending to the meal. Did she let it burn or something? You suddenly remember that you have something for her. You hand Stacey one of the berries Felicia gave you and keep the other one to yourself. <b>Each of you obtains

<br />
Felicia starts setting the table for four, all the while humming a cheerful melody. Her father snaps out of his trance and apologizes to Stacey for whatever reason, then invites you to take a seat. You comply and sit next to each other, with Felicia taking a seat in front of Jess after she finishes laying the table. She smiles at the two of you and calls her dad over… seems she’s hungry.<br />
<br />
The man serves each of you a generous portion and takes his place at the table. You can tell he’s trying to force a smile of his own, but it’s coming off a lot less genuine than his daughter’s.<br />
<br />
-	Once again, thank you so much for all you’ve done for my daughter. If you hadn’t shown up when you did, I’m afraid the worst could have happened… But fortunately haven’t lost your touch even after five years.<br />
<br />
His expression suddenly becomes terrified, as if he’s let slip something he really shouldn’t have. He coughs loudly and turns his attention to the meal, ostensibly inviting you to do the same.<br />
<br />
-	Is it to your liking? It would’ve ended up overcooked if not for your help, Stacey. Thank you for that, I… get lost in thought frequently, I’m afraid. Felicia isn’t so great of a cook either, but we make do with our limited skills, I’d say. Neither of us have starved so far, right? Heh heh…<br />
<br />
He falls into a deep silence once again, and with Felicia too focused on her own plate to talk either, the room grows awkwardly quiet.<br />
<br />
For all the things you’ve heard and learned so far, there is still a whole lot of stuff that just doesn’t add up. Then again, there appears to be a number of sensitive subjects that your host might not appreciate being asked to elaborate on, especially considering you’re his guests …<br />
<br />
From silence to superficial banter to what’s really bothering you… What will you do now?</span><br />

Clearly she wasn't used to people pass the registration form... She takes out her cellphone, types something in a hurry and puts it away, then takes back the papers and glances through them one last time to make sure everything is in order.<br />

<b>1x Challenger's Keycard</b> and points you in the direction of a large door on the far wall of the Registration Hall. You pick up your belongings from the counter, thank the woman and hasten your pace toward the gate, glad to escape the angry mob that was forming behind you.<br />
<br />
As you approach the door, you see a device next to it that you assume to be a card reader. You swipe the keycard the woman handed you and sure enough, after a green LED flashes, the doors slide open. Taking a deep breath, you try to ignore the nagging feeling that you've been away from the circuit for too long and walk inside.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
The deafening noise of the crowd fills the massive room. Where did all these people come from? Well, now that you think about it, there was a pretty heavy publicity campaign surrounding the event in the streets of Salin City. And besides, how often did you get to see the best of the best in action? Since times immemorial, people have nurtured a need for heroes; the possibility that one will rise in front of their eyes during this gauntlet is also a huge factor of interest. And as for those less talented... well, another thing that people have also loved since times immemorial is watching someone get smacked around inside an arena.<br />
<br />
You take your time to soak in the atmosphere. It's inebriating in a way, the combination of lights, cheers, and the sheer size of the battleground itself. Resembling a covered stadium, and almost as big as one, this Gym is clearly a top-tier one. Built with large crowds in mind (and rightfully so), three stands were constructed to accommodate thousands of spectators; the spotlights, six of them in total, provide impeccable visibility of the battlefield itself while keeping the stands in the dark, much like an opera house. High up, hanging from the ceiling, is a high-definition screen showcasing portraits and various statistics of the clashing Trainers and their respective teams. Your heart skips a bit as you see your own picture already on display... these guys are good! Your opponent's portrait still isn't visible, but you have a feeling he or she will be revealed soon. You clench your fist and step forward with determination, trying your best to block out the crowd's noise and the colossal pressure that comes with it. You take your place in the designated square in front of the battling area, and look to the far end of the arena from where your adversary will presumably make his or her entrance from.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a hole on the ground opens and a middle-aged man in a suit and bowtie emerges, no doubt standing on an elevating platform, microphone in hand. Looking as professional as it looks ridiculous, there is however no denying that the organization put a lot of effort into this event's presentation. The man holds his mic up and does the introductions in an overly dramatic voice, but it only adds to the atmosphere.<br />
<br />
- Llllladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, Trainers of allll ages! Welcome to the Salin City Gym Challenge!! To begin, allow me to announce the rules of this Gauntlet Match! Wesley must defeat all of the &quot;Original Gym Leaders&quot; in succession to conquer this Challenge, and if he does, he will be formally recognized as the very first <i>Champion of the Cascadia League</i> by Pokémon League Officials! That's right folks, in this spectacle of epic proportions, the challenger must contend against acclaimed Gym Leaders from all over the Archipelago, the very best Cascadia has, or at one point had, to offer!<br />
<br />
The crowd pops for the announcement, as you stare in bewilderment: this is apparently more than a mere exhibition match, the stakes are much higher if there's an official League Title up for grabs! Just imagine, you may walk out of this competition a Fizzy Bubbles Champion! Besides, if the opposition is a number of retired Trainers, how hard can it really be?<br />
<br />
- Let's get this show on the road! Please welcome the promising young contestant for this evening.... WEEEEEEESSSS!!! <br />
<br />
Every single spotlight in the Gym switches off except for one, focused directly on you. The crowd cheers louder than ever - whether they're genuinely rooting for you or eager to see you get pummeled.<br />
<br />
- And his opponent, hailing from Mediville, Arcane Real, weighing in at 110 pounds... The Aspiring Young Emperor, GAAAAAAAAAARTH!<br />
<br />
The spotlight aimed at you also switches off as another one lights up, this time pointing toward the entrance opposite where you stand. A blast of confetti explodes from the ground up, and through the glittering bits of paper comes your opponent... a very young-looking Trainer, no doubt younger than yourself, with short brown hair and glasses, wearing a tucked-in white shirt and dark-blue jeans. His posture is in stark contrast with the spectacle that surrounds him; for all the grandeur of his introduction, the Trainer looks just about as intimidated as you, looking around in awe and discomfort as if this was the first time he's been in this situation.<br />
<br />
- This opening match will serve to test the mettle of our challenger; can he hang with the greats, or will his journey end before it even starts? Wesley versus Garth, Singles Match in Standard Arena, 1-on-1 <i>to the faint</i>! Now gentlemen, lllllllet's get ready to rrrrrumble!!<br />
<br />
The constant coining of catchphrases feels a little unnecessary, considering most of them aren't even original, but the guy has heart. You look over at your opponent, standing in his own square on the opposite side of the field, who's still trying to decide on a Pokémon for this battle, it seems. He catches your stare and waves at you.<br />
<br />
- Hey there, nice to meet you!<br />
<br />
The sound is hard to make out clearly through the crowd's constant cheering, but he seems like a nice fellow. But... wasn't this supposed to be a battle against &quot;original&quot; Gym Leaders? This kid is <i>way</i> too young to be branded as such...<br />
<br />
- My name's Garth! So you're Wes, eh? It's not easy to make it past registration; you're the first proper challenger we've had in a while! Actually...- he pauses and gazes at the ground, looking embarrassed. -... this is my first battle in the Gym Challenge too. I took the challenge a couple of days ago on the event's opening night, and even though I lost, I guess I impressed management and they offered me a job here! I'm still kinda learning the ropes, so it'll be good to finally see if I've improved some! My role is to test the mettle of every challenger that passes the registration test before they're given the honour of fighting the legendary Leaders. Now, here's to hoping for a great match, right Wes?!<br />
<br />
Somehow, Garth's attitude calms you down a little; it's nice to see that not everyone you'll go up against is a cold, heartless battling demon. From what you can tell, this young man isn't much different from you at all.<br />
He finally smiles and his look becomes fiercely determined; he's made his choice, it seems.<br />
<br />
- Since you're the challenger, you get to go second; courtesy of the house! So, I guess I'll be going with... this one!<br />
<br />
He hurls a regular Pokeball in the air, and as it snaps open its contents materialize in the center of the field: a Grumpig!<br />
<br />
- <i>OOOOOOoooooooohhh!!</i> The Aspiring Young Emperor starts things off with his Master of the Mind! Behold, Garth's Grumpig!!<br />
<br />
Garth sighs; admittedly, the theatrics are getting a little out of hand. It's not like this is being broadcast on national TV... is it?<br />
<br />
It's your time to choose. You remember this is just a one-on-one match, so whatever you pick, it better win you the match or you're out! Your stomach turns at the thought of failing that miserably in the very first round, in front of such a massive audience, but you try your best to cast aside those thoughts and focus on defeating Garth. He said it himself, he's just getting started, so that should give you a fighting chance! Regardless of how long ago you last battled, you've earned more than enough accolades to have some faith in your skills. Besides, you're itching to see what those &quot;original&quot; Leaders look like! If their name value alone has attracted this many people, you can only imagine they must be, or have been, pretty awesome Trainers.<br />
<br />
The arena, like the announcer said, is a standard field without obstacles or terrain adversities, which helps keep things simple. On the other hand, it leaves the outcome of the match entirely up to the moves ordered, with no help or hindrance from the surroundings...You look through the six partners you chose for this ride.<br />
<br />
Who will you pick to start things off?</span></span><br />

<br />
Between Pandora, Gapp, the Lapras and Kessler, there are many things still left unsolved. But if anything, the much-needed break at the infirmary helped you set your thoughts straight: Pandora must be your first priority. And who knows, you might run into more answers if you manage to track her down. After all, she was the reason you got pulled into all of this... or rather, your own actions that put her in jeopardy. Finding her and assuring her safety comes first, and even without any leads, it’s clear you won’t achieve much of anything just lying on the mattress, no matter how much your body begs you to.<br />
<br />
You force yourself to get up, pull off the needles and take the first of your last steps towards the end of this ordeal.<br />
You figure Pandora might be being kept in the lab where those Link Balls sent the Pokémon you captured during the cave raid. For all you know, they could be experimenting on her this very moment… the thought makes your stomach turn, you have to do something! But without a single lead, no way to blend in, and no idea where the labs even are!...<br />
<br />
You step outside. Even for someone as accustomed to the cold as you, the sudden change of temperature makes you shiver briefly. Still, the chilly air makes the pain somewhat more bearable, and you muscle onwards. But something’s not right…<br />
<br />
Many soldiers walk around camp, as you’d have expected. Most of them are familiar with your face by now, but they hardly acknowledge your presence. The encampment is in silence, which is unsettling considering how many people you’re seeing. They all move and work in silence, staring mostly at the ground, a mixture of sadness and fear in their eyes. There’s something else that’s off, but you can’t quite… wait.<br />
<br />
Your eyes land on the flag raised next to the camp’s entrance... It’s flying at half-mast. That, the tense atmosphere, the cold, all of it makes your heart grow inexplicably heavy…. You try to shake it off and resume your search. You have no choice but to ask around, as subtly as you can, for any leads as to how to find the labs.<br />
<br />
-	You’re not supposed to go there. And I’m not supposed to be talking. Haven’t you heard the announcement?<br />
<br />
This is the answer you get out of just anybody you approach. What the hell’s going on here?! There are dozens of tents, looking through all of them would take ages and that’s not counting those where access would be restricted. You need more information…<br />
<br />
You walk around camp some more, low-rank officers that joined you in the trip through the icy tunnels, every single one of them now actively averting your gaze and minding their chores. Just as you begin to feel exasperated, you spot a young soldier sitting by himself on a wooden crate. He’s looking up to the sky in silence, a cartwheel filled with ammo boxes nearby. It seems he’s taking a break, or he’s simply unmotivated to keep going. As you approach him and his features grow more defined, you tell yourself this one must be no older than 18. His eyes are bloodshot, as if he’d been crying, and he’s muttering something under his breath. Maybe you can get something out of this one…<br />
<br />
You stand next to the soldier and greet him; he looks at you briefly before locking eyes on the ground. You try to ask him the way to the lab, but for now he proves no more helpful than the others.<br />
<br />
-	It’s… wait, I… go away! I really can’t be talking. You heard Commander Kessler, didn’t you? Just… just go away, I’m working!<br />
<br />
He jumps off the crate and goes to pick up the cartwheel. But part of you tells you to press harder; this one seems easier to break than the rest! How you break him is the problem though, you’re out in the open and apparently talking too much has been branded a transgression or something. And if you rough him up too bad, people might notice…<br />
<br />
What do you do?</span></span><br />

<b><u>The SS Leviathan Shipwreck</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>CyberBlastoise</u>:</u></b> <i>((I made it a point to tell you that Lumineon doesn’t know Dive, and won’t be able to keep up with your character or Carvanha; it says so on the Intro Post: without Dive you can’t access the deeper parts of the Shipwreck, and I can’t overlook that.))</i><br />
<br />
You decide that staying where you are is the only thing you <i>can’t</i> do. Thinking quickly, you realize you won’t be able to take on such a huge flock on such disadvantageous terrain, and so the only thing left to do is sound the retreat. Gearing up, you almost instinctively aim for the SS Leviathan; it’s the only landmark that may provide shelter for miles around, at least the underwater portion of the ship… You can worry about the legal issues after you survive.<br />
<br />
You instruct Savage and Swift to follow you as you dive down and toward the shipwreck. You can’t afford to stay behind and keep an eye on the two Water-Types, but you know they’ll follow your instructions to the best of their abilities, so now it’s every man and ‘mon for himself.<br />
<br />
With renewed confidence, you dive down as deep as you can, the scuba gear fulfilling its role to perfection; you move through the ocean almost effortlessly, swimming towards the wreckage of the once-imposing Leviathan. The Wingull are now far behind (and above), whereas the famous treasure is now close ahead – that’s two birds with one stone, pun intended, so in a way you can’t help but feel thankful for the seagull attack that drove away the Coastal Guard.<br />
<br />
After a few more minutes of swimming down, you finally reach the sunken ship. The wood is broken and in a considerably state of decay, with several breaches across the hull: just what you were looking for. You search for a gap large enough to fit through, and sure enough, you find one! You slide through the crack, carefully so as not to get stuck because of the oxygen bottle on your back, and pull yourself inside the ship. Looking up, you can see an eerie glow not far above, which means the surface is just up ahead! You flap your legs vigorously in one last effort, and you finally make it out of the water.<br />
<br />
Breathing a sigh of relief, you remove the headgear and breathe in. The air is stale, humid and strangely warm… You look around and realize you must have come up from a crack on the deck’s floor; you reach for the wooden planks and pull yourself up and out of the water entirely, sitting on the floor for a few moments of well-deserved rest. The break will also give you some time to think about your next course of action; as soon as Savage and Swift catch up to you, why not explore the ship while you’re already here? It was the original purpose of your journey to Cascadia, after all…<br />
<br />
Just then, ripples form on the water surface from where you came, and shortly afterwards two sharp-edged yellow fins emerge… It’s Savage! But what about… oh no.<br />
<br />
The rest of Savage’s body surfaces as well, and the Carvanha worriedly looks at you while revealing to be carrying something in its fangs… it’s Swift!!<br />
You hurriedly bend over to pick up the Lumineon, who is unconscious and bleeding from several cuts all across its body. You lack the communication skills to ask Savage what happened, but the fact that the Carvanha is unharmed provides the answer: Swift failed to follow the two of you down towards the Shipwreck because it couldn’t Dive, and the flock caught up to him… Savage probably went back for his friend, and it’s the only reason why Swift is still alive- if just barely!<br />
<br />
What could have been a leisurely stroll around the ship in search of long-lost treasure just took a turn for the worse, and you can’t help but feel guilty over what happened to Swift. It’s time to reassess the situation… Will you press onwards in your exploration in hopes of finding something to nurse the Lumineon back to health? Do you have something on you at the moment that might relieve its pain? You realize the unlikelihood of finding medicine untouched by either time or saltwater in here, but on the other hand, your only remaining option is to backtrack all the way to a Pokémon Center, and that would mean running into that deadly flock of Wingull waiting for you outside again...<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span><br />

<br />
<b><u>Bane Forest</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>Ex-Admiral Insane</u>:</u></b> The decision was unexpected to say the least – even for you. With a mind that turns to profit wherever it can be found, suddenly deciding to abandon the promise of considerable wealth in exchange for… what, exactly? For all you know, there may be absolutely nothing waiting for you out in the wilderness of Venom Island. You try to ignore the part of you screaming about how you might not even make it back at all, and gear up to leave the encampment. That nightmare better have meant something.<br />
<br />
You step outside. The air is chilly, the atmosphere as noxious and uninviting as you remember it. You look around, the last thing you need right now is to attract unwanted attention… but there’s nobody around, it seems. Makes sense, considering it’s the dead of the night; on the other hand, not having somebody keep watch over the camp probably isn’t a great idea, considering this is one of the most inhospitable places in all of Cascadia. Oh well, at least it works to your benefit.<br />
<br />
You tiptoe your way toward the main entrance, push open the wooden gate and walk outside… away from the comfort of the encampment’s wall, and into the bleak, dark unknown. You remember what happened just hours before in the quicksand pit, and tell yourself you need to be extra careful now that visibility has diminished even more. Each step may be your last, but you’re determined to get to the bottom of this.<br />
<br />
You brave the darkness as carefully as you can, but mindful of keeping a steady pace throughout; after all, the longer you stay out here, the bigger the odds of running into something nasty and dangerous. Rags follows close behind, which gives you a measure of confidence in a land that is probably overflowing with Poison-Types. You struggle to remember the path toward the mark on the map; even straight lines are hard to follow in these conditions. Still, all you can do now is move forward.<br />
<br />
After what feels like an hour of walking, you start to wonder whether you’re lost, you should be there by now… but the landscape remains the same, silent, barren and hopefully lifeless. Just as you’re about to turn to Rags, the mist surrounding you grows thicker and thicker at an alarming pace, unnatural even, and before you know it, everything around you is a hazy purple. It’s hard to even make out Rags through the fog, and he’s supposed to be no more than a foot away! What the hell’s going on?! Wait…<br />
<br />
You’ve seen this before. In your dream, everything went purple then too! Except then you were floating, thankfully you’re on solid ground now, but if your theory is correct, there should be something else about to…<br />
<br />
<i>You’ve come.</i><br />
<br />
The familiar amalgam of voices is heard, and the spiraling shadows from the dream begin to swirl and coalesce in front of you much like you were expecting. You instinctively take a step back and call for Rags, who doesn’t answer back. Instead, it’s the voices that speak once more.<br />
<br />
<i>I did not expect you to make this choice, Lucas. To my recollection, humans were always much more attached to wealth than reason...</i><br />
<br />
Wait, “<u>my</u> recollection”? The voices spoke in the plural in your dream… The shadows form a sphere, which grows until it reaches about the size of your own head, and a pair of large, ice-cold eyes spread open. It’s… a Gastly!<br />
<br />
<i>Your presence here Lucas… why did you come? I can reach into the deepest recesses of your mind, and see a strong desire for fortune, not unlike many of your kind and once my own. But I cannot read a person’s heart… so, human, why do you risk losing the coin you were promised? Indulge me in this, and I will share the reason why I summoned you here.</i><br />
<br />
You have so many questions swirling around in your head right now that having to <i>answer</i> one of Gastly’s is the last thing you intended. But it seems the mysterious Pokémon will tell you nothing until you humour him…<br />
<br />
What do you do?</span></span></div>

<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>Arc_Angel &amp; lilbluecorsola</u>:</u></b> In the kitchen, the old man stands in silence after Stacey’s question. You knew it’d be a touchy subject, but the nagging feeling was too much to ignore, and it could be the key to this whole situation… or it could turn out to be nothing at all. You turn off the oven while you wait for a reply that may not come, but you keep your eyes locked on the elder to reassure him that you do expect an answer.<br />
<br />
After a while, he sighs and looks back at you. His eyes are red and tearing up, but he manages to keep his composure somewhat as he finally speaks.<br />
<br />
-	Rather dashing, wasn’t I? Took me forever to get that suit on right. My dear, that picture is… an unfortunate memento of an event that took place five years ago at Fizzytopia, of which I served as host. It’s… a day I would do anything to forget, <i>anything</i> at all. Why I haven’t disposed of that photo yet is beyond me…<br />
<br />
He says nothing more and turns his empty stare to the still-fuming pot. But does he need to say anything else? Pieces of the puzzle begin to come together, and the man himself suddenly looks as familiar to you as the photograph’s background: who is he after all?<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Alicia claps her hands in excitement upon hearing Jess’s suggestion for a game.<br />
<br />
-	Oh, I’ve never played that before, sounds like so much fun! Me first, me first! So… oh, I got one! Jess, what’s your sister like?<br />
<br />
Seems like a harmless enough question. Part of you was afraid she’d ask something embarrassing or overly personal in her state of childish excitement. You smile and give her your answer, followed by a question of your own.<br />
<br />
-	She's really sweet, probably the sweetest thing you've ever seen. She loves to draw, and is a huge fan of birds. Her favorite Pokémon is Swablu. What’s <i>your</i> sister like?<br />
<br />
Felicia’s eyes light up upon hearing your question, but suddenly hesitates, as if trying to remember...<br />
<br />
-	My sister? She's... younger than me, two years younger! Her name's Serena. She goes to school at... Salin City Elementary? Yeah, I think that's it! She used to draw a lot too, like your sis, but I haven't seen her do it in a long time... I'll have to ask her why when she gets home! Why isn't she here yet?... <br />
<br />
She falls into a brief silence, as if lost in thought, but quickly bounces back brimming with energy.<br />
<br />
-	Oh! My turn, sorry! Soo.... Hehe, I know! What did the Shadow Man tell you in your last dream?<br />
<br />
You’re completely taken by surprise. Shadow Man? What’s this crazy chick talking about now? Is it some kind of local folk tale, or has she <i>really</i> lost it? You try your best to answer adequately, so as not to lose her attention; you could run into valuable information any moment now, so it’s imperative that you keep playing along.<br />
<br />
-	The Shadow Man? <i>(Who could she be referring to? It couldn't be... Nah. She wouldn't know him. Still, that's the only Shadow I'm aware of. Guess it's worth a shot.)</i> He told me... To look after the Star Girl. That she'll be fine on her own, she doesn't need his protection anymore. He'll still be watching over her from the other side though….. That was a long time ago. Um, sorry if that doesn't make much sense... What about you? What did the Shadow Man say in your dream? Oh! Say, perhaps you can draw him for me? I kinda forget what he looks like, since I don't usually remember my dreams. I'm also curious about your sister's drawings. You wouldn't happen to have any around, would you? I can show you one my sis made when I first started my journey, if you like.<br />
<br />
Felicia looks at you with a confused but delighted look on her face. She’s loving this.<br />
<br />
-	Aw, the Shadow Man never told me about Star Girl! Are they a couple? Is she his sister? I have to ask him tonight... How come you don't remember him? Isn't he right there next to you every night while you dream too? Last night, the Shadow Man warned me about the big fire in that building... he said Sis might be there and I had to watch out for the people that did it.<br />
She gets up to fetch a notepad from her bedside table and scribbles something in it, then hands it to you. Drawn on it is simply the figure of a tall man, completely painted black with no discernible features.<br />
Suddenly, Felicia’s expression turns serious; she becomes tense and her eyes are locked on you.<br />
<br />
-	So now it's my turn... Did you start the fire, Jess?<br />
<br />
You sense something’s about to snap in that twisted head of hers, so you approach the topic carefully, rewinding the conversation a little back to Shadow Man and Star Girl to try and soothe Felicia somewhat.<br />
<br />
-	Their relationship is a bit... complicated. I consider them close comrades. Kinda like kindred spirits. Eh heh, I'm not very good at remembering faces, so thanks for the reminder. As for your question... no, I did not start the fire. Whatever gave you that idea? Do you know who could've done it?<br />
<br />
The girl blinks for a moment, all semblance of anger gone as quickly as it appeared.<br />
<br />
-	But you and your friend were there, and you knew exactly what to do to stop the fire, and... but wait, you saved me from the Electrode too! So it makes no sense at all, does it? I'm sorry, forget I said anything, I'm just... just a little confused, I guess, I... – she starts smiling again and looks at you warmly. – About a week ago, the Shadow Man said I should get to know you better once we met! Did he tell you about me in your dreams too? Is that why you wanted to play this game? You're so smart, Jess! Oh yeah, you wanted to see my sister’s drawings, right? Let me see if I can find some…<br />
<br />
She gets up again and rummages through the trunk once more; not long afterwards, she hands you a very worn-looking notebook. You skim through it, and sure enough, it’s filled with colorful sketches of flowers, birds and a huge number of butterflies. The traces are clearly those of a child, middle school-level at best, which is odd; if they really are only two years apart, you’d expect her sister’s drawings to be better than this. Either she topped practicing as she got older, or…<br />
<br />
-	She sketches in class all the time… Butterflies are her favourites, she’s even trying to get one of her own! See that one over there with the pink and white wings? She made it just last week, isn’t it great?<br />
<br />
No, it’s really not… whoever drew it could be no more than ten years old, no matter how bad they were at it. It just doesn’t add up…<br />
<br />
Just then, you hear a knock on the door. Damnit, already? You feel like you ended up with more questions than answers! You put the notebook down as Felicia opens the door to reveal a very determined-looking Golett – seems Dwemer was tasked with the important quest of calling you down for dinner! The solemn air of the ghostly construct makes you chuckle, and you thank him (her? It?) before heading downstairs, followed by the young girl.<br />
<br />
When you reach the kitchen, you find the old man looking very sad, eyes transfixed on what you assume is dinner in a fuming pot, with Stacey tending to the meal. Did she let it burn or something? You suddenly remember that you have something for her. You hand Stacey one of the berries Felicia gave you and keep the other one to yourself. <b>Each of you obtains

1x Enigma Berry!</b><br />
<br />
Felicia starts setting the table for four, all the while humming a cheerful melody. Her father snaps out of his trance and apologizes to Stacey for whatever reason, then invites you to take a seat. You comply and sit next to each other, with Felicia taking a seat in front of Jess after she finishes laying the table. She smiles at the two of you and calls her dad over… seems she’s hungry.<br />
<br />
The man serves each of you a generous portion and takes his place at the table. You can tell he’s trying to force a smile of his own, but it’s coming off a lot less genuine than his daughter’s.<br />
<br />
-	Once again, thank you so much for all you’ve done for my daughter. If you hadn’t shown up when you did, I’m afraid the worst could have happened… But fortunately haven’t lost your touch even after five years.<br />
<br />
His expression suddenly becomes terrified, as if he’s let slip something he really shouldn’t have. He coughs loudly and turns his attention to the meal, ostensibly inviting you to do the same.<br />
<br />
-	Is it to your liking? It would’ve ended up overcooked if not for your help, Stacey. Thank you for that, I… get lost in thought frequently, I’m afraid. Felicia isn’t so great of a cook either, but we make do with our limited skills, I’d say. Neither of us have starved so far, right? Heh heh…<br />
<br />
He falls into a deep silence once again, and with Felicia too focused on her own plate to talk either, the room grows awkwardly quiet.<br />
<br />
For all the things you’ve heard and learned so far, there is still a whole lot of stuff that just doesn’t add up. Then again, there appears to be a number of sensitive subjects that your host might not appreciate being asked to elaborate on, especially considering you’re his guests …<br />
<br />
From silence to superficial banter to what’s really bothering you… What will you do now?</span></span>

</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: LightBlue"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Silver">Beneath the fun façade, Jessica’s intent was firm: Gather as much information about Felicia’s “sister” – or rather situation – as she could. To her surprise and relief, the girl brought up the subject of siblings first. Jess smiled as she called upon Daisy’s mutual fondness for art and avians, happy to share such safe tidbits. However, before she could peel the other’s layers back further, the conversation quickly steered into a confusing (and possibly quite dangerous) territory. Jess blinked in puzzlement. Shadow Man? What did she mean by that? Jess began rambling out of nervousness, in an attempt to divert from the fact she had no clue what she was talking about. (Well, not exactly…)<br />
<br />
Fortunately, Felicia seemed to accept her half-assed explanation, returning with an excited rant of her own. At the end, her last question struck like stone. Jess swallowed and proceeded ever more cautiously, afraid one wrong word could set off such a clearly unstable individual.<br />
<br />
Again, her answer appeared to adequately appease, and Jess breathed a sigh as Felicia got up to search for some of her sister’s pictures, feeling especially grateful for some personal space. Felicia soon came back with a worn notebook, which inflated itself with crude descriptions of flowers, birds, and an abundance of butterflies. Flipping through the pages, Jessica’s mystification grew. The style was not far removed from her own relative, who herself was only nine. No matter how much one lacked skill or refinement, the rough quality suggested someone still learning the ways of the world, who saw colors instead of cruelty, capturing brightness over shades of grey. In this case, it wasn’t a conscious choice. The creator simply didn’t know any better. Yet Felicia claimed they were but two years apart. How could that be?<br />
<br />
Jessica pondered as Felicia pointed to a pink-and-white-winged butterfly (apparently made a week ago), asking eagerly for opinion. While Jessica couldn’t bring herself to praise the work by any means, she agreed, in the purest sense, that there was an inherent beauty in its simplicity. Luckily, she was saved the struggle of selecting whether to speak honestly from soul or experience by Dwemer’s timely arrival at the door. While Jess was somewhat frustrated by the interruption just as she seemed to be approaching the heart of the matter, she couldn’t help but chuckle at the ghostly golem’s solemn manner of invitation. Besides, she found she was getting rather peckish, so she shut the book and laid it gently on the bed before scooping up Kristen, following Felicia and their ethereal escort down to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
There, she saw to her surprise Stacey tending to the stove, while their host simply watched on with sad, distant eyes. Jessica shrugged, deciding it better not to question out of courtesy. She recalled she had something to give the other trainer though, and caught her attention long enough to show her the Enigma Berry. Since Stacey seemed occupied with the steaming pot, Jess handed the seed to Dwemer for safekeeping, then went to where Felicia was happily humming and setting the table in hopes of offering some help.<br />
<br />
At that moment, the man awakened from his reverie and apologized to Stacey for some reason, insistently bidding both she and Jess take a seat. They shrugged and obeyed, assembling adjacent while Felicia finished apportioning the plates and napkins, finally settling in the chair opposite Jessica. Her father served each of them a generous amount before taking his own chair next to his daughter.<br />
<br />
“Once again, thank you so much for all you’ve done for my daughter. If you hadn’t shown up when you did, I’m afraid the worst could have happened… But fortunately haven’t lost your touch even after five years.”<br />
<br />
Jessica raised an eyebrow, and she could sense Stacey staring suspiciously straight across the table as well. The speaker coughed, realizing perhaps he said something he shouldn’t have, and desperately directed attention back towards the meal. Although Jessica didn’t like to pry out of politeness – not to mention shyness – the number of questions piling up were becoming too much for her to ignore. They were beginning to burn almost as hot as the fire she ran into earlier. (Plus, awkward silences made her uncomfortable.) She paused long enough to take a spoonful (taking care not to spill on Kristen in her lap, who was sketching a still life of the spread and sneaking bites in between strokes), mulling over her next move as she chewed. After gulping the morsel with a sip of water from her glass, she opened her mouth at last:<br />
<br />
“It’s good, thank you. I can’t cook either, to be honest, so it’s better than anything I could do.”<br />
<br />
She mumbled, unsure whether she was being flattering or rude. She fumbled with her fork as the self-consciousness dragged on.<br />
<br />
“Oh, Stacey knows how to bake though! I’ve seen her cakes and stuff, she’s really great!”<br />
<br />
Wait, when did this turn into a compliment contest? Jess blushed, feeling she was forgetting something. …What was the point again? Oh, right. Inhaling deeply, she managed to compose herself enough to blurt out her real request:<br />
<br />
“Er, sir, what exactly did you mean by ‘five years ago’? F-forgive me for asking, but it kinda seems like you know us… Have we met before?”</span></span></span></div>

Hey everyone. First of all, I'm so sorry for the delay with this batch; I've prioritized the Arcane Realm and I hope nobody holds it against me, even if it did come at your expense. I can't promise more frequent Cascadia updates in the near future, since clearing people from the AR will still take precedence, but hopefully I can manage a more acceptable pace for you guys, especially since most of you aren't even bound to the AR in the first place.<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate it though if you could post a link confirming that you have indeed been cleared from the Arcane Realm in your next reply so I can continue updating you. Those of you who haven't gone through the zone yet naturally can't reply to this next batch, but if you've been given green light already (even if it was years ago) I'd like confirmation, please. If you can't find the link, I guess I'll just have to take your word for it. <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite7" alt=":p" title="Stick Out Tongue    :p" data-shortname=":p" /><br />

The girl blinks for a moment, all semblance of anger gone as quickly as it appeared.<br />
<br />
-	But you and your friend were there, and you knew exactly what to do to stop the fire, and... but wait, you saved me from the Electrode too! So it makes no sense at all, does it? I'm sorry, forget I said anything, I'm just... just a little confused, I guess, I... – she starts smiling again and looks at you warmly. – About a week ago, the Shadow Man said I should get to know you better once we met! Did he tell you about me in your dreams too? Is that why you wanted to play this game? You're so smart, Jess! Oh yeah, you wanted to see my sister’s drawings, right? Let me see if I can find some…<br />
<br />
She gets up again and rummages through the trunk once more; not long afterwards, she hands you a very worn-looking notebook. You skim through it, and sure enough, it’s filled with colorful sketches of flowers, birds and a huge number of butterflies. The traces are clearly those of a child, middle school-level at best, which is odd; if they really are only two years apart, you’d expect her sister’s drawings to be better than this. Either she topped practicing as she got older, or…<br />
<br />
-	She sketches in class all the time… Butterflies are her favourites, she’s even trying to get one of her own! See that one over there with the pink and white wings? She made it just last week, isn’t it great?<br />
<br />
No, it’s really not… whoever drew it could be no more than ten years old, no matter how bad they were at it. It just doesn’t add up…<br />
<br />
Just then, you hear a knock on the door. Damnit, already? You feel like you ended up with more questions than answers! You put the notebook down as Felicia opens the door to reveal a very determined-looking Golett – seems Dwemer was tasked with the important quest of calling you down for dinner! The solemn air of the ghostly construct makes you chuckle, and you thank him (her? It?) before heading downstairs, followed by the young girl.<br />
<br />
When you reach the kitchen, you find the old man looking very sad, eyes transfixed on what you assume is dinner in a fuming pot, with Stacey tending to the meal. Did she let it burn or something? You suddenly remember that you have something for her. You hand Stacey one of the berries Felicia gave you and keep the other one to yourself. <b>Each of you obtains

1x Enigma Berry!</b><br />
<br />
Felicia starts setting the table for four, all the while humming a cheerful melody. Her father snaps out of his trance and apologizes to Stacey for whatever reason, then invites you to take a seat. You comply and sit next to each other, with Felicia taking a seat in front of Jess after she finishes laying the table. She smiles at the two of you and calls her dad over… seems she’s hungry.<br />
<br />
The man serves each of you a generous portion and takes his place at the table. You can tell he’s trying to force a smile of his own, but it’s coming off a lot less genuine than his daughter’s.<br />
<br />
-	Once again, thank you so much for all you’ve done for my daughter. If you hadn’t shown up when you did, I’m afraid the worst could have happened… But fortunately haven’t lost your touch even after five years.<br />
<br />
His expression suddenly becomes terrified, as if he’s let slip something he really shouldn’t have. He coughs loudly and turns his attention to the meal, ostensibly inviting you to do the same.<br />
<br />
-	Is it to your liking? It would’ve ended up overcooked if not for your help, Stacey. Thank you for that, I… get lost in thought frequently, I’m afraid. Felicia isn’t so great of a cook either, but we make do with our limited skills, I’d say. Neither of us have starved so far, right? Heh heh…<br />
<br />
He falls into a deep silence once again, and with Felicia too focused on her own plate to talk either, the room grows awkwardly quiet.<br />
<br />
For all the things you’ve heard and learned so far, there is still a whole lot of stuff that just doesn’t add up. Then again, there appears to be a number of sensitive subjects that your host might not appreciate being asked to elaborate on, especially considering you’re his guests …<br />
<br />
From silence to superficial banter to what’s really bothering you… What will you do now?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">Sorry this took so long =/<br />
<br />
<span style="color: silver">Stacey could feel the air around them thicken to almost choke her as she stared at the old man for his reply. She smelt the food cooking, reaching its competion and switched off the oven never losing eye contact with him. He was scared to give her an answer but that nagging feeling wouldn't leave her alone. The silence seemed to go on forever before his eyes welled up with tears and with a sigh he clears his throat and give his reply.<br />
<br />
-	Rather dashing, wasn’t I? Took me forever to get that suit on right. My dear, that picture is… an unfortunate memento of an event that took place five years ago at Fizzytopia, of which I served as host. It’s… a day I would do anything to forget, <i>anything</i> at all. Why I haven’t disposed of that photo yet is beyond me.<br />
<br />
Stacey felt her mind sifting through the new information, there was something there that called to an old memory. Five years ago, many things happened five years ago and her memory wasn't brilliant. It was a pity Dwemer hadn't been around at the time, he would help her recall her memories in a heartbeat. She had travelled in Fizzytopia often but, what was this day he spoke of? She furrowed her brows in confusion but smiled politely at the man before helping him finish off the meal. One of the pots wasn't looking good at all and smelt just as bad, it felt like forever since she had sent Dwemer up to fetch Jess and Felicia, she only hoped they wouldn't be too much longer; even she was beginning to feel a little uncomfortable with the new silence. A few minutes later she heard the door to the kitchen creek open and Dwemer along with Jess enter the kitchen. Stacey cast the pair a warm smile happy to see them both again and she took the berry from Jess with a look of confusion but happily accepted all the same. <br />
<br />
Felicia was setting the dining table and her father apologises to Stacey for the awkward silence before carrying the meal through inviting the two to sit down at the table. Jess looks a little confused at the missed exchange and Stacey just smiles at her at takes a place next to her at the table. Felicia sits down with gusto and calls her father over, it appears she's hungry too. He starts serving up the meal and Stacey feels her stomach grumble in approval, ruined or not she was looking forward to this repast. She fetched out a small container of Ghost Pokemon food from her bag and handed it to Dwemer who was sat on the sofa and he helped himself to the contents happily. Felicia's father tries to put a smile on his face but its forced and looks pained unlike his daughter who looks very pleased to be here. <br />
<br />
-	Once again, thank you so much for all you’ve done for my daughter. If you hadn’t shown up when you did, I’m afraid the worst could have happened… But fortunately haven’t lost your touch even after five years.<br />
<br />
Stacey's eyes widened and she quickly regained her composure almost as quickly as he did, she was right, she knew that she recognised him. 5 years ago yes she remembered she visited Fizzytopia with a spunky little Rotom, it was a great day, well to start. He had been there when the sky rained fire and the city was nearly destroyed. She had volunteered her assistance, along with Jess and they had fought giant, super strong Pokemon against all odds. But he wasn't to blame for that, it was a freak accident caused by a higher power. She knew that day haunted Jess and she thought perhaps it wasn't best to bring it up again but like the flames they encountered today the questions burned at her mind. She swallowed her mouthful of food and caught sight of her travelling partner from the corner of her eye. She looked confused and intrigued too, the little slip had not gone unnoticed by her either. Felicia's father quickly moved onto thanking Stacey for her help finishing off the meal, it hadn't turned out too bad, a little slat and pepper fixed a multitude of sins and she smiled at him warmly. Jess mirrored her thoughts and complimented the ghost trainer on her baking skills causing her cough and rub her neck with embarrassment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not too bad, I make a mean Old Gateaux and my Rotom helps out but I'm not too good a cook, this is good thank you&quot; She said trying to move the focus away from her. Jess seemed to be deep in thought wringing her hands together before blurting out what she was thinking. Stacey turned to face the old man who looked a little pale. She bit her lip, Jess didn't remember but amazingly she did today, maybe being around Dwemer was helping. Speaking of the ghost he was looking over the arm of the sofa with a deep interest, he always liked hearing about the past. Stacey covered Jess's hand with her own on the table hoping that the news that might about to be shared wouldn't traumatise her again.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened back then wasn't your fault sir, a greater power was at work that day. We volunteered to help of our own accord ... you ... you shouldn't feel guilty but I wonder why you do?&quot; Stacey asked aloud sharing a look with Jess who looked confused that Stacey appeared to know what he was speaking of</span></span></div>

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>Arc_Angel &amp; lilbluecorsola</u>:</u></b> The tension in the room became palpable at the man’s eerie remark. How does he know the two of you? You’ve never met him before in your lives… or have you? Stacey seems to think so, much to Jess's surprise.<br />
<br />
Felicia gladly continues her meal, oblivious to the whole conversation. If there’s any comfort to be had, it’s that at least she’s far from one of her psychotic breaks. Her father, on the other hand, seems strangely unfazed by his apparent slip-up. What if it wasn’t a mistake at all? He takes a sip of his drink, puts down the glass slowly and looks at you with a truly unreadable expression – for the first time since you met him. His eyes land on Stacey, in response to her reassuring words.<br />
<br />
-	Oh, I know love. I wasn’t to blame for any of it… All the while, I’ve been the victim, since I was a child! But now, thanks to you, I can finally be free of it all…<br />
<br />
You exchange a confused glance. A groggy, heavy glance, that is somehow much harder to pull off than such a simple motion should ever be… You feel as if you’ve been awake for two weeks straight, unable to fight the drowsiness. You struggle against the unnatural feeling long enough to see Felicia’s head drop flat on the table, but it’s so hard to fight back… so hard.… so……<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
<b>Stacey</b>: You feel exhausted; you’ve been running for so long now, carrying the motionless bodies of a Teddiursa and Koffing in your arms; their weight is beginning to feel unbearable, but you have to keep running, or they’ll catch up to you! The Lyanazia woods are dark, the air is thick with moisture and feels uncomfortably warm as it enters your lungs; the branches and rocks graze your feet and ankles, making you wince in pain, but you have to keep going. You try your best to keep up the pace, until you hit your leg on a soaked block of timber and go flying several feet forward, landing less-than-graciously on the muddy floor of the rainforest.<br />
<br />
Your body aches all over, but you persevere. It’s been too long, too hard, too unbelievable of an adventure to give up now. And they’re depending on you… You get to one knee, then back to your feet, legs wobbly and in pain. You spot a lone Stantler in the distance, a welcome sight amidst the desolation. Next to it however, something unexpected, something amiss… a foreign sight in an otherwise familiar painting. A mass of swirling shadows, at first vaguely and then definitely resembling a tall, slim man, pets the Stantler on the head… and then slaps it on the thigh, making it pin up and dash forward, frightened, straight at you! <a href="http://www.serebiiforums.com/showthread.php?380915-Lyanazia-s-Recorded-History/page6&amp;p=10758492#post10758492" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.serebiiforums.com%2Fshowthread.php%3F380915-Lyanazia-s-Recorded-History%2Fpage6%26p%3D10758492%23post10758492&amp;hash=05e37a9dfd9fc25d83db9f3bab952ce5" rel="nofollow noopener">Your body and mind are too numb, too beaten up to react as the beast’s sharp horn pierces you right under the breast, tearing skin, flesh and bone</a>, throwing you to the floor once again… and, with every last ounce of strength escaping your body, the blurry image of your Spiritomb gracing your eyes one last time… you die. <br />
<br />
Slowly, ever so slowly, your eyes begin to part open again. In front of you… a Stantler and a man of shadows stand in the distance. That was quite the tumble; you even lost hold of Teddiursa and Koffing! Your body is taken over by a now familiar fatigue. You get to one knee, then to your feet, and just then, the Stantler dashes toward you, piercing you with its horn; an unbearably sharp pain runs through your body, and you fall down. With your dying breath, you silently call for Reaper’s help, but it doesn’t come…<br />
<br />
You fight hard to get back up, take a deep breath, get to one knee and then back to your feet. The forest, humid, dark and cold, sprawls in front of you. Close by, a lone Stantler enveloped by a veil of darkness, next to the faint outline of a human, catches your eye. You feel so tired, so anxious, but all you can muster when the animal suddenly bolts forward and stabs you with its antler is a gasp, followed by a loud scream of agony as you tumble to the ground, blood gushing from the wound, your life draining away with it…<br />
<br />
The mud tastes indescribably terrible, and the wet feeling against your face is bothersome enough to force you to get back up, first to one knee, then back to your feet. You have to hurry and find the Pokemon you were carrying, or you’ll be caught! But your body, your abdomen in particular, is in so much pain, as if a knife had split it open a hundred times… You fall back down, one hand clutching your rib-cage below the breast, the other closed in a fist as tightly as possible as the pain washes over you. Why does it hurt so much? Not even the otherwise-soothing sight of an oblivious Stantler eases the torment... Suddenly, the deer yelps, scared senseless, and starts galloping toward you. You somehow know what happens next, and again feel completely powerless to stop it; you watch passively as death approaches yet one more time, and will continue to do so over and over again, perhaps forever… This time however, just before impact, you spot a brief glow of light emanating from your closed hand, soon vanishing and being replaced by a… metallic feeling? Before you can dwell on it, the antler pierces your ribs and liver again, and again you fall, lifeless, under the apathetic gaze of your Spiritomb.<br />
<br />
The cold, uncomfortable stinging feeling of rain dropping and trickling down across your face makes you open your eyes. Through some inhuman power, or the sheer force of routine, your body rises, almost on its own, to face the ordeal yet again. The brief moment of silence, of rotten peace, of extreme exhaustion just before the tragedy are almost as unbearable by now as the stab itself. You know you’ll be powerless to stop it, your limbs won’t comply, and all you can do is wonder if this will ever end. But then you remember… Your fist loosens and you open your hand to reveal a tiny metal sphere, black in its entirety save for the cyan neon stripes that cross its surface. A Blue Cyberball… In the midst of your numbness, you recall that you used one such ball to house a Pokemon who’s recently been at your side. Was it really recently, though? How long have you been here, anyway?...<br />
<br />
The cry of terror is heard again. The shadows release the angry Stantler in your direction once more, sharp horns crying for your blood and your life for the hundredth time, the thousandth, you can no longer tell. But can this time be different?<br />
<br />
What will you do?<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
<b>Jess:</b> The noise of the crowd is deafening, a sea of people filled with joy and contentment at the magnificent spectacle being put on in the streets of Fizzytopia. After all, this was the first time Connor’s feats were celebrated, in honour of the eightieth anniversary of his heroic victory that saved all of Fizzy Bubbles. The speeches of both Mayor Thompson and the event’s host, Charles Higginbotham, close friend of the legendary hero, inspired the listeners and filled them with a sense of pride to be Fizzytopians. Your own heart is still racing after your amazing victory at the Hero’s Balloon Game.<br />
<br />
Until suddenly, the cries of happiness turn to terrified screams, and waves upon waves of people start running in every direction, bumping into each other and almost dragging you along. You look in the sky and see the Hero’s Float consumed by flames and losing altitude fast, about to crash on countless bystanders! <a href="http://www.serebiiforums.com/showthread.php?324473-The-Hero-of-Legend-Battle-of-Liberty/page4" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.serebiiforums.com%2Fshowthread.php%3F324473-The-Hero-of-Legend-Battle-of-Liberty%2Fpage4&amp;hash=2c895dc25ef4629d5ba819a673cf850b" rel="nofollow noopener">But as you’re pushed around by the rampaging mob, you lose sight of your beloved Atzu the Azumarill. Filled with a sense of urgency, overtaken by a dark, ominous feeling, you start to panic as you call out to the Water-Type to no avail.</a> Trying to fight your way through the crowd, you try to spot the blue rabbit; shoved, pushed, kicked and bumped into, the ordeal almost proves too much until you finally spot a blue sphere through the masses. Atzu’s tail! You get as close as you can, ducking and dodging, and when you finally reach the Azumarill… the sight makes your stomach turn violently. Atzu isn’t moving, isn’t breathing, his body is covered in bruises and shoe marks. Your beloved partner… is dead.<br />
<br />
A wave of despair, guilt, sheer disbelief washes over you, a mix of dark feelings that would make anyone fall to their knees and cry as loud as they could. But you have no time that, as the terrifying realization sets in that your belt, usually holding your companion’s Pokeballs, is entirely empty… followed by a faint, but unquestionably familiar cry of <i>”Corsola!”</i> It’s Haruki!!<br />
<br />
You rush in the direction of the sound, too concerned to think about anything else by now – you already lost Atzu, you can’t bear to lose anyone else! The cries get weaker and weaker, but as you close in on the origin of the sound, a new, heartbreaking one is clearly audible through the commotion – a snapping, crumbling noise. As you approach Haruki, you lay eyes on the countless fragments of shiny blue coral scattered across the floor, practically trampled to dust, and instinctively turn your gaze away. Tears start welling up, and just then, through the mass of ever-shifting legs to your right, a faint red light glows atop a green helmet… Alice?!<br />
<br />
You run over as fast as the crowd lets you, but the red glow fades shortly before you reach it. By the time you arrive at where Alice was, only her body remains, in a state much like Atzu’s, another gory, soul-crushing sight. Dominated by an overwhelming apathy, you stand motionless as the mob around you continues to panic. One of the many faceless people bumps into you hard, sending you to the floor, only to be stepped on by hundreds of uncaring feet, stomped against the harsh gravel over and over again, with no chance to even try and get back up. Are you… going to end up like all of your Pokemon? Maybe… maybe it’s for the best now… <br />
<br />
You hear a horn in the distance, followed by the unmistakable sound of an engine. The crowd is slowly dispersing by now, but your body is broken, beaten to the limit of its endurance. You can only watch as one of the many electronic equipment vans that were parked next to the parade comes speeding off straight at you, oblivious to your presence; the driver – hardly resembling a human, but rather a… mass of shadows? - probably focused on nothing else except leaving this god-forsaken festival. As the vehicle draws closer and closer at alarming velocity, a brief flash of light glows above your fractured right hand, and is soon replaced by a pristine-white Snow Ball. The presence within is instantly familiar to you even still inside the device…<br />
<br />
What will you do?!</span><br />

<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>Arc_Angel &amp; lilbluecorsola</u>:</u></b> The tension in the room became palpable at the man’s eerie remark. How does he know the two of you? You’ve never met him before in your lives… or have you? Stacey seems to think so, much to Jess's surprise.<br />
<br />
Felicia gladly continues her meal, oblivious to the whole conversation. If there’s any comfort to be had, it’s that at least she’s far from one of her psychotic breaks. Her father, on the other hand, seems strangely unfazed by his apparent slip-up. What if it wasn’t a mistake at all? He takes a sip of his drink, puts down the glass slowly and looks at you with a truly unreadable expression – for the first time since you met him. His eyes land on Stacey, in response to her reassuring words.<br />
<br />
-	Oh, I know love. I wasn’t to blame for any of it… All the while, I’ve been the victim, since I was a child! But now, thanks to you, I can finally be free of it all…<br />
<br />
You exchange a confused glance. A groggy, heavy glance, that is somehow much harder to pull off than such a simple motion should ever be… You feel as if you’ve been awake for two weeks straight, unable to fight the drowsiness. You struggle against the unnatural feeling long enough to see Felicia’s head drop flat on the table, but it’s so hard to fight back… so hard.… so……<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
<b>Jess:</b> The noise of the crowd is deafening, a sea of people filled with joy and contentment at the magnificent spectacle being put on in the streets of Fizzytopia. After all, this was the first time Connor’s feats were celebrated, in honour of the eightieth anniversary of his heroic victory that saved all of Fizzy Bubbles. The speeches of both Mayor Thompson and the event’s host, Charles Higginbotham, close friend of the legendary hero, inspired the listeners and filled them with a sense of pride to be Fizzytopians. Your own heart is still racing after your amazing victory at the Hero’s Balloon Game.<br />
<br />
Until suddenly, the cries of happiness turn to terrified screams, and waves upon waves of people start running in every direction, bumping into each other and almost dragging you along. You look in the sky and see the Hero’s Float consumed by flames and losing altitude fast, about to crash on countless bystanders! <a href="http://www.serebiiforums.com/showthread.php?324473-The-Hero-of-Legend-Battle-of-Liberty/page4" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.serebiiforums.com%2Fshowthread.php%3F324473-The-Hero-of-Legend-Battle-of-Liberty%2Fpage4&amp;hash=2c895dc25ef4629d5ba819a673cf850b" rel="nofollow noopener">But as you’re pushed around by the rampaging mob, you lose sight of your beloved Atzu the Azumarill. Filled with a sense of urgency, overtaken by a dark, ominous feeling, you start to panic as you call out to the Water-Type to no avail.</a> Trying to fight your way through the crowd, you try to spot the blue rabbit; shoved, pushed, kicked and bumped into, the ordeal almost proves too much until you finally spot a blue sphere through the masses. Atzu’s tail! You get as close as you can, ducking and dodging, and when you finally reach the Azumarill… the sight makes your stomach turn violently. Atzu isn’t moving, isn’t breathing, his body is covered in bruises and shoe marks. Your beloved partner… is dead.<br />
<br />
A wave of despair, guilt, sheer disbelief washes over you, a mix of dark feelings that would make anyone fall to their knees and cry as loud as they could. But you have no time that, as the terrifying realization sets in that your belt, usually holding your companion’s Pokeballs, is entirely empty… followed by a faint, but unquestionably familiar cry of <i>”Corsola!”</i> It’s Haruki!!<br />
<br />
You rush in the direction of the sound, too concerned to think about anything else by now – you already lost Atzu, you can’t bear to lose anyone else! The cries get weaker and weaker, but as you close in on the origin of the sound, a new, heartbreaking one is clearly audible through the commotion – a snapping, crumbling noise. As you approach Haruki, you lay eyes on the countless fragments of shiny blue coral scattered across the floor, practically trampled to dust, and instinctively turn your gaze away. Tears start welling up, and just then, through the mass of ever-shifting legs to your right, a faint red light glows atop a green helmet… Alice?!<br />
<br />
You run over as fast as the crowd lets you, but the red glow fades shortly before you reach it. By the time you arrive at where Alice was, only her body remains, in a state much like Atzu’s, another gory, soul-crushing sight. Dominated by an overwhelming apathy, you stand motionless as the mob around you continues to panic. One of the many faceless people bumps into you hard, sending you to the floor, only to be stepped on by hundreds of uncaring feet, stomped against the harsh gravel over and over again, with no chance to even try and get back up. Are you… going to end up like all of your Pokemon? Maybe… maybe it’s for the best now… <br />
<br />
You hear a horn in the distance, followed by the unmistakable sound of an engine. The crowd is slowly dispersing by now, but your body is broken, beaten to the limit of its endurance. You can only watch as one of the many electronic equipment vans that were parked next to the parade comes speeding off straight at you, oblivious to your presence; the driver – hardly resembling a human, but rather a… mass of shadows? - probably focused on nothing else except leaving this god-forsaken festival. As the vehicle draws closer and closer at alarming velocity, a brief flash of light glows above your fractured right hand, and is soon replaced by a pristine-white Snow Ball. The presence within is instantly familiar to you even still inside the device…<br />
<br />
What will you do?!</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: Silver"><span style="font-size: 9px">At Jessica’s prompt, Stacey seemed to recall something as well. The woman’s hand comforted her own, which had been shaking – subconsciously – not just from nerves of speaking first. Though her brain was still in mist (whether willfully or not), her soul could sense a strangeness was amiss. No, not strangeness. A scathing intimacy, scratching at the surface…<br />
<br />
<i>What happened back then wasn't your fault…<br />
<br />
a greater power was at work…<br />
<br />
you ... you shouldn't feel guilty but I wonder why you do?</i><br />
<br />
The man slowly took a sip of his drink, and steeled them with an impregnable expression. As soon as words of cryptic confession left his lips, a deep heaviness took hold of the atmosphere. She tried to turn to Stacey for an explanation, but found such a simple clockwork motion more difficult than expected, as if stoppered by rust. From the corner of fading sight, she felt a flicker of innocence as Felicia’s hair fell onto the cloth, slumped next to a half-finished plate (so close her angel hair almost touched the food). Such pure white couldn’t fight against the dark, succumbing instantly to whatever spell had been cast.<br />
<br />
Having been exposed to many more evils in the past, however, Jess was at least semi-aware of the danger. How blind trust and enchantment leads to hypnotism, especially from those who had seen and lived much longer. So she struggled with all her might to stay awake. The remainder of her strength gripped Stacey’s palm tightly, before slackening. Barely focusing over the other’s shoulder, the last thing Jess saw was the photo on the far wall, with what appeared to be the man in his younger days, and two smiling girls beside him… She was about to open her mouth to ask, probe, plead further, but somnolence forced surrender…<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
She woke to the sound of screams. Of joy, celebration, song and streamers. But then, those screams suddenly turned sour. To fear, panic, sorrow. The float burst into flames, capsizing over the sea of chaos. People swarming, clamoring and climbing over each other to escape. Jess stood still amidst it all, staring straight at the familiar tower of flames that tickled her mind until her memory snapped. Atzu. Where was Atzu?<br />
<br />
She spotted a buoy lost in the ocean, and pushed desperately past the current, pursuing what was perhaps a dream, a figment of her disordered heart. Like the light of an angler fish, a beacon guiding its prey to the beast’s maw. But she didn’t care. She had to save him, before this horribly small world bares its huge fangs…<br />
<br />
But when she reached him, all that remained was a broken and battered body, bruised badly beyond recognition, blue into black. Bereft of breath.<br />
<br />
A dizzying rush of shock and shame and sheer denial, all at once, made her stagger. No, no, not again. This wasn’t how it was supposed to go. But she couldn’t stop, think. For at that moment she realized an emptiness by her side, and a call from the other direction. She plunged toward it, gasping for air. The cry grew weaker and weaker, until…<br />
<br />
<i>Crunch.</i><br />
<br />
Far more than the churning movements of the crowd, the sound sickened her stomach as she reached for the fragments of coral lying at the bottom of the brine, cracked almost completely under pressure into fine dust particles. She swallowed, salt water running from her own eyes as she shifted her gaze from the gruesome scene…<br />
<br />
<i>Just accept it, this is fate<br />
So next, next, next…</i><br />
<br />
Her blurred vision caught the bright glow of a green helmet, glaring red like a traffic signal. A lighthouse warning to steer boats away. But the stricken siren voice was too much to bear, and had the opposite effect of leading sailors astray. So she ran straight to the rocks, where she found Alice in much the same state as Atzu. A tiny twisted form, seeping scarlet onto the street…<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;No, no, I don’t want it to be destroyed…&quot;<br />
There came a world where happiness ends…<br />
<br />
&quot;Madder red, I beg you, please don’t ruin anyone’s future anymore.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
She couldn’t take it anymore. Couldn’t stand to lose anyone else. So she let herself be engulfed by the depths of despair, sinking slowly as others treaded over her, struggling for their own survival. All the time, she kept numbly thinking: <i>This can’t be right. Haruki and Alice weren’t even at the event.</i> But the repeated pain in her own pounding limbs and chest was proof, reminding her that this wasn’t an illusion.<br />
<br />
<i>In this unnatural scene,<br />
The shimmering heat laughed, &quot;This is the real thing!&quot;</i><br />
<br />
No, there was something off about that statement. But she couldn’t process or bring herself to bother. Her friends were dead. And soon she would be too. Just as well, she deserved such punishment for not being able to protect them… Or Stacey... Or anyone...<br />
<br />
She heard a blare, an engine in the distance. A truck came barreling down the road, oblivious to lingering passerby, <s>especially</s> even ones collapsed on the concrete. She couldn’t discern the shadowy profile in the driver’s seat, but it didn’t matter. She didn’t blame them for wanting to escape this carnival of demise, even at the cost of more casualties. As the screeching tires approached, she smiled to herself at the irony while a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPvwla-oLig" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DIPvwla-oLig&amp;hash=310a41d7b9fe398829cfa5e17aecf8cd" rel="nofollow noopener">melody</a> rang in her ears…<br />
<br />
Just then, a warmth – no, cold sparked above her fractured fingers. Something like a smooth stone insinuated between them. She could scarcely crane her neck to perceive the pristine presence against a backdrop of blood, but detected a round weight deposit. Rather than accepting it as the sign of a savior, such a miracle only filled her with further dread. Though she knew that giving up was weakness in itself, she refused to double the sin of suicide by risking another life for hers. She had to save whoever was in there, at least.<br />
<br />
Her first thought was to throw the ball as far as she could, but her wrist could hardly move, let alone her arm. With great reluctance, she finally choked out,<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry.”<br />
<br />
…As she managed to stretch her thumb just enough to press the release button.<br />
<br />
Crimson flooded the boulevard, and a small Snorunt stood directly in the vehicle’s path. Jess tried to shout, tell her to hurry, get out of the way, but her throat wouldn’t produce any noise. She shut her lids, praying for safety.<br />
<br />
<i>Please… Someone help…</i><br />
<br />
Seconds passed, and Jessica gradually dared to peek slightly. To her surprise, the incoming wheels that would’ve crushed her skull were stopped just short a few feet in front of her. In between, Kristen had erected a PROTECTive barrier. Jessica stunned at the size of it; there was no way she could’ve done that by herself, given her low level of skill… For that matter, why was the shield a shade of ruby instead of jade?<br />
<br />
Her questions increased when she heard a soft munching. Squinting, the Snorunt appeared to strangely be snacking on something. What was it? Some kind of crystalline substance…<br />
<br />
Despite the agony it caused her nervous system, Jess sat straight up. No mistaking it, <i>those sapphire shards were pieces of Corsola</i>.<br />
<br />
Her horror intensified when the mineral seemed to meld with the monster consuming it, sprouting horns of similar shine and structure. The fiend licked her lips.<br />
<br />
“Ah, delicious~”<br />
<br />
A chill ran down the girl’s spine as she listened to such a terrifying tone coming from Kristen’s tongue, similar to a snake’s hiss. Her sockets were inflamed, just like that time…<br />
<br />
“Who are you?”<br />
<br />
Jessica whispered. Despite quivering, her query was unexpectedly calm, clear.<br />
<br />
The demon grinned.<br />
<br />
“My name, love, is Lilith. You and your servant kindly awakened me one year ago, and provided me a host to stay in while I regain my powers. For that I suppose I owe you, so I spared your life in addition to this little one’s, insignificant though it may be.”<br />
<br />
She surveyed her surroundings, drinking in the devastation.<br />
<br />
“Ah, such beautiful carnage… It has strengthened me enough so I may speak without need for that silly sketchpad. But still…” She cast a sly, searching look at Jess, as if peering into the trainer’s past. “I wonder what this place truly reflects.”<br />
<br />
Jessica squirmed under scrutiny, and Lilith laughed.<br />
<br />
“I see, you have met one of my minions before. You and this… ‘Haruki’ witnessed her work in the Glacier Islands, correct?”<br />
<br />
Jessica’s brow furrowed. It hurt to contemplate. What was she talking about? (For that matter, exactly whose history was she accessing? Had she somehow absorbed Haruki’s knowledge as well?) Did she mean the Jynx from back then? The name conjured jumbled images of snow and ice and petrified corpses preserved within them. Jess shuddered, having hoped to keep those recollections buried deep, frozen for eternity.<br />
<br />
“Ah, but my protégé’s feats are far from impressive, compared to mine. Allow the master to demonstrate true art.”<br />
<br />
Lilith approached Alice’s limp figure, running her paw along the pale skin, perfect cheekbones. As if playing with a precious doll, she parted the pretty silk strands that hid a glass rose, blooming wide but utterly blank.<br />
<br />
Then, in one swift motion, she snapped Alice’s crown jewel, ripping it directly from the emerald dome. Some liquid spurted out from the temple and splashed across Jessica’s face.<br />
<br />
“Ah… Ah…”<br />
<br />
Lilith giggled as she skipped over to Atzu, swinging the spike with wicked intent as she stabbed it gleefully into his gut. She began to carve carefully outward, stripping the fur from his flesh. When she got to the gullet, she leaned in close, kissing and caressing and nipping at the nape until her lips were completely stained. Jessica could only watch helplessly, bile rising to her own throat.<br />
<br />
<i>Stop. What are you doing? Oh God, why?</i><br />
<br />
The queen lifted her new cape and wrapped it around herself, cackling with delight as she spun, spraying more rosary beads into the air.<br />
<br />
“Well, what do you think? A masterpiece, is it not?”<br />
<br />
Silence.<br />
<br />
“You’re right… It needs one final touch.”<br />
<br />
She flipped the blade around, and without hesitation, impaled it right through her own chest and out the back. Ribbons spilled forth like serpents, twining together to form a circle around her waist. The sash helped bind the hide to her frame, which had grown to the full height of a human child. The pelt itself purposefully stretched to fit, now resembling sleeves and a skirt.<br />
<br />
“Ah, much better. Nowhere near my original magnificence, of course, but this will have to do for now.”<br />
<br />
“…Yours.”<br />
<br />
“Pardon? What did you say, dear? Do speak up. As rightful ruler of the underworld, I shall make a special exception in this case and lend you an ear.”<br />
<br />
“…Not yours.” Excruciatingly, Jess crawled forward, clutching at the hem of the cloak. Atzu’s coat. All that was left of him. “Give it back!” she sobbed.<br />
<br />
Frost crossed Lilith’s countenance as she shook the beggar off. “FOOLISH MORTAL,” she screeched, “IT SEEMS YOU STILL DO NOT KNOW YOUR PLACE.” Flashing with rage, she hovered over the scarred, scared mess as a wintry gale picked up and whipped through the area. A booming wail bellowed in the wind: “PERHAPS I SHALL TEACH YOU A LESSON, SO YOU WILL KNOW TO BOW BEFORE ME…”</span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"><br />

<span style="color: silver"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>Brine Island</i></span><br />
<br />
<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>Arc_Angel &amp; lilbluecorsola</u>:</u></b> The tension in the room became palpable at the man’s eerie remark. How does he know the two of you? You’ve never met him before in your lives… or have you? Stacey seems to think so, much to Jess's surprise.<br />
<br />
Felicia gladly continues her meal, oblivious to the whole conversation. If there’s any comfort to be had, it’s that at least she’s far from one of her psychotic breaks. Her father, on the other hand, seems strangely unfazed by his apparent slip-up. What if it wasn’t a mistake at all? He takes a sip of his drink, puts down the glass slowly and looks at you with a truly unreadable expression – for the first time since you met him. His eyes land on Stacey, in response to her reassuring words.<br />
<br />
-	Oh, I know love. I wasn’t to blame for any of it… All the while, I’ve been the victim, since I was a child! But now, thanks to you, I can finally be free of it all…<br />
<br />
You exchange a confused glance. A groggy, heavy glance, that is somehow much harder to pull off than such a simple motion should ever be… You feel as if you’ve been awake for two weeks straight, unable to fight the drowsiness. You struggle against the unnatural feeling long enough to see Felicia’s head drop flat on the table, but it’s so hard to fight back… so hard.… so……<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
<b>Stacey</b>: You feel exhausted; you’ve been running for so long now, carrying the motionless bodies of a Teddiursa and Koffing in your arms; their weight is beginning to feel unbearable, but you have to keep running, or they’ll catch up to you! The Lyanazia woods are dark, the air is thick with moisture and feels uncomfortably warm as it enters your lungs; the branches and rocks graze your feet and ankles, making you wince in pain, but you have to keep going. You try your best to keep up the pace, until you hit your leg on a soaked block of timber and go flying several feet forward, landing less-than-graciously on the muddy floor of the rainforest.<br />
<br />
Your body aches all over, but you persevere. It’s been too long, too hard, too unbelievable of an adventure to give up now. And they’re depending on you… You get to one knee, then back to your feet, legs wobbly and in pain. You spot a lone Stantler in the distance, a welcome sight amidst the desolation. Next to it however, something unexpected, something amiss… a foreign sight in an otherwise familiar painting. A mass of swirling shadows, at first vaguely and then definitely resembling a tall, slim man, pets the Stantler on the head… and then slaps it on the thigh, making it pin up and dash forward, frightened, straight at you! <a href="http://www.serebiiforums.com/showthread.php?380915-Lyanazia-s-Recorded-History/page6&amp;p=10758492#post10758492" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.serebiiforums.com%2Fshowthread.php%3F380915-Lyanazia-s-Recorded-History%2Fpage6%26p%3D10758492%23post10758492&amp;hash=05e37a9dfd9fc25d83db9f3bab952ce5" rel="nofollow noopener">Your body and mind are too numb, too beaten up to react as the beast’s sharp horn pierces you right under the breast, tearing skin, flesh and bone</a>, throwing you to the floor once again… and, with every last ounce of strength escaping your body, the blurry image of your Spiritomb gracing your eyes one last time… you die. <br />
<br />
Slowly, ever so slowly, your eyes begin to part open again. In front of you… a Stantler and a man of shadows stand in the distance. That was quite the tumble; you even lost hold of Teddiursa and Koffing! Your body is taken over by a now familiar fatigue. You get to one knee, then to your feet, and just then, the Stantler dashes toward you, piercing you with its horn; an unbearably sharp pain runs through your body, and you fall down. With your dying breath, you silently call for Reaper’s help, but it doesn’t come…<br />
<br />
You fight hard to get back up, take a deep breath, get to one knee and then back to your feet. The forest, humid, dark and cold, sprawls in front of you. Close by, a lone Stantler enveloped by a veil of darkness, next to the faint outline of a human, catches your eye. You feel so tired, so anxious, but all you can muster when the animal suddenly bolts forward and stabs you with its antler is a gasp, followed by a loud scream of agony as you tumble to the ground, blood gushing from the wound, your life draining away with it…<br />
<br />
The mud tastes indescribably terrible, and the wet feeling against your face is bothersome enough to force you to get back up, first to one knee, then back to your feet. You have to hurry and find the Pokemon you were carrying, or you’ll be caught! But your body, your abdomen in particular, is in so much pain, as if a knife had split it open a hundred times… You fall back down, one hand clutching your rib-cage below the breast, the other closed in a fist as tightly as possible as the pain washes over you. Why does it hurt so much? Not even the otherwise-soothing sight of an oblivious Stantler eases the torment... Suddenly, the deer yelps, scared senseless, and starts galloping toward you. You somehow know what happens next, and again feel completely powerless to stop it; you watch passively as death approaches yet one more time, and will continue to do so over and over again, perhaps forever… This time however, just before impact, you spot a brief glow of light emanating from your closed hand, soon vanishing and being replaced by a… metallic feeling? Before you can dwell on it, the antler pierces your ribs and liver again, and again you fall, lifeless, under the apathetic gaze of your Spiritomb.<br />
<br />
The cold, uncomfortable stinging feeling of rain dropping and trickling down across your face makes you open your eyes. Through some inhuman power, or the sheer force of routine, your body rises, almost on its own, to face the ordeal yet again. The brief moment of silence, of rotten peace, of extreme exhaustion just before the tragedy are almost as unbearable by now as the stab itself. You know you’ll be powerless to stop it, your limbs won’t comply, and all you can do is wonder if this will ever end. But then you remember… Your fist loosens and you open your hand to reveal a tiny metal sphere, black in its entirety save for the cyan neon stripes that cross its surface. A Blue Cyberball… In the midst of your numbness, you recall that you used one such ball to house a Pokemon who’s recently been at your side. Was it really recently, though? How long have you been here, anyway?...<br />
<br />
The cry of terror is heard again. The shadows release the angry Stantler in your direction once more, sharp horns crying for your blood and your life for the hundredth time, the thousandth, you can no longer tell. But can this time be different?<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">Sorry about the lateness of my reply, been dying to get this out since I got my internet back ^-^<br />
<br />
<span style="color: silver">Stacey needed him to know that what had happened that day wasn't his fault and although it had been hard for both of them it had made her Pokemon stronger. The destruction caused by the beam that struck the city had been catastrophic and she had been injured in the attack but her Pokemon had survived and even her Misdreavus had evolved, beautiful and deadly and along with the other trainers had defeated a wild Rhydon. Felicia seemed oblivious to the tension that her statement had caused and saw that she too had an unreadable expression, it was if she was fighting the emotions bubbling beneath the surface. The response they received was far from what she expected and she turned to Jess frowning in confusion but found that she was struggling to meet her eyes. Stacey suddenly felt all the energy she possessed robbed from her as her eyes nearly closed. She felt a panic grip her chest as she realised that she had been drugged before that dark place in her mind called out to her.<br />
<br />
<i>'You should have known, you can never go anywhere or trust anyone, they will always hurt you'</i>. Stacey saw Felicia, his daughter fall to the table under the same effects and her last thought was for her Golett Dwemer, she mentally begged him to run, to escape her fate as she too collapsed.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
She wasn't waking up, no she was already awake but still so very very tired. She was running, she felt that she had been running for an eternity as her legs felt like lead and and her lungs burnt against the strain of her increased breathing. The forest around her was thick and seemed to reach out for her at every turn. It was so warm, had it always been this warm? Her white shirt had stuck to her chest that was coated with a fine sheen of sweat. In her arms lay Maddie who was only a little Teddiursa and Jericho her wise ass Koffing. She had to keep them safe, she had too ... she went flying as she tripped over a thick branch and sent her Pokemon sliding through the mud. As she picked herself up she wondered why this was all so familiar, had she been here before? Hadn't she already ran as far as she could, protected her Pokemon? As she rose to her knees her body screaming that she remains still, that she rest she saw another familiar sight, a lone Stantler who had locked eyes with her but next to it was something new, something that had not been there before. A shadowy figure stood next to the Stantler petting it on the head before slapping its thigh causing it to rear up and charge right for her. He eyes widened in horror as her mind caught up with the situation a little too late.<br />
<br />
<i>'No ... not again!'</i> she thought as the Stantler dove right into her, its antlers spearing her through her chest, just under her breast tearing through flesh and snapping her bones as if they were twigs. She gasped in shock before the pain hit her like a train. She was sent flying through the air landing on her back, her blood coating the floor of the forest as her last living breaths escaped her torn lungs. She saw the blurry figure of her Spiritomb in the distance and his name escaped her lips as she died.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Suddenly she gasps coughing as if she had the worst chest infection ever, why did she feel so damn tired? And why did her chest hurt so much? Opening her eyes against the mud that clung to them she saw her Teddiursa and Koffing lying on the ground, that was right she had tripped and dropped them, she had to get to them, to make them safe. She rose to one knee and again the figure of the Stantler entered her vision and the shadowy man that stood by its side. It repeated the same action as before and the reindeer charged for her again. She was too tired to move, her brain was already breaking through the fog and begging her to try. The same antlers pierced her chest and tore it apart and she landed with a thud as she gasped in agony and fear. She found her voice this time and screamed Repears name now with her dying breath.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Again the felt her cold wet ground beneath her face and again she made it to her knees before the now terrifying sight of the beast that would kill her again. Why was she reliving this over and over? This had been the worst day of her life, the day of her painful and pointless death and now she had to relive it again and again. The Stantler charges for her again and her eyes show the fear and agony she felt in her heart as she was unable to muster the strength to fight it. It dove into her ripping her body apart and she screamed in pain as she fell back to the earth her blood spilling from her uselessly pumping heart and she begged for it to end, permanently this time. <br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
The mud tasted like tar in her mouth and she spat it out wanting to brush her teeth as she opened her eyes to the forest floor. She pushed off the ground and shivered. Was it cold? She didn't feel cold but she couldn't stop shivering. She managed to get to her feet when an almighty pain ripped through her abdomen and chest knocking her back down to one knee. She gasped trying to fight against it, trying so hard to breathe. Oh God it hurt so bad and why was that Stantler staring at her like that, couldn't it see she was in pain? Suddenly a shadowy figure whacks it hind and it rears forward charging for her. Her eyes widen and fresh tears fall from them.<br />
<br />
<i>'Please let this end, I can't go on like this anymore. Stop hurting me, I ... I can't take it. Let me die, just let me die.'</i> As the pained sob left her lips at the inevitable she saw a flash of white appear in her hand replaced by the feel of cold metal. Before she could look down however she was speared again and her last vision was of Reaper and his uncaring look. She blinked as the tears fell and so did her life.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
The rain stung her face, it was nothing compared to the pain she felt throughout her body but it was enough to wake her up. As if her body was working on autopilot she rose to her knees, her head remaining low as she breathed in oxygen into her damaged lungs. Was there any point in fighting? It was inevitable, even this period of silence before her death was just as painful, the waiting, the awful anticipation. It was never going to end, this was how she was going to spend eternity. What had she done to deserve this? This was Hell and she was trapped here. The silence had felt so much longer this time but her sense of time was so distorted, she didn't even remember how so got here anymore. All she could remember was the pain but something was different, was she imagining it? Her hand was grasped around something round and cold. Her sorrowful eyes turned to see a Blue Cyberball held in her right hand. Was she imagining it? This was ... this was Dwemer's ball! He had been with her recently, or had he? At this time, the first time he hadn't even been born, was this her mind trying to give her hope? She fight her hand tighten on the beautiful object before she looked up to see the Stantler cry out as the shadows send it charging right for her, its antlers pointing forward for her chest. <br />
<br />
'<i>It's real I know it is, it ... it has to be</i>' she said as she shook from fear and adrenaline, as her eyes faced the beast that dashed to end her life. A new emotion entered her heart along with the thin string of hope the metal ball in her hand brought, anger ... no hot burning rage. Her eyes shed tears and the fear was still causing her heart to beat a charging pace but she was furious. She narrowed her eyes at the beast, she didn't blame it the first time it had caused her death and even now a rational part of her mind buried so far under her emotions that the shadows around the beast were causing this but the Stantler was the one who killed her over and over. This rage, this desperation to stay alive was giving her body strength, allowing her to move and with all the strength she possessed she threw the cyberball at the charging Stantler, hoping that as it hit its head it would knock it off course. What she would ask her Pokemon within to do she would regret later but right now all she regretted was no doing this sooner.<br />
<br />
<i>'Dwemer, please help me. I can't die again. Stop the Stantler, end it all ... kill it! <b>Dynamicpunch</b> and <b>Superpower</b>, rip its horns off'</i> she mentally pleaded with him inside his ball before she slumped back completely spent.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver">Stepping off the ferry via plank, Ethan breathed a breath of fresh air, stretching as he did, &quot;Ahhhh!&quot; he yawned, &quot;I can’t believe how long we were on that boat ride, it felt like an eternity.&quot; he whined to his Sableye who was happily grinning, content to be back on the young trainer's left shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;We haven't been able to do much since the last time you were with us..&quot; the man said remembering how not even a week had passed since his Sableye was back home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sab…&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But now that you're back maybe it’s a good sign, a good time to go on an adventure.&quot; Walking down the dock into the city the young man looked around the bustling environment, with its captivating lights and sounds, the different venues all scattered around and different mix of people from the many regions this world had to offer. This place was a bit different from where he grew up, but felt similar to where he ended up moving to in his early twenties. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well Adam is there anything you wish for us to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sab!&quot; the creature pointed at a sign near a Pokémon Center quite excitedly like a child trying to show off something they wanted.<br />
<br />
The sign with 8 different silhouettes of Gym Leaders along with their badges read like this; <b>Do you think you have what it takes to take on the eight gym leaders of Cascadia? Then prove it! Register and take on the challenge today!</b><br />
<br />
A bit corny for Ethan's taste but the message proved effective enough,<br />
<br />
Patting the cave dweller on the head, the young man smiled, &quot;Funny, that's exactly what I was thinking of us doing anyway haha.&quot;<br />

<b>The Silver Forest</b><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>jolteonjak</u>:</b> You realize that outsmarting this team might be difficult – after all, they seem to read each other’s thoughts to the point where talking is no longer required! Thinking that maybe keeping your voice down will make it harder for them to counter your moves, you whisper your instructions to Cyndaquil.<br />
<br />
The fire mouse immediately puts your instructions to use, running quickly around the field to minimize the odds of Excadrill hitting him from below. He dashes toward Baro, trying to spot the Dig hole as he goes, which proves fairly easy given Excadrill’s size. Rushing over to it, Cyndaquil shoots multiple golden stars down the tunnel, certain that the move will hit somewhere down there.<br />
<br />
Just then, the ground shakes, and dangerously close to Cyndaquil emerges his opponent, barely missing him; the Swift attack, however, follows close behind, and scores a direct hit as soon as Excadrill sets his feet on the ground!<br />
Barely hurt given its typing however, the mole Pokémon just grins as it dashes forward and <b>Cut</b>s your partner with its huge claw!<br />
<br />
Trying to shake it off, Cyndaquil shoots a number of blue flaming orbs, attempting Will-o-Wisp. The flames float slowly in the air however, and Excadrill swiftly counters each of them with a pinpoint precision Mud Slap, drowning out each fire before they hit, but none of the Mud Slaps make their way over to Cyndaquil himself either.<br />
<br />
Baro smiles, saying nothing, as his trusty partner begins to glow a bright yellow and the ground beneath shakes and cracks; you’re familiar with the next move… <b>Earth Power</b>!<br />
<br />
How do you counter this?!</span></span>

</blockquote><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: green">Chad watched in horror as it appeared impossible to even scratch Baro and his Excadrill. He knew the Swift attack he ordered wouldn’t cause a lot of damage, but at least he learned that Excadrill was capable of sustaining damage. Meanwhile, Cyndaquil was taking a lot damage.<br />
<br />
He knew if he was going to succeed he would have to surprise Excadrill, as it seemed to be fighting on its own. How could he do this though? The Will-o-Wisp attack was supposed to catch Excadrill off guard, but it didn’t. Excadrill was able to quickly counter the attack with an attack of its own.<br />
<br />
“Stay strong buddy!” he yelled out to the Fire Mouse Pokémon. “I know you can do this!”<br />
<br />
Chad looked all over the battlefield for some clues. He wondered if Cyndaquil should hide in a tree and just shoot fire from the branches. That idea immediately gave him flashbacks to the time Cyndaquil accidentally burnt down part of a forest; and he figured if that happened Baro would show even less mercy. He had already decided not to try and use the holes Excadrill already dug; Excadrill was bound to know a powerful Ground-type attack like Earthquake or Magnitude or…<br />
<br />
Just then Chad witnessed Excadrill beginning to glow a bright yellow. He felt the ground beneath him tremble a bit. He noticed it start to crack. He recognized this attack. His eyes instantly bugged out in astonishment, it’s Earth Power!<br />
<br />
“<b>FLAMETHROWER</b>! On the ground! Get in the air now!” Chad yelled out as loud and quickly as he could. He hoped it would be enough time for Cyndaquil react to avoid taking too much damage from the Ground- and Steel-type’s latest attack by using the Flamethrower as propulsion to get some height. ‘Steel-type, yes, Excadrill is part Steel,’ Chad thought to himself. ‘If I play my cards right, maybe I <i>can</i> surprise Excadrill!’ “Then on the way down, surround yourself with <b>Swift</b>! I know that won’t damage it a lot, but it’ll still take damage.”<br />
<br />
Chad decided to use this time he hopefully bought to make sure he understood the details of his new plan. Now it was up to Excadrill to do fall into his trap.<br />
</span></span><br />

OOCA: (A = Again) For sake of continuity, Cyndaquil doesn’t have the Fire Ball I put him in from 2013’s Fizzby Birthday celebration.<br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">“We’re here!” announced Karmas in a sing song voice as he stepped off the ferry.<br />
<br />
The trainer took in the Lake, a large smile on his face. It felt like it had been forever since he had left his base, and he had forgotten how good it felt. Karmas didn’t even get to take three steps before something slammed into this neck, wrapping its arms around his neck and sending him falling to the ground. <br />
<br />
“Thanks Claptrap,” muttered Karmas, picking himself up.<br />
<br />
The Carnivine let out a chuckle, and propped his head atop of Karmas’, almost like a rudimentary hat. Everyday Karmas regretted letting Claptrap watch a certain show that involved a grass type latching onto its owner’s head. At least Claptrap didn’t use his mouth.<br />
<br />
“So where do we want to go first?” asked Karmas.<br />
<br />
Claptrap loosened one of his arms and pointed right at the lake. “So you want to go to the shores of the lake?” He shook his head. “Something on the other side of the lake?” Once again, the Carnvine shook his head. “You do know that the water is electrified right?” Nothing. “Yeah, neither of us would last very long in there.” Claptrap pointed at the lake again in a more insistent fashion. “Fine then, we’ll go and check out the lake, but we aren’t going to be actually going into the lake!”<br />
<br />
Claptrap didn’t say anything; instead he gave his trainer a large goofy smile which Karmas took as a sign that he agreed with Karmas’ decision. With that in mind, the trainer started walking, ready for anything.<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>jolteonjak</u>:</u></b> <i>((Welcome back JJ, and congrats on graduating from the AR! ^^))</i><br />
<br />
Baro and Excadrill again prove they are a formidable pair, effectively countering your strategies at every turn. You scramble your head for a way to surprise the seemingly omniscient opponents, but the pressure isn’t helping. Excadrill is about to unleash a deadly Earth Power that will definitely leave a dent in your tiny Cyndaquil, possibly knock him out clean!<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a memory springs up. A forest fire caused by you and Cyndaquil in a previous adventure, reminding you that using the woods for cover would only further infuriate the already fuming Baro… but that didn’t mean you couldn’t use fire <i>at all</i>!<br />
<br />
The Fire Mouse’s expression lights up the second your orders reach his ears. It’s a risky tactic, but it’s all you have to go on! You can only hope that Cyndaquil’s already strong enough to propel his own body upwards with his Flamethrower… otherwise he’s a sitting duck! The Fire-Type arcs his head back and unleashes a massive stream of flames against the ground directly beneath it. For a while, nothing happens, and the floor starts to crack and crumble as Excadrill finishes charging up… Just as you’re about to lose all hope, Cyndaquil’s body is suddenly propelled upwards by the fire pillar, narrowly dodging five deadly earthen spike that sprout moments later from the rocky soil! You did it!<br />
<br />
Baro looks shocked for the first time in the entire match, watching in disbelief as Cyndaquil reaches an incredible height. High up in the air, he takes aim and dives down, homing in on the foe who is still stunned for missing. Golden stars surround the mouse’s body, and explode on contact immediately after Cyndaquil lands hard on top of Excadrill’s head!<br />
<br />
-	It… can’t be!<br />
<br />
You realize why Baro looks so shocked: Excadrill begins to flail its head incessantly, looking to drive its iron horn into Cyndaquil, but somehow the tiny Fire-Type is… holding on to the mole’s head! The more Excadrill struggles, the harder Cyndaquil tries to keep its grasp, knowing that the consequences will be terrible if he falls off and tumbles right in front of the massive opponent!<br />
<br />
You have effectively closed the distance between Cyndaquil and his foe, surprising both Baro and Excadrill into temporary confusion. You need to find a way to capitalize before the Ground-Type shoves your partner off, because it <i>will</i> pummel Cyndaquil into a pulp the second it falls to the ground!<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span><br />

<br />
<b>Jess:</b> The rise of Lilith, queen of ice and blood, represents as much of a danger as your previous predicament; even though the demonic Froslass effectively saved you from the incoming truck, her fury now promises unimaginable degrees of pain that make being ran over seem like the better scenario after all…<br />
<br />
For a while, it seems only you and Lilith remain in the entire festival. It’s as if her powers are altering this reality, which doesn’t seem all that real to begin with; in a fraction of second, the raucous crowd can no longer be heard; there are no more screams, crying children, not one more foot meets your broken body lying on the floor. The only thing that can be heard and felt is the bone-chilling wind; there is only fear, pain and cold, so much cold… The gale turns into a full-on hailstorm, ice crystals pelting your skin relentlessly, mercilessly; Lilith floats above you, blinded by otherworldly rage, and countless icicles take shape and hover around the Froslass, their sharp edges pointing directly at you…<br />
<br />
Suddenly, <i>everything</i> turns white. A powerful flash of light fills the entire area, and afterwards, an indescribable feeling of peace washes over you, easing your pain, somehow putting your mind at rest despite everything you just witnessed. Even with this intense radiance, for some reason you aren’t blinded and your eyes have no difficulty adjusting to the clarity; you watch as Lilith screeches and her body returns to red plasma before being forced back into Kristen’s Snow Ball. And when the light finally subsides, you find yourself inexplicably healed and strong enough to stand back up.<br />
<br />
The streets are still empty. Whether this is still a side effect of Lilith’s outburst or another manifestation of the light’s magic you can’t tell, but one thing you’re sure of – Alice, Haruki and Atzu’s corpses are nowhere to be found, not a trace of blood on the gravel either. You instinctively look at the truck that Kristen stopped, only to find the driver’s seat equally empty. And just then a soothing, feminine, almost musical voice is heard from <i>above</i>; you immediately look up and stand in awe of what you see – the figure of a woman completely covered in the same white light that banished Lilith before, floating in the sky like an angel.<br />
<br />
<i>Pay heed to the silent tale<br />
Of two girls by blood unbound;<br />
Understand this song of pain<br />
So one day may truth be found.<br />
<br />
Just like sisters, closest friends<br />
No parents to call their own<br />
Grew together in an orphanage<br />
Doomed to always be alone.</i><br />
<br />
You have strong suspicions as to who the woman of light is referring. The “angel” floats down until her feet are mere inches above the ground, directly in front of you, and resumes her poem.<br />
<br />
<i>One day came a kind old man<br />
When one was five, the other three;<br />
He offered to take them home<br />
Both were happy as could be.<br />
<br />
So began this tale of three<br />
A family of make-believe<br />
Though he gave them all his love<br />
One more thing he sought to give…</i><br />
<br />
The woman takes your hand in hers. It feels warm to the touch, especially after Lilith’s cold onslaught. She presses something against your open palm and closes your hand afterwards, uttering two final words before vanishing into nothingness.<br />
<br />
<i>Save her…</i><br />
<br />
After the apparition is gone, you open your hand again – in it is a similarly unremarkable <b>1x Green Feather</b>. Just then, you start to feel light-headed again, just like you did before finding yourself at the festival, and before you know it, you pass out…<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
<b>Stacey:</b> Utter desperation begins to set in at the millionth death you experience. Your mind starts to cave in, and just as you’re about to give up and accept your eternal fate, a glimmer of hope materializes in the palm of your hand. Realizing that the presence within may be your only hope of breaking the cycle – regardless of what must happen to Stantler to do so -, you hurl the Blue Cyberball straight at the incoming deer with the very last of your strengths. Your eyes follow the sphere’s path and watch as it collides with one of Stantler’s horns, temporarily staggering it and forcing the device open. From inside hops Dwemer, silent and resolute like always, and stoically stands between you and the quadruped who is about to resume its charge.<br />
<br />
The golem’s eyes narrow upon entering the battlefield, ready to carry out your gruesome orders without a hint of hesitation. It waits until the beast is in range and unleashes a vicious Dynamic Punch that stops Stantler dead in its tracks, completely halting its movement and almost knocking it out clean! Dazed beyond hope, the deer wobbles and looks around lost in confusion, but Dwemer’s not done with it… Grabbing the beast by the antlers, it <i>lifts the creature off the ground</i> and starts to pull, harder and harder, hoisting the victim helplessly in the air… until a loud <i>crack</i> echoes throughout the forest when the Pokemon’s horns are ripped from its skull! A crimson shower covers the heartless Ghost-Type as it releases the dead Stantler, throwing its carcass to the floor and leaving it in a pool of its own blood.<br />
<br />
For the first time in what feels like years, you lay on the ground unharmed; the sharp, unforgiving edge of those cruel horns didn’t pierce you, and never will again. Dwemer walks over to you and tries to help you back to your feet, but you’re too tired … Just then, a flash of light covers the forest, and everything around you – Dwemer, Reaper, Stantler’s body – disappears in an instant. There is only you and the light that washes over your body, somehow relieving you of all pain and fatigue… you find yourself able to get back up and do so; looking up, the figure of a woman covered in that same light stands in front of you. Her radiance is intense but you don’t feel the need to so much as cover your eyes; the light is strong enough that you can’t see the woman’s features, but at the same time it doesn’t blind you…<br />
<br />
The woman of light floats barely above the ground, and recites a poem in the most delicate, melodic voice you ever heard.<br />
<br />
<i>Once a happy, carefree man<br />
Darkness came and changed it all;<br />
At the hands of that foul beast<br />
One by one he watched them fall.<br />
<br />
Parents, scientists, all would die<br />
On the Glacier Isle that day.<br />
So did all others who tried<br />
Such evil they could not slay.</i><br />
<br />
She floats over to you, takes your hand in hers and presses something against your palm.<br />
<br />
<i>Heatran, Raikou, Articuno<br />
And the man who owned the three<br />
The hero of Fizzytopia<br />
Soon arrived to set him free.<br />
<br />
And although his life was saved<br />
Darkest dreams began to rise<br />
Overtime his mind collapsed<br />
So began the man’s demise…</i><br />
<br />
The brightness begins to fade, and soon the forest is back to the way it was before; Dwemer stands by your side, looking at you with what you assume is concern. The woman disappears along with the light, leaving you with a final message:<br />
<br />
<i>Save him…</i><br />
<br />
You look at what she gave you; as it turns out, it’s nothing more than a simple <b>1x Green Feather</b>… what is the meaning of all this? You ponder on the woman’s words and remember your previous assumption. This poem… who was she talking about? Was it really the mayor of Fizzytopia… or someone else?<br />
<br />
Just as you begin to dwell on the matter, a sudden feeling of drowsiness overpowers you, much like the one that your felt before you wound up here. Strength leaves your body once again and is replaced by an intense need to sleep; you fall back and your eyes close…<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
<b>Jess:</b> A sprawling plains appears before your eyes. The strong sunlight forces you to squint and cover your eyes. There’s a delicate scent of grass and flowers in the air, in a scene that seems to be the antithesis of the Festival’s disaster. Remembering the previous events, your fingers immediately reach for your belt and feel the ice-cold touch of metal; for better or worse, the Snow Ball is still in your possession…<br />
<br />
-	You’re here! Hey, I didn’t know you could enter this place! But I’m so glad you came along Jess!<br />
<br />
The unmistakable voice of Felicia, brimming with happiness, comes from a nearby pond. You look over to find the young girl waving; but she isn’t wearing the same clothes as before…<br />
Her body is covered by an elegant white, sleeveless dress that reaches the floor, revealing only a pair of crystal slippers. She wears a silver necklace around her neck, adorned with a large blue gem; in each wrist is a bracelet featuring a similar gem, as is the delicate tiara placed on her head. Her hair, worked into an elaborate style of intertwined braids, complements the picture and is held in place by a platinum hairpin with another blue stone. She looks just like a princess out of a fairytale…<br />
<br />
Your eyes then immediately shift to the figure standing next to her. A familiar one, though you couldn’t describe it even if you wanted to... The truck driver, an ever-shifting mass of shadows, whose shape vaguely resembles that of a tall man, towers next to Felicia. One of its ethereal “hands” rests on the girl’s shoulders, who doesn’t seem to mind at all…<br />
<br />
-	The Shadow Man told me you brought Star Girl along! But you know, I don’t think he likes her very much… Didn’t you say they liked each other?<br />
<br />
She shrugs and kneels down by the lake, amused by a couple of Tympole swimming within. She then seems to remember something, turns to you with a frown and her voice swells with emotion.<br />
<br />
-	Serena used to come here to play, but today she didn’t… You showed up instead… What did you do to Serena? Is she mad at me? Did Star Girl harm her?! Say… do you like princesses?<br />
<br />
The last question is again asked in a jovial tone; you’ve gotten used to her mood swings by now, but this time she seems to be going somewhere with this…<br />
<br />
-	Serena and I used to pretend we were princesses all the time. We would dress up and hide from the bad witch until a prince came to save us… But you’re no prince, and you made Serena vanish… so are you the witch? You’re not wearing rags like one, and your nose isn’t the right size either…<br />
<br />
The Shadow Man suddenly dissolves into a swirling mass of darkness and envelops the girl shortly before vanishing entirely. Felicia’s eyes turn black and her voice changes slightly.<br />
<br />
-	Her favourite colour was blue, she always wore blue jewelry like this when she pretended to be a princess; her favourite Pokemon was also blue… do you know what she hated? <i>Red</i>.<br />
<br />
Just as the last word rolls off her tongue, darkness erupts from the ground and begins to take form; a moment later, a massive Magmortar grins and aims its arm cannon straight at you while shadows dance around its body. Felicia focuses her attention on the lake, again fascinated by the Pokemon inside, while muttering to herself.<br />
<br />
-	Red made her cry… everyone should be scared of red. Red burns… <br />
<br />
The Fire-Type looks ready to strike as its twisted smile widens… quick, what do you do?!<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
<b>Stacey:</b> Stone walls rise all around you, impenetrable and inescapable, forming a square area of considerable length. There’s a fine layer of sand beneath your feet, and dust kicks up when you walk. Empty wooden stands can be spotted to your right, and the whole place is in silence save for the rhythmic sound of metal against metal. Your hand instinctively reaches down to your belt… thankfully, the Cyberball is still there.<br />
<br />
Initially, you thought you were all alone. But it’s evident that you’re not; looking over to the source of the noise, you find someone clad in a suit of armour swinging a two-handed sword against a mannequin in chainmail. The knight stops as he too becomes aware of your presence; he turns to face you and removes his helmet, revealing… Felicia’s father?!<br />
<br />
-	Stacey! How kind of you to join me. I must apologize for the awkward meal…<br />
<br />
You expect him to elaborate, but instead he simply resumes his practice, striking the mannequin repeatedly with his claymore.<br />
<br />
-	How wonderful it must be to be called a hero, no? You should know the feeling, given your widespread reputation… I wouldn’t know, of course. I never did much of anything noteworthy, save for a speech or two… I fashion myself more of a survivor, but if I am so, it’s because of <i>others</i> who were destined to be heroes. Meant for greatness, public recognition and the unconditional love of the masses…<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the mannequin’s chainmail shatters into a million pieces, and the practice doll itself begins to dissolve and spill to the ground as a viscous mass of darkness. Then, spinning and rising, the shadows take the shape of a man, who bows before the old man as if he were a king.<br />
<br />
-	The world of today lacks real heroes, Stacey. Do you fashion yourself a <i>real</i> hero? How many lives have you ever saved? I’ve met true heroes myself, and they were nothing like you… They could defeat any danger, any creature, no matter how… <i>Evil</i>.<br />
<br />
The last word echoes across the arena in a completely different voice, booming with overwhelming malice. The shadow Man vanishes into the ground, and darkness sprouts back up only a couple of feet from where you stand; the shadows swirl and dance, until they give form… to a terrifying Hydreigon!<br />
<br />
Felicia’s father again resumes practicing his swordplay, nonchalantly talking to himself while he does so.<br />
<br />
-	Only true heroes can conquer evil… he was a true hero, wasn’t he? Oh yes he was…<br />
<br />
The three-headed behemoth roars as it lays eyes on you; it spreads its wings and takes to the skies, then begins to dive down straight at you! Quick, what do you do?!</span><br />

<br />
The streets were crowded, noisy and lively. You wonder whether Salin City is always like this way in the morning or if the upcoming Gym leader Challenge is what has everyone buzzing. The local Gym is famous for its unique system, in which a different Leader from one of the eight Islands takes on challengers for a period of time, before leaving and giving place to another Leader. This event however, seems to be different... Adam appears to be excited to take part, so the two of you approach one of the large publicity signs.<br />
<br />
-	Taken an interest in the Grand Farewell, did you? Always nice to see young blood keep up with these traditions!<br />
<br />
You immediately turn around, startled by the elderly voice behind you. You lock eyes with a tall, familiar-looking old man with a receding hairline and a pair of sunglasses, though you can’t quite pinpoint his identity. He smiles at you, points to the sign and clears his throat, immediately giving away who he is.<br />
<br />
-	Yo! Champ in the making! I see you’re interested in taking this Gym Challenge! Allow me to explain! Heh, it’s been a while since I’ve done this…<br />
<br />
Clyde adjusts his sunglasses and places a fingertip over the old man featured in the promotional poster.<br />
<br />
-	This man here is the single greatest Trainer in all of Fizzy Bubbles – the Champion, Gottfried! And this tournament, the Grand Farewell, is being held in honour of his retirement!<br />
<br />
You take a better look at the picture. The man seems taller than most people, broad-shouldered, imposing. He is bald and sports a long, impressive white beard; his eyes are sky blue and frowning seems to be the only expression he can muster if he didn’t even try to smile for the photo. All in all, he commands respect with his look alone.<br />
<br />
-	Gym Leaders from all over Cascadia were invited to the ceremony, and decided to pay homage to Gottfried by hosting this competition! Only the best Trainers are selected to take part in the exhibition, which starts tomorrow! Incidentally, today’s the last day of registration, so let me show you to the arena.<br />
<br />
Clyde takes off, closely followed by an excited Adam; you figure you might as well go after them… <br />
After a while of braving the sea of people that fills the streets of Salin City, you finally catch up to the older man, who points to a massive, circular building nearby<br />
<br />
-	This is the Salin Colosseum, where the Grand Farewell will take place starting tomorrow! I reckon it’s almost closing time, but if you make a run for it you might still make it in time to register! I look forward to seeing your performance from the stands. Good luck to you… and this is from me!<br />
<br />
He opens the leather suitcase he’s been carrying and pulls a bottle from inside. He hands you

<b>1x Fresh Water</b> in vintage Clyde-fashion, and shakes your hand before turning around and disappearing into the crowd. Adam pokes your leg and urges you to hurry up, or you’ll miss your chance to enter!<br />
<br />
As you approach the building, a large number of people are making their way out of the Colosseum, most of them silent, and all looking disappointed. You wonder why everyone seems so disheartened when such an exciting event is about to take place…<br />
You finally make it to the entrance and step inside. A security guard points you to the reception, grumpily telling you it’ll close in five minutes. You walk up to the counter, where a young woman tries her best to force a smile – it’s evident she’s exhausted, who knows how many people she had to register today?<br />
<br />
-	Welcome sir! Here to register for the Grand Farewell Tournament? This is a momentous occasion, so only the very best Trainers are allowed to sign up. To be honest, not a single person today has met the necessary requirements, so please don’t be discouraged if you’re not accepted! Please understand, only the best of the best are allowed to perform for the Champion.<br />
<br />
She pulls out a registration form from a drawer and places it on the counter. She clears her throat and declares the conditions for entering like an automaton – she’s been at this all day, after all.<br />
<br />
-	Applicants must meet the following requirements: an active party of six Pokemon at level 70 or above; one each of Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced and Expert Battle Trophies; and one Regional League participation diploma. Please display all of these to proceed with registration, otherwise we regr…<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a phone starts to ring. The woman apologizes, picks up her cellphone and the look on her face changes suddenly.<br />
<br />
-	B-but sir… But protocol… y-yes. Yes, I understand.<br />
<br />
She puts the phone down, clears her throat again and puts on a fake smile once more.<br />
<br />
-	A-apologies, I… misread the document. This was for a different competition. The, uhh… the applicant must meet the following requirements: an active party of six Pokemon at any level and an official Pokedex.<br />
<br />
You can’t help but notice the alarming changes to the regulation, but can’t say you aren’t pleased with the modifications. The woman reads the rest of the rules in a tired voice.<br />
<br />
-	Each Pokemon is allowed to carry one Held Item, and the Trainer is allowed the use of up to 2 items from their Bag during each battle. Battles will be Singles Matches on Leader-selected Arenas, with each Trainer using 3 Pokemon; the challenger is allowed to switch, while the Gym Leader is not.<br />
There will be one match each morning and each afternoon until either the challenger loses or defeats all eight Leaders over the course of 4 days. The challenger is allowed to select which 3 Pokemon to use from the 6 registered one hour before each match. Now, please select your six Pokemon and present your Pokedex to proceed with the registration…<br />
<br />
The six partners you choose will carry you through the whole tournament, with no access to a PC to switch between battles… who will you pick?</span></span> <br />

<br />
Claptrap’s insistence pays off – despite your warnings, the Carnivine wanted to see the lake, so see the lake you shall.<br />
<br />
… or so you thought.<br />
<br />
As you begin to approach Storm Lake, a tourist spot famous for the electrified pond shaped like a crescent moon, you realize something is amiss – there aren’t nearly as many people as you would have expected; in fact, the whole area seems to be… sealed off?<br />
Red and white plastic tape surrounds the entire area, forbidding access past a certain point. You try to find out the reason, but as soon as you get near the tape to take a better look beyond, someone grabs your shoulder, making Claptrap bare his fangs.<br />
<br />
-	In case it’s not perfectly clear, this is a restricted area. As a matter of public safety, I must insist that you turn back.<br />
<br />
You face the person who approached you to find it’s a tall man wearing a black POLT uniform – the “Public Order League Trainers” that are called upon to handle complicated Pokemon-related incidents. Claptrap seems annoyed as it turns uncomfortably on your head… What is this all about?<br />
Suddenly, a flash of light fills the area ever-so-briefly, reminding you of a lightning bolt filling the skies, except… there isn’t so much as a single cloud in sight. You turn to the lake again; now that you’re close enough, you can spot a <i>very</i> large number of shapes lining the pond’s margins – you can’t quite make out what they are in the distance, but are those Pokemon? <i>All</i> of those?!<br />
<br />
-	Sir, I won't repeat myself. Turn around and leave, I’m sure there are adventures to be had elsewhere on the Island. If you resist, I’ll have to arrest you.<br />
<br />
You’re reminded that these aren’t your run-of-the-mill police officers; POLT are known for their extreme effectiveness in maintaining public peace, and are considered the ultimate line of defense in Pokemon-related catastrophes. Maybe getting on this man’s bad side is ill-advised, but you can’t help but wonder what’s going on here…<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span><br />

<b><u>The SS Leviathan Shipwreck</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>CyberBlastoise</u>:</u></b> <i>((I made it a point to tell you that Lumineon doesn’t know Dive, and won’t be able to keep up with your character or Carvanha; it says so on the Intro Post: without Dive you can’t access the deeper parts of the Shipwreck, and I can’t overlook that.))</i><br />
<br />
You decide that staying where you are is the only thing you <i>can’t</i> do. Thinking quickly, you realize you won’t be able to take on such a huge flock on such disadvantageous terrain, and so the only thing left to do is sound the retreat. Gearing up, you almost instinctively aim for the SS Leviathan; it’s the only landmark that may provide shelter for miles around, at least the underwater portion of the ship… You can worry about the legal issues after you survive.<br />
<br />
You instruct Savage and Swift to follow you as you dive down and toward the shipwreck. You can’t afford to stay behind and keep an eye on the two Water-Types, but you know they’ll follow your instructions to the best of their abilities, so now it’s every man and ‘mon for himself.<br />
<br />
With renewed confidence, you dive down as deep as you can, the scuba gear fulfilling its role to perfection; you move through the ocean almost effortlessly, swimming towards the wreckage of the once-imposing Leviathan. The Wingull are now far behind (and above), whereas the famous treasure is now close ahead – that’s two birds with one stone, pun intended, so in a way you can’t help but feel thankful for the seagull attack that drove away the Coastal Guard.<br />
<br />
After a few more minutes of swimming down, you finally reach the sunken ship. The wood is broken and in a considerably state of decay, with several breaches across the hull: just what you were looking for. You search for a gap large enough to fit through, and sure enough, you find one! You slide through the crack, carefully so as not to get stuck because of the oxygen bottle on your back, and pull yourself inside the ship. Looking up, you can see an eerie glow not far above, which means the surface is just up ahead! You flap your legs vigorously in one last effort, and you finally make it out of the water.<br />
<br />
Breathing a sigh of relief, you remove the headgear and breathe in. The air is stale, humid and strangely warm… You look around and realize you must have come up from a crack on the deck’s floor; you reach for the wooden planks and pull yourself up and out of the water entirely, sitting on the floor for a few moments of well-deserved rest. The break will also give you some time to think about your next course of action; as soon as Savage and Swift catch up to you, why not explore the ship while you’re already here? It was the original purpose of your journey to Cascadia, after all…<br />
<br />
Just then, ripples form on the water surface from where you came, and shortly afterwards two sharp-edged yellow fins emerge… It’s Savage! But what about… oh no.<br />
<br />
The rest of Savage’s body surfaces as well, and the Carvanha worriedly looks at you while revealing to be carrying something in its fangs… it’s Swift!!<br />
You hurriedly bend over to pick up the Lumineon, who is unconscious and bleeding from several cuts all across its body. You lack the communication skills to ask Savage what happened, but the fact that the Carvanha is unharmed provides the answer: Swift failed to follow the two of you down towards the Shipwreck because it couldn’t Dive, and the flock caught up to him… Savage probably went back for his friend, and it’s the only reason why Swift is still alive- if just barely!<br />
<br />
What could have been a leisurely stroll around the ship in search of long-lost treasure just took a turn for the worse, and you can’t help but feel guilty over what happened to Swift. It’s time to reassess the situation… Will you press onwards in your exploration in hopes of finding something to nurse the Lumineon back to health? Do you have something on you at the moment that might relieve its pain? You realize the unlikelihood of finding medicine untouched by either time or saltwater in here, but on the other hand, your only remaining option is to backtrack all the way to a Pokémon Center, and that would mean running into that deadly flock of Wingull waiting for you outside again...<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span>

Swimming as quickly as he could, Bill tried to get away from the flocking Wingull. Whatever was happening, it was clear that they were agitated by something or other. Bill was the slowest swimmer of the three, so he expected that the Wingull would more flock to him than any of his compatriots, for now they would more than likely be safe. After all, these are just wild Wingull between him and two natural-borne fish of the sea he'd obviously be the slowest, hopefully he could dive deep enough before getting too many bruises from these things. All he had to do was concentrate on the task at hand, swimming for the wreckage. Unlike the other two, he could not afford to just swim around in misdirection, he had to make a beeline for it and quick.<br />
<br />
Eventually, he reached the ship itself, but unfortunately, there was no entrance at his level, at least not one that he could feasibly fit through. He had to quickly go up or down to find some way in, and considering the fact that the Wingull were waiting for them upwards, the best chance he had was to swim down first and surface once inside <i>The Leviathan</i>. At least, the Wingull indirectly helped him with getting to the ship and thus the ever elusive treasure. Soon, he found his ticket in, a large breach in the hull of the ship. Hopefully this wouldn't lead to a dead end, both literally and figuratively. He turned to see if his Pokemon had made it safely, but he was more surprised by the fact that none of the Wingull seemed to have followed him. Still, it's probably best not to press his luck. He entered into the ship, hoping that both of the fish-Pokemon had found or, knowing Savage, made their own entrance.<br />
<br />
He noticed a bright glow appearing above him, that typically meant one thing, surface. He swam upward towards the light. The closer he got, the more excited he got. He swam faster and faster until he finally reached the destination, an air pocket in the ship, or perhaps this is above the water level, he didn't keep track over how high he swam. He found himself in some room within the ship at any rate. Finding a nearby plank attached to the floor of the room, the trainer hefted himself onto the dry land. He did, he finally did it. Though he was feeling tired, he hadn't swam that fast in a long time. He lay next to the hole, after all unlike him his Pokemon couldn't walk on land and that meant that after everything had calmed down, he needed to reunite with them. His eyes were cast on the sea below him, when he noticed something surfacing out of the water. Alarmed, he quickly sprang to his feet until he noticed it was Savage. That was one Pokemon...but then he noticed what was in Savage's mouth, a blue butterfly fish, aka Swift. The blue pokemon was battered, scratched, and bleeding from several places. This was bad, really bad. And to make matters worse, he hadn't prepared for this type of beating. Potions alone probably wouldn't help much. He did have something that might help in the meantime. His gear came with a bag that he carried all his stuff in, and with it was a First-aid kit. It couldn't cure everything that happened to Swift, but it could definitely help. He packed this more in preparation for himself because of how dangerous his explorations tend to be.<br />
<br />
It seemed like that Swift was caught up by the Wingull, he cursed his luck. It looks like they decided to go after the strongest looking in the group and attack it simultaneously. One or two might not be a lot, but damage does add up quickly and this is the result. He hefted Swift onto the surface. &quot;You did good, Savage. Return.&quot; He had his Pokeball recall the piranha Pokemon back into its ball. Pulling out the kit, he grabbed some bandages to help close up the wounds and stop the bleeding. He had some disinfectant, but this could only stop future infections, not cure wounds, like Potions. Still this solution was temporary at best and with those Wingull out there, he had been trapped.<br />
<br />
That meant that he couldn't get to the Pokemon center in this way. The only thing he could do is go is explore the ship. Then again, if he made it to the other side of it, the Wingull most likely wouldn't have flocked on that side unless there were guards positioned there too. Still, there is a chance to escape and get to the Pokemon center to help Swift without drawing too much attention. He'd worry about getting revenge later. After bandaging up Swift, he clasped his hand in a prayer. &quot;Goddess of the Ocean of Mystery. I don't know if you can hear me, but if you can, your knight is in grave danger. Please, I ask...no beg that you keep him and me safe until I can get him the help he needs.&quot; After his prayer, he recalled it to the Pokeball. The treasure would have to wait till later, he had a friend to save.<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>PikaGod</u>:</u></b> <i>((Welcome back PG! Please reply in “yellow”.))</i><br />
<br />
Claptrap’s insistence pays off – despite your warnings, the Carnivine wanted to see the lake, so see the lake you shall.<br />
<br />
… or so you thought.<br />
<br />
As you begin to approach Storm Lake, a tourist spot famous for the electrified pond shaped like a crescent moon, you realize something is amiss – there aren’t nearly as many people as you would have expected; in fact, the whole area seems to be… sealed off?<br />
Red and white plastic tape surrounds the entire area, forbidding access past a certain point. You try to find out the reason, but as soon as you get near the tape to take a better look beyond, someone grabs your shoulder, making Claptrap bare his fangs.<br />
<br />
- In case it’s not perfectly clear, this is a restricted area. As a matter of public safety, I must insist that you turn back.<br />
<br />
You face the person who approached you to find it’s a tall man wearing a black POLT uniform – the “Public Order League Trainers” that are called upon to handle complicated Pokemon-related incidents. Claptrap seems annoyed as it turns uncomfortably on your head… What is this all about?<br />
Suddenly, a flash of light fills the area ever-so-briefly, reminding you of a lightning bolt filling the skies, except… there isn’t so much as a single cloud in sight. You turn to the lake again; now that you’re close enough, you can spot a <i>very</i> large number of shapes lining the pond’s margins – you can’t quite make out what they are in the distance, but are those Pokemon? <i>All</i> of those?!<br />
<br />
- Sir, I won't repeat myself. Turn around and leave, I’m sure there are adventures to be had elsewhere on the Island. If you resist, I’ll have to arrest you.<br />
<br />
You’re reminded that these aren’t your run-of-the-mill police officers; POLT are known for their extreme effectiveness in maintaining public peace, and are considered the ultimate line of defense in Pokemon-related catastrophes. Maybe getting on this man’s bad side is ill-advised, but you can’t help but wonder what’s going on here…<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #ffff00">As Karmas and Claptrap walked, well Karmas walked and Claptrap hung onto Karmas, over to the Lake, they soon both realised that there was something not quite right. The area was pretty sparse, which a tourist spot shouldn't be.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's going on here?&quot; whispered Karmas as he realised that the area was actually taped off.<br />
<br />
Claptrap let out a groan of disappointment as he urged his trainer to go on, after all he wanted to see the lake! Perhaps thinking that he could see what the problem was, Karmas took another couple of steps forward. His attention completely on the tape, he didn't notice someone walking up behind him. However, he did soon learn that there was someone there, when they put their hand on his shoulder. Spinning around in surprise, Claptrap baring his spines, Karmas saw that the person was a member of the POLT. Karmas had vaguely heard of them before, and if he remembered correctly, they were generally called in for pokemon related incidents. <br />
<br />
Claptrap didn't take well to being told that the area was restricted and that they would have to go back, as evidenced by him hissing at the man. Karmas opened his mouth to say something when *FLASH* there was a bright light, almost like a lightning bolt. Looking over at the lake, Karmas realised that there were things lining the lake's edges. Things that looked a lot like bodies. A chill ran down his spine, oh god, they looked like the bodies of pokemon. What on earth was going on here? The man told Karmas to leave again, this time threatening to arrest him if he didn't.<br />
<br />
Karmas wanted nothing more than to tell the man that he wanted to help, but, once again if he remembered correctly, the POLT were considered pretty high up in the chain of command, which meant that he didn't want to get on the man's bad side. He turned to walk away, but stopped himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I'm not going to be going anywhere,&quot; he said, staring the man right in the eyes, &quot;I saw those things, and I want to help figure out what's going on with them. Anyways, its not like this is my first time dealing with dangerous things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karmas folded his arms and awaited the man's reply, readying himself to run if the man tried to arrest him.</span><br />

<br />
The streets were crowded, noisy and lively. You wonder whether Salin City is always like this way in the morning or if the upcoming Gym leader Challenge is what has everyone buzzing. The local Gym is famous for its unique system, in which a different Leader from one of the eight Islands takes on challengers for a period of time, before leaving and giving place to another Leader. This event however, seems to be different... Adam appears to be excited to take part, so the two of you approach one of the large publicity signs.<br />
<br />
-	Taken an interest in the Grand Farewell, did you? Always nice to see young blood keep up with these traditions!<br />
<br />
You immediately turn around, startled by the elderly voice behind you. You lock eyes with a tall, familiar-looking old man with a receding hairline and a pair of sunglasses, though you can’t quite pinpoint his identity. He smiles at you, points to the sign and clears his throat, immediately giving away who he is.<br />
<br />
-	Yo! Champ in the making! I see you’re interested in taking this Gym Challenge! Allow me to explain! Heh, it’s been a while since I’ve done this…<br />
<br />
Clyde adjusts his sunglasses and places a fingertip over the old man featured in the promotional poster.<br />
<br />
-	This man here is the single greatest Trainer in all of Fizzy Bubbles – the Champion, Gottfried! And this tournament, the Grand Farewell, is being held in honour of his retirement!<br />
<br />
You take a better look at the picture. The man seems taller than most people, broad-shouldered, imposing. He is bald and sports a long, impressive white beard; his eyes are sky blue and frowning seems to be the only expression he can muster if he didn’t even try to smile for the photo. All in all, he commands respect with his look alone.<br />
<br />
-	Gym Leaders from all over Cascadia were invited to the ceremony, and decided to pay homage to Gottfried by hosting this competition! Only the best Trainers are selected to take part in the exhibition, which starts tomorrow! Incidentally, today’s the last day of registration, so let me show you to the arena.<br />
<br />
Clyde takes off, closely followed by an excited Adam; you figure you might as well go after them… <br />
After a while of braving the sea of people that fills the streets of Salin City, you finally catch up to the older man, who points to a massive, circular building nearby<br />
<br />
-	This is the Salin Colosseum, where the Grand Farewell will take place starting tomorrow! I reckon it’s almost closing time, but if you make a run for it you might still make it in time to register! I look forward to seeing your performance from the stands. Good luck to you… and this is from me!<br />

<b>1x Fresh Water</b> in vintage Clyde-fashion, and shakes your hand before turning around and disappearing into the crowd. Adam pokes your leg and urges you to hurry up, or you’ll miss your chance to enter!<br />
<br />
As you approach the building, a large number of people are making their way out of the Colosseum, most of them silent, and all looking disappointed. You wonder why everyone seems so disheartened when such an exciting event is about to take place…<br />
You finally make it to the entrance and step inside. A security guard points you to the reception, grumpily telling you it’ll close in five minutes. You walk up to the counter, where a young woman tries her best to force a smile – it’s evident she’s exhausted, who knows how many people she had to register today?<br />
<br />
-	Welcome sir! Here to register for the Grand Farewell Tournament? This is a momentous occasion, so only the very best Trainers are allowed to sign up. To be honest, not a single person today has met the necessary requirements, so please don’t be discouraged if you’re not accepted! Please understand, only the best of the best are allowed to perform for the Champion.<br />
<br />
She pulls out a registration form from a drawer and places it on the counter. She clears her throat and declares the conditions for entering like an automaton – she’s been at this all day, after all.<br />
<br />
-	Applicants must meet the following requirements: an active party of six Pokemon at level 70 or above; one each of Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced and Expert Battle Trophies; and one Regional League participation diploma. Please display all of these to proceed with registration, otherwise we regr…<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a phone starts to ring. The woman apologizes, picks up her cellphone and the look on her face changes suddenly.<br />
<br />
-	B-but sir… But protocol… y-yes. Yes, I understand.<br />
<br />
She puts the phone down, clears her throat again and puts on a fake smile once more.<br />
<br />
-	A-apologies, I… misread the document. This was for a different competition. The, uhh… the applicant must meet the following requirements: an active party of six Pokemon at any level and an official Pokedex.<br />
<br />
You can’t help but notice the alarming changes to the regulation, but can’t say you aren’t pleased with the modifications. The woman reads the rest of the rules in a tired voice.<br />
<br />
-	Each Pokemon is allowed to carry one Held Item, and the Trainer is allowed the use of up to 2 items from their Bag during each battle. Battles will be Singles Matches on Leader-selected Arenas, with each Trainer using 3 Pokemon; the challenger is allowed to switch, while the Gym Leader is not.<br />
There will be one match each morning and each afternoon until either the challenger loses or defeats all eight Leaders over the course of 4 days. The challenger is allowed to select which 3 Pokemon to use from the 6 registered one hour before each match. Now, please select your six Pokemon and present your Pokedex to proceed with the registration…<br />
<br />
The six partners you choose will carry you through the whole tournament, with no access to a PC to switch between battles… who will you pick?</span></span>

<span style="color: silver">The early morning sun was high casting a beautiful orange, red and yellow glow on the city, with so many people out and about Ethan wondered if the city was always this booming with activity or if the Gym Challenges brought most people out…<br />
<br />
Looking up from the sign Ethan felt a rather familiar eerie feeling of someone approaching him from behind, Ethan tensed up thinking that a possible mugger was mistaking him for an easy target, a tourist from out of town maybe. <br />
<br />
Turning slightly to his left shoulder to where Adam was, they both looked at each other, and though they hadn’t been together for too long after reuniting, had already formulated a plan to get the jump on the guy from behind. <br />
<br />
With his fingers he counted off <i>One, Two…</i> without uttering a word, <i>Three!</i> quickly whirling around and was startled to find an elderly man with a suitcase, and sunglasses behind them, &quot;Taken an interest in the Grand Farewell, did you? Always nice to see young blood keep up with these traditions!&quot; his voice and face seeming familiar to the young boy but before he could say anything his Sableye jumped into action, leaping across ready to <b>scratch</b> up the man’s face, reacting quickly Ethan grabbed the Sableye mid air and placed him on the ground, &quot;It’s okay, somehow I think I know this guy.&quot; he assured before facing the older gentlemen standing before them, &quot;Sorry about that, you wouldn’t <i>believe</i> how many times someone tends to sneak up behind me.&quot; He said apologetically, &quot;But what you said just now, what’s the Grand Farewell?&quot; the boy asked before the man simply smiled on and pointed to the board that Ethan and his Pokémon had just been eyeing, clearing his throat and with the next thing he said giving his identity away, &quot;Yo! Champ in the making! I see you’re interested in taking this Gym Challenge! Allow me to explain! Heh, it’s been a while since I’ve done this…&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way!&quot; he couldn’t believe it, this guy was, Clyde! He had never met him before himself but Clyde was famous for aiding Pokémon Trainer’s before they took on a Gym Challenge, this guy knew talent when he saw it!<br />
<br />
Adjusting his glasses he pointed to the man featured on the poster, &quot;This man here is the single greatest Trainer in all of Fizzy Bubbles – the Champion, Gottfried! And this tournament, the Grand Farewell, is being held in honour of his retirement!&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking a closer look Ethan could tell the man was wise beyond his years, it had to with his sky blue eyes, something that his mother had taught him at a early age, that the eyes were the portals to people’s souls. He chuckled at how long and impressive his white beard was, would even make his best friend a bit jealous and his stance, it demanded respect but the thing that Ethan couldn’t get over was how the man didn’t even seem to smile, but instead frowned for his own picture!<br />
<br />
&quot;Gym Leaders from all over Cascadia were invited to the ceremony, and decided to pay homage to Gottfried by hosting this competition! Only the best Trainers are selected to take part in the exhibition, which starts tomorrow! Incidentally, today’s the last day of registration, so let me show you to the arena.&quot;<br />
<br />
With the favor of showing Ethan to the arena, the duo followed close behind with Adam ahead of his trainer, ducking through the crowds of people that littered the streets, and Ethan struggling to get past them. Occasionally losing sight of them, finally he caught up to them near a clearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;A-are…we…there…yet?&quot; he says with a shortness of breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is the Salin Colosseum, where the Grand Farewell will take place starting tomorrow! I reckon it’s almost closing time, but if you make a run for it you might still make it in time to register! I look forward to seeing your performance from the stands. Good luck to you… and this is from me! &quot; Opening up his suitcase he hands Ethan in old Clyde fashion <b>x1 Fresh Water</b>, Ethan stands up and gladly takes the drink from him, a bit star stuck.<br />
<br />
<i>Liza will never believe me if I tell her!</i> as he fangirled…<br />
<br />
Before shaking hands with Clyde, thanking him for his help and waving good bye to him with his free hand, gripping tight to the bottle in the other, &quot;We’ll try our best!&quot; he assured as the man disappeared among the crowd all the while forgetting that they were on a time limit. Adam poking Ethan back to reality with a sharp claw, &quot;Ow!, right let’s go!&quot; As the two raced down to the large structure they watched as a group of people exited from within. Their expressions sad and defeated, like they had just all came back from a funeral, theirs.<br />
<br />
Wondering why anyone could possibly be in such a negative place with such an awesome event starting up soon the boy made his way through the entrance and was quickly stopped by a grumpy security guard pointing him to the receptionist, warning him he only had 5 minutes. <br />
<br />
Heading over to the desk the boy asked, &quot;Is there any spots left?, Am I too late!?&quot;<br />
<br />
The tired receptionists’ forcing a smile on her face, &quot;Welcome sir! Here to register for the Grand Farewell Tournament?&quot; obviously wanting nothing more than to go home, take a long hot bath and relax from the number of people she had to see today.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes ma’am!&quot; the boy exclaims.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a momentous occasion, so only the very best Trainers are allowed to sign up. To be honest, not a single person today has met the necessary requirements, so please don’t be discouraged if you’re not accepted! Please understand, only the best of the best are allowed to perform for the Champion.&quot; She says as she goes through one of her drawers, pulling out a registration form placing it on the table before going on, &quot;Applicants must meet the following requirements: an active party of six Pokemon at level 70 or above; one each of Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced and Expert Battle Trophies; and one Regional League participation diploma.&quot; And with everything that needed to be required Ethan began losing hope he would have gotten any chance to compete <i>no wonder they looked so disappointed</i> he thought, &quot;Please display all of these to proceed with registration, otherwise we regr…&quot; that was until her cell phone rang.<br />
<br />
She picks it up, apologizing and seemed rather surprised by whoever it was that was on the other line, Adam that had been on the ground this whole time began climbing back up to his trainer’s shoulder as both of them wondered what it was that was going on, &quot;B-but sir… But protocol… y-yes. Yes, I understand.&quot; Placing down her cell she takes a moment to compose herself, smiling her fake smile and continued on, &quot;A-apologies, I… misread the document. This was for a different competition. The, uhh… the applicant must meet the following requirements: an active party of six Pokemon at any level and an official Pokedex.&quot;<br />
<br />
This worked out better then Ethan could’ve ever imagined. But it wasn’t like he couldn’t have gotten what they had asked for originally, eventually, but the shortage of refs in Trainer Battles seemed to be at such a high time low that they almost seemed nonexistent…<br />
<br />
&quot;Each Pokemon is allowed to carry one Held Item, and the Trainer is allowed the use of up to 2 items from their Bag during each battle. Battles will be Singles Matches on Leader-selected Arenas, with each Trainer using 3 Pokemon; the challenger is allowed to switch, while the Gym Leader is not.<br />
There will be one match each morning and each afternoon until either the challenger loses or defeats all eight Leaders over the course of 4 days. The challenger is allowed to select which 3 Pokemon to use from the 6 registered one hour before each match. Now, please select your six Pokemon and present your Pokedex to proceed with the registration…&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;4 Days!&quot; the boy exclaimed. So much was happening in such a short amount of time and despite the pressure of facing 8 gym leaders of Cascadia the boy couldn't help but grin.<br />
<br />
He came thinking he would only be allowed to face one...all he could think of now was going down in history as the only man to win against the Cascadia League in 4 Days time, that is, If he made it that far of course.<br />
<br />
At the request of presenting a full party of six, a decision he had decided on the night before he pulled out from his belt six Pokeballs: Vampire, Dragon, Premier, Dark, Dive, and Psychic on the desk; The boy then reached inside his leather jacket into a hidden compartment and handed the receptionist an indigo Pokedex
