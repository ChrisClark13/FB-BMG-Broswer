<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> You intended to get the heck out, you did! But what really ended up happening is both you and Meowth finding yourselves <i>deeper</i> into the tunnel than before, frantically running as fast as you can to escape what seems like certain death. Maybe getting out of the tunnel would have been the best option, but there's no way you can turn around now.<br />
<br />
Menancingly large boulders fall all around you as the tunnel collapses, but there's nothing you can do other than run for your life and try to dodge what you can... knowing that when you can't, you're done for!<br />
<br />
You spot glimmering stones flying past you as Red and Yellow Shards tumble from the shaking ceiling, but there's no time to stop and collect any of them; surviving takes priority! You briefly wonder how you'd probably have been set for life if you'd had the opportunity of collecting all of these gems, but fate had different plans and you're not exactly liking them.<br />
<br />
You keep running for what feels like an eternity, and the earthquake doesn't seem like it's going to subside any time soon. And just as you begin outrunning the cave in, something emerges from the ground right in front of you and causes you to trip and fall down hard! Lying on the floor, you look back to see what happened, only to witness a Dugtrio looking straight at you before vanishing into the ground once again! If it had a mouth, you could swear it'd be grinning... First those Magcargo, now Dugtrio - it's as if the entire fauna of Mt. Aduro is out to get you for some reason!<br />
<br />
Before you can stand up again, a portion of the tunnel's left wall crumbles and countless boulders tumble on top of your legs! You feel a sharp pain and suppress a scream; if these rocks had fallen from the roof your lower limbs would've been shattered! As it is, you reckon they're not broken, but you're still stuck from the knees down!! You try to fight out of it, but the stoens are way to heavy to push them yourself. Meowth, limber as he is, managed to avoid them altogether and looks over in concern.<br />
<br />
Before he can do anything to help you out, a stream of fire whistles right past his ear - he has his back turned to the attacker, facing you, but you can see it just fine - an angry-looking Torkoal is ready to strike, and next time it won't miss! Its smoke is black and being pumped out at high pressure, which can't be a good sign, and it doesn't seem to care about the tunnel collapsing all around it - boulders are just bouncing off its shell harmlessly!<br />
<br />
You shout at Meowth to pay attention - Torkoal's about to attack again!<br />
What do you do?! </span></span> <br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Treepandaone</u>:</b> You try to mix approaches to maximize your success, by threatening and attacking at the same time. You whisper your instructions to Psyduck and Deckard, and while the latter seems to have no problem acknowledging the complex stream of commands, the yellow platypus takes a while to assimilate all the information. You turn to the ghosts again and growl a menacing warning, but neither Froslass seems the least bit fazed - why would they fear <i>anything</i> when they're already dead?<br />
<br />
Their response is swift and deadly. As soon as Psyduck's eyes begin to glow, focusing for Hypnosis, the ghost on the right bolts forward, a white and red blur, and stabs the poor Water-Type with a lightning-fast <b>Ice Shard</b>, the bloodied one it was holding. Psyduck falls back in pain from the piercing wound on its left shoulder and fails to complete the Hypnosis. The attacker then seems to lose interest in the opponent and instead shifts its focus to Deckard, who now finds itself in a two-on-one situation! Fortunately it took the time to shift its composition slightly, becoming more attack-oriented after a quick Sharpen... Will it help?<br />
<br />
The second Froslass employs the exact same strategy as the first, phasing in and out of view to strike with an almost undodgeable <b>Ice Shard</b>. The attack finds its mark, but by its very nature no cut is inflicted on Deckard's body, who shrugs off the blow and prepares to counter. As per your instuctions, the Porygon dashes forward hovering above ground and drives its whole body weight into the Froslass that attacked it... passing <i>right through</i> the Ghost-Type with an ineffective Tackle. Both red-eyed Froslass draw clsoer together and unleash a collective <b>Icy Wind</b> that blows with frightening force, but Deckard sees it coming, remembers the Ice Shard and instantly adapts to the incoming move, altering its code to resist it; its blue portions turn a light-emitting bright orange, indicating its type to have changed to Fire!<br />
<br />
The Icy Wind hits Deckard at full strength, the freezing gale however having little effect on the Porygon's new sizzling form. If they're surprised, the Ghosts don't show it; they keep staring at the man-made Pokemon with the intent to fight. Just then, Psyduck springs back into action, driving a claw across one of the Froslass's body, but having just a little success as Deckard earlier, the Normal-Type Scratch having absolutely no effect on the ethereal creature.<br />
Fighting through the obvious pain on her shoulder, the platypus immediately follows up the failed attack with a point-blank Mud Bomb that does hit this time, propelling the ghost back a couple of feet, reeling from the effective blow! The other Froslass doesn't stand idly however, and mercilessly blows the Psyduck away with a powerful burst of black, <b>Ominous Wind</b>. Your partner once again falls on her back, writhing in pain, but isn't out for the count just yet. That wound looks pretty serious, however...<br />
<br />
The battle is definitely not in your favor, although Deckard does have the upper hand after a successful strategy. Psyduck is having it a lot worse and how reliable she will prove for the rest of the battle remains to be seen, given her critical condition...<br />
<br />
With the deck stacked against you against these hellspawn, what do you do now? </span></span> <br />

<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> You intended to get the heck out, you did! But what really ended up happening is both you and Meowth finding yourselves <i>deeper</i> into the tunnel than before, frantically running as fast as you can to escape what seems like certain death. Maybe getting out of the tunnel would have been the best option, but there's no way you can turn around now.<br />
<br />
Menancingly large boulders fall all around you as the tunnel collapses, but there's nothing you can do other than run for your life and try to dodge what you can... knowing that when you can't, you're done for!<br />
<br />
You spot glimmering stones flying past you as Red and Yellow Shards tumble from the shaking ceiling, but there's no time to stop and collect any of them; surviving takes priority! You briefly wonder how you'd probably have been set for life if you'd had the opportunity of collecting all of these gems, but fate had different plans and you're not exactly liking them.<br />
<br />
You keep running for what feels like an eternity, and the earthquake doesn't seem like it's going to subside any time soon. And just as you begin outrunning the cave in, something emerges from the ground right in front of you and causes you to trip and fall down hard! Lying on the floor, you look back to see what happened, only to witness a Dugtrio looking straight at you before vanishing into the ground once again! If it had a mouth, you could swear it'd be grinning... First those Magcargo, now Dugtrio - it's as if the entire fauna of Mt. Aduro is out to get you for some reason!<br />
<br />
Before you can stand up again, a portion of the tunnel's left wall crumbles and countless boulders tumble on top of your legs! You feel a sharp pain and suppress a scream; if these rocks had fallen from the roof your lower limbs would've been shattered! As it is, you reckon they're not broken, but you're still stuck from the knees down!! You try to fight out of it, but the stoens are way to heavy to push them yourself. Meowth, limber as he is, managed to avoid them altogether and looks over in concern.<br />
<br />
Before he can do anything to help you out, a stream of fire whistles right past his ear - he has his back turned to the attacker, facing you, but you can see it just fine - an angry-looking Torkoal is ready to strike, and next time it won't miss! Its smoke is black and being pumped out at high pressure, which can't be a good sign, and it doesn't seem to care about the tunnel collapsing all around it - boulders are just bouncing off its shell harmlessly!<br />
<br />
You shout at Meowth to pay attention - Torkoal's about to attack again!<br />
What do you do?! </span></span>

<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">Neither Keith nor Meowth said a word about their instinctive dash in what was possibly the worst possible direction in which to run. One, there was no time. And two, even if there was, neither would be in a position to say anything about it to the other, for they were both equally guilty in this. Right now, they had to focus on evading the alarmingly large rocks falling all around them! Among the falling debris were numerous Red Shards and Yellow Shards, and the sight of these couldn't help but get Keith thinking that he'd be set for life with those, but alas, an opportunity to collect these precious gems was not presenting itself.<br />
<br />
They ran and ran, for what seemed like an eternity. The earthquake wasn't letting up, either. However, one thing seemed to finally be going their way- they were starting to outrun the cave-in! But before Keith could even begin to form a relieved smile on his face, he tripped over something he could've sworn wasn't there a second before, and fell to the ground. Hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Owwww...&quot; groaned Keith as he looked back, only to see a three-headed brown Pokémon looking back at him for a second. Even if Keith had gone for his Pokédex, the Dugtrio vanished underground before he would've even began to reach for the pocket in which he kept his Pokédex. &quot;Man, what is up with this- WAH!&quot; he exclaimed, for at that moment, before he could even begin to get up, part of the tunnel's left wall crumbled into pieces, numerous boulders tumbling down onto his legs! He felt a sharp pain, and had to grit his teeth to prevent himself from screaming (though a few choice swearwords in Shuppet language managed to sneak out).<br />
<br />
Meowth wheeled around in alarm. &quot;Keith!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Youse OK?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh... Yeah, I think so,&quot; Keith nodded. &quot;If those rocks were from the ceiling it'd be a different story, but I don't think my legs are even broken- MEOWTH, BEHIND YOU!&quot; he screamed, as a stream of fire flew right past Meowth's ear. Meowth couldn't see the source, but Keith could- it was a Torkoal, and it looked angry. Real angry. Not to mention all the thick, black smoke that was being pumped out of its shell at high pressure, definitely not a good sign.<br />
<br />
&quot;But yer legs!&quot; Meowth protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;You let me worry about that, focus on the Torkoal!&quot; ordered Keith. &quot;It's about to attack again, so use <b>Water Pulse</b> to deflect it! Then maybe try to reason with it, see what the hell is up with the Pokémon around here, let it know we mean no harm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if dat don't work?&quot; Meowth asked nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;If it insists on a fight, then give it one,&quot; Keith replied. &quot;<b>More Water Pulses</b> if necessary.&quot; As Meowth turned to face the Torkoal, to prepare a Water Pulse to counter the oncoming Fire move, Keith turned to look at the pile of rocks covering his legs from the knees down. He wasn't exactly weak, but he still knew he had no chance of moving these rocks on his own. He therefore reached for his belt (mercifully the rocks weren't blocking off access to his Poké Balls!) and pulled a single Poké Ball off of it. He enlarged the ball and held it up. &quot;Helga, go!&quot; Keith exclaimed, as a Hariyama emerged from the ball in a flash of light.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yama... Hari?!&quot; Helga exclaimed as she noticed Keith's predicament.<br />
<br />
&quot;Helga, I need you to use <b>Strength</b> and move these rocks off my legs,&quot; Keith stated. &quot;But keep an eye on the ceiling- rocks are falling from the ceiling, too, so if you see one coming for you or me, deflect it with <b>Arm Thrust</b>.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yama,&quot; nodded the Hariyama as she stepped towards the pile of rocks, ready to get to work on them.</span></span></div>

<br />
<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> Thanking Arceus that there are no stones on your Balls, you reach out for Helga’s device and release the Hariyama. Who would’ve guessed that the female Makuhita traded to you by Levin Sanders for a single Berry, all that time ago, would prove this invaluable right now?<br />
<br />
Helga dutifully nods as you relay your instructions; she places her enormous palms on the pile of rubble that’s trapping you underneath and begins to push as hard as she can! Fortunately, “Helga’s Strength makes it possible to move boulders around!”, so you reason it’s only a matter of time until you’re free. However, there are other simultaneous concerns – the tunnel is still on the verge of collapsing, and Meowth is pitted against a furious Torkoal!<br />
<br />
The fire tortoise releases another <b>Flamethrower</b>, just as you expected, but fortunately Meowth is more than agile enough to counter – he lets loose a Water Pulse that meets the incoming stream of flames and quickly douses it; both attacks cancel each other out, leaving behind a thick cloud of vapor that obscures everybody’s vision temporarily, yours included!<br />
A sudden gale of hot wind then disperses the mist, and your eyes widen when they find Meowth lying on the floor, knocked back by the <b>Heat Wave</b> unleashed by Torkoal! It’s clear to you that the foe must be more than used to fighting without seeing properly, considering it’s always surrounded by smoke, so blowing Heat Waves across the air is probably its instinctive method of self-defense, which unfortunately for you worked just fine…<br />
<br />
You cry out to Meowth for him to get back up, concerned for his well-being, when suddenly you feel Helga stop pushing. You look up just in time to see a huge chunk of rock about to fall on your head, until an open palm shatters it into a million pieces! Helga narrowly avoided the worst with a swift Arm Thrust and soon resumes pushing the rest of the boulders aside with Strength… but will you be so lucky next time? You have to hurry!!<br />
<br />
Meowth gets back on his feet, still wobbly from the hit, but fortunately Torkoal is slow to mount its offense. You hear the cat talk to the opponent in its native tongue, to which Torkoal replied with only a few dry syllables before adopting an attacking stance once more. Meowth turns briefly to relay the information – Torkoal simply replied that “The Great One doesn’t want outsiders in His mountain”, whoever that Great One may be… While Meowth translates, you watch in fear as Torkoal’s shell shatters and floats around its body, a move you’re already familiar with – <b>Shell Smash</b>! Just as soon as Meowth focuses his attention back on Torkoal, it’s much too late: with its drastically enhanced speed, the tortoise envelops itself in a spiral of flames and slams its whole body weight right into your partner with a super powerful <b>Flame Wheel</b>!!<br />
<br />
Meowth is sent back so hard that he collides with the rest of the rubble Helga was still removing, sending the remaining rock fragments flying everywhere and effectively setting you free faster! You struggle to get back up and immediately check on your friend, who is still conscious but just barely. How can you keep up with Torkoal now that its strength and speed have increased so dramatically?! You can only watch as Torkoal prepares to unleash one final move on the downed Meowth…<br />
<br />
-	<i>WAAARK, WAAAARK!</i><br />
<br />
Out of nowhere, two similar bird heads appear right behind Torkoal and land a single peck each – a Doduo?! Trying its best to look brave, the two-headed ostrich waits to see the foe collapse in defeat… but after seconds of awkward silence, Torkoal simply turns around irritated and ready to roast the meddling bird! Doduo panics and dashes back the way it came, and Meowth sees his opening! Conjuring all of his remaining strength, he releases two Water Pulses in quick succession, which hit the opponent dead-on while its back is turned! A loud <i>boooom</i> follows, and when the waves settle down and coalesce into a large puddle… Torkoal lies knocked out in the center, courtesy of its harshly-lowered defenses! <b>Meowth has gained 1 Level!</b><br />
<br />
After the commotion, Doduo shows up again and starts jumping up and down in place; an exhausted Meowth is quick to provide translation, clarifying that it’s telling the three of you to hurry up and follow it! You reason that, if Doduo came from farther ahead, it means the earthquake must not have disturbed the deeper part of the tunnel! But your legs still hurt from being trapped beneath a layer of rock, there’s no way you can run fast enough… One more medium-sized boulder falls from the ceiling and hits you in the left shoulder, almost dislocating it; you instinctively clutch it in pain as you rummage your head for one last brilliant idea… you have to follow Doduo to safety, you must be nearly there!<br />
<br />
Come on, only a little farther to go, but you need one extra push! You can’t stay here a second longer, so what do you do?!</span></span> <br />

<span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>Aduro Island</i></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> Thanking Arceus that there are no stones on your Balls, you reach out for Helga’s device and release the Hariyama. Who would’ve guessed that the female Makuhita traded to you by Levin Sanders for a single Berry, all that time ago, would prove this invaluable right now?<br />
<br />
Helga dutifully nods as you relay your instructions; she places her enormous palms on the pile of rubble that’s trapping you underneath and begins to push as hard as she can! Fortunately, “Helga’s Strength makes it possible to move boulders around!”, so you reason it’s only a matter of time until you’re free. However, there are other simultaneous concerns – the tunnel is still on the verge of collapsing, and Meowth is pitted against a furious Torkoal!<br />
<br />
The fire tortoise releases another <b>Flamethrower</b>, just as you expected, but fortunately Meowth is more than agile enough to counter – he lets loose a Water Pulse that meets the incoming stream of flames and quickly douses it; both attacks cancel each other out, leaving behind a thick cloud of vapor that obscures everybody’s vision temporarily, yours included!<br />
A sudden gale of hot wind then disperses the mist, and your eyes widen when they find Meowth lying on the floor, knocked back by the <b>Heat Wave</b> unleashed by Torkoal! It’s clear to you that the foe must be more than used to fighting without seeing properly, considering it’s always surrounded by smoke, so blowing Heat Waves across the air is probably its instinctive method of self-defense, which unfortunately for you worked just fine…<br />
<br />
You cry out to Meowth for him to get back up, concerned for his well-being, when suddenly you feel Helga stop pushing. You look up just in time to see a huge chunk of rock about to fall on your head, until an open palm shatters it into a million pieces! Helga narrowly avoided the worst with a swift Arm Thrust and soon resumes pushing the rest of the boulders aside with Strength… but will you be so lucky next time? You have to hurry!!<br />
<br />
Meowth gets back on his feet, still wobbly from the hit, but fortunately Torkoal is slow to mount its offense. You hear the cat talk to the opponent in its native tongue, to which Torkoal replied with only a few dry syllables before adopting an attacking stance once more. Meowth turns briefly to relay the information – Torkoal simply replied that “The Great One doesn’t want outsiders in His mountain”, whoever that Great One may be… While Meowth translates, you watch in fear as Torkoal’s shell shatters and floats around its body, a move you’re already familiar with – <b>Shell Smash</b>! Just as soon as Meowth focuses his attention back on Torkoal, it’s much too late: with its drastically enhanced speed, the tortoise envelops itself in a spiral of flames and slams its whole body weight right into your partner with a super powerful <b>Flame Wheel</b>!!<br />
<br />
Meowth is sent back so hard that he collides with the rest of the rubble Helga was still removing, sending the remaining rock fragments flying everywhere and effectively setting you free faster! You struggle to get back up and immediately check on your friend, who is still conscious but just barely. How can you keep up with Torkoal now that its strength and speed have increased so dramatically?! You can only watch as Torkoal prepares to unleash one final move on the downed Meowth…<br />
<br />
-	<i>WAAARK, WAAAARK!</i><br />
<br />
Out of nowhere, two similar bird heads appear right behind Torkoal and land a single peck each – a Doduo?! Trying its best to look brave, the two-headed ostrich waits to see the foe collapse in defeat… but after seconds of awkward silence, Torkoal simply turns around irritated and ready to roast the meddling bird! Doduo panics and dashes back the way it came, and Meowth sees his opening! Conjuring all of his remaining strength, he releases two Water Pulses in quick succession, which hit the opponent dead-on while its back is turned! A loud <i>boooom</i> follows, and when the waves settle down and coalesce into a large puddle… Torkoal lies knocked out in the center, courtesy of its harshly-lowered defenses! <b>Meowth has gained 1 Level!</b><br />
<br />
After the commotion, Doduo shows up again and starts jumping up and down in place; an exhausted Meowth is quick to provide translation, clarifying that it’s telling the three of you to hurry up and follow it! You reason that, if Doduo came from farther ahead, it means the earthquake must not have disturbed the deeper part of the tunnel! But your legs still hurt from being trapped beneath a layer of rock, there’s no way you can run fast enough… One more medium-sized boulder falls from the ceiling and hits you in the left shoulder, almost dislocating it; you instinctively clutch it in pain as you rummage your head for one last brilliant idea… you have to follow Doduo to safety, you must be nearly there!<br />
<br />
Come on, only a little farther to go, but you need one extra push! You can’t stay here a second longer, so what do you do?!</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">Keith couldn't help but grin as Helga set to work, moving the rocks off her Trainer. He knew of all the trades she had gone through- first, her original Trainer, a Fighting-type specialist by the name of Levin, traded her to James for a single Berry. Then James traded her to Keith for a set of decorative Vanillish sculptures. Prior to her evolution, Helga feared that Keith would also trade her away, but nothing of the sort happened, nor would it ever. Though the occasional worry still found its way into Helga's mind every now and again, these days she was much more reassured that Keith was intent on keeping her. The two were now about as close as a Pokémon and Trainer could be, but Keith had to snap out of it, he had much bigger things to think about at the moment- like Meowth!<br />
<br />
As Keith knew would be the case, Meowth was quick enough to fire off a Water Pulse at the second Flamethrower, both moves colliding in midair and cancelling each other out. The collision of fire and water created a cloud of steam, obscuring the vision of everyone present. However, to Keith's horror, this seemed not to matter to the Torkoal, for a Heat Wave blasted through the steam, striking Meowth hard and knocking him back! &quot;WAAAAH!&quot; Meowth exclaimed as the powerful Fire move made contact.<br />
<br />
&quot;Meowth!&quot; Keith exclaimed. But before Meowth could respond, he suddenly realized that Helga had stopped pushing boulders. Though he had a grim idea of what to expect, he looked up, and sure enough, a large rock was falling right for his head! Keith slammed his eyes shut, only to hear the sound of the boulder being blasted into relatively harmless gravel in midair. Keith opened his eyes, and sure enough, Helga had seen the rock falling, and shattered it with Arm Thrust. The Poison-type Trainer gave a grateful smile to his Hariyama, but then turned his attention back to Meowth, who was talking to Torkoal. Once Torkoal gave its curt response, Meowth turned to Keith. &quot;Well, Meowth, what's up?&quot; Keith asked urgently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Torkoal's sayin' dat 'da Great One don't want outsiders in his mountain',&quot; Meowth translated.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Great One?&quot; Keith murmured. &quot;Well, can you tell Torkoal that we want to leave and went the wrong way by accident- oh, shit,&quot; he said suddenly, for at that moment, Torkoal used a move that made his eyes widen in horror- it was Shell Smash! A move that drastically ups the user's offenses and Speed, in exchange for lowering its defenses. Meowth turned back to Torkoal and opened his mouth, but no words exited his mouth before flames swirled around Torkoal's body, and the angered Fire-type slammed into Meowth! This move hit Meowth so hard that it sent the Scratch Cat Pokémon flying backwards, whereupon he collided with the rest of the rubble on Keith's legs, finishing Helga's job for her. Helga helped Keith get back on his feet (he was quite right, by the way, his legs weren't broken, but being hit by those rocks wasn't exactly soothing!), as Meowth struggled to get back up himself. But it looked to be no good, Torkoal was gearing up for a final move- when suddenly, a pair of sharp, loud caws sounded from behind Torkoal, as a two-headed bird dashed forward, each head landing a Peck attack.<br />
<br />
&quot;A Doduo?&quot; Keith murmured in surprise as he took out his Pokédex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doduo, the Twin Bird Pokémon,&quot; droned the device. &quot;Doduo's heads never sleep simultaneously- one head always stays awake and keeps watch while the other one sleeps. Although it cannot fly very well, it is very skilled at running.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doduo's sudden appearance and attack served to distract Torkoal, and that was all the opening Meowth needed! Acting quickly, the Normal type got to his feet and charged up two Water Pulses, one in each front paw, and hit Torkoal with both of them simultaneously. Between the super effectiveness, the weakened defenses from the Shell Smash, and Meowth's Ability of Technician, Keith was hardly surprised to see that the Torkoal had fainted from the dual attack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nicely done, Meowth!&quot; grinned Keith.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tanks,&quot; Meowth replied, grinning weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And thank you too, Helga,&quot; Keith said, smiling at the Hariyama. &quot;I can't thank you enough- hmm?&quot;<br />
<br />
For at that moment, Doduo, who had fled in fear of the Torkoal, came back, hopping up and down and cawing urgently. Meowth spoke up almost immediately. &quot;Doduo's sayin' we gotta follow it!&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then it must be safer up ahead!&quot; Keith exclaimed. &quot;Another exit, a part of the cave that isn't collapsing... I'll take it over this, whatever it is- gah!&quot; he grunted as he started to run, but very hastily stopped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Youse OK?&quot; Meowth asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but my legs are in no shape for running at the moment,&quot; sighed Keith. Then, his eyes lit up. Of course! Why didn't he think of him before? And then his train of thought was abruptly derailed by a sizable rock to his shoulder, mercifully not breaking or dislocating it (but coming too damn close to doing so for comfort!), but spurring Keith into swifter action. &quot;Meowth, on my shoulder,&quot; Keith instructed, as he held out a Poké Ball at the Hariyama. &quot;Helga, take a good rest,&quot; he added as the Hariyama was withdrawn. Then, he took out another ball and held it out just as Meowth climbed back onto the (relative) safety of Keith's shoulder (to Keith's relief, Meowth chose to take the uninjured shoulder, even though the injured one was still usable- it was quite sore, after all). &quot;Let's ride, Vernon!&quot; he declared as his Tauros appeared in a flash of light. As fast as he could, considering the battered condition of his legs, Keith climbed onto his Tauros's back. &quot;Follow that Doduo!&quot; he ordered. Vernon nodded and mooed in response to his Trainer's order, ready to go as soon as the Doduo was.</span></span><br />

These islands contain the some of the most diverse typing of Pokemon in the entirety of Fizzy Bubbles. All of these islands are actually volcanoes, but the majority of them have gone dormant. As many Pokemon spend all their lives here, many fossils of Pokemon and plants are buried in the depths of the volcanic ground, maybe some of these may be worth a look?

<br />
She didn't wait for the boat to make a full stop before jumping over board as a voice entered in her head that wasn't hers, <i>Better not fall!</i> the voice said, innocent and sweet though a bit dark and eerie as well. Liza landed on to the dock with both feet firmly on the ground. Turned and bowed to no one...<br />
<br />
“Stop being such a worried wart all the time, <i>Lucy!</i>”<br />
<br />
A small flame appeared out of thin air which followed with a small candle floating underneath it, a little girls giggle resonating through the wind as the Litwick that now stood in front of its trainer smiled at her.<br />
<br />
<i>Where are we going?</i> Lucy said as she sat on the head of its trainer.<br />
<br />
“You'll see!” Liza said cheerfully.<br />
<br />
<i>Awwww...</i><br />
<br />
The duo quickly made haste toward the Pokémon Center, Liza had learned through her travels, was a great hub of information when a trainer needed to get to a place in a hurry.<br />
<br />
She passed through the two sliding doors and headed toward the front desk, where a nurse was standing around and upon seeing Liza’s face greeted her.<br />
<br />
“Good morning! Welcome to the Pokémon Center.” The nurse said, “Would you like to rest your Pokémon?”<br />
<br />
It was odd for Liza to think if she had just continued school she would have been the nurse behind the counter assisting lost trainers and their hurt Pokémon.<br />
<br />
“No, actually I've already had my Pokémon looked at; what I wanted to know wa-” <br />
<br />
But she stopped when the TV monitor behind the desk caught her attention. “We are here live where 6 trainers will be competing against each other to see which one of them will be victorious against the 8 Cascadia Gym Leader’s- oh it looks like the first of the challengers is walking out of the locker room!” the reporter turned the camera to the doors on the far side, the crowd behind the reporter growing ever wilder. <br />
<br />
Liza wondered if Ethan might have wanted to compete in something like that, knowing full well how much he loved battling.<br />
<br />
She was about to turn away when she saw stepping onto the stage the person she had just been thinking about!<br />
<br />
She couldn’t believe it! It was him, it was Ethan walking onto the platform shaking hands with the first of the Gym Leaders; she smiled when she realized he was finally going after his dream…and even though she wished she could see how the match would turn out, it made her want to go after her own dream even more!<br />
<br />
Liza returned to the nurse’s gaze, “You wouldn't know where a contest hall would be held do you? Last I heard was they were being held in this very creepy place called Phantom Isle but I was hoping I wouldn't have to travel such a long distance in the middle of nowhere to compete in them.” the trainer smiled, “Oh- pardon me, I haven't introduced myself, my name is Liza and this is Lucy” she said as her Litwick gave a sneaker, “And me and my team plan to conquer all 5 categories of contests!” <br />

<span style="color: lightblue"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>Glacier Island</i></span><br />
<br />
<b><u>Boreal Wastelands</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Treepandaone</u>:</b> You try to mix approaches to maximize your success, by threatening and attacking at the same time. You whisper your instructions to Psyduck and Deckard, and while the latter seems to have no problem acknowledging the complex stream of commands, the yellow platypus takes a while to assimilate all the information. You turn to the ghosts again and growl a menacing warning, but neither Froslass seems the least bit fazed - why would they fear <i>anything</i> when they're already dead?<br />
<br />
Their response is swift and deadly. As soon as Psyduck's eyes begin to glow, focusing for Hypnosis, the ghost on the right bolts forward, a white and red blur, and stabs the poor Water-Type with a lightning-fast <b>Ice Shard</b>, the bloodied one it was holding. Psyduck falls back in pain from the piercing wound on its left shoulder and fails to complete the Hypnosis. The attacker then seems to lose interest in the opponent and instead shifts its focus to Deckard, who now finds itself in a two-on-one situation! Fortunately it took the time to shift its composition slightly, becoming more attack-oriented after a quick Sharpen... Will it help?<br />
<br />
The second Froslass employs the exact same strategy as the first, phasing in and out of view to strike with an almost undodgeable <b>Ice Shard</b>. The attack finds its mark, but by its very nature no cut is inflicted on Deckard's body, who shrugs off the blow and prepares to counter. As per your instuctions, the Porygon dashes forward hovering above ground and drives its whole body weight into the Froslass that attacked it... passing <i>right through</i> the Ghost-Type with an ineffective Tackle. Both red-eyed Froslass draw clsoer together and unleash a collective <b>Icy Wind</b> that blows with frightening force, but Deckard sees it coming, remembers the Ice Shard and instantly adapts to the incoming move, altering its code to resist it; its blue portions turn a light-emitting bright orange, indicating its type to have changed to Fire!<br />
<br />
The Icy Wind hits Deckard at full strength, the freezing gale however having little effect on the Porygon's new sizzling form. If they're surprised, the Ghosts don't show it; they keep staring at the man-made Pokemon with the intent to fight. Just then, Psyduck springs back into action, driving a claw across one of the Froslass's body, but having just a little success as Deckard earlier, the Normal-Type Scratch having absolutely no effect on the ethereal creature.<br />
Fighting through the obvious pain on her shoulder, the platypus immediately follows up the failed attack with a point-blank Mud Bomb that does hit this time, propelling the ghost back a couple of feet, reeling from the effective blow! The other Froslass doesn't stand idly however, and mercilessly blows the Psyduck away with a powerful burst of black, <b>Ominous Wind</b>. Your partner once again falls on her back, writhing in pain, but isn't out for the count just yet. That wound looks pretty serious, however...<br />
<br />
The battle is definitely not in your favor, although Deckard does have the upper hand after a successful strategy. Psyduck is having it a lot worse and how reliable she will prove for the rest of the battle remains to be seen, given her critical condition...<br />
<br />
With the deck stacked against you against these hellspawn, what do you do now? </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: lightblue">A cacophony of thoughts clouded Matthew's judgment; the fear of impending doom casting errors onto the veteran trainer's orders. Though the question of Froslass' fear was certainly valid considering their already vacant demise, the Pokémon trainer had hoped that the lack of advanced brain functions; power of hypnosis even on the dead; a clever combination, heck anything would have prevented the sudden attack that actually came. The two ghost-types phased through the air with impeccable ease, stabbing at his companions with the same ferocity that clearly led to the death of the slowly rotting corpse that used to be a Beartic. <br />
<br />
Matthew's heartbeat sped up as Psyduck fell to the ground with a pierced shoulder, a faint whimper escaping from his mouth as he saw one of his newest Pokémon become injured. Perhaps he was wrong to throw them into such a serious arena so soon, his confidence being the catalysts for their demise. He cursed his inability to walk away, but was buoyed by Deckard's capable recovery, the programming code Pokémon suffering no cuts nor bruises, and effectively changing type into fire to avoid the icy fate Psyduck had almost succumbed to. <br />
<br />
The worst, however, was still to come as Matthew watched his Pokemon's normal type attacks fly through the ethernal forms of the ghosts; Psyduck's scratch and Deckards tackle failing and leaving them open to counter attacks. For all the study, battle, experience, wisdom, reminders Matthew had made the gravest of mistakes, forgetting all he had known under the pretense of quick thinking and overwhelming anxiety, but this was no time for that! Matthew attempted to pull himself together, assessing the situation at hand as Psyduck rose to its feet, though still incredibly injured.<br />
<br />
Running was still not an option. In the milisecond Psyduck had attempted to set up the Hypnosis, the two Froslass had already made their moves with priority Ice Shards, the quickening attack would clearly out-run their tired legs and provide next to no resistance. The deck was stacked against him, and right now he was the Joker missing his king and queen; his most powerful Pokémon and starter Rhyperior was weak to all things ice, as were most of his fossil Pokémon. <br />
<br />
For now, he decided, he would continue fighting with Psyduck and Porygon; the two low-leveled Pokémon still stood more of a chance of coming from behind than fresh Pokémon with weaknesses did than defeating the Froslass. Perhaps the certainty he displayed, and belief in the heart of his compadres, was misplaced but for now it was all he had. He decided that should they go down he would release whatever Pokémon he had in a last ditch attempt; a grand finale before his inevitable death and a goodbye to the people he loved the most; to die a death surrounded by Pokémon. If that was the way it had to be done, then so be it, but with two Pokémon still fighting the good fight, he wasn't out of it yet.<br />
<br />
“Psyduck, <b>Future Sight</b> then two <b>Mud Bombs</b>. Deckard, use <b>Agility</b> to distract them, force them to focus fire on yourself and run from any attacks, then pop a few <b>Psybeams</b> their way! Stay on the offensive and we can get through this”<br />
<br />
Always the optimist, Matthew gave his orders with a thumbs up, though his mind faltered and prayed to the heavens for a savior...</span></span></div>

<br />
<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u> Electric Blue Eye</u>:</b> You decide to decline the woman's offer to keep any of your items, refusing to relinquish the Plates out of fear she may be in on the scheme to take them from you; instead, you ask for directions and she is happy to provide them - if she's upset in any way, she does a good job of hiding it.<br />
<br />
Following her instructions, you immediately quicken your pace toward the guarded entrance with a &quot;Competitors&quot; sign above it. The door is located to your right, whereas another one on your left (with considerably more people flocking to it) is meant for &quot;Spectators&quot;. You can't help but notice only 5 other people stand by the Competitor's door, waiting to be admitted. None look familiar, but as you remember the initial requirements for registration, you reason that they all must be formidable Trainers. Either that or they all had their acceptance conditions tweaked at the last minute, but somehow that seems extremely unlikely.<br />
<br />
You walk close to the guards and wait for your turn. One of them approaches you, checks the tablet he's holding and nods.<br />
<br />
- Challenger Ethan, welcome to the Grand Farewell Tournament. Please proceed to the door on the far end of this corridor, where you and the other competitors will be given honorary seats to listen to Champion Gottfried's speech. You will receive further instructions upon its conclusion.<br />
<br />
You pass through the door and find yourself on a long, narrow passage with a mahogany door on the far end, just like the man said. You walk along the red tapestry-covered corridor, noticing the walls adorned with several paintings and portraits. You recognize the faces of many world-class Trainers: Red, Green, Lance, Steven Stone, Wallace, Cynthia, Alder and Iris, all Champions from far-away regions; other notable photos include Fizzy Bubbles' Elite Five Arnold, Tess, Stacey, Stark and Hayward. In a way, it feels intimidating to be stared at by so many legends, even if they're only pictures...<br />
When you finally reach the large wooden gate, you notice it has been carved to resemble a lion's head, with a majestic flowing mane embedded with the <i>Daimonji</i> symbol. Your hand rests on the handle as you briefly wonder why this carving looks familiar, but you can't dwell on it too long as you hear the roaring crowd on the other side of the door. Breathing in deeply, you enter the Challengers' Room.<br />
<br />
- Ohhh~, another one?<br />
<br />
Your jaw almost drops from the sight before you. You find yourself in an open balcony with the floor covered in red carpet like the corridor; six chairs are lined in the middle, overlooking the entire arena. Countless spectators have gathered in the stands below you, a sellout crowd for sure. It's impossible to tell, but if you had to guess, there must be well over 50.000 people!<br />
<br />
The other five Trainers you'd spotted before are all gathered here, each of them having taken a seat already. One vacant chair remains, and one of the them urges you to take it.<br />
<br />
- Come on, join us! We're all moderately friendly, except for Kayl over there, he just doesn't care. The speech is about to start! I don't think Gottfried has ever made a public announcement in his life before; then again, that's kinda why they call him the &quot;Silent King&quot;... I wonder why he's stepping down. Legends like him should never go away!<br />
<br />
The Trainer is clearly passionate about this whole thing. It seems that Gottfried retiring is a huge deal around these parts. You can't help but feel curious as well... You take the remaining seat, and just as you sit down the entire crowd seems to get up! The noise intensifies, and when the unmistakable sound of a microphone going live is heard through the speakers, you know the speech is about to start! Suddenly, the other five Trainers look to their left and lean slightly off the balcony. You follow their gaze and finally understand... your seats were placed immediately to the right of the main balcony, twice the size of yours, where the star of the moment is standing! The layout of the place finally makes sense to you: The Champion is in the center, with the challengers to his right and eight people on a third balcony to his left, which you assume are the Gym Leaders that were invited.<br />
<br />
Your eyes finally rest on the man whom entire event was put together for, as Gottfried slowly makes his way from a large golden chair to the microphone on the edge of the main balcony.<br />
The man, while old, is enormous. Broad-shouldered and imposing, he wears a long, heavy-looking crimson cape that almost reaches the floor. It's hard to tell where you're standing what he's wearing underneath, since the cape pretty much covers his entire frame. He has a very serious expression, just like in that picture that Clyde showed you earlier, and has the same thick white beard, which is at first glance is vaguely shaped like the flames of a Fire Blast... His head is completely bald and his eyes are a cold light-blue. His entire figure commands respect, and although 50.000 people came to see him, he doesn't seem the least bit inclined to be here.<br />
<br />
<i>- THANK YOU GOTTFRIED! *clap clap clapclapclap* THANK YOU GOTTFRIED! *clap clap clapclapclap**</i><br />
<br />
The sight of all these people cheering for a single man is both heartwarming and awe-inspiring. They all seem to idolize the elder, despite his apparent posture; with a hardened, unreadable expression, his eyes are locked on the crowd, hardly blinking. He waits until the chants die down somewhat and takes the mic.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #B22222">- Just look at you.</span><br />
<br />
His voice is deep, raspy, powerful. And still, you notice a hint of fatigue.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #B22222">- Thousands upon thousands chanting for an old man, a dying legacy. You are all fools, each and every one of you without exception! And yet... I am moved.</span><br />
<br />
The deafening silence that had fallen over the arena as Gottfried uttered his first words suddenly broke out in cheers again.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #B22222">- That so many of you chose to be here today instead of moving on with your lives... is both foolish and rewarding.</span><br />
<br />
As Gottfried speaks, you notice a young man sitting on a chair next to the Champion's in the main balcony with a devastated look on his face. He's probably around your age, with blonde hair so light it could pass off as white; his eyes are green and he's dressed in a simple white shirt and matching pants. Gottfried pauses briefly, inhales deeply and continues.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #B22222">- I will not bore you with a long speech about myself, nor have I ever been inclined to do so. Know only that I no longer have the heart to battle, as my mind is turned to another pursuit. Since I cannot fully dedicate myself to defending the title of Champion anymore, I choose to step down rather than do so half-heartedly.</span><br />
<br />
The massive elder shifts his body slightly and holds his arm to the side, signaling the blonde man behind him.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #B22222">- As I withdraw from my position, I choose to appoint my apprentice, Johan of the Engel family, as the new Champion until such time when he is defeated in battle. I know he is ready and will do me justice. And it is him I have to thank for this event, which he orchestrated despite my vehement protests.</span><br />
<br />
You can tell he attempts to smile, but either due to lack of habit or his impressive beard, it's barely noticeable.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #B22222">- I tire of talking. Johan, Champion of Fizzy Bubbles, the spotlight is yours.</span><br />
<br />
The young man shifts uncomfortably in his chair before nodding, getting up and replacing Gottfried on the mic. The old man returns to his own seat and closes his eyes, as if exhausted for whatever reason. Johan clears his throat and addresses the audience.<br />
<br />
- I... thank you for the vote of confidence, sir. I will do my best to live up to your legacy. But ladies and gentlemen, this day isn't about me! Let's have one more round of applause for the Silent King, our true Champion, Gottfried!<br />
<br />
Once again the crowd erupts in cheers as Johan takes the opportunity to catch his breath. You wonder why Gottfried was so vague in his reasoning for stepping down; after all, shouldn't that be the main purpose of his speech in the first place? But you have a feeling his choice of words was deliberate and carefully weighed, and that he didn't let on any more than he intended. The people didn't seem to mind either, so perhaps it doesn't really matter, but still...<br />
<br />
- I envisioned the Grand Farewell as a tribute to our undefeated Champion, hoping to gather the best Trainers in the region and put on a memorable show. I could think of no better send-off to a man who, more than any other, made a name for himself on the field of battle. I would also like to thank the eight Gym Leaders who agreed to take part in the festivities, some of whom even helped fund this great event!<br />
<br />
The crowd now cheers for the men on the left balcony, most of whom rise to meet the applause.<br />
<br />
- This Tournament will determine the best of the best, and a fitting prize will be awarded to the winner - the privilege of raising an offspring of one of Gottfried's own Pokemon!<br />
<br />
To this announcement, the crowd explodes once more. You know nothing of the Champion's team, but there's no doubt in your mind that every single one of these 50.000 people know all about Gottfried's Pokemon. Several different chants break out, and you struggle to make out what people are saying. You seem to pick up &quot;Jotun&quot; and &quot;Sigurd&quot; cheers, but one chant is heard loud above all the others.<br />
<br />
- LEAR! LEAR! LEAR!<br />
<br />
Johan smiles and waits for everyone to calm down.<br />
<br />
- Who knows which one? If any of the challengers manage to stand tall above the eight Leaders, you will find out! The first round of battles will begin shortly. Please be patient!<br />
<br />
He turns to face his mentor, who seems to have fallen asleep in his golden chair. Johan shakes his head and smiles, as if used to it, and returns to his seat.<br />
Just then, the door you came in through opens again and the same security guard who gave you instructions earlier calls out to you and the other challengers.<br />
<br />
- It's time to head down to the arena. Please follow me.<br />
<br />
The six of you exchange brief stares before following the man out of the balcony, back through the corridor and into a separate chamber you hadn't noticed before.<br />
<br />
- This is the locker room where you will await your turn to battle. I trust you all know the Leaders you'll be facing, yes? If so, please step inside, and one of you will be called out to the arena for the first match. Best of lucks to you all gentlemen, please make our Champion proud!<br />
<br />
All six of you enter the locker room - a spacious area with several small-scale machines found commonly in Pokemon Centers, such as individual healing pods, laptops with access to e-mail (but blocked storage access as per the tournament's rules), etc - and find it lined with monitors on the walls. They're transmitting a live broadcast of the event, currently showing the arena being prepared for the first match. You all take a seat as the reporter covering the show announces on worldwide TV that the battles are about to start!<br />
<br />
You exchanged confused glances; if that's true, how come nobody told you anything yet? Just then, the monitor directly above the exit, the largest of the TV sets in the room, changes the display to photos of all six challengers. They begin to spin around until, one by one, they form a vertical line. The photo on top represents the first challenger to go out to the arena... and it's you!<br />
<br />
You jolt up immediately once you realize the situation. You're up next, about to battle in front of <i>fifty thousand people</i>! The door on the far end of the locker room opens, revealing the arena beyond. You quickly remember what the woman at the counter told you yesterday: <i>&quot;Each Pokemon is allowed to carry one Held Item, and the Trainer is allowed the use of up to 2 items from their Bag during each battle. Battles will be Singles Matches on Leader-selected Arenas, with each Trainer using 3 Pokemon; the challenger is allowed to switch, while the Gym Leader is not.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
You take a deep breath and step outside. The sun is shining and the air is warm; you try to focus, but the atmosphere of the place is absolutely overwhelming, the crowd erupting at the sight of the first challenger and the beginning of the Tournament. You finally make your way over to the battlefield, outlined in white, and stand in your designated circle. Looking around, you see a man in an elevated pod to your right wearing a black and white shirt, who you assume is the referee. And directly across you on the other end of the arena is a brown-haired man with a blue vest and a serious expression, who can only be your opponent - Gym Leader Sean!<br />
<br />
- The first match is about to start! Gym Leader Sean versus Pokemon Trainer Ethan! Please meet at the center and greet your opponent!<br />
<br />
Both of you make your way towards the middle of the arena. Sean holds out his hand in sportsmanship, but as soon your own hand meets his, the Leader pulls you in close and whispers in your ear.<br />
<br />
- Did you receive any sort of message or warning before this match?!<br />
<br />
His tone is dark and filled with urgency. You can't tell whether he's threatening you or just concerned; either way, he knows something's up. You try to remember what you read about this man in the file yesterday... is he trustworthy? Will he be an ally or an enemy?<br />
<br />
The wild crowd is growing restless with anticipation, there isn't much time to talk... What is your answer? </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">OoC: I apologize if my reply basically sucks, but I've been brain dead for weeks because of finals and just needed to write this out for some stress relief.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: silver"><span style="font-size: 9px">The receptionist didn’t react like the young man had expected. She didn’t flinch or get angry like he thought she would when he blatantly refused to fork over his items but instead gave him the directions he needed to get to his seat, all with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;T-thank you…&quot; the young trainer had told the women behind the desk before promptly leaving and making his way to a set of double doors.<br />
<br />
When he was sure he was out of ear shot, the young man confided in his Pokémon, his thoughts on the matter, &quot;This is pointless buddy, at this point we’ll just be suspecting everyone of leaving some note on our doorstep.&quot; He scoffed, &quot;Seriously? This isn’t 5th grade! What kind of prank is that?!&quot;<br />
<br />
The Sableye laughed a bit, &quot;Let’s just enjoy the day, I’m sure it won’t be the last time we hear from our mysterious ‘friend’ …I’m sure their second message will be a little bit more pissed off. Haha.&quot;<br />
<br />
Upon reaching his destination Ethan noticed only 5 other trainers were standing around the door way he needed to go through, the one labeled ‘competitor’ <br />
<br />
&quot;Stiff competition…&quot; How was it only 5 other trainers including himself were allowed to compete? That’s when it hit him, he quickly remembered what the requirements where to even be allowed in the tournament, a Trophy of beginner, intermediate and advance battles, along with a participation certificate in an official league tournament. <br />
<br />
If it didn’t feel real before, it did now!<br />
<br />
<i>How am I supposed to compete against all of them!</i> Ethan thought, Adam quick to notice his trainer’s gripping his hand tight...<i>Why was I allowed to compete?</i><br />
<br />
When his name was finally called Ethan began to wonder if he should of just bailed on the whole thing…but his Sableye pushed him forward before he had a chance.<br />
<br />
Through the ‘competitor’s’ door way both trainer and Pokémon found inside a long and narrow passageway, paved in red carpet. He was told to go to the far side where he’d find a mahogany door he needed to enter from.<br />
<br />
He made his way toward it when his Sableye began tucking at his jacket, urging to look at something, &quot;Adam what is i- oh!&quot; he turned and what he saw hanging from the walls were a number of portraits containing pictures of the many Champions across every region…&quot;Sab…&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don’t know who they are, buddy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sab...&quot; The Sableye said in a no.<br />
<br />
The trainer chuckled, &quot;Have you been living underneath a rock my friend?&quot; Ethan said rubbing his creature’s head affectionately. &quot;These men, women and even children…are the Champions of every faraway region known to man, they are highly respected for their strength and their smarts, and their love for Pokémon. Truly they are an inspiration to every trainer that has ever dreamed of competing in the league.&quot;<br />
<br />
The young trainer stared at them for a while taking it all in, but suddenly a sick feeling plummeted inside his stomach and began to make him feel like throwing up. A feeling he had been fighting in secret, a feeling of despair. <br />
<br />
<i>What if I make a fool of myself out their? What if I can’t even beat a single one of my opponents Pokémon? What if I should’ve defended when I attacked instead? What if…What if…</i><br />
<br />
The thoughts became louder and louder in the young man’s mind, soon he stumbled against the wall, the pictures seemed to have come alive, their stares were intimidating…<br />
<br />
&quot;Adam…I just…I just don’t think I can do this…&quot;<br />
<br />
Sableye didn't like where this was going, he quickly jumped off his trainers back and urged him to move but Ethan wouldn’t budge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sab…&quot; the little ghoul looked back at the pictures, and noticed one man he did recognize, it was before his time but Ethan had described every individual that he had traded with, marking them as people he trusted.<br />
<br />
Sableye whirled around urging him to look, and though it took a while Ethan finally did, the trainer astonished to find a man that had helped him early in his career as a beginner. <br />
<br />
Hayward of the Elite Five.<br />
<br />
He smiled thinking about the fact, though relatively new to Fizzy Bubbles, Hayward was kind enough to trade his Teddiursa he had acquired through a recent hatch of his. But it wasn’t the simple fact he won the bid on the little Pokémon that Ethan remembered him. It was because Hayward believed in paying homage to the video games that so many trainers played with as children. By Trading a Pokémon with a free item, was more than just a free gift, but a way to make a connection with other trainers. <br />
<br />
His disappearance though, a mystery to many, Ethan will always remember him for giving him his first companion on this scared land.<br />
<br />
Ethan looked at his Sableye, he smiled a bit, the bad feelings somehow seemed to not matter much anymore. <br />
<br />
The young trainer extended his arm out so his Pokémon could climb back on to his shoulder, &quot;Come on, their all waiting for us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sab!&quot; the little ghoul jumped back on as they both headed down the same path, &quot;Thanks buddy, I needed that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sab!&quot;<br />
<br />
Reaching the end of the corridor Ethan came across the mahogany door he had seen earlier, it wasn’t until now though he noticed it had craved on the front a lion’s head that looked so vivid and real he was a little nervous to go for the handle afraid that the beast with a majestic mane and a funny looking symbol on the forehead would surely come alive and rip them both to shred’s.<br />
<br />
The trainer smiled nervously at his Pokémon before taking in a deep breath, reaching the knob and turning it, the light bright as he entered inside of it.<br />
<br />
--<br />
The rest of the proceeding felt like it had happened in a complete and utter blur. He complemented the speech Gottfried gave as he waited in the locker room with everybody else hidden through a secret chamber through the hall he had been in...Gottfried didn't give much reason to why he was stepping down, other then ‘looking through another pursuit’. <br />
<br />
Of course it was the most obvious of answers and somehow Ethan didn't buy it, but the crowd did, and maybe that was good enough...besides Johan didn't seem like a bad guy, Ethan could tell there was a lot of love there between the both of them.<br />
<br />
Remembering very well, that his mother was a strong influence on him to follow his own path, battling. It was odd for him to admit that she was more of a mentor to him then his own father, but with him being away on jobs it wasn't like he could have...<br />
<br />
The crowd exploded after hearing what the grand prize would be if anyone managed to defeat all 8 of Cascadia's Gym Leaders; an offspring of the Champion's very own Pokémon. But in all honesty it was just an honor to compete.<br />
<br />
But still, it didn't hurt to think about what kind of Pokémon Gottfried had assembled but being a Champion for so many years, he was sure they were something special about them...<br />
<br />
His thoughts were soon interrupted as his attention was brought to the largest screen in the room. <br />
<br />
Ethan's face along with the other competitors displaying on the screen before spinning around and around, one by one lining up in a vertical line.<br />
<br />
The young trainer a bit surprised jolted up when he realized he was the first to battle.<br />
<br />
Ethan walked out of the locker room with much excitement and confidence that he didn’t bother looking at the other competitors as he made his way onto the field, the roar of the crowd a rather encouraging feeling that, regardless whether he had entered because of luck he was here to fulfill a long childhood dream and achieving that dream was all that mattered to him.<br />
<br />
He walked into his designated circle when the referee had said, &quot;The first match is about to start! Gym Leader Sean versus Pokemon Trainer Ethan! Please meet at the center and greet your opponent&quot;<br />
<br />
He made it to the middle of the field as Sean extends his hand for a shake and when Ethan's hands reached the Gym Leader's, Sean drew him in close and with an urgent and dark voice asked him, &quot;Did you receive any sort of message or warning before this match?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan didn't know what he was supposed to think. Was Sean the one behind the note? Why would a Gym Leader by after the Plates, did they have some other kind of meaning besides some scripture of the past, it wouldn’t be that surprising after all, Diego had told him there was a possibility that they held a some sort of ‘key’ to something, doubtful since any research he found on the matter was too vague for words…<br />
<br />
The young trainers grip grew stronger around Sean’s hand, the screams of the cheering crowd becoming nothing more then a distant memory, Ethan leaned in close and whispered in the other man’s ear…<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea..were you the one that left the note on top of my doorstep? What is it you know about the Plates of Arceus?!&quot;</span></span></div>

<br />
<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> <i>((Record marker: <b>4 of 6</b> in-hand Pokemon declared – Nidoking, Meowth, Hariyama, Tauros.))</i><br />
<br />
Some quick-thinking on your part and you turned a disastrous situation into a spectacular escape – Vernon huffs and slams his hooves on the ground before picking up speed and dashing full-speed ahead, narrowly dodging the boulders that continue to fall all around you. As the Tauros effortlessly carries you even deeper into the cave, you look behind to see the tunnel you were in just now completely cave in and disappear from sight… that was close!! But now… how will you make it out of here, if you can’t backtrack anymore? You figure that’s a problem for another time – all that matters right now is following the Doduo that mysteriously appeared to aid you!<br />
<br />
The tunnel twists changes direction repeatedly, sharp turns every five steps, but Vernon remains undeterred. After a while of running as fast as he can, you spot a large opening in the tunnel ahead. You urge Vernon to head for the new exit, and just as he leaps out of the cave, the entire structure collapses behind you! That was <i>way</i> too close! But if not for your last minute idea of calling out Tauros to help, you’d undoubtedly have been crushed under the rubble… well done!<br />
<br />
Meowth demands your attention and frantically points at something in the distance. The stress of escaping impending doom was so intense that you’d forgotten to reassess your new surroundings… You find yourself in a spacious, incredibly large cavern, unfortunately without a single gemstone in sight. The area feels much warmer than the tunnel, and it’s easy to see why – two wide lava pools replace part of the floor, emanating an all-too-familiar heat. And between stalagmites and bubbling magma, over where Meowth keeps pointing… is Kyle!! You must’ve been lead to a group of caves up north as you traversed the tunnel, and it seems fate has brought you and the dimwitted reporter back together! But something’s not right…<br />
<br />
The Doduo you were chasing now stands in front of Kyle, looking terrified, while two creatures crawl out of one of the lava pools… they should’ve been Magcargo, what else could survive those temperatures? But they were definitely something else… a pair of Magmar!<br />
<br />
Your mind drifts briefly – why on earth is every living thing on Mt Aduro so hostile? Sis Kyle even do anything wrong this time around? It’s starting to feel like, no matter what you do or don’t do, the wild Pokemon roaming the volcano are out to get you… is the “Great One” that Torkoal mentioned to blame? Either way, it seems the amateur journalist finds himself in peril again… He looks over to you, only now realizing your presence, and his face lights up in the face of potential rescue.<br />
<br />
-	DUDE! It’s so good to see you! Look, I could really, <i>really</i> use a hand here… Doduo and I can’t do this on our own… I told you there was a conspiracy! Everyone’s out to get <i>them</i>!<br />
<br />
He points behind him as he shouts the last sentence, and your eyes follow his lead… What are those things?! Cowering behind Kyle (oh the irony…), all but one, five Pokemon look in fear while the two Magmar approach. They’re vaguely familiar to you - bipedal, anteater-like animals with a long brown face and red fur with yellow stripes… it’s a group of Heatmor!<br />
<br />
-	I’ve been trying to understand why all the other locals are so aggressive towards this particular pack, that’s why I was studying the Magcargo earlier! Doduo’s strong enough to keep Slugma at bay, but this is out of our league dude… please, give us a hand, we can take them down if we team up!<br />
<br />
You look at the two Magmar that emerged from the lava. They look tremendously strong, especially if they feel at home <i>inside</i> molten rock… Also, neither Kyle nor his Doduo look the least bit reliable as battle partners… How’d you get yourself into this situation again? Meowth seems to be thinking the same and points at another opening on the cave’s wall not far from where you’re standing, and it seems to lead outside again, thank Arceus! You’ve witnessed with your own eyes that this mountain contains unimaginable riches waiting to be explored…<br />
<br />
Do you leave Kyle and the Heatmor to fend for themselves and resume your hunt for treasure? Taking Doduo into account, as well as the five anteaters, Kyle’s forces vastly outnumber the hostile Magmar, so maybe they’ll be alright.<br />
Or do you stop to help EyeLand Network’s only employee in a double battle to protect the Heatmor pack?<br />
<br />
The choice is yours…</span></span> <br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u> Electric Blue Eye</u>:</b> <i>((Actually I find this to be one of your better replies so far, with a nice amount of character development, that’s what I like to see! Keep it up ^^))</i><br />
<br />
Upon hearing your reply, Sean’s expression darkens further. It’s clearly not what he wanted to hear. He whispers again with a worried look on his face.<br />
<br />
-	Damn it. Whatever you do, give the plates to <i>nobody</i>! I’ll explain later, there are all kinds of eyes watching and not all of them can be trusted. For now, let’s do what they expect of us.<br />
<br />
The Gym Leader walks back to his Trainer area, and you do the same. At his gesture, the regular clay arena sinks in to the ground and a new one rises to take its place: a large pool with several round stone platforms placed randomly, a field ideal for aquatic Pokemon but adapted to allow land dwellers to fight as well. The audience’s voices roar louder than ever as the time to fight draws near, but the taciturn Gym leader doesn’t seem the least bit phased by the crowd’s cheers. You find yourself regretting you didn’t conduct your research faster last night, since the power went out just before you could read the data about Sean’s team… The Gym Leader clears his throat and assumes his designated role, much to the audience’s delight.<br />
<br />
-	Ethan, show us what you’ve got! Honor our Champion and give it your all!<br />
<br />
He takes a Lure Ball from his belt and calls the first of his three chosen Pokemon. The device snaps open as Sean calls out to creature inside:<br />
<br />
-	You’re up… Quagsire!<br />
<br />
The goofy-looking bipedal Water/Ground-Type Pokemon materializes on one of the platforms, but you know it can fight just as well underwater. You recall reading how Sean’s greatest virtue was his versatility in combat, and it’s beginning to show right from the start.<br />
Once again the crowd erupts in cheers at the sight of Sean’s choice of Pokemon, and the anticipation of your own pick. Now’s the time to choose…<br />
<br />
Who do you send out to battle?</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> <i>((Welcome to my group, hope you have a good time and enjoy your new adventure! ^^))</i><br />
<br />
Fresh off a fruitful journey across the Arcane Realm, as dictated by the powers that be, you now find yourself free to pursue your lifelong dreams – becoming a Master Coordinator and the foremost authority in a recently discovered form of special evolution, of which very little is known for now. You figure the best place to get started is the main City of the Cascadia Archipelago, the bustling metropolis known as Salin. And what better way to get directions than in the meeting point for any and all travelling trainers – the local Pokemon Center?<br />
<br />
Soon after you walk inside and approach the counter, your expression lights up when you spot Ethan on a nearby monitor; to most of the other people sitting around in the lounge area of the Pokemon Center, he may be a complete stranger about to fight in the Grand Farewell, but to you he’s someone close and special, and seeing him out there fulfilling his dream fills you with joy. And if he gets to fulfill his life’s goal, then so shall you!<br />
<br />
With renewed determination, you turn to the nurse and ask about the existence of Contest Halls in Salin City. The woman looks at you with an apologetic smile and delivers the news.<br />
<br />
-	Oh dear, I’m terribly sorry, I guess you didn’t know… Contests are pretty much a thing of the past, I’m afraid. It’s been over four years since the last official Tournament was held in all of Fizzy Bubbles, and despite ongoing talks that they might return at some point, truth is nothing seems to point in that direction… all everyone cares about these days is good old Pokemon Battles, which is a bit of a shame really...<br />
<br />
You feared this might be the answer. You’re aware that Contest Halls everywhere have been closed for years now, and that no such thing as a professional circuit exists anymore. Qualified referees have long since retired, and unfortunately it seems not even this massive city, full of shops and Gyms, can offer what you so desperately seek. Disheartened, you thank the nurse for her time and turn around to leave… until you’re approached by someone who taps you on the shoulder lightly.<br />
<br />
It’s an old man, probably in his seventies, with a scruffy white beard, thick glasses and a green flannel shirt; he is slightly hunched over and about your own height, and he’s smiling right at you.<br />
<br />
-	Say young lady… I couldn’t help but overhear your conversation. You seem to have an interest in performing with your Pokemon partners, is that right? So many have lost interest in that art… Tell me something dear: in your heart of hearts, what do Contests truly mean to you?<br />
<br />
Could this old man tell you something more about Contests than that young nurse did? Maybe it’s worth humoring him for a while…<br />
He eagerly waits for your reply, though you’re not sure what he means; is there even a right or a wrong answer to his question?...</span></span> <br />

<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Treepandaone</u>:</b> Through thick and thin, you decide to stick with Psyduck and Deckard as your battlers for now. Deckard was clearly the centerpiece of the team, and your success hinged on his ability to take control of the match while providing an opening for the severely injured Psyduck…<br />
<br />
The two Froslass are practically at full health and display very little concern for either opponent. Their behaviour seems purely instinctive, as if driven by a higher force to accomplish a single purpose… And even before Deckard can use its Agility, both ghosts are already placing their full attention on the Porygon… instead of trying to finish off the much weaker Psyduck! But why?...<br />
<br />
Deckard’s body glows briefly and its edges shift and reshape slightly, conferring a more aerodynamic look; but before it can start dashing to draw the enemies’ attacks, both ice demons vanish from sight too fast for either you or your partners to track, and just like before they both hit Deckard with their <b>Ice Shard</b>s, sending it back a couple of feet but once more barely harmed, thanks in large part to its temporary Fire-Type. This doesn’t make sense, even most wild Pokemon are capable of adapting strategies mid-fight if their moves aren’t working… so why do these Froslass insist on striking the wrong opponent with the wrong move?! It’s like they’re not trying to knock Deckard out, or at least they’re looking to do it in a very specific manner, but why?... <br />
<br />
The Porygon is quick to recover and soon begins to run circles around the two enemies, who sure enough have their full attention on Deckard. They manage to match his speed with their lightning-fast Ice Shards, again and again pelting it with the frozen blade in their hands, to almost no effect… and when a massive iridescent sphere falls from the sky like a meteorite, you realize Psyduck was paying attention after all – Future Sight envelops both Froslass and explodes in a violent rainbow blast that sends chunks of ice flying everywhere! But when the frost and snow settle, both foes remain standing, albeit looking considerably weakened… Psyduck did a great job!<br />
Unfortunately, before she can follow up with the Mud Bombs, she loses her footing and collapses, the pain from that horrible wound and the outside cold having taken the best of her… <b>Psyduck is unable to battle!</b><br />
<br />
It seems Deckard’s all on its own now! Both Froslass resume to striking with repeated Ice Shards, each move weak and ineffective but the accumulated pain from the consecutive stabs slowly wearing out your remaining partner… And try as it may, the ghosts keep fading in and out of view, making it impossible for Deckard to take aim for Psybeam! Things aren’t looking good at all…<br />
<br />
Suddenly, one of the Froslass locks up in place, crimson ice spike in hand, unable to move for reasons you can’t quite make out. Deckard probably can’t either, but whatever the cause it provided it with a precious opening! It lets loose a multicolored beam of Psychic energy that finds its mark and sends the Froslass flying back several feet! The ghost tumbles to the floor, drops its Ice Shard and... it’s not moving! Froslass is knocked out, <b>Deckard gains 1 Level!</b><br />
<br />
What the hell happened? And… why is your hair standing on end? You suddenly start hearing a humming sound drawing closer, hard to identify at first but quickly growing to resemble the low-pitched rumbling of an engine… Wait, it is! A snowmobile with two passengers stops right next to you, appearing out of nowhere (or maybe you were too focused on the battle to notice earlier), followed from above by a Magneton… that explains it, Froslass was caught by this Magneton’s Thunder Wave!<br />
<br />
- He managed to knock one out… Listen, we <i>have</i> to take him with us! How many guys back at camp know how to battle?<br />
<br />
One of the passengers shouts at you; his helmet makes it impossible to see his face.<br />
<br />
-	Come on, recall your Pokemon and hop in! You can’t handle two of them, and more are probably on the way!<br />
<br />
The other man doesn’t sound half as eager to have you on-board and is quick to object, while recalling his Magneton. There goes the extra help...<br />
<br />
-	We came here to scout the perimeter, nothing else! I’m not taking strangers inside the camp, you don’t even know if he was stabbed!<br />
<br />
-	Don’t be an idiot, if he’d been hit we’d know! He wouldn’t be standing straight, for one. Come on man, last chance, we’ll take you somewhere safe! Or do you wanna stay out here instead?!<br />
<br />
Deckard continues to try and dodge the remaining Froslass’s strikes, but even with the makeshift Type advantage, the Ghost still has the edge in speed as long as it keeps using Ice Shard, which it doesn’t seem to be stopping any time soon. Maybe one last accurate Psybeam will seal the deal, but Deckard can’t find another opening on his own…<br />
<br />
You have to weigh your options: do you trust two complete strangers in a barren, frozen wasteland? They might be genuinely nice guys, or they can be poachers… Do you accept their offer and retreat (to parts unknown), or do you keep fighting and braving the wasteland on your own? After all you’ve been through on your journeys, you’ve learned to be wary of people you don’t know…<br />
<br />
What do you do?</span></span> <br />

<span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>Aduro Island</i></span><br />
<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> <i>((Record marker: <b>4 of 6</b> in-hand Pokemon declared – Nidoking, Meowth, Hariyama, Tauros.))</i><br />
<br />
Some quick-thinking on your part and you turned a disastrous situation into a spectacular escape – Vernon huffs and slams his hooves on the ground before picking up speed and dashing full-speed ahead, narrowly dodging the boulders that continue to fall all around you. As the Tauros effortlessly carries you even deeper into the cave, you look behind to see the tunnel you were in just now completely cave in and disappear from sight… that was close!! But now… how will you make it out of here, if you can’t backtrack anymore? You figure that’s a problem for another time – all that matters right now is following the Doduo that mysteriously appeared to aid you!<br />
<br />
The tunnel twists changes direction repeatedly, sharp turns every five steps, but Vernon remains undeterred. After a while of running as fast as he can, you spot a large opening in the tunnel ahead. You urge Vernon to head for the new exit, and just as he leaps out of the cave, the entire structure collapses behind you! That was <i>way</i> too close! But if not for your last minute idea of calling out Tauros to help, you’d undoubtedly have been crushed under the rubble… well done!<br />
<br />
Meowth demands your attention and frantically points at something in the distance. The stress of escaping impending doom was so intense that you’d forgotten to reassess your new surroundings… You find yourself in a spacious, incredibly large cavern, unfortunately without a single gemstone in sight. The area feels much warmer than the tunnel, and it’s easy to see why – two wide lava pools replace part of the floor, emanating an all-too-familiar heat. And between stalagmites and bubbling magma, over where Meowth keeps pointing… is Kyle!! You must’ve been lead to a group of caves up north as you traversed the tunnel, and it seems fate has brought you and the dimwitted reporter back together! But something’s not right…<br />
<br />
The Doduo you were chasing now stands in front of Kyle, looking terrified, while two creatures crawl out of one of the lava pools… they should’ve been Magcargo, what else could survive those temperatures? But they were definitely something else… a pair of Magmar!<br />
<br />
Your mind drifts briefly – why on earth is every living thing on Mt Aduro so hostile? Sis Kyle even do anything wrong this time around? It’s starting to feel like, no matter what you do or don’t do, the wild Pokemon roaming the volcano are out to get you… is the “Great One” that Torkoal mentioned to blame? Either way, it seems the amateur journalist finds himself in peril again… He looks over to you, only now realizing your presence, and his face lights up in the face of potential rescue.<br />
<br />
-	DUDE! It’s so good to see you! Look, I could really, <i>really</i> use a hand here… Doduo and I can’t do this on our own… I told you there was a conspiracy! Everyone’s out to get <i>them</i>!<br />
<br />
He points behind him as he shouts the last sentence, and your eyes follow his lead… What are those things?! Cowering behind Kyle (oh the irony…), all but one, five Pokemon look in fear while the two Magmar approach. They’re vaguely familiar to you - bipedal, anteater-like animals with a long brown face and red fur with yellow stripes… it’s a group of Heatmor!<br />
<br />
-	I’ve been trying to understand why all the other locals are so aggressive towards this particular pack, that’s why I was studying the Magcargo earlier! Doduo’s strong enough to keep Slugma at bay, but this is out of our league dude… please, give us a hand, we can take them down if we team up!<br />
<br />
You look at the two Magmar that emerged from the lava. They look tremendously strong, especially if they feel at home <i>inside</i> molten rock… Also, neither Kyle nor his Doduo look the least bit reliable as battle partners… How’d you get yourself into this situation again? Meowth seems to be thinking the same and points at another opening on the cave’s wall not far from where you’re standing, and it seems to lead outside again, thank Arceus! You’ve witnessed with your own eyes that this mountain contains unimaginable riches waiting to be explored…<br />
<br />
Do you leave Kyle and the Heatmor to fend for themselves and resume your hunt for treasure? Taking Doduo into account, as well as the five anteaters, Kyle’s forces vastly outnumber the hostile Magmar, so maybe they’ll be alright.<br />
Or do you stop to help EyeLand Network’s only employee in a double battle to protect the Heatmor pack?<br />
<br />
The choice is yours…</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">At Keith's urgent urging, Vernon the Tauros charged forward, carrying his Trainer away from the crumbling cave and the falling rocks. And not a moment too soon, either- as Keith took the chance and looked over his shoulder, he could see that the tunnel they were fleeing had caved in completely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dat was too close,&quot; Meowth whimpered, clinging to Keith's shoulder for dear life (without the use of his claws, to Keith's relief). &quot;We nearly got crushed! But how's we gonna get out now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have an idea,&quot; Keith replied. &quot;Let's not start worrying about that until our surroundings <i>aren't</i> falling down all around us, hmm?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like a plan,&quot; said Meowth.<br />
<br />
With that, Vernon continued to race after the Doduo. Right now, Keith didn't know how a Doduo of all things found them in the middle of a crumbling cave, nor why it was helping them- all he knew was that this Doduo was leading him away from the falling rocks, so right now, Keith was in no mood to look a gift Ponyta in the mouth.<br />
<br />
The tunnel twisted and turned- Vernon couldn't take five steps without having to turn again, but the Wild Bull Pokémon was far too stubborn to be deterred by a small matter such as this. Kinda takes after his Trainer in that regard, come to think of it. Anyway, Vernon kept on following the twisted tunnel, determined to convey his Trainer to safety, and then after one final turn, Keith noticed what appeared to be an exit. &quot;There, Vernon, up ahead!&quot; Keith exclaimed. The Tauros mooed in response and made one final dash for the exit. And at long last, they were out! Well, out of the smaller tunnel, anyway- they certainly weren't outside.<br />
<br />
They had ended up in a large cavern. Incredibly large. Fill it with water and a Wailord would fit in there real comfortably. What was more, Keith looked behind him, and the tunnel they came in through just seconds before had caved in completely. They were just in time! &quot;Thanks, Vernon,&quot; Keith said, sighing in relief. &quot;You really saved us, thanks.&quot; The Tauros mooed happily in response to this as Keith glanced around the cavern. Not a single gemstone to be found here, though at the moment, this was kinda the least of Keith's concerns.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wat da-&quot; Meowth said suddenly. &quot;Hey! Keith! Over dere!&quot; he exclaimed, pointing off in one direction. Keith looked, and his mouth fell open- the Doduo from earlier was now standing in front of none other than-<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle?!&quot; Keith exclaimed in surprise as Vernon carried them over to the reporter he had encountered before. They were near a few large lava pools, which accounted for this cavern being significantly hotter than the tunnel (of course, given the choice, Keith would take hotter temperatures over being buried alive with large, heavy rocks!). A group of Pokémon were cowering behind Kyle (Keith reasoned that they had to <i>really</i> be scared to be doing that), and a pair of creatures were crawling out of the lava.<br />
<br />
&quot;So dis is Kyle, hmm?&quot; Meowth remarked. &quot;I- WAH!&quot; he exclaimed as he suddenly noticed the Pokémon emerging from the lava. Keith dismounted his Tauros, then took out his Pokédex and pointed it at the newcomers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Magmar, the Spitfire Pokémon, and the evolved form of Magby,&quot; droned the device. &quot;Magmar is born in the spout of a volcano. It thrives in hot environments, and enjoys swimming in molten lava.&quot;<br />
<br />
At that point, Kyle explained the situation- the Pokémon all over the island were, for one reason or another, specifically targeting the small pack of Pokémon currently cowering behind the somewhat dim reporter, prompting Keith to point his Pokédex at them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heatmor, the Anteater Pokémon,&quot; droned the device. &quot;Heatmor breathes through the hole in its tail to fuel its internal fire. It preys almost exclusively on Durant.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle went on to explain that the island's locals were being hostile towards this particular pack of Heatmor, which Keith didn't get at all. He then said that these Magmar were out of Doduo's league, and asked Keith for help.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ehhh,&quot; Meowth whimpered. &quot;How about we get outta here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, no, we can't leave them like this,&quot; argued Keith. &quot;Of course we'll help,&quot; he added to Kyle. Keith reached for his belt, but before he could pick a Poké Ball, the Tauros standing next to him snorted and stomped the ground. &quot;Heh,&quot; grinned Keith as he turned to look at his Tauros. &quot;You want a shot at this?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Tauros mooed affirmatively. &quot;He's ready ta go,&quot; Meowth translated.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right, then,&quot; said Keith. &quot;Go, Vernon! Use-&quot; At that moment, however, he stopped- something still on his Pokédex's screen caught his eye. Heatmor's entry was still up on the screen, and Keith was drawn to one thing in particular; the list of potential Abilities a Heatmor could have. &quot;OK, Vernon, on my word, use <b>Role Play</b> on the Heatmor I point out to you,&quot; he said. &quot;Then use <b>Stone Edge</b> on one of those Magmar, your pick. If I put my Pokédex away and don't point out a Heatmor, then <b>two Stone Edges</b>, one for each Magmar.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wat is youse up to?&quot; Meowth demanded.<br />
<br />
Keith grinned. &quot;Heatmor can have Flash Fire,&quot; he explained. &quot;I'll scan this pack with my Pokédex to see which ones have which Ability, and if one of them has Flash Fire, I'll have Vernon copy it, and then he won't be harmed by Magmar's Fire attacks!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh,&quot; nodded Meowth. &quot;Dat's good tinkin'.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just hope one of them actually does have Flash Fire, though...&quot; Keith muttered as he proceeded to point his Pokédex at each Heatmor in turn, praying they didn't all have Gluttony or something. &quot;And Meowth,&quot; he added, &quot;see if those Heatmor can shed some light on this situation. I'm hoping at least one of them may know why the rest of the island seems to be turning on them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm on it,&quot; nodded Meowth as he jumped down off of Keith's shoulder and approached the Heatmor. &quot;Hey, so, wat's da deal here?&quot; Meowth asked them. &quot;I don't suppose youse guys got any idea wat's gotten all the other Pokémon around here mad at youse?&quot;</span></span></div>

<span style="color: lightblue"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>Glacier Island</i></span><br />
<br />
<b><u>Boreal Wastelands</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Treepandaone</u>:</b> Through thick and thin, you decide to stick with Psyduck and Deckard as your battlers for now. Deckard was clearly the centerpiece of the team, and your success hinged on his ability to take control of the match while providing an opening for the severely injured Psyduck…<br />
<br />
The two Froslass are practically at full health and display very little concern for either opponent. Their behaviour seems purely instinctive, as if driven by a higher force to accomplish a single purpose… And even before Deckard can use its Agility, both ghosts are already placing their full attention on the Porygon… instead of trying to finish off the much weaker Psyduck! But why?...<br />
<br />
Deckard’s body glows briefly and its edges shift and reshape slightly, conferring a more aerodynamic look; but before it can start dashing to draw the enemies’ attacks, both ice demons vanish from sight too fast for either you or your partners to track, and just like before they both hit Deckard with their <b>Ice Shard</b>s, sending it back a couple of feet but once more barely harmed, thanks in large part to its temporary Fire-Type. This doesn’t make sense, even most wild Pokemon are capable of adapting strategies mid-fight if their moves aren’t working… so why do these Froslass insist on striking the wrong opponent with the wrong move?! It’s like they’re not trying to knock Deckard out, or at least they’re looking to do it in a very specific manner, but why?... <br />
<br />
The Porygon is quick to recover and soon begins to run circles around the two enemies, who sure enough have their full attention on Deckard. They manage to match his speed with their lightning-fast Ice Shards, again and again pelting it with the frozen blade in their hands, to almost no effect… and when a massive iridescent sphere falls from the sky like a meteorite, you realize Psyduck was paying attention after all – Future Sight envelops both Froslass and explodes in a violent rainbow blast that sends chunks of ice flying everywhere! But when the frost and snow settle, both foes remain standing, albeit looking considerably weakened… Psyduck did a great job!<br />
Unfortunately, before she can follow up with the Mud Bombs, she loses her footing and collapses, the pain from that horrible wound and the outside cold having taken the best of her… <b>Psyduck is unable to battle!</b><br />
<br />
It seems Deckard’s all on its own now! Both Froslass resume to striking with repeated Ice Shards, each move weak and ineffective but the accumulated pain from the consecutive stabs slowly wearing out your remaining partner… And try as it may, the ghosts keep fading in and out of view, making it impossible for Deckard to take aim for Psybeam! Things aren’t looking good at all…<br />
<br />
Suddenly, one of the Froslass locks up in place, crimson ice spike in hand, unable to move for reasons you can’t quite make out. Deckard probably can’t either, but whatever the cause it provided it with a precious opening! It lets loose a multicolored beam of Psychic energy that finds its mark and sends the Froslass flying back several feet! The ghost tumbles to the floor, drops its Ice Shard and... it’s not moving! Froslass is knocked out, <b>Deckard gains 1 Level!</b><br />
<br />
What the hell happened? And… why is your hair standing on end? You suddenly start hearing a humming sound drawing closer, hard to identify at first but quickly growing to resemble the low-pitched rumbling of an engine… Wait, it is! A snowmobile with two passengers stops right next to you, appearing out of nowhere (or maybe you were too focused on the battle to notice earlier), followed from above by a Magneton… that explains it, Froslass was caught by this Magneton’s Thunder Wave!<br />
<br />
- He managed to knock one out… Listen, we <i>have</i> to take him with us! How many guys back at camp know how to battle?<br />
<br />
One of the passengers shouts at you; his helmet makes it impossible to see his face.<br />
<br />
-	Come on, recall your Pokemon and hop in! You can’t handle two of them, and more are probably on the way!<br />
<br />
The other man doesn’t sound half as eager to have you on-board and is quick to object, while recalling his Magneton. There goes the extra help...<br />
<br />
-	We came here to scout the perimeter, nothing else! I’m not taking strangers inside the camp, you don’t even know if he was stabbed!<br />
<br />
-	Don’t be an idiot, if he’d been hit we’d know! He wouldn’t be standing straight, for one. Come on man, last chance, we’ll take you somewhere safe! Or do you wanna stay out here instead?!<br />
<br />
Deckard continues to try and dodge the remaining Froslass’s strikes, but even with the makeshift Type advantage, the Ghost still has the edge in speed as long as it keeps using Ice Shard, which it doesn’t seem to be stopping any time soon. Maybe one last accurate Psybeam will seal the deal, but Deckard can’t find another opening on his own…<br />
<br />
You have to weigh your options: do you trust two complete strangers in a barren, frozen wasteland? They might be genuinely nice guys, or they can be poachers… Do you accept their offer and retreat (to parts unknown), or do you keep fighting and braving the wasteland on your own? After all you’ve been through on your journeys, you’ve learned to be wary of people you don’t know…<br />
<br />
What do you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: lightblue">Matthew's eyes skittered from one side of the battle to another as he struggled to keep up with the raging battle of speed superiority; Deckard performing marvellously as it began to use its aerodynamic configuration to keep acceleration at a maximum while the two Ghost-types continued to press forward with frightening quickness, the ever-mounting Ice Shard attack a continual favourite from the hell-spawn. Sound mind and fleetness wasn't able to prevent the Ice Shard attacks from landing their mark, but Matthew was taken aback by the lack of change in his opponents strategy, even the simplest of Pokémon and beginner of trainers know how to change strategy to gain headway in a type battle they're losing, but both Froslass seemed to have no such function.<br />
<br />
<i>“What are you?”</i> he asked himself with fearful in-trepidation, but even he knew he didn't really want to know the answer. That would require more knowledge, and the last thing he wanted to do right now was spend a seconds more in the same vicinity as these mindless creatures of death.<br />
<br />
From what he did know, the possessive force that had them controlled on instinct and almost-magical way in which they were created made the Pokémon trainer extremely apprehensive; a spread of death, destruction and regeneration or re-awakening seemed almost inevitable, like a virus with an epicentre that became a pandemic such sights would surely carry over into other parts of the world until all areas had been infected. In his humble non-scientific opinion, this was the outbreak of a zombie-esque plague, the theory being covered from A-to-Z in his favourite scary movies but nothing like this was ever supposed to be real. The thought of becoming embroiled in such misery terrified Matthew down to his bones, the cold chill of the Boreal Wastelands sending them knocking together with painful results.<br />
<br />
<b>*kaboom*</b><br />
<br />
The purple-pink energy explosion soon snapped Matthew's mind back to the battle at hand, thankfully distracting him with good news as he saw Psyduck's Future Sight attack land on the money, sending chunks of ice harmlessly skidding away. Matthew fist-pumped at the success, the young Pokémon proving faith worked, and one so usually clumsy too! The joy was short lived. His face turned from a giant smile to instant despair. Though he assumed a barrage of Mud Bombs to be raining down next, Matthew instead saw his water-type fall to one knee with swirly eyes, before collapsing into the snow. <br />
<br />
“Nooooooooooo” Matthew cried as he sprinted onto the active battlefield, sliding to both knees to pick Psyduck from its position. His inexperienced Pokémon had lost its footing and crumpled from the pain of its earlier wound. Matthew tried to comfort the Pokémon, it had been so long since he had one of his own knocked out, and most of his experience had come in a controlled trainer battle; nothing so brutish and dangerous had come of them, a quick Pokémon Centre visit had them back up and running, but no such luxury seemed close here. “Stay with me Psyduck. It'll be okay. You did a great job”<br />
<br />
“Gragh! Deckard, make them pay!” Hugging his fallen Pokémon with wells in his eyes, Matthew's sadness turned to anger as he violently shook, clenching fists and teeth as he demanded revenge, the red mist descending. Without the Pokémon Centre and with only the most-basic of Pokémon supplies Matthew knew the two Ice-types had near condemned his partner to death, the frozen tundra of the Glacier Island one of the harshest climates in all of Fizzy Bubbles, and perhaps the worst place to die. Surrounded by pure nothingness and as cold as cold can be, to breathe your final breath in such a hospitable sh<i>i</i>thole was the worst fate of any. He slammed his palm into the snow, cursing the ice demons.<br />
<br />
Am accumulation from Ice Shards seemed to have Porygon on the ropes as Matthew became repeatedly frustrated by the Froslass' tactic, even against Deckards new fire-typing the ability to out-speed using priority moves and the two-on-one situation had health chipping away at an alarming rate. Even with Deckard's streamlined agile form the computer code Pokémon was finding letting his attack loose to be a problem, the opportunity to Psybeam few and far between.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a break! His hair stood on end as one of the creatures locked into place. Though he didn't know the origin, Porygon managed to blast a beam of multi-coloured energy its way and stop it from breathing. Matthew celebrated with muted angry tones, his aggressive hatred for his opponents noting there was still one more standing in his way. One more thing that had hurt his Pokémon. One more he wanted to smash into tiny pieces and send back to where it came from.<br />
<br />
A small buzzing disturbed him from his rant, the sound of an engine drawing closer. Peering over his shoulder, Matthew was surprised to see a snow-mobile with two people and a Magneton literally right beside him; the battle clearly distracting him enough for the company to sneak up on him with ease. He quickly figured the reason for Froslass' stoppage, Magneton's Thunder Wave, and made a mental note to thank it and its trainer at a later time. <br />
<br />
Helmets blocked Matthew's sight as the two argued over nothing, the ringing in his ears subsiding enough for him to hear most of the conversation … about him. Advice to return his Pokémon and hop on board, sketchy details of more of said creatures coming, arguments over his condition, had he been stabbed by a shard.<br />
<br />
<i>“Hit by a shard? But...”</i> his eyes darted to the downed Pokémon in Psyduck, wanting to scream at the two and interrogate them for information. But he didn't. He held his tongue. He knew very well that these were the only two in a wide radius that could get him to a place for sufficient recovery. The “scouting perimeter” sinking his heart as he comprehended just how far that would be without a snow-mobile. <br />
<br />
The other trainer withdrew his Magneton back into its Pokémon, removing some of the help he desperately needed to disable the fast-moving ice type. They offered an ultimatum, last chance saloon, somewhere “safe” or staying out here. <br />
<br />
The choice was obvious, but his worries still remained. He knew nothing of the people, they could be anything from poachers to Arceus' witnesses. He didn't care, the world was more than black and white, and as long as they weren't Team Rocket he could tolerate the company of criminals and thieves, provided they could tolerate him. On the other hand his last few adventures had gone south quickly due to human interaction, the most trouble coming from backstabbers, two-timers, general people putting greed over themselves, and of course those who took exception to personality. <br />
<br />
But … at this stage what could he do? Froslass was surely a single Psybeam from being KO'd, but the promise of more creatures and its unending speed meant he would have almost no way of countering. He had to accept the offer. Complete strangers or not they were his only hope. The savour he had prayed for.<br />
<br />
“Return!” he snapped, jumping on the back of the snowmobile with haste before withdrawing his Pokémon back into their homes in a flash of red light, before urging the men to leave post-haste. “go go go”<br />
<br />
“My name is Matthew Brown, thanks for the assist back there. I'm a Pokémon trainer originally looking for the Hiel Research Base before I ran into those things. What are they? In all my travel I've never seen a creature like it … it … it formed out of death.” he stammered, eager to hear anything more than he already knew<br />
<br />
His heart beat exceptionally fast as he waited with baited breath on the answer. One of the two mentioned not taking strangers into the camp over fear of being stabbed, and with one stabbed platypus in his arsenal he was taking a huge risk, but it was his only option. He needed their camp for supplies in order to treat Psyduck, and his unwillingness to leave her behind meant he had to risk bringing an infected force into the camp. He prayed that the turn, if it happened, could be controlled in the Pokéball and treated from there, or that the leaders of this “camp” would be understanding, but he knew deep down they were unlikely to be. Just like him they were greedy, the argument to two people had just had showed they were looking out for number one. And who could blame them?<br />
<br />
The other mentioning how few battlers at this camp did intrigue Matthew, giving him the upper hand. Whatever checks and regulations stood in his way, an angry Rhyperior and Aerodactyl combination would surely sway the few to let him bring Psyduck inside, the two capable of taking on an army should they want to. And given Psyduck's condition, they'll sure as hell want to. He would tell them about Psyduck's condition for sure, but first he needed access to the camp …</span><br />

<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> Leaving Kyle and Doduo to fend for themselves is out of the question for you. Even if he has five Heatmor on his side, they seem too powerless to fight back, and you know how reliable the reporter is - no, you're not taking any chances.<br />
<br />
Meowth leaps off your shoulder and waits for an opening to reach the group of anteaters, in hopes of gathering information. Meanwhile, you choose Vernon as your battler to face the Magmar, but instead of ordering it to go on the offensive straight away, you have a different strategy - which, bright as it is, still hinges on a stroke of luck!<br />
<br />
You point your PokeDex at the group of Heatmor, in hopes of scanning their Ability.As you do, you take a closer look at the pack: all but one of them are lying on the ground, cowering and looking severely malnourished. The only one standing, motionless but with a defiant expression, seems in slightly better shape, though just barely...<br />
<br />
- Keith, come on dude, hurry up or we're toast!!<br />
<br />
Doduo has already adopted its battle stance, trying its best to look fierce but coming off as anything but. It's clear as day it is just as frightened as Kyle, but it's not backing down. Just then, your Dex finally finishes analyzing the data and relays the information:<br />
<br />
<i>- Heatmor, Female, Level 2; Ability:Gluttony // Heatmor, Female, Level 3, Ability: Gluttony. // Heatmor, Male, Level 1, Ability: Gluttony. // Heatmor, Female, Level 3, Ability: Gluttony.</i><br />
<br />
You begin to despair; how unlucky can a guy be? Thenagain, that explains why all four of the Heatmor on the ground look so incredibly famished. Finally, your Dex scans the final Heatmor, the one still standing...<br />
<br />
<i>- Heatmor, Male, Level 8, Ability: Flash Fire.</i><br />
<br />
That's it! You quickly instruct Vernon to use Role Play on the last Heatmor, to which he promptly complies. He emits a glowing purple sphere that travels toward the fire anteater, then returns to the Tauros and vanishes inside his body. The Magmar remain oblivious to your presence, focused solely on Kyle and the Pokemon with him... The reporter is clearly biding his time, avoiding direct confrontation if he can; you have a feeling Doduo won't last long the second it engages the Spitfire Pokemon...<br />
<br />
Vernon takes aim and summons several sharp stones, which begin to circle his body; taking advantage of his foes having their back turned, he unleashes a Stone Edge barrage that crashes into the Magmar on the left, hitting it so hard that it falls over on its face! Alarmed, the second Magmar turns around and immediately decides to dispose of you first - clearly, your Tauros is the biggest threat in the room.<br />
<br />
Through all the commotion, Meowth nimbly maneuvers between the two foes, both focused on larger foes, and successfully makes his way toward the pack of Heatmor behind Kyle. They look at him with apprehension but seemingly open up after a while, though you can't make out what they're saying; you'll have to wait until Meowth gets back to you...<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, Kyle seems to have found his guts and yells instructions to Doduo, in a desperate attempt to be helpful.<br />
<br />
- Alright Doduo, his back is turned, let him have it! <b>Quick Attack</b>!<br />
<br />
The two-headed bird nods, faking bravery, and dashes forward at lightning-speed, slamming its whole body weight against the distracted Magmar. The hit doesn't prove nearly as powerful as Vernon's Stone Edge, as the Magmar merely loses its footing temporarily and turns around in a swift motion, decking Doduo with a massive <b>Fire Punch</b> that almost knocks it out clean! Angered, the Spitfire Pokemon grabs the bird by one of its necks and hoists it off the ground. Its fist becomes covered in flames again as it prepares to land one final hit on the annoying Doduo...<br />
<br />
- Doduo NO! Come on buddy, snap out of it!<br />
<br />
Kyle's encouragement is to no avail, as the bird helplessly swings its legs in the air unable to break free from the enemy's grasp... And just as you thought things were bad, the Magmar you hit earlier recovers, stands back up and spits a powerful <b>Flame Burst</b> right at Vernon!<br />
<br />
With so much going on at the same time, what do you do?! </span></span> <br />

<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Treepandaone</u>:</b> Survival takes center stage; although Deckard could probably hold its own against the lone remaining Froslass, you decide it's not worth the risk, especially if these two men are telling the truth - if more of these creatures really are approaching, then you need to get the hell out.<br />
<br />
For now, you reason it's in your ebst interest not to let them know about your Psyduck's condition, especially since that seems to make or break the deal of being accepted into their camp. You're still not sure why, but from what you've gathered so far, you have a pretty good idea...<br />
<br />
You introduce yourself and make your original intentions known; one of the men (the owner of Magneton) scoffs at your quest for the Research Base and sounds bitter as he starts explaining.<br />
<br />
- Hiel Research Center... nowadays that's about as real as freaking Atlantis! We came from the base, but not much research happens there anymore. We're lucky if we survive, especially if we're bringing in extra mouths to feed...<br />
<br />
The other man, the one driving the snowmobile, cuts his partner off, visibly annoyed at his remarks, and addresses you more politely.<br />
<br />
- We're scientists, or we used to be... I'm Jacob and this is Daryl. We worked at Hiel up until a couple of months ago, conducting research on the effects of the aurora borealis on the local wildlife. Nowadays, not much work gets done except fighting for our lives... Those creatures you met back there, they aren't regular Froslass. Like you said, they're born of death. We call them &quot;Shards&quot;, because of how they kill their prey in order to multiply... They rise out of any creature killed by their corrupted Ice Shards, human and Pokemon alike - the moment you're stabbed, you're pretty much done.<br />
We're not sure how it started, but we lost a huge number of people before we managed to seal off the Base; that's why Daryl here is so reluctant to bring you in, don't hold it against him. We're all a bit on edge...<br />
<br />
You're left to ponder on Jacob's words: &quot;the moment you're stabbed, you're pretty much done&quot;... What looked like a regular Ice Shard attack against a Water-Type Pokemon is shaping up to be something a lot more serious after all. It did seem odd for such an attack to leave that grievous of a wound as to knock out Psyduck...<br />
<br />
But now what? Do you reveal the truth to Jacob and Daryl - that you're carrying a potentially &quot;infected&quot; Pokemon - and risk losing entry into the Base? If that happens, you'll be denied the medical attention your friend so desperately needs...<br />
On the other hand, these guys were selfless enough to rescue you, regardless of any ulterior motives they may have had; don't you owe them the truth, after all they worked to keep their survival camp safe? And what will happen to you if they find out <i>after</i> they've let you in?<br />
<br />
You're faced with a moral dilemma as the Research Center comes into view... What will you do? </span></span> <br />

<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> Leaving Kyle and Doduo to fend for themselves is out of the question for you. Even if he has five Heatmor on his side, they seem too powerless to fight back, and you know how reliable the reporter is - no, you're not taking any chances.<br />
<br />
Meowth leaps off your shoulder and waits for an opening to reach the group of anteaters, in hopes of gathering information. Meanwhile, you choose Vernon as your battler to face the Magmar, but instead of ordering it to go on the offensive straight away, you have a different strategy - which, bright as it is, still hinges on a stroke of luck!<br />
<br />
You point your PokeDex at the group of Heatmor, in hopes of scanning their Ability.As you do, you take a closer look at the pack: all but one of them are lying on the ground, cowering and looking severely malnourished. The only one standing, motionless but with a defiant expression, seems in slightly better shape, though just barely...<br />
<br />
- Keith, come on dude, hurry up or we're toast!!<br />
<br />
Doduo has already adopted its battle stance, trying its best to look fierce but coming off as anything but. It's clear as day it is just as frightened as Kyle, but it's not backing down. Just then, your Dex finally finishes analyzing the data and relays the information:<br />
<br />
<i>- Heatmor, Female, Level 2; Ability:Gluttony // Heatmor, Female, Level 3, Ability: Gluttony. // Heatmor, Male, Level 1, Ability: Gluttony. // Heatmor, Female, Level 3, Ability: Gluttony.</i><br />
<br />
You begin to despair; how unlucky can a guy be? Thenagain, that explains why all four of the Heatmor on the ground look so incredibly famished. Finally, your Dex scans the final Heatmor, the one still standing...<br />
<br />
<i>- Heatmor, Male, Level 8, Ability: Flash Fire.</i><br />
<br />
That's it! You quickly instruct Vernon to use Role Play on the last Heatmor, to which he promptly complies. He emits a glowing purple sphere that travels toward the fire anteater, then returns to the Tauros and vanishes inside his body. The Magmar remain oblivious to your presence, focused solely on Kyle and the Pokemon with him... The reporter is clearly biding his time, avoiding direct confrontation if he can; you have a feeling Doduo won't last long the second it engages the Spitfire Pokemon...<br />
<br />
Vernon takes aim and summons several sharp stones, which begin to circle his body; taking advantage of his foes having their back turned, he unleashes a Stone Edge barrage that crashes into the Magmar on the left, hitting it so hard that it falls over on its face! Alarmed, the second Magmar turns around and immediately decides to dispose of you first - clearly, your Tauros is the biggest threat in the room.<br />
<br />
Through all the commotion, Meowth nimbly maneuvers between the two foes, both focused on larger foes, and successfully makes his way toward the pack of Heatmor behind Kyle. They look at him with apprehension but seemingly open up after a while, though you can't make out what they're saying; you'll have to wait until Meowth gets back to you...<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, Kyle seems to have found his guts and yells instructions to Doduo, in a desperate attempt to be helpful.<br />
<br />
- Alright Doduo, his back is turned, let him have it! <b>Quick Attack</b>!<br />
<br />
The two-headed bird nods, faking bravery, and dashes forward at lightning-speed, slamming its whole body weight against the distracted Magmar. The hit doesn't prove nearly as powerful as Vernon's Stone Edge, as the Magmar merely loses its footing temporarily and turns around in a swift motion, decking Doduo with a massive <b>Fire Punch</b> that almost knocks it out clean! Angered, the Spitfire Pokemon grabs the bird by one of its necks and hoists it off the ground. Its fist becomes covered in flames again as it prepares to land one final hit on the annoying Doduo...<br />
<br />
- Doduo NO! Come on buddy, snap out of it!<br />
<br />
Kyle's encouragement is to no avail, as the bird helplessly swings its legs in the air unable to break free from the enemy's grasp... And just as you thought things were bad, the Magmar you hit earlier recovers, stands back up and spits a powerful <b>Flame Burst</b> right at Vernon!<br />
<br />
With so much going on at the same time, what do you do?! </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">Keith's was a brilliant strategy, for sure, but the fact remained that it relied heavily on luck. If all five Heatmor had Gluttony, this wasn't gonna work! It was a tense few moments as Keith's Pokédex scanned the five Fire-types, relaying their genders, levels, and most important, Abilities, one by one on the screen. So of course, the first four Heatmor all seemed to have Gluttony. &quot;Arceus damn it,&quot; Keith muttered, starting to sweat (more than usual, anyway, considering their volcanic surroundings). Kyle's frantic urging did nothing to improve Keith's mood, either, and it was all Keith could do to stop himself from snapping at the bumbling reporter. Instead, he kept his mouth shut and his eyes glued to the Pokédex screen as it started loading the data for the fifth Heatmor. Male... Level 8... Flash Fire!<br />
<br />
&quot;That one, Vernon!&quot; Keith exclaimed, pointing at the one Heatmor that wasn't looking quite as malnourished as his companions looked. &quot;<b>Role Play</b> now!&quot; The Tauros was only too happy to oblige, and a purple orb floated out of the Tauros's body, over to the Heatmor Keith indicated, and then back into Vernon. &quot;Great, Vernon!&quot; grinned Keith. &quot;Now, <b>Stone Edge</b>! Go!&quot;<br />
<br />
The Tauros bellowed as it unleashed a barrage of sharpened stones at the Magmar on the left. And it was at that moment that the pair of Fire-types realized just who the larger threat in the room was. Meowth used this distraction as his opening to approach the pack of Heatmor. Apprehensive though they appeared at first, they soon seemed to open up to Meowth and appeared to be answering him. Just what they were saying was anyone's guess (except Meowth's) at this point- Keith was gonna have to wait for Meowth to get back to him and relay the information. For now, the battle was his priority.<br />
<br />
Kyle and Doduo were bravely getting into the fray, but Doduo was in trouble- the Twin Bird Pokémon had tried hitting the other Magmar with a <b>Quick Attack</b>, but the move proved almost ineffective, seeming to only serve to annoy the Magmar, who retaliated with a forceful <b>Fire Punch</b>, nearly KOing the Twin Bird Pokémon in one hit! Then the Magmar picked Doduo up by one of its necks and prepared to finish it off, while the first Magmar managed to get back up and spew a <b>Flame Burst</b> right at Vernon! Keith, however, wasn't worried- Vernon's Role Play went off without a hitch, he saw it happen himself. Vernon had acquired Flash Fire, so that Flame Burst wasn't gonna do a damn thing to his Tauros!<br />
<br />
&quot;Vernon, take that Flame Burst!&quot; Keith instructed. &quot;Then go straight into a <b>Rock Climb</b> attack on the one holding Doduo, and hit the other one with another <b>Stone Edge</b>!&quot;</span></span></div>

<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u> Electric Blue Eye</u>:</b> <i>((Actually I find this to be one of your better replies so far, with a nice amount of character development, that’s what I like to see! Keep it up ^^))</i><br />
<br />
Upon hearing your reply, Sean’s expression darkens further. It’s clearly not what he wanted to hear. He whispers again with a worried look on his face.<br />
<br />
-	Damn it. Whatever you do, give the plates to <i>nobody</i>! I’ll explain later, there are all kinds of eyes watching and not all of them can be trusted. For now, let’s do what they expect of us.<br />
<br />
The Gym Leader walks back to his Trainer area, and you do the same. At his gesture, the regular clay arena sinks in to the ground and a new one rises to take its place: a large pool with several round stone platforms placed randomly, a field ideal for aquatic Pokemon but adapted to allow land dwellers to fight as well. The audience’s voices roar louder than ever as the time to fight draws near, but the taciturn Gym leader doesn’t seem the least bit phased by the crowd’s cheers. You find yourself regretting you didn’t conduct your research faster last night, since the power went out just before you could read the data about Sean’s team… The Gym Leader clears his throat and assumes his designated role, much to the audience’s delight.<br />
<br />
-	Ethan, show us what you’ve got! Honor our Champion and give it your all!<br />
<br />
He takes a Lure Ball from his belt and calls the first of his three chosen Pokemon. The device snaps open as Sean calls out to creature inside:<br />
<br />
-	You’re up… Quagsire!<br />
<br />
The goofy-looking bipedal Water/Ground-Type Pokemon materializes on one of the platforms, but you know it can fight just as well underwater. You recall reading how Sean’s greatest virtue was his versatility in combat, and it’s beginning to show right from the start.<br />
Once again the crowd erupts in cheers at the sight of Sean’s choice of Pokemon, and the anticipation of your own pick. Now’s the time to choose…<br />
<br />
Who do you send out to battle?</span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver">Sean didn’t look pleased hearing what Ethan had to say, and for a brief moment the young trainer began to wonder if he had just upset the man that had left him the note, but then the Gym Leader whispered back with…<br />
<br />
&quot;…Whatever you do, give the plates to <i>nobody</i>! I’ll explain later, there are all kinds of eyes watching and not all of them can be trusted. For now, let’s do what they expect of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan nodded his head in understanding as they let go of their hands and both began to move to their designated circles, it wasn’t long before the regular clay arena began to sink into the floor and a new one rose in its place. <br />
<br />
The young trainer wasn’t that surprised with the choice of arena, a pool with several round stone platforms placed randomly on top of the water. Water Type Trainer = Water Type Arena.<br />
<br />
The roar of the crowd grew louder as Sean threw out his first Pokémon, Quagsire. It made sense after reading his bio that Sean would have a Pokémon capable of fighting above and below water.<br />
<br />
Ethan sighed, closing his eyes and taking in a deep breath…<br />
<br />
Whether Sean could be trusted still remained to be seen, for all that he knew Sean was playing him like a fiddle, but it wasn’t like he had much of anything to go on, at least for now it didn’t hurt to play along. If anything, Ethan was going to use this battle as an opportunity to test the Gym Leader to see if he was trustworthy or not. A person that truly loves Pokémon couldn’t be evil, right? <br />
<br />
&quot;Sab?&quot; the creature looked on, wondering what Pokémon his trainer would choose.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is it then!&quot; Ethan said, before opening his eyes again and reaching for his Dive Ball unclipping it from his belt and holding it in his palm.<br />
<br />
Ethan smiled, &quot;Sean this is my first Pokémon battle with a Gym Leader, and I plan to win!&quot; right now he didn’t want to think about the Plates or whomever was after them, what he wanted now was to lose himself into battle.<br />
<br />
Pressing the center of the ball Ethan threw the capsule up high in the air, &quot;Diego! I need your assistance!&quot; before a Male Jellicent materialized from out of the ball with a white and silvery light onto one of the platforms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get ready old friend, we are about to have ourselves a battle for the ages. Start off with an <b>Ice Beam</b>, freezing any chance of him getting into the water, then <b>absorb</b> his energy, and go into a <b>Giga Drain</b>!&quot;<br />

<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> <i>((Welcome to my group, hope you have a good time and enjoy your new adventure! ^^))</i><br />
<br />
Fresh off a fruitful journey across the Arcane Realm, as dictated by the powers that be, you now find yourself free to pursue your lifelong dreams – becoming a Master Coordinator and the foremost authority in a recently discovered form of special evolution, of which very little is known for now. You figure the best place to get started is the main City of the Cascadia Archipelago, the bustling metropolis known as Salin. And what better way to get directions than in the meeting point for any and all travelling trainers – the local Pokemon Center?<br />
<br />
Soon after you walk inside and approach the counter, your expression lights up when you spot Ethan on a nearby monitor; to most of the other people sitting around in the lounge area of the Pokemon Center, he may be a complete stranger about to fight in the Grand Farewell, but to you he’s someone close and special, and seeing him out there fulfilling his dream fills you with joy. And if he gets to fulfill his life’s goal, then so shall you!<br />
<br />
With renewed determination, you turn to the nurse and ask about the existence of Contest Halls in Salin City. The woman looks at you with an apologetic smile and delivers the news.<br />
<br />
-	Oh dear, I’m terribly sorry, I guess you didn’t know… Contests are pretty much a thing of the past, I’m afraid. It’s been over four years since the last official Tournament was held in all of Fizzy Bubbles, and despite ongoing talks that they might return at some point, truth is nothing seems to point in that direction… all everyone cares about these days is good old Pokemon Battles, which is a bit of a shame really...<br />
<br />
You feared this might be the answer. You’re aware that Contest Halls everywhere have been closed for years now, and that no such thing as a professional circuit exists anymore. Qualified referees have long since retired, and unfortunately it seems not even this massive city, full of shops and Gyms, can offer what you so desperately seek. Disheartened, you thank the nurse for her time and turn around to leave… until you’re approached by someone who taps you on the shoulder lightly.<br />
<br />
It’s an old man, probably in his seventies, with a scruffy white beard, thick glasses and a green flannel shirt; he is slightly hunched over and about your own height, and he’s smiling right at you.<br />
<br />
-	Say young lady… I couldn’t help but overhear your conversation. You seem to have an interest in performing with your Pokemon partners, is that right? So many have lost interest in that art… Tell me something dear: in your heart of hearts, what do Contests truly mean to you?<br />
<br />
Could this old man tell you something more about Contests than that young nurse did? Maybe it’s worth humoring him for a while…<br />
He eagerly waits for your reply, though you’re not sure what he means; is there even a right or a wrong answer to his question?...</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver">Liza’s expression turned from a happy one to a sad one as the nurse was telling her of the bad news that contests hadn’t existed in the land in Fizzy Bubbles for over four years and though there were recent talks of bringing them back, nothing had been done to confirm these rumors to be true. The professional referees had all gone and retired leaving the land with no sense of self expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; The young lass said dismissing herself from the nurse before a light tap of the shoulder had caught her attention; she turned around where she came to find an old man smiling back at her. He looked to be around seventy with a scruffy white bread, thick glasses and a green flannel shirt. He was about her height with his back slightly hunched over.<br />
<br />
Liza half expected that the old man would probably ask her to tell him how to get to a certain place in the city, she was all ready to tell him she had just arrived a few minutes ago herself before he began to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say young lady… I couldn’t help but overhear your conversation. You seem to have an interest in performing with your Pokemon partners, is that right? So many have lost interest in that art… Tell me something dear: in your heart of hearts, what do Contests truly mean to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>What do Contest mean to me?</i><br />
<br />
Liza smiled at the old man before answering &quot;Contests are my childhood. Growing up I’d watch coordinators perform with their Pokémon, side by side displaying beautiful works of art on a single stage. It wouldn’t be about battling, it would be about telling a story to the audience of your experiences, your travels, whether they are triumphs or defeats, happy memories or sad ones. <br />
<br />
It’s nothing like battles, and that’s probably the reason why many have lost interest in it…but let me ask you a question, when was the last time you saw a Piplup defeat a Charizard in a clean fight or seen a Caterpie out shine a Charmander? Practically never, right?<br />
<br />
Well in contests you can do just that! It doesn’t matter how strong you or are lucky you turn out to be but rather how much of an effort both you as a trainer and your Pokémon partner place within each other in what you do!&quot; she said &quot;But I guess that doesn’t matter anymore…&quot; she sighed.<br />
<br />
She looked down at the ground as her Litwick floated from off of her head next to her <i>Mama?</i> the little ghost giving her trainer an empathetic look.<br />
<br />
&quot;I best look for something else to do in this town…I’d hate it to be a waste of a trip.&quot; she said before beginning to leave…<br />

<b><u>Boreal Wastelands</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Treepandaone</u>:</b> Survival takes center stage; although Deckard could probably hold its own against the lone remaining Froslass, you decide it's not worth the risk, especially if these two men are telling the truth - if more of these creatures really are approaching, then you need to get the hell out.<br />
<br />
For now, you reason it's in your ebst interest not to let them know about your Psyduck's condition, especially since that seems to make or break the deal of being accepted into their camp. You're still not sure why, but from what you've gathered so far, you have a pretty good idea...<br />
<br />
You introduce yourself and make your original intentions known; one of the men (the owner of Magneton) scoffs at your quest for the Research Base and sounds bitter as he starts explaining.<br />
<br />
- Hiel Research Center... nowadays that's about as real as freaking Atlantis! We came from the base, but not much research happens there anymore. We're lucky if we survive, especially if we're bringing in extra mouths to feed...<br />
<br />
The other man, the one driving the snowmobile, cuts his partner off, visibly annoyed at his remarks, and addresses you more politely.<br />
<br />
- We're scientists, or we used to be... I'm Jacob and this is Daryl. We worked at Hiel up until a couple of months ago, conducting research on the effects of the aurora borealis on the local wildlife. Nowadays, not much work gets done except fighting for our lives... Those creatures you met back there, they aren't regular Froslass. Like you said, they're born of death. We call them &quot;Shards&quot;, because of how they kill their prey in order to multiply... They rise out of any creature killed by their corrupted Ice Shards, human and Pokemon alike - the moment you're stabbed, you're pretty much done.<br />
We're not sure how it started, but we lost a huge number of people before we managed to seal off the Base; that's why Daryl here is so reluctant to bring you in, don't hold it against him. We're all a bit on edge...<br />
<br />
You're left to ponder on Jacob's words: &quot;the moment you're stabbed, you're pretty much done&quot;... What looked like a regular Ice Shard attack against a Water-Type Pokemon is shaping up to be something a lot more serious after all. It did seem odd for such an attack to leave that grievous of a wound as to knock out Psyduck...<br />
<br />
But now what? Do you reveal the truth to Jacob and Daryl - that you're carrying a potentially &quot;infected&quot; Pokemon - and risk losing entry into the Base? If that happens, you'll be denied the medical attention your friend so desperately needs...<br />
On the other hand, these guys were selfless enough to rescue you, regardless of any ulterior motives they may have had; don't you owe them the truth, after all they worked to keep their survival camp safe? And what will happen to you if they find out <i>after</i> they've let you in?<br />
<br />
You're faced with a moral dilemma as the Research Center comes into view... What will you do? </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">OoC: :O. Awesome.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: lightblue">The loud whir of the snowmobile's engine filled the air as the tracks skidded away from the Froslass with ease; outspeeding the demonic creature and leaving it for dust, allowing Matthew to have a conversation with the three men. His heart and mind were torn about telling them the truth, he cared about his companion more than his own life but such people could be about to risked everything for his sake. Pings of guilt spread across his mind like a radar, the insufferable weight crushing his soul as it disagreed with his evil intentions. He had been caught up in an anger, clouding his vision and upon his return he couldn't bear to keep secrets from the two people who had provided him salvation. <br />
<br />
The two men discussed the Hiel Research Base with opposing opinions as Matthew listened intently, curious to know more of the place he had been searching. Magneton's owner had Matthew rubbed the wrong way from the get-go, despite the earlier intervention and help with the hell-spawn, the implication that Matthew would be a deadweight irked the Pokémon trainer. A moment of respite and silence had Matthew reflect on his actions once more. Perhaps he was right? Already he hadn't planned to tell them of his Pokémon's condition, and risked the lives of more than just himself in this deal. He was wrong to think like that, and the idea that he would worried him even more. Perhaps he wasn't the same person as all those years ago. Before his absence he trusted everyone, willing to go the extra mile to save people and risk himself, but here he was being as greedy and the opposition he once swore to counter. He was the bad guy here, and the Magenton's owner had him nailed down to a T. The extra mouth to feed. The excess baggage. The nuisance. <br />
<br />
The snowmobile glide across the white canvas below like a breeze, zooming through the pristine glory of nature, the exposed transportation giving heed to a wide landscape of pure beauty and the fierce cutting air reminded him of the savagery that lay in companionship right beside it. The two men continued to talk, the rider cutting off the other and introducing themselves. Jacob and Daryl. Matthew listened as they explained the situation, their origins of science and the aurora borealis. <br />
<br />
Come to think of it, Matthew had never seen the famous light show in real life, just pictures from the internet. He always had a fascination with the wide expanse of space, and his own fight for life cut his sky-searching before he could even consider the possibility of the northern lights. He mused to himself that should he survive this ordeal, he would release all his Pokémon and stay long enough for the entire group to see. A glimmer of hope at the end of the tunnel. Another reason to fight.<br />
<br />
“We call them &quot;Shards&quot;, because of how they kill their prey in order to multiply... They rise out of any creature killed by their corrupted Ice Shards, human and Pokemon alike - the moment you're stabbed, you're pretty much done”<br />
<br />
Matthew's ears began to ring as he heard Jacob say the words he had been dreading the entire ride, his head feeling light and his gut feeling like it needed to throw up. Psyduck had fallen to a single stab, and while its willpower had left it enough to aid in battle, the water type had become KO'd from a single shot. The battle begun to make sense as Matthew added up the pieces, his eyes drifting in an out of consciousness as he replayed the battle ten-fold. He screamed inside, the words “pretty much done” and “corruption” swirling around like a vortex of bad news. He almost couldn't believe it.<br />
<br />
“But... but Psyduck was hit by a shard.” he said blankly, pulling out the platypus' Pokéball from his belt and lifting it up to his face. “She … she got hit by one of those things and was knocked out a few minutes later. Is … is there nothing you can do? There must be. Please”<br />
<br />
He wasn't sure who he was begging to, the scientists or a force above. It didn't matter. An aura of disbelief surrounded his words, as if the trainer couldn't comprehend the seriousness of the situation, but he did. It was classic human arrogance; the idea of living forever, the creation of religion and afterlife, medicine and instant cures. Everybody thinks they'll live forever. The remains of the research base came into view as Matthew's breath began to become short, the conception of Psyduck's demise coming so soon after its birth was devastating. Whatever outcome lay ahead would almost certainly be the biggest challenge of all his adventures …</span></span></div>

<b><u>The SS Leviathan Shipwreck</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>CyberBlastoise</u>:</b> With the only two Pokemon in your possession being fish, land battles are virtually unwinnable. Quite the predicament, since there seem to be several areas of this ship that haven’t been flooded. What at first seemed like good news suddenly sank in as a terrifying reality – you can’t survive in water and you can’t battle on land. How are you supposed to make it out of here safely?!<br />
<br />
Your gut tells you to get the hell out of here. With no means to bring the fight to this terrifying opponent, fleeing is your only option, and you decide to go through the door on your left at the last second. Anything is better than standing still and being eaten alive by a ghost, and you seem to recall having entered the ship from starboard, meaning left is the side of the ship you haven’t explored. Jolting to the side, you slam your whole body weight against the rotting door… and the wood gives in, crumbling into a hundred pieces while you burst into the room!<br />
<br />
You tumble to floor down hard, not waiting the door to break so easily. But nevermind the pain, what about Jellicent?! You look over your shoulder, scared that the foe might have followed you inside... but there’s no side of it! The chill you felt earlier has vanished too, as if the ghostly presence had evaporated... You’re certain it wasn’t a mirage, but the place once gain feels as deserted as it did before. This doesn’t make any sense…<br />
<br />
You pull yourself back up and look around. The room, like most of the area you’ve explored thus far, almost completely dark; what little light fills the area is being given off by weird-looking mushrooms that have grown in the humid environment of the sunken ship’s confines.

Your eyes have adjusted to the low clarity of the room by now and you start scouting the room. It seems to have been a storage room at some point, but whatever goods it may have contained have long been destroyed. There is nothing of interest in the place, and with the Jellicent seemingly gone, you have to decide where to go now. There are only two doors leading out of the room other than the one you came in from. One on the far wall, and one on the wall to your left. You see a blueish-white smoke seeping in from beneath the first door, and as you approach it, an all-too familiar chill runs down your spine again, just like before. Could it be?...<br />
You turn to the other door, which is already half open, and there’s nothing remarkable about it. Except… your eyes shift from the door to the ground, and your stomach turns. Leading all the way from the door you came in from to the half-open one on the left, a trail of dry blood fills the floor. How did you not notice this before?! <br />
<br />
An open door with a path of blood and a closed one with ominous mist… Which one do you go through?</span></span>

Bill slammed arm first into the door, not expecting the wood to have rotted that much. In fact, the door splintered easily, but sadly the trainer was still going. Eventually he slammed directly into the wall across from the doorway before falling over onto the floor directly below. &quot;That could have gone a lot better.&quot; Instinctively, he looked over his shoulder to see how much time he had left before the Jellicent could get to him, but to his surprise nothing was there...was that just an illusion? No, Bill remembered the cold atmosphere from before and that was no illusion...wait before? So now the cold is gone too, odd. He had seen paranormal stuff before, but he was prepared those times, this time, not so much...in fact he was expected just a typical treasure hunt. <br />
<br />
Bill picked himself up to survey the room from before. Nothing much except a few glowing mushrooms here and there, growing full well without any form of light or nutrient but rotten wood. Well, if we was going to be stuck on this ship, he would have to eat something, hopefully these mushrooms aren't too poisonous. He plucked a couple of them just in case. After placing the mushrooms into his sack, he looked around the room. This was where the cargo was stored, and possibly where any treasure would have been as well, and maybe a few other things like food and medical supplies. Either way, what wasn't already taken out by treasure thieves and the government was either destroyed or worthless. Nothing worth staying for at least. He noticed that the room had three exits, the one that he entered in, one towards the back of the ship* and one next to where he hit the wall earlier. However, the other two doors that he didn't enter had their own interests.<br />
<br />
The one to the back of the ship was half-open, but what was even more interesting was the trail of dried blood. What the hell happened here? Well, that was a mystery for another time, maybe...the other door didn't fare much better in the creepiness meter however, as bluish-white smoke started filling the floor underneath it, then he felt that chill once again. That Jellicent from before could still be lurking nearby as well. So his choices were take a chance with the dried out blood, or take the chance with the the bloody floor. He started towards the open door as that was the safer option, but before he stepped into the next room, his curiosity got the better of him. Not only was the other way closer to his destination, but it was also filled with paranormal activity, it had to be. He couldn't help himself, even with the Lumineon in danger, his curious nature would once again get the better of him. He approached the door with the white smoke flowing ever so smoothly outside the door and slowly he opened the door, ready to go through it and hopefully get through whatever room this was to get to the other side of the ship.<br />
<br />
*I'm assuming that this is towards the back since I was going starboard earlier and you said to my left<br />

<br />
<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> The situation is dire - not so much for Vernon, who is now immune to fire, nor the Heatmor pack whom you manage to draw the attackers' attention away from. The one in real danger is Kyle's Doduo, who caws and squirms to get out of Magmar's hold to no avail.<br />
<br />
Your Tauros flinches briefly when ordered to stand there and take the incoming Flame Burst like a man, but he trusts you implicitly. Spreading its four legs to establish a wider base, Vernon closes its eyes just as the fireball is about to make contact... and sure enough, nothing happens! The flames explode all around the bull and are swiftly absorbed into his body, leaving Vernon without a scratch, just as you planned. Surprised but relieved, your partner nods with renewed confidence and prepares to retaliate!<br />
<br />
But it seems to be too late. Magmar squeezes Doduo's neck, making the respective head cry in pain while the other helplessly tries to peck the Fire-Type to no avail. Fire surrounds the foe's free hand; it pulls its fist back, ready to deliver the final blow... until a rock hits it square on the head and breaks its focus!<br />
<br />
- Leave him alone you monster! You duck-faced lava-lover! Wanna bully someone? You're an embarrassment to your species!<br />
<br />
Kyle screams frantically, doing anything he can to divert Magmar's attention away from his beloved Doduo. His shouts and insults seem to do the trick, as the Spitfire Pokemon interrupts its Fire Punch and turns its head to the puny human who dared defy it.<br />
<br />
That's the opening you needed! Vernon gathers energy in its front legs and his hooves grow and sharpen. The Tauros bolts forward and tramples the distracted Magmar underfoot after leaping on top of it. The opponent collapses under Tauros's weight and lets go of Doduo, who hurries back to his Trainer while gasping for air. That was close!<br />
<br />
The other Magmar, still seething over the complete ineffectiveness of its Flame Burst, refuses to be humiliated again. It closes in on Vernon while he was busy with Rock Climb, and just as the opportunity presents itself, the Fire-Type rams into the Tauros with a vicious <b>Cross Chop</b>! Vernon falls over in pain, meanwhile allowing the Magmar it had just attacked to get back up and rejoin its friend. The two opponents now tower over your fallen partner and prepare to dispose of the threat together, both grinning widely as they approach him with their arms crossed again...<br />
<br />
Just when all seems lost, Doduo and the strongest Heatmor you scanned earlier leap into action; this time around Doduo successfully lands a <b>Peck</b> barrage on one of the Magmar, while the Heatmor crashes into the other with a forceful <b>Tackle</b>! Vernon appreciates the aid, struggles back to his feet and summons another ring of sharp stones. Eyes glimmering with rage, the Tauros unleashes the rocks against the Magmar stunned by Doduo, each of the boulders finding its mark, and the Fire-Type falls on its back... unconscious! Magmar is knocked out! <b>Vernon gains 1 Level!</b><br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the second Magmar continues to brawl with Heatmor; although it is clearly stronger than the anteater, its moves are sluggish as it's still feeling the effects of Vernon's Rock Climb, allowing Heatmor to keep up. It isn't until the foe realizes its partner has been vanquished that it finally stands down, frightened by the sudden shift in the numbers game - he's now outnumbered 3 to 1, and seems to have lost the will to fight. It steps back, away from Heatmor, and looks around for an exit... until something happens.<br />
<br />
<b><i>&quot;WEAKLING.&quot;</i></b><br />
<br />
The booming voice rings in your head, though no actual sound is heard, and immediately afterwards another tremor is felt across the cave, although this one is quick to subside. But when it does, a huge boulder falls from the ceiling without warning... and crushes the Magmar underneath.<br />
<br />
- Holy crap!! What the hell just happened?!<br />
<br />
Kyle is in shock, and with good reason. He probably also heard the same voice as you, and now this happens?! There's no way Magmar survived that... was this some sort of twisted punishment for its cowardice, or just an incredible coincidence?<br />
There's a brief moment of stunned silence as you, Kyle, Vernon, Doduo and Heatmor all look at the massive rock. What if some unknown force in this mountain has the power to kill those inside on a whim? Is any of you safe? What on earth is going on?<br />
<br />
Meowth returns from his conversation with the other Heatmor and nudges you on the leg until you give him proper attention. He relays all the information he got with a concerned look on his face: the Heatmor speak of the same &quot;Great One&quot; that the wild Torkoal from before also mentioned. They say It rules over all life on Aduro Island and resides at the core of Mt Aduro, the mountain you're currently in; It is responsible for maintaining certain volcanoes active and others dormant, watching over the balance of the Island and the well-being of its inhabitants... those It deems worthy, that is.<br />
The Heatmor say that the Great One regards strength and self-sufficiency as the ultimate qualities; It actively looks to dispose of Pokemon he considers weak for lacking those traits, enforcing Its own process of &quot;natural&quot; selection - ensuring that the only inhabitants of Aduro Island are the ones It considers worthy. Magcargo and Magmar are among those It favors, and recruits them to eliminate &quot;less adequate&quot; species. Others It deemed unworthy have turned on other equally inept Pokemon in hopes of gaining the Great One's favor, which is the case with many Torkoal and other species that can't simply feed off lava.<br />
These are the last remaining Heatmor on all of Aduro Island, and they claim they're about to disappear as well. The Great One diverted the flow of the lava rivers to flood the few remaining Durant nests on Mt Aduro, effectively eliminating their main source of food, and sent Its favored servants to hunt down the few Heatmor that survived. But even if they manage to somehow fend off the attackers, they are doomed to die of starvation. But they say at least they'll die together as a family, concludes a visibly-emotional Meowth.<br />
<br />
Kyle nods in agreement.<br />
<br />
- That's what I meant when I said I had a conspiracy to look into. It was clear that Aduro, known for its abundance of different Fire-Types, had a recent shift in its fauna. When I came here to get the scoop, I expected to find poachers or some other kind of shady criminal deal... but I never expected it to be the workings of a higher being. If this is the will of the god of Aduro, maybe we shouldn't interfere... The Heatmor look to have accepted their fate too. It's how nature works, I'm not sure we should be fighting it... Besides, we've all just witnessed what happens when the Great One is upset! Come on Keith, let's get the hell out of here. I've heard many reports from highly credible sources about a millenium-old treasure hidden in Mt Infernus... what do you say?<br />
<br />
Well... what <i>do</i> you say? </span></span> <br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u> Electric Blue Eye</u>:</b> Sean awaits patiently for your choice of Pokemon. The second Diego materializes on the battlefield, a faint smile crosses his lips, pleased with your choice of counter - a Gym Leader is expected to know the all strengths and limitations of his preferred type, and even though Jellicent holds no type advantage over Quagsire, the entire picture has already formed in Sean's mind - Diego can maneuver just as well as Quagsire in and out of water, has access to Grass moves and almost none of Quagsire's attacks are particularly effective against Ghosts.<br />
<br />
- A fine choice Ethan. Show me what you got.<br />
<br />
Quagsire's expression is its usual goofy one. It stares blankly at Diego for about a minute before smiling and waving at him. Sean waits for your instructions and immediately formulates his own strategy as he hears your orders.<br />
<br />
- <b>Encore</b> his Ice Beam, <b>Yawn</b> and close with <b>Amnesia</b>.<br />
<br />
Diego dutifully releases a stream of frigid energy at the water around them; almost immediately, the arena transforms into an ice ring, effectively stopping either Pokemon from going underwater without breaking through the frozen layer above. As instructed, Quagsire immediately starts applauding, its contagious enthusiasm causing Diego to forget his next moves. Rather than following up with Absorb, the Jellicent fires another Ice Beam, this time aimed at the opponent, who takes it like a champ. The beam hits its mark causing appreciable damage to the part-Ground-Type, but far from enough to defeat it - so much so that Quagsire responds with a casual Yawn, suddenly unimpressed with the repeated attack. Diego is left groggy, and as he prepares to lazily shoot a third Ice Beam, Quagsire's mind tunes out for a moment - in turn greatly increasing his tolerance to special moves. When the third beam connects it barely causes any visible damage, and you're left in a tight spot.<br />
<br />
- I'm in no hurry to finish this. And by the looks of it, neither is Diego.<br />
<br />
Sean sounds slightly amused for once, clearly taking a jab at you to rile you up. You can tell he's eager to see how you respond - Quagsire is now much stronger against energy-based moves (comprising most of Jellicent's arsenal) and you can tell Diego is about to fall asleep - you'll be lucky if he pulls off another move before it happens, not to mention he might still be locked in the Encore... although you did land a couple of hits this turn, the odds are clearly stacked against you!<br />
<br />
What do you do? </span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> The old man looks on as you try your best to define Contests and their meaning; speaking from the heart, you explain the reasons you're drawn to the art of performing rather than battling, stressing the fundamental differences between appeals and battles. And you're right, it's likely that very difference that turns people away from Contests so often - from a very young age, most children are exposed to Pokemon battles, be it in school or on TV. Battles have a much wider audience worldwide, and draw several million viewers on large events. Contests, in comparison, have a much more modest fanbase, and as a form of entertainment it occupies simply a particular niche of the market.<br />
<br />
The elder's expression gives nothing away all the way through, but when you finish he can't help but sport a huge smile. When you turn to leave, disheartened by the current state of affairs in Salin City's Contest scene, he again puts a hand on your shoulder to stop you.<br />
<br />
- Please wait just a little longer. Hearing you speak like that... it reminded me of someone very dear to me. My wife used to talk about Contests just like you do - in a way, she still does. She was quite the champion back in the day... the appeals she came up with were things of beauty, true works of art. She won many Contests in her youth too. She and I travelled all over Fizzy Bubbles - while I challenged a town's Gym Leader, she'd be performing at the local Contest Hall!<br />
<br />
He tears up a little but quickly regains composure.<br />
<br />
- I... I don't want to keep you from your endeavors much longer, but if I could trouble you with a personal request... you are right in saying many people turn away from Contests in this day and age. In fact, their popularity started to dwindle long ago, and with them my wife's happiness... When more and more people began to lose interest in the art, she was forced to step away from the almost non-existent professional circuit. Since she did, she was never the same again... Nothing cheers her up anymore - I can't remember the last time I heard her laugh. I can do nothing to replace what she lost but... maybe you could? Could you please help her relive her dream? A simple appeal, something pretty to lift her heart... I'm sure she'd love to see a youngster who still loves Contests as much as she did.<br />
<br />
He looked down, embarrassed for asking so much of you.<br />
<br />
- I can't bring Contests back to Cascadia, but maybe you could bring Contests back into her life, if only for a moment... but I ask so much of you, with nothing to offer in return! I shouldn't be forcing all this on a stranger, someone so young no less. Please forgive me, this isn't your struggle.<br />
<br />
He pulls out a paper rectangle from his pocket.<br />
<br />
- Sorry for taking so much of your time. I'm glad we got to talk, dear. Here, take it if you want: I purchased a ticket to watch the Grand Farewell but these days I lack the motivation to actually go... you seem to know that young man from the broadcast, so maybe you'd like to watch the Tournament in person? </span></span> <br />

Anything at all.<br />

You feel the snowmobile halt to a stop almost immediately after you finish talking. Daryl turns around and forcefully pushes you off your seat and down to the icy floor.<br />
<br />
- What the f*ck did you say? Are you insane?!<br />
<br />
His voice is filled with rage and apprehension, as if the mere <i>thought</i> of travelling with an infected Pokemon safely stored inside its Ball was enough to contaminate the whole camp from a distance. Daryl looks ready to lay a beating on you until Jacob intervenes to stop things from escalating.<br />

- Calm down please! Daryl, it's not his fault. He was attacked, just like we were in the past. We all lost our Pokemon, you managed to hold on to Magneton but not everyone was so lucky. I wasn't, you remember that. Matthew's Psyduck needs our help and you should be glad he mentioned its infection <i>before</i> we got inside! How many people would do that?<br />
<br />
He gets off the snowmobile and helps you to your feet.<br />
<br />
- Listen, we've learned how to handle early-stage infections but we have to be quick about it, and even then the response to treatment varies with each host. Psyduck will have to be quarantined in a heated room to thaw out any ice particles in her circulation and prevent the corruption from spreading. Having her inside her Ball won't help either... If you trust me, please hand her over and I'll do my best to save her. I can't promise you anything, it's not a flawless method, but it's all we can do.<br />
<br />
He holds out his hand, hoping for an agreement.<br />
<br />
- Also, we'll need to take a look at Porygon as well. It's supposedly a digital creature but I don't know if it can be corrupted. We've realized that Pokemon like Magneton are immune, but a lifeform like Porygon is a complete mystery to us - it's unlikely that it's been infected, but for the sake of everyone inside I can't take any chances. Please... it's the only way I can let you in. </span></span> <br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>CyberBlastoise</u>:</b> Dried blood or eerie mist... neither choice seems right. It seems that whichever door you choose, there will be consequences, and neither give any indication of how you'll get Swift healed up. Because that is still the number one priority.<br />
<br />
Or is it? Common sense tells you to stay away from the familiar blue mist that gives you the chills... but curiosity tells you to go ahead and open the door. Besides, trying the other one meant going to the <i>back</i> of the ship, if your sense of direction doesn't fail you...<br />
<br />
You place a hand on the door handle, turn it and push the door open. A thick layer of neon-blue smoke kicks up, pouring into the storage room you're in, making you cough a couple of times. You look up into the darkness ahead... and one more, overpowering chill runs down your spine while your legs begin to tremble on their own.<br />
<br />
Before you is a long, narrow corridor that stretches into the distance, covered in fog. And amidst the fog you count no less than <i>five</i> male Jellicent, absent-mindedly floating above the ground, casually bumping into each other and against the walls as if they weren't even there. Their moans fill the ship, as well as your very soul with an intense fear even though they haven't even noticed you yet - their mere presence seems to exert some kind of terrifying effect. The mist has a glow of its own that illuminates the hall in its entirety with a faint blue light, allowing you to peer into the distance and see a door on the far end of the corridor. And standing in front of it is a sixth male Jellicent, but green instead of blue...<br />
<br />
Turns out this isn't a sunken ship inhabited by a lone Jellicent... it's a full-on ghost ship! You try to hide behind the door you just opened as you go over your options, now that the mystery of the blue mist has been revealed...<br />
<br />
Will you force your way through the ghost horde, attempt to sneak by, turn back to one of the other doors, or something else entirely? </span></span> <br />

<span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>Aduro Island</i></span><br />
<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> The situation is dire - not so much for Vernon, who is now immune to fire, nor the Heatmor pack whom you manage to draw the attackers' attention away from. The one in real danger is Kyle's Doduo, who caws and squirms to get out of Magmar's hold to no avail.<br />
<br />
Your Tauros flinches briefly when ordered to stand there and take the incoming Flame Burst like a man, but he trusts you implicitly. Spreading its four legs to establish a wider base, Vernon closes its eyes just as the fireball is about to make contact... and sure enough, nothing happens! The flames explode all around the bull and are swiftly absorbed into his body, leaving Vernon without a scratch, just as you planned. Surprised but relieved, your partner nods with renewed confidence and prepares to retaliate!<br />
<br />
But it seems to be too late. Magmar squeezes Doduo's neck, making the respective head cry in pain while the other helplessly tries to peck the Fire-Type to no avail. Fire surrounds the foe's free hand; it pulls its fist back, ready to deliver the final blow... until a rock hits it square on the head and breaks its focus!<br />
<br />
- Leave him alone you monster! You duck-faced lava-lover! Wanna bully someone? You're an embarrassment to your species!<br />
<br />
Kyle screams frantically, doing anything he can to divert Magmar's attention away from his beloved Doduo. His shouts and insults seem to do the trick, as the Spitfire Pokemon interrupts its Fire Punch and turns its head to the puny human who dared defy it.<br />
<br />
That's the opening you needed! Vernon gathers energy in its front legs and his hooves grow and sharpen. The Tauros bolts forward and tramples the distracted Magmar underfoot after leaping on top of it. The opponent collapses under Tauros's weight and lets go of Doduo, who hurries back to his Trainer while gasping for air. That was close!<br />
<br />
The other Magmar, still seething over the complete ineffectiveness of its Flame Burst, refuses to be humiliated again. It closes in on Vernon while he was busy with Rock Climb, and just as the opportunity presents itself, the Fire-Type rams into the Tauros with a vicious <b>Cross Chop</b>! Vernon falls over in pain, meanwhile allowing the Magmar it had just attacked to get back up and rejoin its friend. The two opponents now tower over your fallen partner and prepare to dispose of the threat together, both grinning widely as they approach him with their arms crossed again...<br />
<br />
Just when all seems lost, Doduo and the strongest Heatmor you scanned earlier leap into action; this time around Doduo successfully lands a <b>Peck</b> barrage on one of the Magmar, while the Heatmor crashes into the other with a forceful <b>Tackle</b>! Vernon appreciates the aid, struggles back to his feet and summons another ring of sharp stones. Eyes glimmering with rage, the Tauros unleashes the rocks against the Magmar stunned by Doduo, each of the boulders finding its mark, and the Fire-Type falls on its back... unconscious! Magmar is knocked out! <b>Vernon gains 1 Level!</b><br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the second Magmar continues to brawl with Heatmor; although it is clearly stronger than the anteater, its moves are sluggish as it's still feeling the effects of Vernon's Rock Climb, allowing Heatmor to keep up. It isn't until the foe realizes its partner has been vanquished that it finally stands down, frightened by the sudden shift in the numbers game - he's now outnumbered 3 to 1, and seems to have lost the will to fight. It steps back, away from Heatmor, and looks around for an exit... until something happens.<br />
<br />
<b><i>&quot;WEAKLING.&quot;</i></b><br />
<br />
The booming voice rings in your head, though no actual sound is heard, and immediately afterwards another tremor is felt across the cave, although this one is quick to subside. But when it does, a huge boulder falls from the ceiling without warning... and crushes the Magmar underneath.<br />
<br />
- Holy crap!! What the hell just happened?!<br />
<br />
Kyle is in shock, and with good reason. He probably also heard the same voice as you, and now this happens?! There's no way Magmar survived that... was this some sort of twisted punishment for its cowardice, or just an incredible coincidence?<br />
There's a brief moment of stunned silence as you, Kyle, Vernon, Doduo and Heatmor all look at the massive rock. What if some unknown force in this mountain has the power to kill those inside on a whim? Is any of you safe? What on earth is going on?<br />
<br />
Meowth returns from his conversation with the other Heatmor and nudges you on the leg until you give him proper attention. He relays all the information he got with a concerned look on his face: the Heatmor speak of the same &quot;Great One&quot; that the wild Torkoal from before also mentioned. They say It rules over all life on Aduro Island and resides at the core of Mt Aduro, the mountain you're currently in; It is responsible for maintaining certain volcanoes active and others dormant, watching over the balance of the Island and the well-being of its inhabitants... those It deems worthy, that is.<br />
The Heatmor say that the Great One regards strength and self-sufficiency as the ultimate qualities; It actively looks to dispose of Pokemon he considers weak for lacking those traits, enforcing Its own process of &quot;natural&quot; selection - ensuring that the only inhabitants of Aduro Island are the ones It considers worthy. Magcargo and Magmar are among those It favors, and recruits them to eliminate &quot;less adequate&quot; species. Others It deemed unworthy have turned on other equally inept Pokemon in hopes of gaining the Great One's favor, which is the case with many Torkoal and other species that can't simply feed off lava.<br />
These are the last remaining Heatmor on all of Aduro Island, and they claim they're about to disappear as well. The Great One diverted the flow of the lava rivers to flood the few remaining Durant nests on Mt Aduro, effectively eliminating their main source of food, and sent Its favored servants to hunt down the few Heatmor that survived. But even if they manage to somehow fend off the attackers, they are doomed to die of starvation. But they say at least they'll die together as a family, concludes a visibly-emotional Meowth.<br />
<br />
Kyle nods in agreement.<br />
<br />
- That's what I meant when I said I had a conspiracy to look into. It was clear that Aduro, known for its abundance of different Fire-Types, had a recent shift in its fauna. When I came here to get the scoop, I expected to find poachers or some other kind of shady criminal deal... but I never expected it to be the workings of a higher being. If this is the will of the god of Aduro, maybe we shouldn't interfere... The Heatmor look to have accepted their fate too. It's how nature works, I'm not sure we should be fighting it... Besides, we've all just witnessed what happens when the Great One is upset! Come on Keith, let's get the hell out of here. I've heard many reports from highly credible sources about a millenium-old treasure hidden in Mt Infernus... what do you say?<br />
<br />
Well... what <i>do</i> you say? </span></span>

</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">Vernon looked rather surprised at Keith's orders to just stand there and take the attack, but by the same token, he knew Keith wasn't going to intentionally put him in harm's way. Though he involuntarily flinched at the prospect, he stood still nonetheless, and sure enough, the Flame Burst was absorbed into his body with no ill effects, his temporary Ability shielding him from the Fire move. However, it seemed as though they were too late- Magmar was tightening its grip on one of Doduo's necks, and preparing a Fire Punch with its free hand, ready to deliver a finishing blow-<br />
<br />
And then, suddenly, a small rock hit the Magmar in the head! Kyle had thrown a rock at Magmar and was shouting insults at it, a desperate attempt to divert its attention away from Doduo. It was clear to Keith that Kyle truly cared about his Pokémon, but more importantly at the moment, he realized that this was succeeding in distracting the Magmar- the exact opening they needed! &quot;Vernon! <b>Rock Climb</b>!&quot; he exclaimed.<br />
<br />
The Tauros wasted no time and jumped onto the distracted Magmar, trampling it underfoot. &quot;Direct hit!&quot; Keith grinned, but then he noticed the second Magmar, the one whose Flame Burst turned out to be useless. It was coming right at Vernon from behind, its arms crossed. Keith gasped- a Cross Chop! How many times had he seen his Toxicroak execute this most powerful of Fighting-type techniques? &quot;Vernon, behind you!&quot; he called, but too late- the Cross Chop hit its mark, knocking the Tauros to the ground. Keith looked on in horror as the pair of Magmar approached Vernon, their arms crossed, ready to finish him off. Keith frantically scrambled for Vernon's Poké Ball, when suddenly, Kyle's Doduo and the strongest Heatmor of the group sprang into action together, the former using Peck on one of the Magmar and the latter hitting the other with Tackle. This was sufficient distraction to allow the Tauros to get back to his feet. &quot;Great, Vernon!&quot; Keith grinned. &quot;Now, <b>Stone Edge</b>! Go!&quot;<br />
<br />
Vernon bellowed loudly as he repaid the favor by assailing one of the Magmar with a barrage of sharpened stones, successfully knocking it out. Keith grinned at Vernon gratefully, then turned to look at the remaining Magmar, who suddenly found itself wildly outnumbered. This most obvious disadvantage did not go unnoticed by the Spitfire Pokémon, and it backed off from Heatmor, looking around nervously, in search of an exit, no doubt-<br />
<br />
<b><i>&quot;WEAKLING.&quot;</i></b><br />
<br />
The word reverberated in Keith's head, and yet no actual sound could be heard. It was almost as though something was broadcasting the word telepathically to all minds in the area. But before Keith could even start to react to it, the word brought with it another tremor. This one was mercifully brief, but what happened afterwards was anything but merciful- a rock came falling from the ceiling and crushed the Magmar beneath it! Keith couldn't help but give a startled gasp- Magmar could not have survived that!<br />
<br />
There was total silence for a moment as everyone present looked on at the fallen rock that surely killed the Magmar it fell on. What was this? Was this some sort of sick, twisted punishment for the Magmar's sudden moment of cowardice? Or just some unfortunate coincidence? And then, Keith felt something nudging his leg- it was Meowth, and the Scratch Cat Pokémon was looking concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Meowth?&quot; Keith said as he crouched down. &quot;What is it? What did the Heatmor say?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... Ya remember dat &quot;Great One&quot; dat da Torkoal mentioned?&quot; Meowth asked. Keith nodded. &quot;Well, it's dis ting dat rules ova all life on da island, and lives at da core of Mt. Aduro- da mountain we're in right now. And it's responsible fer keepin' certain volcanoes dormant and makin' others active, and stuff like dat, and it keeps watch over dose who inhabit dis island- but only dose it deems worthy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean, only those it deems worthy?&quot; asked Keith.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, da Heatmor say dat da Great One values strength and self-sufficiency above all else,&quot; Meowth explained, &quot;and it actively seeks ta dispose o' dose it tinks are weak cuz dey ain't as strong or self sufficient as it likes. Dose five Heatmor is da last o' deir kind on dis island, and da Great One wants dem gone, too. &quot;Da- da Great One, it- it diverted lava flows sp-specifically to w-wipe out all da Durant nests on da island, j-just so d-da Heatmor would st-starve ta death,&quot; Meowth continued, starting to snivel a bit as he spoke, tears coming to his eyes. &quot;S-so even if dey m-m-manage ta d-drive off all da P-Pokémon da G-Great One is usin' t-ta eliminate d-d-dem, d-dey're just g-gonna st-starve anyways. B-b-but da Heatmor say dat- dat- dat at least- at least dey'll d-die as- as a family!&quot; Meowth wailed before bursting into tears.<br />
<br />
For a moment, Keith could not speak as he took in the words. Some higher power that ruled over Aduro Island was actively turning on its weaker inhabitants? That... Keith couldn't even think of words to sufficiently convey just how hideously wrong he thought this was. And then, as he spoke, Kyle voiced the opinion that they should get the hell out of there, that the Heatmor have already resigned themselves to their fate, and cited the Magmar's unfortunate end as a damn good reason as to why they ought not meddle in the affairs of a higher power. He then told Keith of reports he'd received from credible sources about a millennium-old treasure hidden in Mt. Infernus, clearly hoping that he'd want to go with him and not pursue this matter further.<br />
<br />
Keith shook his head. &quot;No,&quot; he said, his voice thick with rage. &quot;No. There's, there's no way in hell I'm just gonna let this slide. These Heatmor have just as much right to live as any other Pokémon. So what if they have to eat Durant instead of just living on lava like Magmar and Magcargo? They've done nothing to deserve this kind of fate! Hell, this one's even saved Vernon's ass more than once in that battle!&quot; he exclaimed, gesturing to the one who looked less starved than his four companions. &quot;Thank you for that, by the way,&quot; Keith added to the Flash Fire Heatmor. &quot;But still- this is an outrage!&quot; Keith then exclaimed, getting back on track. &quot;Kyle, I don't know about you, but I intend to do everything I can to save these Heatmor. Even if it means we gotta relocate them to a different island, even if it means we gotta take on this Great One ourselves.&quot; As he spoke, Keith dug into his backpack and dug out an <a href="http://www.serebiiforums.com/showthread.php?265205-Berry-Shop&amp;p=17236707#post17236707" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.serebiiforums.com%2Fshowthread.php%3F265205-Berry-Shop%26p%3D17236707%23post17236707&amp;hash=e788889adb79a8b0be3045bf9c0a2b94" rel="nofollow noopener">Iapapa Berry</a>. He then crouched down and offered it to the pack of Heatmor. &quot;Here,&quot; Keith said. &quot;I know it's not much, and that it's no Durant, but it's all I got. I'm gonna help you guys if it's the last thing I do, understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
As Keith did this, Meowth climbed back onto Keith's shoulder. He had stopped sobbing, but his eyes were still watery, though he could now speak coherently again. &quot;I'll help, too!&quot; Meowth declared. &quot;I'm wit ya all da way, Keith!&quot; Even Vernon gave a determined bellow, offering his support for this cause- clearly still thankful for the help that the strongest Heatmor of the bunch had given him in that battle. Keith smiled, thankful for his Pokémon's support, as he held out the Iapapa Berry to the pack of Heatmor.</span></span><br />

<span style="color: silver"><b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u> Electric Blue Eye</u>:</b> Sean awaits patiently for your choice of Pokemon. The second Diego materializes on the battlefield, a faint smile crosses his lips, pleased with your choice of counter - a Gym Leader is expected to know the all strengths and limitations of his preferred type, and even though Jellicent holds no type advantage over Quagsire, the entire picture has already formed in Sean's mind - Diego can maneuver just as well as Quagsire in and out of water, has access to Grass moves and almost none of Quagsire's attacks are particularly effective against Ghosts.<br />
<br />
- A fine choice Ethan. Show me what you got.<br />
<br />
Quagsire's expression is its usual goofy one. It stares blankly at Diego for about a minute before smiling and waving at him. Sean waits for your instructions and immediately formulates his own strategy as he hears your orders.<br />
<br />
- <b>Encore</b> his Ice Beam, <b>Yawn</b> and close with <b>Amnesia</b>.<br />
<br />
Diego dutifully releases a stream of frigid energy at the water around them; almost immediately, the arena transforms into an ice ring, effectively stopping either Pokemon from going underwater without breaking through the frozen layer above. As instructed, Quagsire immediately starts applauding, its contagious enthusiasm causing Diego to forget his next moves. Rather than following up with Absorb, the Jellicent fires another Ice Beam, this time aimed at the opponent, who takes it like a champ. The beam hits its mark causing appreciable damage to the part-Ground-Type, but far from enough to defeat it - so much so that Quagsire responds with a casual Yawn, suddenly unimpressed with the repeated attack. Diego is left groggy, and as he prepares to lazily shoot a third Ice Beam, Quagsire's mind tunes out for a moment - in turn greatly increasing his tolerance to special moves. When the third beam connects it barely causes any visible damage, and you're left in a tight spot.<br />
<br />
- I'm in no hurry to finish this. And by the looks of it, neither is Diego.<br />
<br />
Sean sounds slightly amused for once, clearly taking a jab at you to rile you up. You can tell he's eager to see how you respond - Quagsire is now much stronger against energy-based moves (comprising most of Jellicent's arsenal) and you can tell Diego is about to fall asleep - you'll be lucky if he pulls off another move before it happens, not to mention he might still be locked in the Encore... although you did land a couple of hits this turn, the odds are clearly stacked against you!<br />
<br />
What do you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver"><i>Amazing</i>, Ethan thought, <i>To have been able to see my Pokémon and know exactly why I choose it in the first place…so this is the strength a Gym Leader has. He has countered me without doing relatively anything, really. And the chemistry these two share, Sean’s rather amused face complied with his Quagsire’s dopey character…they blend rather well together, don’t they? But this is no time to praise them! He may not of had any super effective moves but the way he’s already forcing me to switch to my next Pokémon, it’s kind of incredible…but that doesn’t change my plans one tiny bit.</i> Ethan smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Diego you did exactly what I needed you to do, return amigo!&quot; Ethan yelled as he retrieved his <i>drowsy</i> Jellicent back into his ball. <br />
<br />
He couldn’t risk Diego staying out longer then he could, even if Jellicent did strike at least one more attack, after getting hit with <b>Yawn</b> and only 3 Pokémon to choose from, he needed to play it smart. This was no different from playing Chess…<br />
<br />
<i>Look at the battle unfold in your mind, Ethan, don’t think 2 steps ahead think, 3, 4 or more if you can…</i> a voice of a ghost from his past echoing in his mind.<br />
<br />
Unclipping a Premier Ball from his belt Ethan threw it up in the air before yelling out, &quot;Chris, I need your assistance!&quot; and in a flash of white silvery light a small green serpent like Pokémon with feet appendages appeared (more like lizard) on the field. Now that he was able to provide some flat surface for his Snivy to run around in or in this case skate; his plan could go into effect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chris, don’t let the Quagsire’s goofy face fool you! There’s no point dawdling with this Pokémon.&quot; The trainer yelled out, &quot;You need to strike fast and hard!…start with <b>Magical Leaf</b>, while under attack hit him with a <b>Glare</b> and finish with a <b>Leaf Blade</b>!&quot;<br />
<br />
The way Ethan saw it, he needed to immobilize Sean’s Pokémon from causing another <b>Encore</b> or <b>Yawn</b> and at the same time cause damage…only time would tell if his plan would work.</span></span></div>

<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>sweetbbydoll</u>:</b> The old man looks on as you try your best to define Contests and their meaning; speaking from the heart, you explain the reasons you're drawn to the art of performing rather than battling, stressing the fundamental differences between appeals and battles. And you're right, it's likely that very difference that turns people away from Contests so often - from a very young age, most children are exposed to Pokemon battles, be it in school or on TV. Battles have a much wider audience worldwide, and draw several million viewers on large events. Contests, in comparison, have a much more modest fanbase, and as a form of entertainment it occupies simply a particular niche of the market.<br />
<br />
The elder's expression gives nothing away all the way through, but when you finish he can't help but sport a huge smile. When you turn to leave, disheartened by the current state of affairs in Salin City's Contest scene, he again puts a hand on your shoulder to stop you.<br />
<br />
- Please wait just a little longer. Hearing you speak like that... it reminded me of someone very dear to me. My wife used to talk about Contests just like you do - in a way, she still does. She was quite the champion back in the day... the appeals she came up with were things of beauty, true works of art. She won many Contests in her youth too. She and I travelled all over Fizzy Bubbles - while I challenged a town's Gym Leader, she'd be performing at the local Contest Hall!<br />
<br />
He tears up a little but quickly regains composure.<br />
<br />
- I... I don't want to keep you from your endeavors much longer, but if I could trouble you with a personal request... you are right in saying many people turn away from Contests in this day and age. In fact, their popularity started to dwindle long ago, and with them my wife's happiness... When more and more people began to lose interest in the art, she was forced to step away from the almost non-existent professional circuit. Since she did, she was never the same again... Nothing cheers her up anymore - I can't remember the last time I heard her laugh. I can do nothing to replace what she lost but... maybe you could? Could you please help her relive her dream? A simple appeal, something pretty to lift her heart... I'm sure she'd love to see a youngster who still loves Contests as much as she did.<br />
<br />
He looked down, embarrassed for asking so much of you.<br />
<br />
- I can't bring Contests back to Cascadia, but maybe you could bring Contests back into her life, if only for a moment... but I ask so much of you, with nothing to offer in return! I shouldn't be forcing all this on a stranger, someone so young no less. Please forgive me, this isn't your struggle.<br />
<br />
He pulls out a paper rectangle from his pocket.<br />
<br />
- Sorry for taking so much of your time. I'm glad we got to talk, dear. Here, take it if you want: I purchased a ticket to watch the Grand Farewell but these days I lack the motivation to actually go... you seem to know that young man from the broadcast, so maybe you'd like to watch the Tournament in person? </span></span>

<br />
<span style="color: silver">Liza looked at the ticket, it had been so long since she got to be with her High School sweetheart in person, to even be inches away from him while he did the thing he loved, it was a chance of a life time!<br />
<br />
Sure they would call each other when they could, leave messages, send care packages, etc. but it wasn’t the same, it wasn’t until Liza had built up the courage to quit school that she finally decided to come be with him. That’s the whole reason she even came to Fizzy Bubbles…though not the only reason, she had her own dreams too, she wanted to compete in contests and after hearing this old man’s story…it kind of reminder her of her life with Ethan.<br />
<br />
<i>What would you do Ethan?</i> Liza thought, <i>What am I saying…</i> she shook her head, <i>I know exactly what you’d do…</i><br />
<br />
There might not be any active contests anymore, but she didn’t care. As a person that loved contests and as a kid she owed it to herself to show this man’s wife that there are still people out there that believe! That the art form wasn’t as dead as other think it is, so what if there wasn’t any audience to see it? <i>’They don’t know what they’re missing out!’</i><br />
<br />
Because of her old aunt that was near 80 years now that took care of Liza when she was nothing more than a baby until she was the age she was now, Liza had always had a soft spot for the elderly when everyone else simply dismissed them, got tired of them or just didn’t have the patience. <br />
<br />
Liza grabbed the other man’s hand with both of her own and looked him straight in the eye, “I will help you, so that your wife can see that the burning passion of contests is still alive and well!” <br />
<br />
“Litwick, Lit!”<br />
<br />
<i>I’m sorry love, I guess I’ll have to wait for the reunion you promised..</i><br />
