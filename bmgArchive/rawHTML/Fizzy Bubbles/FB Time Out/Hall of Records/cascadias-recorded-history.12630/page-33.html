These islands contain the some of the most diverse typing of Pokemon in the entirety of Fizzy Bubbles. All of these islands are actually volcanoes, but the majority of them have gone dormant. As many Pokemon spend all their lives here, many fossils of Pokemon and plants are buried in the depths of the volcanic ground, maybe some of these may be worth a look? You start out on the island that you first choose, via a ferry. In order to change areas afterward, Surf or Fly is a necessity.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: red"><i>Aduro Island</i></span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px">An active volcano, this is the largest of all of the islands of Cascadia. Continually pumping lava out of human-built channels into the sea, the volcano causes the island to continually become larger and larger. Fire, Ground, and Rock types are common in these areas, and there are a few volcanic caverns leading into the volcano which are of interest to many people, and are said to house rare and powerful Pokemo. There is also a small village on the opposite end of the island, and the natives appear to be friendly, as long as they aren't disturbed too much. Vegetation on this island is sparse, and only the hardy plants can survive the heat of the volcano. The sand along the beaches is pitch black, and isn't exactly the softest thing to walk barefoot on. Hot springs and geysers are common in this area, dotting the landscape of the giant smoking mountain.<br />
<b><span style="color: red">The Lithogic River</span></b> - The 'river of fire' in native settler terms, the Lithogic River is a large channel of lava being carried from the rim of Mount Aduro down to the sea. A few fire types hang around this area, and it's been said that the lava has cooled into rare gems in some parts./size]</span>

OOC: Though I do have an ongoing adventure in here, it is unlikely to continue anytime soon, and I have kaisap's OK to start a new adventure here.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red"><span style="font-size: 9px">Some knew him for his Poison-type expertise. Some knew him for the wide variety of Pokémon he raised. Some knew him as the guy who would ride across the Fizzytopia region on the back of a dark grey Scolipede. Some just knew him as that guy with the hat. But they all knew him as Keith Masters. And right now, he was stepping off a ferry which had sailed to the Cascadia Archipelago. But this time, the 23-year-old Pokémon Trainer wasn't getting off at his usual stop- which was the notoriously putrid and polluted Poison-type paradise known as Venom Island- but rather on the largest island in the archipelago, one which was constantly growing due to the volcano's continuous lava production.<br />
<br />
The Trainer himself was clad in his usual attire- a red and white sleeveless jacket over a black t-shirt, a pair of blue jeans, a pair of red and white sneakers, and perhaps his most distinctive feature, a large, brown cowboy hat. Next to him was an impressive-looking Pokémon, clad in a purple hide that was tough as steel. He didn't stand quite as tall as his Trainer, but the difference between their heights was not particularly major. This Nidoking had earned quite a few envious looks from other Trainers on the ferry, and Keith couldn't quite blame them- he hadn't really intended to evolve Godric all the way to this stage as fast as he had, and yet, he wasn't regretting it in the slightest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, here we are, Godric,&quot; grinned Keith. &quot;Aduro Island!&quot; The Nidoking turned to his Trainer and gave a questioning grunt. &quot;Ah,&quot; nodded Keith. &quot;Lemme guess- some of your teammates probably told you all about Venom Island, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Godric nodded in response. &quot;Heh,&quot; Keith chuckled. &quot;Why am I not surprised? Myrtle complained about it from the moment we made land there... and of course, Venom Island's where I caught Strychnine in the first place,&quot; he added, fondly thinking back to the moment when he had hurled a Rocket Ball at a weakened Grimer. &quot;But anyway, yeah, decided to check out some of the other islands for a change,&quot; he finished. &quot;This one's said to be the biggest one- and getting bigger, in fact- so I figured it's a decent place to start, you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nidooooh,&quot; growled Godric, albeit in a friendly tone, while nodding in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I was reading up on the places of interest back on the ferry,&quot; Keith continued. &quot;I thought we could start by checking out the Lithogic River. Supposed to be this river of lava that flows from the top of the volcano all the way to the sea. Sounds pretty interesting to me, how about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nidoooohhh!&quot; Godric replied enthusiastically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh. I'll take that as a yes,&quot; grinned Keith. &quot;Let's go then. There was a map on the ferry, I memorized the way to get to the river from the dock.&quot;&quot; With that, Keith set off towards the Lithogic River, his Nidoking walking by his side.</span></span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>Electric Blue Eye</u>:</u></b> <i>((Please keep a link to your Profile in your replies, it's a bit easier for me! Thanks.))</i><br />
<br />
The woman looks over the items your present . the purple Dex and 6 Pokeballs -, runs them all through an infrared sensor and looks at the monitor, waiting for the corresponding readings. After a while she smiles, nods and hands you a key with “House 12” written on a paper tag.<br />
<br />
-	Congratulations, you have now been registered into the Grand Farewell Tournament! This is the key to your house in the Villa. We have prepared accommodations for all our guests, which I hope are to your liking! Our only rule is curfew after midnight, since preparations for the next day’s battles begin at that hour and we need to reroute most power from the Villa to the Stadium – all non-essential electronics are disabled after midnight, please understand.<br />
<br />
She rings a bell and shortly afterwards, a steward appears.<br />
<br />
-	Please take our guest to his residence Bert, he’ll be staying in House 12. Mr. Ethan, best of lucks to you in your upcoming challenge, and remember, do your very best to honor our Champion in the Arena!<br />
<br />
You claim back your Pokeballs and Pokedex, store them away and follow the steward away from the reception desk, out of the stadium through a side door and into the private Residential Area that has been created solely for this event. They really are pulling out all the stops! You walk across a red brick road, with elegantly trimmed topiaries shaped like Pokemon, which branches out to several conglomerates of large houses. You take a left turn and approach one of the conglomerates, before the man stops in front of the first residence and invites you in. Is the <i>whole house</i> to yourself?!<br />
<br />
- Please make yourself comfortable Mr.Ethan. The inaugural speech and the first two rounds of the Tournament start tomorrow; you will need to be well-rested.<br />
<br />
He takes a bow and leaves graciously, leaving you and Adam to stare at the mansion that has been reserved for you. They must have spent an obscene amount of money on all these houses! Still, you might as well make the most of it, right?<br />
You hold the key in your hand and approach the front door, unlocking it. You step inside and your jaw drops - it's even better on the inside! Tapestries, golden candelabra, polished mahogany furniture... You're still in shock when Adam nudges you on the leg, snapping out of your trance. You look at him annoyed, until you realize he's holding something in his hand. A... piece of paper? You must have walked over it when you stepped inside... you take it from the Sableye and glance over it. There's a handwritten message...<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Forfeit the Plates at the reception first thing tomorrow.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
The... Plates? What did this mean? How did anyone know of the Plates in the first place, and why on earth would you give them over?!<br />
You try to put all of that behind you for now, and explore the house. It's getting late however, with only thirty minutes to go before midnight, and you remember what the receptionist said about curfew...<br />
There's a welcome package on a nearby table in the hall; in it you find a bag of cookies, a bottle of chocolate milk and a pamflet with various bits of information on the event. More significantly, a layout of the Tournament brackets...<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Day 1: Inaugural Speech by the Champion Gottfried; Challenger vs Gym Leader Sean (morning battle); Challenger vs Gym Leader Trevor (evening battle)</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
Another piece of information catches your eye: <i>&quot;Don't forget to look up data on each participant the day before your battles! It always helps to be prepared, so make sure to use the Personal Terminal in your residence every night!&quot;</i><br />
<br />
You look over to the living room, and sure enough, there's a small desktop computer on a table in front a very comfortable-looking couch - seems they thought of everything. But with only thirty minutes to go before power is cut, you probably only have time to read information on one subject before curfew...<br />
<br />
Which do you prefer to read: data on <b>Champion Gottfried</b>, <b>Gym Leader Sean</b> or<b>Gym Leader Trevor</b>?</span></span> <br />

<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>PikaGod</u>:</u></b> You decide to stand up to the POLT officer, arguing that you’re no stranger to danger and have seen enough in your travels to handle this situation, whatever that may be.<br />
<br />
The stern-looking man raises an eyebrow and reaches for his belt, picks a Pokeball and releases its contents. A Marowak materializes and raises its bone high in the air as a sign of warning, keeping its eyes firmly locked on you. The officer prepares to speak when a second flash fills the whole area, blindingly strong this time, forcing all of you to cover your eyes. After it fades, you start to feel a terrible numbness in your feet, progressively spreading to your legs and stopping around your waist; immobilized, you lose your balance and fall on your knees, unable to stand, as does the POLT; even Marowak seems to be having a hard time staying on its feet, despite its supposed immunity to electricity!<br />
Fortunately, the feeling of paralysis washes away almost as quickly as it appeared, allowing you to stand back up after only a short while. The officer does the same, curses under his breath and looks over to the lake; you instinctively do the same, just in time to see most of the shapes in the distance tumble to the side by the margin; they, however, don’t make it back up…<br />
<br />
-	Last warning; get out, or I’ll take you out.<br />
<br />
He doesn’t sound half as professional as before; clearly, having to deal with this mess <i>and</i> the occasional perpetrator is getting on the man’s nerves, and you get the feeling that arresting you isn’t the first thing on his mind – he just wants you gone so he can focus on the problem at hand, and seems to have no qualms about using force.<br />
<br />
Your legs are still tingly, although you can move them just fine. Whatever this was it seems to have come from the lake, and it was a pulse powerful enough to travel though <i>sand</i> and even affect a Ground-Type. Whichever the cause, it must have incredible power, especially judging by what it did to those closer to the margin… you wonder if those Pokemon are all dead, or just paralyzed worse than you were. Either way, what hopes could you have of getting closer unharmed? Was it even worth it, or should you just obey the POLT officer and seek the safety of other zones? You know he’s only looking out for you, but your curiosity still hasn’t been satisfied…<br />
<br />
You take one last look around while you plan your next course of action, and spot someone else nearby that you hand’t noticed before. An old man is watching the lake with a melancholic smile, not far from where you stand, seemingly oblivious to your presence and, more importantly, unaffected by the recent energy wave. He is skinny, with a thick white beard, wears a light-blue short-sleeved shirt, an old-looking pair of shorts, a straw hat and a weird pair of black, heavy-looking boots like you’ve never seen before, and which stand out like a sore thumb given the rest of his outfit. His eyes are locked on the lake, and he seems lost in thought…<br />
<br />
-	What’s it going to be, then?<br />
<br />
The Marowak takes a step forward and holds its bone like a sword at its master’s question; it’s ready to strike at the first sign of struggle. Should you engage the POLT officer? If you beat him, you’d have a clear path to the lake… or will you stand down and leave as instructed after all?</span></span><br />

<br />
<br />
<b><u>The SS Leviathan Shipwreck</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>CyberBlastoise</u>:</u></b> You realize that, unfortunately, treasure will have to wait. Healing Swift back to health is your top priority, although the basic care you already provided helped ease its pain, and the Pokeball’s interior is also designed to stabilize Pokemon in critical condition long enough for the Trainer to seek a dedicated Center; you hope the device’s technology can keep your precious Lumineon safe until you find help.<br />
<br />
Your surrounding are grim, dark and uninviting; the innards of the long-sunken ship, unexplored for Arceus-knows how long, are cold and humid, and the air is stagnant making it hard to breathe. Moss hangs from the broken planks, and not a single sound can be heard other than your lonely steps and the droplets of water than drip from the walls. You reason that your best bet is moving deeper within the ship and look for a way out on the other side, <i>behind</i> the Wingull that already gave you so much trouble. You can’t shake off the feeling that their attack was much too severe, much too coordinated for a regular flock of wild seagulls. What could have turned them so violent?...<br />
<br />
The journey into the bowels of the ship is lonely and done slowly; your common sense tells you that, despite the gravity of the situation, rushing blindly across the fragile wooden floor would be suicidal; who knows where the planks may be cracked, even broken, or what dangers lurk ahead? The ship itself feels much like a maze; a central walkway unfolds for what seems like miles ahead, although you can barely see five steps in front of you – the lack of proper lighting only helps to make the whole place feel spookier. And speaking of spooky, why did it get so cold all of a sudden?...<br />
<br />
Indeed, a chill runs down your spine as the temperature seems to drop even further for no apparent reason. It’s not that the air itself has gotten colder, but something about your surroundings feels… dead...<br />
<br />
<i>Leeeaaaave….</i><br />
<br />
The ominous voice filled with ill intent resonates in your mind, although your ears hear nothing. Your heart starts to race and a sense of urgency overtakes you; why do you feel the need to run for your life all of a sudden?!<br />
<br />
<i>Begooooooneeeeee…</i><br />
<br />
Again the terrifying, silent voice… It rings louder this time, without a sound, but its message is crystal clear. Suddenly, you spot two tiny red dots directly in front of you; when they begin to approach, your eyes slowly start to make out the form that stands in your way, and your heart sinks in your chest – it beat faster than usual before, but now it seems to have stopped. Reaching its ethereal arms out for you, promising a deathly embrace, a massive blue Jellicent blocks your path!<br />
<br />
You hastily look around, weighing your limited options. It’s hard to tell in the darkness, but there seems to be a wooden door on each side of the corridor – one to your left and one to your right. However, there’s no telling if either of them will budge, and even if either does, what might be lurking behind? If you try to flee but fail to enter a room, the Jellicent will easily catch up to you! On the other hand, you could always try to force your way through by battle, but how strong is the foe? It has already proven to be able to invade your mind and speak to you, a testament of considerable power in of itself…<br />
<br />
Quick, what do you do?!</span></span> <br />

<b><u>Geyser Park</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</u></b> <i>((Welcome to the team MM! I hope you enjoy the journey, glad to have you! ^^))</i><br />
<br />
After years upon years of travel, you have unquestionably made a name for yourself, first and foremost as a master of the Poison Type. However, you choose to steer away from the most obvious destination, one you have already braved in the past, in favor of a different kind of setting. Before your eyes, the colossal Mt Aduro rises to the sky, the burning Babylon of Cascadia that commands respect for its sheer size and the undying furnace within. The giant only gets bigger by the minute, continuously increasing its landmass – some experts even claim that, in twenty years time, Aduro may well be the only remaining isle in the Archipelago if it keeps its current growth rate, swallowing all the smaller islands as it expands.<br />
<br />
Godric the Nidoking stands next to you, recently evolved and brimming with power. You couldn’t be happier the decision of evolving your partner when you did, but he still lacked experience, so you reasoned he should join you in this adventure. Godric himself seems to agree and is just as excited as you are to be here.<br />
<br />
The temperature is naturally higher than in most other places you’ve ever been. The scenery is just as beautiful as you’d expected too; flowing all the way from the peak of Mt Aduro in the distance, a very wide river of bright orange lava has carved its way down the mountainside and into the ocean far below. You remember how Aduro’s expansion was facilitated by humans several years ago, who created underground tunnels to redirect magma from the volcano’s core directly into the sea. The Lithogic River however, was a natural wonder, as it had formed without Man’s interference and continued to flow for decades, maybe centuries, on its own. It’s as wide as any real river, and if it were made of water it’d take a boat to go from one side to the other – swimming across from margin to margin would probably take a whole day.<br />
<br />
-	And would you look at that, actual live specimens! Dear viewers, you’re watching the EyeLand Network and right now, your beloved host is risking his life to bring you an up-and-close shot of these dangerous Pokemon!<br />
<br />
The voice comes from somewhere nearby. You scout your surroundings and quickly find what you’re looking for; a young man with a professional broadcasting camera on his shoulder, kneeling down in front of two Magcargo!<br />
<br />
-	Indeed ladies and gentlemen, this is Kyle Styles bringing you the latest on environmental issues all over Cascadia! For example, look at these Magcargo, look at how angry and unhappy they look! Something is rotten in the State of Aduro dear viewers, and the EyeLand Network will show you just… hey hey, what are you doing? Hey, stop, I didn’t mean to… HEEEELP!!!<br />
<br />
Angry indeed, but probably because of the young man shoving his camera in their faces, the two fire slugs take offense to his proximity and spit out a couple of Lava Plumes he narrowly manages to avoid! The man drops his camera in fear, and begins to slowly back away, but the Magcargo have been provoked and seemingly refuse to just let him go! He’s in danger!<br />
<br />
What do you do?</span></span> <br />

<b><u>Geyser Park</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</u></b> <i>((Welcome to the team MM! I hope you enjoy the journey, glad to have you! ^^))</i><br />
<br />
After years upon years of travel, you have unquestionably made a name for yourself, first and foremost as a master of the Poison Type. However, you choose to steer away from the most obvious destination, one you have already braved in the past, in favor of a different kind of setting. Before your eyes, the colossal Mt Aduro rises to the sky, the burning Babylon of Cascadia that commands respect for its sheer size and the undying furnace within. The giant only gets bigger by the minute, continuously increasing its landmass – some experts even claim that, in twenty years time, Aduro may well be the only remaining isle in the Archipelago if it keeps its current growth rate, swallowing all the smaller islands as it expands.<br />
<br />
Godric the Nidoking stands next to you, recently evolved and brimming with power. You couldn’t be happier the decision of evolving your partner when you did, but he still lacked experience, so you reasoned he should join you in this adventure. Godric himself seems to agree and is just as excited as you are to be here.<br />
<br />
The temperature is naturally higher than in most other places you’ve ever been. The scenery is just as beautiful as you’d expected too; flowing all the way from the peak of Mt Aduro in the distance, a very wide river of bright orange lava has carved its way down the mountainside and into the ocean far below. You remember how Aduro’s expansion was facilitated by humans several years ago, who created underground tunnels to redirect magma from the volcano’s core directly into the sea. The Lithogic River however, was a natural wonder, as it had formed without Man’s interference and continued to flow for decades, maybe centuries, on its own. It’s as wide as any real river, and if it were made of water it’d take a boat to go from one side to the other – swimming across from margin to margin would probably take a whole day.<br />
<br />
-	And would you look at that, actual live specimens! Dear viewers, you’re watching the EyeLand Network and right now, your beloved host is risking his life to bring you an up-and-close shot of these dangerous Pokemon!<br />
<br />
The voice comes from somewhere nearby. You scout your surroundings and quickly find what you’re looking for; a young man with a professional broadcasting camera on his shoulder, kneeling down in front of two Magcargo!<br />
<br />
-	Indeed ladies and gentlemen, this is Kyle Styles bringing you the latest on environmental issues all over Cascadia! For example, look at these Magcargo, look at how angry and unhappy they look! Something is rotten in the State of Aduro dear viewers, and the EyeLand Network will show you just… hey hey, what are you doing? Hey, stop, I didn’t mean to… HEEEELP!!!<br />
<br />
Angry indeed, but probably because of the young man shoving his camera in their faces, the two fire slugs take offense to his proximity and spit out a couple of Lava Plumes he narrowly manages to avoid! The man drops his camera in fear, and begins to slowly back away, but the Magcargo have been provoked and seemingly refuse to just let him go! He’s in danger!<br />
<br />
What do you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: Red"><span style="font-size: 9px">Keith and Godric arrived at the Lithogic River with no trouble, and just as Keith expected, it was truly a sight to behold. It looked as wide and as natural as any ordinary river, the only difference being the molten lava that flowed through it.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's amazing, isn't it, Godric?&quot; Keith remarked. &quot;I mean, there's supposed to be underground tunnels that carry magma from the volcano right into the sea, that's how the island keeps getting bigger. But those were manmade, this river is all natural, and it's been flowing for I don't even know how long.&quot; Godric gave an appreciative growl, enjoying the scenery just as much as his Trainer was.<br />
<br />
And then, their viewing was interrupted by a voice, and from what was being said, before even turning around, Keith was guessing that a TV show was being taped live. Sure enough, he looked around, and saw a young man with what looked like a professional TV camera on his shoulder, and he was kneeling down before a pair of vivid orange Pokémon that looked as though they came from the river itself. Each one sported a shell of volcanic rock on its back. Keith took out his Pokédex and pointed it at these Pokémon- he had seen plenty of Slugma before, having lived in Lavaridge Town in his youth, but these were new to him, probably its evolved form. Sure enough...<br />
<br />
&quot;Magcargo, the Lava Pokémon, and the evolved form of Slugma,&quot; droned the device. &quot;Magcargo's shell is extremely brittle and crumbles away at the slightest touch. It can spout flames from the gaps in this shell.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was then that Keith noted how angry the Magcargo were getting. The guy with the camera seemed to notice this, too, but what that guy didn't seem to notice, despite it being obvious to Keith and his Nidoking, was that that guy was the <i>cause</i> of the Magcargo's anger! He was sticking his camera right in their faces, Keith was honestly surprised he hadn't been attacked yet. And then, as if on cue, the pair of Fire/Rock-types unleashed Lava Plume at the man. He managed to narrowly evade them, thankfully, and as he finally seemed to catch on, he dropped the camera and backed off. However, the Magcargo weren't done with him, having been provoked into action, and they started oozing after him.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, that's not good,&quot; Keith remarked. He turned to face his Nidoking. &quot;We gotta help him, Godric. Nail those Magcargo with your <b>Supersonic</b>. Hopefully it'll confuse them long enough for the guy to get away. If they start coming for us, prepare to use <b>Drill Run</b>.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nidoooh,&quot; nodded Godric, before turning to face the pair of Magcargo and preparing to use Supersonic.</span></span></div>

<br />
The woman looks over the items your present . the purple Dex and 6 Pokeballs -, runs them all through an infrared sensor and looks at the monitor, waiting for the corresponding readings. After a while she smiles, nods and hands you a key with “House 12” written on a paper tag.<br />
<br />
-	Congratulations, you have now been registered into the Grand Farewell Tournament! This is the key to your house in the Villa. We have prepared accommodations for all our guests, which I hope are to your liking! Our only rule is curfew after midnight, since preparations for the next day’s battles begin at that hour and we need to reroute most power from the Villa to the Stadium – all non-essential electronics are disabled after midnight, please understand.<br />
<br />
She rings a bell and shortly afterwards, a steward appears.<br />
<br />
-	Please take our guest to his residence Bert, he’ll be staying in House 12. Mr. Ethan, best of lucks to you in your upcoming challenge, and remember, do your very best to honor our Champion in the Arena!<br />
<br />
You claim back your Pokeballs and Pokedex, store them away and follow the steward away from the reception desk, out of the stadium through a side door and into the private Residential Area that has been created solely for this event. They really are pulling out all the stops! You walk across a red brick road, with elegantly trimmed topiaries shaped like Pokemon, which branches out to several conglomerates of large houses. You take a left turn and approach one of the conglomerates, before the man stops in front of the first residence and invites you in. Is the <i>whole house</i> to yourself?!<br />
<br />
- Please make yourself comfortable Mr.Ethan. The inaugural speech and the first two rounds of the Tournament start tomorrow; you will need to be well-rested.<br />
<br />
He takes a bow and leaves graciously, leaving you and Adam to stare at the mansion that has been reserved for you. They must have spent an obscene amount of money on all these houses! Still, you might as well make the most of it, right?<br />
You hold the key in your hand and approach the front door, unlocking it. You step inside and your jaw drops - it's even better on the inside! Tapestries, golden candelabra, polished mahogany furniture... You're still in shock when Adam nudges you on the leg, snapping out of your trance. You look at him annoyed, until you realize he's holding something in his hand. A... piece of paper? You must have walked over it when you stepped inside... you take it from the Sableye and glance over it. There's a handwritten message...<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Forfeit the Plates at the reception first thing tomorrow.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
The... Plates? What did this mean? How did anyone know of the Plates in the first place, and why on earth would you give them over?!<br />
You try to put all of that behind you for now, and explore the house. It's getting late however, with only thirty minutes to go before midnight, and you remember what the receptionist said about curfew...<br />
There's a welcome package on a nearby table in the hall; in it you find a bag of cookies, a bottle of chocolate milk and a pamflet with various bits of information on the event. More significantly, a layout of the Tournament brackets...<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Day 1: Inaugural Speech by the Champion Gottfried; Challenger vs Gym Leader Sean (morning battle); Challenger vs Gym Leader Trevor (evening battle)</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
Another piece of information catches your eye: <i>&quot;Don't forget to look up data on each participant the day before your battles! It always helps to be prepared, so make sure to use the Personal Terminal in your residence every night!&quot;</i><br />
<br />
You look over to the living room, and sure enough, there's a small desktop computer on a table in front a very comfortable-looking couch - seems they thought of everything. But with only thirty minutes to go before power is cut, you probably only have time to read information on one subject before curfew...<br />
<br />
Which do you prefer to read: data on <b>Champion Gottfried</b>, <b>Gym Leader Sean</b> or<b>Gym Leader Trevor</b>?</span></span>

<br />
Taking the capsules, items and his Pokedex from off the table the receptionist ran them through an infrared sensor looking at, Arceus knew what, before smiling at her finds, nodding and handing Ethan a key with a paper tag that read: 'House 12'.<br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations, you have now been registered into the Grand Farewell Tournament! This is the key to your house in the Villa.

<br />
Nodding in understanding Ethan took note of what she had said. She then rang a bell and in little to no time a steward appeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please take our guest to his residence Bert, he’ll be staying in House 12. Mr. Ethan, best of lucks to you in your upcoming challenge, and remember, do your very best to honor our Champion in the Arena!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan thanked her, collecting his things before following Bert away from the receptionist desk, through a side door and outside of the stadium were he was amazed to find a private residential area was perpared solely for the purpose of the tournament.<br />
<br />
With his feet walking along a red bricked road the boy and his Sableye looked around the lavish place that even had hedges that were shaped like Pokemon. The group then took a left turn and stopping in front of the first house the steward turned around to face him, ushering him to step inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way the whole house is mine??!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Please make yourself comfortable Mr.Ethan. The inaugural speech and the first two rounds of the Tournament start tomorrow; you will need to be well-rested.&quot;<br />
<br />
But before the steward could make his leave the boy reached inside his pocket and took out $<a href="http://bmgf.bulbagarden.net/f231/coin-exchange-21821/index18.html#post5107221" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fbmgf.bulbagarden.net%2Ff231%2Fcoin-exchange-21821%2Findex18.html%23post5107221&amp;hash=b9c95559153a7840b8b57eec6fd99d5b" rel="nofollow noopener">1,000 coins</a> in a small brown bag, handing it to him and thanking him for showing him around, even if he was just doing his job. He had worked odd jobs himself, here and there, been a waiter for a bit of his life until he realized it wasn't for him, it was always nice after a long day to see a nice tip. <br />
<br />
Looking back at the villa, Ethan clutched the key tight in his hands, remembering that for many years after leaving home he had lived on the streets with no four walls or roof to shield him from the elements or a bed with someone there to tuck him in at night, not even a big enough jacket to keep him warm. No, he had to grow up fending for himself thus letting go of all materialist things. But looking at the mansion sized building before him a tear ran from his eye, even if this was only temporary, he couldn't be happier. &quot;Sab?&quot; the little ghoul giving a questionable look at his trainer before he responded back with &quot;Right then, shall we.&quot; Sliding the key inside the lock, turning the knob and opening the door…finding inside the fanciest place he had ever been in, beside break-ins.<br />
<br />
Snapping out of his trance the boy’s Sableye poked him on the knee…&quot;Ugh, how many times do I got to tell you not to- what’s that in your hand? &quot; He asked taking from his Sableye a piece of paper he had found underneath the boy’s shoe, and read it out loud, &quot;Forfeit the Plates at the reception first thing tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Ethan and Adam looked at each other immediately, how did anyone know the he was collecting the plates…and why would he just give them up? He needed them! not wanting it to bother him while so many good things were happening, the boy crumbled the note and tossed in the nearest bin he found before finally allowing himself to take it all in… <br />
<br />
The house was fully furnished with all the trimmings, pointless things that only the rich would be interested in, he looked through every cabinet and drawer, played with the appliances and electronics trying to figure out how they worked…he ran through the house with Sableye exploring every room and corner until the sun outside set and the moon rose in its place.<br />
<br />
Looking at the clock Ethan noticed that the time was 11:30pm, having remembered what the receptionist had said, he only had 30mins before curfew…looking across he saw a welcome package set aside on the table that he seemed to have missed in his exploration. Going through its contains, he pulled a bag of cookies, chocolate milk and a pamphlet with information about the tournament and its break down: &quot;Day 1: Inaugural Speech by the Champion Gottfried; Challenger vs Gym Leader Sean (morning battle); Challenger vs Gym Leader Trevor (evening battle)&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>It all starts tomorrow then…</i> he thought getting a little bit excited.<br />
<br />
He looked again and noticed another piece of information that made the young man’s eyes widen, &quot;Don't forget to look up data on each participant the day before your battles! It always helps to be prepared, so make sure to use the Personal Terminal in your residence every night!&quot; He looked around the room in a frenzy and sure enough there it was, a computer seating on the coffee table, next to the couch. <br />
<br />
<i>They sure think of everything, don’t they?</i><br />
<br />
Ethan knew close to nothing about Gottfried, unlike the other Champions his heard about, Gottfried was an Enigma. And though this tournament was in honor of him, with less than 30mins left, he probably only had time to search on one of the people featured tomorrow…and if Ethan wanted to win or impress someone he had never heard of, he had to do great in the first match of the tournament and the first step in doing so would be finding out what <b>type</b> of gym leader he would be facing, after that he could make a better sound decision on which 3 to bring. If he got a chance to meet with Gottfried he would just be honest…&quot;Hi, my name is Ethan it’s great to meet you…uhhh is it bad I’ve never heard of you?&quot;- smooth, he couldn't think of that now though.<br />
<br />
Seating across from the computer the young boy began searching for information on <b>Gym Leader Sean</b>. Seating next to him the boy’s Sableye was trying to open the bag of cookies having a hard time with its vacuum seal, trying for the bitter part of a few minutes in doing so, until finally he gave in and threw them on the table with his arms crossed. Ethan with one hand on the keyboard typing, reached for the bag with the other, and opened it with his teeth, grabbing a cookie before tossing back at the astonished ghost, now happily eating from the bag.<br />
<br />
Ethan had to remember to go to sleep right away, even if his nerves probably wouldn't let him, he sure didn't want to over sleep...</span></span></div>

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</u></b> You decide that you can’t just ignore a man in need; even though it’s his own fault for being in this mess, you choose to help the poor guy before he’s reduced to cinders by the angry pair of fire slugs. Godric himself seems raring to go, eager to prove himself and test his mettle against the natives of Mt Aduro.<br />
<br />
The Nidoking's ears start to vibrate at high speed shortly before he opens his mouth and lets out a special-frequency soundwave. You don't hear a thing, but then again, you weren't supposed to; the Magcargo however, interrupt their assault and start to look around frantically, greatly disturbed by the noise. They're still a few feet away, so the move isn't as effective as it would usually be in a direct confrontation, but it sure is enough to stop them in their tracks.<br />
<br />
One of the fire slugs seems to have forgotten about what it was doing completely, casually gazing at its surroundings... Lovely place, really. As for the second Magcargo, it isn't so easily distracted; after a brief period of disorientation, it turns around to locate the source of the sonic wave, locking eyes with Godric and immediately realizing what happened.<br />
<br />
It nudges its partner twice, forcing it to focus as well, and the two shift their undivided attention to you and your partner, angered by your interference. Why can't a poor pair of slugs just be left to their affairs without humans, cameras and even other Pokemon ruining their day? Already annoyed at the reporter's invasion of privacy, they look intent on making <i>someone</i> pay, and since Godric drew first blood, they seem to forget all about the other guy and begin to take aim at the Poison-Type!<br />
<br />
The man also realizes your presence, and quickly rushes over to hide behind you, despite being clearly older and taller than you - probably in his early thirties, slim, sporting thick black glasses and dressed in a white t-shirt with a stylized green &quot;EyeLand&quot; logo on the front and camo-pattern cargo shorts, he sticks out like a sore thumb in the otherwise natural beauty of the landscape. And now, he is cowering behind you like a child.<br />
<br />
- THEY'RE GONNA KILL MEEEEE!!<br />
<br />
You fight your hardest not to roll your eyes and just focus on the task at hand. Godric is waiting for the right time to strike, while the Magcargo slither toward you. As soon as they're in range, the Poison Point Pokemon lunges at them, Ground energy swirling around his horn like a massive drill. Godric hits one of the Magcargo dead-on, sending it flying back several feet, reeling from the highly effective blow! It lands in a mess of lava and rock, seemingly motionless... until the magma begins to coalesce again, glowing and reforming the slug with its <b>Recover</b>! Part of its body quickly cools off and transforms into a new shell, and the Magcargo is ready to fight back!<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the second Magcargo sees its opening and moves in on Godric while his back is turned, blowing out an impressive <b>Flamethrower</b> attack that hits the unprotected Nidoking from behind! Godric trips and falls to one knee, his back briefly catching fire, though fortunately it didn't leave him with a burn.However, the Magcargo he hit before is directly in front of him, ready to strike as its mouth begins to fill with flames - Godric now finds himself <i>right between</i> the two Magcargo, and about to be on the receiving end of a point-blank fire attack from the front!<br />

<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>Electric Blue Eye</u>:</u></b> You reason that researching your first opponent is the best way to get a good start. As curious as you are about the retiring Champion, you correctly assume that you won't time toresearch both bios, so you boot the PC and access the &quot;Grand Farewell Bios&quot; folder - in it, as expected, are only three files: &quot;Gottfried.pdf&quot;, &quot;Sean.pdf&quot; and &quot;Trevor.pdf&quot;. You had half-hoped that information on all other participants would be available as well, but it seems they did think of everything by only allowing these 3 documents to be viewed. You can only hope they change the available bios tomorrow, in case you make it that far...<br />
<br />
You select &quot;Sean.pdf&quot; and open it. A small 3-page document appears, detailing the Gym Leader's most significant data. You skim through the file, hastily trying to absorb as much information as you can before the power is cut.<br />
<br />
<i>Sean, Male, 25 years old<br />
<b>Category:</b> Gym Leader<br />
<b>Location:</b> Pearl Lake, Crater Island, Cascadia Archipelago<br />
<b>Type Specialty:</b> Water<br />
<b>Career Highlights:</b><br />
- Official League Starter received (age 10).<br />
- Completed Cascadia Gym Challenge (age 16)<br />
- Approved as Gym Trainer at Hiel Research Base, Glacier Island, Cascadia Archipelago (age 18)<br />
- Teacher at Cascadia's Pokemon School (age 18 - 20)<br />
- Approved as Gym Leader at Pearl Lake, Crater Island, Cascadia Archipelago (age 20)<br />
<br />
<b>Bio:</b> Sean has made a name for himself as one of Cascadia's best Trainers from an early age. Born and raised on Crater Island, he grew accustomed to a life surrounded by Water-Type Pokemon.<br />
Outside of battling, he has taken an interest in teaching up-and-coming Trainers, his pondered and level-headed demeanor making him an excellent tutor.<br />
Wise beyond his years, his greatest strength lies in the ability to plan his battles several steps ahead of the opponent. He favors adaptability and versatility over raw power, and that preference is obvious in his choice of Pokemon, starting with what many consider his &quot;signature&quot; partner</i> <b>*blip*</b><br />
<br />
Just as you're about to finish the document, the computer switches off, as do most of the lights in the living room. It seems they were serious about the blackout! It's still bright enough for you to see your way around, if just barely, provided by a couple of low-voltage lamps in each division, meaning that power re-route has also been carefully planned so as not to leave the guests <i>completely</i> in the dark after curfew. This isn't a prison, after all.<br />
With little else to do, and the opening ceremony starting early in the morning, you figure the best you can do is turn in for the right to get some rest.<br />
<br />
After a while of wandering through the mansion-sized residence, you finally find the bedroom or the upper floor - a large, richly decorated division with several closets and a particularly large bed. Next to it is an elaborate bedside table, the dark red wood carved with shapes of several Pokemon. It feels almost criminal to actually <i>use</i> the furniture around here. Even so, you store your Bag away and prepare to get some shut-eye, noticing a small alarm clock already set to ring at 7 am the next morning.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
You wake up feeling refreshed, ready to take on the challenges ahead and the immense pressure of performing in front of the huge crowd that will undoubtedly be watching the Grand Farewell. You try to remember everything you learned about your first opponent last night, while remembering that even if you manage to beat Gym Leader Sean, you'll have to contend against a complete unknown in Trevor later in the day. But first things first, you don't want to miss Gottfried's opening speech!<br />
You rush out of the house as soon as you're ready, and make your way across the red brick road in the opposite direction from whence you came yesterday. After a while, you finally make it to the reception. It's only when the woman from yesterday greets you cheerfully that you freeze in place and remember something from the night before...<br />
<br />
- Good morning Mr Ethan, did you sleep well? Best of lucks out there tonight, don't forget to put on a show! And let me know if you need us to hold onto something for you while you're out there, alright?<br />
<br />
The note under the door... It said to surrender the Plates at the reception in the morning! While you doubt the woman knows anything about it (either that or she's great at faking it), you still have a choice to make before going into the Arena...<br />
<br />
Do you play it safe and leave the Plates here, or do you ignore the message from last night and move on? The show's about to start! </span></span> <br />

</blockquote><span style="color: #FF0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">Godric's Supersonic succeeded in distracting the Magcargo duo. Initially, anyway. One of them was completely distracted, and seemed to be just looking around and enjoying the scenery, while the other one, once the disorientation had worn off, immediately sought out the source of the attack. Upon spotting Godric, the Fire/Rock-type seemed to realize exactly what had happened. It nudged the other Magcargo, getting it to focus, and the two of them focused, right on Keith and Godric. &quot;Oh, boy,&quot; Keith murmured.<br />
<br />
It was at that moment that the man noticed Keith for the first time, and despite clearly being somewhere in the area of a decade older than him, ran behind him and cowered like a little kid. Keith resisted the urge to roll his eyes, and Godric looked as though he too was resisting the urge. &quot;Nido,&quot; he grunted.<br />
<br />
The Magcargo chose this moment to charge! ...or, in their case, slither forward. They really weren't built for speed, were they? Anyway, Keith knew that this was the time to act. &quot;<b>Drill Run</b>!&quot; he exclaimed, and Godric lunged forward immediately, striking one of the Magcargo with his horn, which was swirling with Ground energy. Keith grinned- a direct hit! Fire-types and Rock-types were both weak to Ground, so that move had to hurt! Indeed, the Magcargo landed several feet away from Godric in a heap of lava and rock. However, Keith's grin vanished faster than a plate of bacon in a Snorlax colony, for the Magcargo seemed to be reforming its body- it was using <b>Recover</b>! It even recooled some of its magma to repair its shell. And then, Keith noticed the second Magcargo, who had seen the opening and was seizing the opportunity. &quot;Godric, behind you!&quot; he exclaimed, but it was too late- the <b>Flamethrower</b> was launched, bright and blazing, and struck Godric directly. The Nidoking tripped, falling to one knee, and though his back had caught fire for a brief moment, it didn't seem to leave a burn. And now, the Magcargo he had hit before was right in front of him, also gearing up to use Flamethrower, while the second one was still right behind him.<br />
<br />
Wait a sec... Keith realized something. Godric was right between the two Magcargo, with one about to launch a Flamethrower at him. And there was nothing on either side of him that would prevent him from simply... moving off to the side. Right? And it ought to be an easy matter, too- anyone who's been a Pokémon Trainer for more than ten consecutive seconds ought to be able to know, between a Magcargo and a Nidoking, which one was the faster.<br />
<br />
&quot;Godric, dodge it! To the right!&quot; Keith exclaimed. &quot;Then use <b>Focus Energy</b>, and blast them with <b>Confusion</b>!&quot;</span></span></div>

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>Arc_Angel &amp; lilbluecorsola</u>:</u></b> <i>((Sorry for the delay!))</i><br />
<br />
<b>Jess:</b> The rise of Lilith, queen of ice and blood, represents as much of a danger as your previous predicament; even though the demonic Froslass effectively saved you from the incoming truck, her fury now promises unimaginable degrees of pain that make being ran over seem like the better scenario after all…<br />
<br />
For a while, it seems only you and Lilith remain in the entire festival. It’s as if her powers are altering this reality, which doesn’t seem all that real to begin with; in a fraction of second, the raucous crowd can no longer be heard; there are no more screams, crying children, not one more foot meets your broken body lying on the floor. The only thing that can be heard and felt is the bone-chilling wind; there is only fear, pain and cold, so much cold… The gale turns into a full-on hailstorm, ice crystals pelting your skin relentlessly, mercilessly; Lilith floats above you, blinded by otherworldly rage, and countless icicles take shape and hover around the Froslass, their sharp edges pointing directly at you…<br />
<br />
Suddenly, <i>everything</i> turns white. A powerful flash of light fills the entire area, and afterwards, an indescribable feeling of peace washes over you, easing your pain, somehow putting your mind at rest despite everything you just witnessed. Even with this intense radiance, for some reason you aren’t blinded and your eyes have no difficulty adjusting to the clarity; you watch as Lilith screeches and her body returns to red plasma before being forced back into Kristen’s Snow Ball. And when the light finally subsides, you find yourself inexplicably healed and strong enough to stand back up.<br />
<br />
The streets are still empty. Whether this is still a side effect of Lilith’s outburst or another manifestation of the light’s magic you can’t tell, but one thing you’re sure of – Alice, Haruki and Atzu’s corpses are nowhere to be found, not a trace of blood on the gravel either. You instinctively look at the truck that Kristen stopped, only to find the driver’s seat equally empty. And just then a soothing, feminine, almost musical voice is heard from <i>above</i>; you immediately look up and stand in awe of what you see – the figure of a woman completely covered in the same white light that banished Lilith before, floating in the sky like an angel.<br />
<br />
<i>Pay heed to the silent tale<br />
Of two girls by blood unbound;<br />
Understand this song of pain<br />
So one day may truth be found.<br />
<br />
Just like sisters, closest friends<br />
No parents to call their own<br />
Grew together in an orphanage<br />
Doomed to always be alone.</i><br />
<br />
You have strong suspicions as to who the woman of light is referring. The “angel” floats down until her feet are mere inches above the ground, directly in front of you, and resumes her poem.<br />
<br />
<i>One day came a kind old man<br />
When one was five, the other three;<br />
He offered to take them home<br />
Both were happy as could be.<br />
<br />
So began this tale of three<br />
A family of make-believe<br />
Though he gave them all his love<br />
One more thing he sought to give…</i><br />
<br />
The woman takes your hand in hers. It feels warm to the touch, especially after Lilith’s cold onslaught. She presses something against your open palm and closes your hand afterwards, uttering two final words before vanishing into nothingness.<br />
<br />
<i>Save her…</i><br />
<br />
After the apparition is gone, you open your hand again – in it is a similarly unremarkable <b>1x Green Feather</b>. Just then, you start to feel light-headed again, just like you did before finding yourself at the festival, and before you know it, you pass out…<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
<b>Jess:</b> A sprawling plains appears before your eyes. The strong sunlight forces you to squint and cover your eyes. There’s a delicate scent of grass and flowers in the air, in a scene that seems to be the antithesis of the Festival’s disaster. Remembering the previous events, your fingers immediately reach for your belt and feel the ice-cold touch of metal; for better or worse, the Snow Ball is still in your possession…<br />
<br />
-	You’re here! Hey, I didn’t know you could enter this place! But I’m so glad you came along Jess!<br />
<br />
The unmistakable voice of Felicia, brimming with happiness, comes from a nearby pond. You look over to find the young girl waving; but she isn’t wearing the same clothes as before…<br />
Her body is covered by an elegant white, sleeveless dress that reaches the floor, revealing only a pair of crystal slippers. She wears a silver necklace around her neck, adorned with a large blue gem; in each wrist is a bracelet featuring a similar gem, as is the delicate tiara placed on her head. Her hair, worked into an elaborate style of intertwined braids, complements the picture and is held in place by a platinum hairpin with another blue stone. She looks just like a princess out of a fairytale…<br />
<br />
Your eyes then immediately shift to the figure standing next to her. A familiar one, though you couldn’t describe it even if you wanted to... The truck driver, an ever-shifting mass of shadows, whose shape vaguely resembles that of a tall man, towers next to Felicia. One of its ethereal “hands” rests on the girl’s shoulders, who doesn’t seem to mind at all…<br />
<br />
-	The Shadow Man told me you brought Star Girl along! But you know, I don’t think he likes her very much… Didn’t you say they liked each other?<br />
<br />
She shrugs and kneels down by the lake, amused by a couple of Tympole swimming within. She then seems to remember something, turns to you with a frown and her voice swells with emotion.<br />
<br />
-	Serena used to come here to play, but today she didn’t… You showed up instead… What did you do to Serena? Is she mad at me? Did Star Girl harm her?! Say… do you like princesses?<br />
<br />
The last question is again asked in a jovial tone; you’ve gotten used to her mood swings by now, but this time she seems to be going somewhere with this…<br />
<br />
-	Serena and I used to pretend we were princesses all the time. We would dress up and hide from the bad witch until a prince came to save us… But you’re no prince, and you made Serena vanish… so are you the witch? You’re not wearing rags like one, and your nose isn’t the right size either…<br />
<br />
The Shadow Man suddenly dissolves into a swirling mass of darkness and envelops the girl shortly before vanishing entirely. Felicia’s eyes turn black and her voice changes slightly.<br />
<br />
-	Her favourite colour was blue, she always wore blue jewelry like this when she pretended to be a princess; her favourite Pokemon was also blue… do you know what she hated? <i>Red</i>.<br />
<br />
Just as the last word rolls off her tongue, darkness erupts from the ground and begins to take form; a moment later, a massive Magmortar grins and aims its arm cannon straight at you while shadows dance around its body. Felicia focuses her attention on the lake, again fascinated by the Pokemon inside, while muttering to herself.<br />
<br />
-	Red made her cry… everyone should be scared of red. Red burns… <br />
<br />
The Fire-Type looks ready to strike as its twisted smile widens… quick, what do you do?!</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: Silver"><span style="font-size: 9px">No more voices, but hail wailed instead, striking her skin more brutally – deliberately – than errant footsteps did before. One could forgive pain from panic. Here now though, the assailant aimed to anguish. Spears formed around Lilith, surrounding her in a fractal flower, tips trained on Jessica’s heart…<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the white expanded and burst, blessing the area with light. Despite the bright, Jess could somehow see clearer than before, and her body relaxed, feeling somehow at ease. She witnessed the Demon Queen’s downfall and imprisonment back in her icy cell – a frozen hell – as if banished by divine might itself. Jess felt her wounds wane, and when the holiness faded she found the strength to stand.<br />
<br />
The scene she returned to was the same, save for signs of any struggle or sadness. The remains of her teammates, the truck driver – all were gone – as if they had never existed in the first place. She stared at the empty streets, the overwhelming sense of loneliness and absence even worse than sorrow. At least then there was proof of grief, of guilt. What she was fighting for. To deny her life, her love, as a lie… What was left?<br />
<br />
A harmony descended from the heavens, taking the girl’s hand in hers. Jess realized she must really be losing her sanity, to be seeing and hearing angels. Either that or she had truly died, and the woman had come to guide her in order to join her comrades in heaven. Jess would gladly surrender her will to survive if it meant seeing her friends again, but the spirit instead recited a poem and impressed something in her palm: a bird’s modest mode of flight, soft as snow, but warm to the touch. Actually, perhaps it was her own flesh that was febrile – her head grew hot and dizzy once again, reminding of the spell cast prior. Though she tried to resist, the phoenix down was having its opposite effect – rather than revive her, it induced sleep until she fainted…<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
She woke to a peaceful plains, stretching mildly all around her. A sweetness filled the air, a complete contrast to the stench of blood and fear she smelled moments ago. As she recalled those events, her fingers flinched towards her waist, where the snowglobe still waited. Its cold exterior betrayed neither thoughts nor emotion of the one within…<br />
<br />
Someone’s speech roused her, and she rolled over in the grass to spot Felicia by a pool, dressed as if she were a princess in a fairytale. Beside her… Was no prince, but the mass of darkness that tried to murder her. He contacted her shoulder, to which Felicia reacted quite calmly.<br />
<br />
“The Shadow Man told me you brought Star Girl along! But you know, I don’t think he likes her very much… Didn’t you say they liked each other?”<br />
<br />
Jess frowned and shook her head, addressing the “Shadow Man” directly.<br />
<br />
“Lili- Kris is not the ‘Star Girl’ you speak of. The Shadow I know would be well aware of that. You are not Star Girl’s Shadow. …Who are you?”<br />
<br />
Felicia, having lost interest in the conversation, dropped to her knees and began watching a group of Tympole dancing in the waters. After a moment, she turned back to Jess, speaking with confused sentiment. Before Jess could respond, Felicia called her a “witch”, stopping the trainer in her tracks. She swallowed, fist clenching. Of all the roles she had hoped to be assigned in this mad play, this never-ending circus, the one she hated most... Of course, she could never be the hero. How could she, when she had allowed her companions to be killed before her very eyes?<br />
<br />
As if feeding off Jessica’s own despair as well, the Shadow Man morphed into a black blob, engulfing Felicia in its center. The victim’s irises flickered and dimmed – an image Jess recognized immediately as a mark of possession. Indeed, Felicia’s tone changed as she muttered enigmatically, turning back to the lake. Her words however gave birth to an enormous hellbeast, shadows taking the shape of flames as it leveled its cannon towards her.<br />
<br />
Jess bit her lip, hesitating over her belt. The pure metal gleamed, eager for escape. …No, she couldn’t risk it. Not after last time. Though she had little regard for her own, Felicia’s life was at stake too. Jess couldn’t overlook the possibility of putting her in more danger. What other option was there though? She gazed desperately about, observing nothing but vacant meadow. Not even a single tree or rock to use as cover. There was only the lake in the center… Jessica gulped, knowing what she was about to do was crazy and probably wouldn’t work. (Besides, if she were the witch, then it would be tantamount to suicide anyway.) But between this and potentially unleashing two demons against each other, she figured it was the safest bet.<br />
<br />
“Felicia, hold your breath!”<br />
<br />
She cried, hoping the soul within could hear as she dashed forward and grabbed the host’s hand, dragging into the water as she dived beneath the surface. Closing her eyes to stave off her own fear of submersion, she held Felicia’s form close within the cleansing source, praying it would protect them both from being burned at the stake…</span></span></div>

<br />
<b><u>Salin City</u></b><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>Electric Blue Eye</u>:</u></b> You reason that researching your first opponent is the best way to get a good start. As curious as you are about the retiring Champion, you correctly assume that you won't time toresearch both bios, so you boot the PC and access the &quot;Grand Farewell Bios&quot; folder - in it, as expected, are only three files: &quot;Gottfried.pdf&quot;, &quot;Sean.pdf&quot; and &quot;Trevor.pdf&quot;. You had half-hoped that information on all other participants would be available as well, but it seems they did think of everything by only allowing these 3 documents to be viewed. You can only hope they change the available bios tomorrow, in case you make it that far...<br />
<br />
You select &quot;Sean.pdf&quot; and open it. A small 3-page document appears, detailing the Gym Leader's most significant data. You skim through the file, hastily trying to absorb as much information as you can before the power is cut.<br />
<br />
<i>Sean, Male, 25 years old<br />
<b>Category:</b> Gym Leader<br />
<b>Location:</b> Pearl Lake, Crater Island, Cascadia Archipelago<br />
<b>Type Specialty:</b> Water<br />
<b>Career Highlights:</b><br />
- Official League Starter received (age 10).<br />
- Completed Cascadia Gym Challenge (age 16)<br />
- Approved as Gym Trainer at Hiel Research Base, Glacier Island, Cascadia Archipelago (age 18)<br />
- Teacher at Cascadia's Pokemon School (age 18 - 20)<br />
- Approved as Gym Leader at Pearl Lake, Crater Island, Cascadia Archipelago (age 20)<br />
<br />
<b>Bio:</b> Sean has made a name for himself as one of Cascadia's best Trainers from an early age. Born and raised on Crater Island, he grew accustomed to a life surrounded by Water-Type Pokemon.<br />
Outside of battling, he has taken an interest in teaching up-and-coming Trainers, his pondered and level-headed demeanor making him an excellent tutor.<br />
Wise beyond his years, his greatest strength lies in the ability to plan his battles several steps ahead of the opponent. He favors adaptability and versatility over raw power, and that preference is obvious in his choice of Pokemon, starting with what many consider his &quot;signature&quot; partner</i> <b>*blip*</b><br />
<br />
Just as you're about to finish the document, the computer switches off, as do most of the lights in the living room. It seems they were serious about the blackout! It's still bright enough for you to see your way around, if just barely, provided by a couple of low-voltage lamps in each division, meaning that power re-route has also been carefully planned so as not to leave the guests <i>completely</i> in the dark after curfew. This isn't a prison, after all.<br />
With little else to do, and the opening ceremony starting early in the morning, you figure the best you can do is turn in for the right to get some rest.<br />
<br />
After a while of wandering through the mansion-sized residence, you finally find the bedroom or the upper floor - a large, richly decorated division with several closets and a particularly large bed. Next to it is an elaborate bedside table, the dark red wood carved with shapes of several Pokemon. It feels almost criminal to actually <i>use</i> the furniture around here. Even so, you store your Bag away and prepare to get some shut-eye, noticing a small alarm clock already set to ring at 7 am the next morning.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
You wake up feeling refreshed, ready to take on the challenges ahead and the immense pressure of performing in front of the huge crowd that will undoubtedly be watching the Grand Farewell. You try to remember everything you learned about your first opponent last night, while remembering that even if you manage to beat Gym Leader Sean, you'll have to contend against a complete unknown in Trevor later in the day. But first things first, you don't want to miss Gottfried's opening speech!<br />
You rush out of the house as soon as you're ready, and make your way across the red brick road in the opposite direction from whence you came yesterday. After a while, you finally make it to the reception. It's only when the woman from yesterday greets you cheerfully that you freeze in place and remember something from the night before...<br />
<br />
- Good morning Mr Ethan, did you sleep well? Best of lucks out there tonight, don't forget to put on a show! And let me know if you need us to hold onto something for you while you're out there, alright?<br />
<br />
The note under the door... It said to surrender the Plates at the reception in the morning! While you doubt the woman knows anything about it (either that or she's great at faking it), you still have a choice to make before going into the Arena...<br />
<br />
Do you play it safe and leave the Plates here, or do you ignore the message from last night and move on? The show's about to start!</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver">Accessing the computer's database for anything related to the Grand Farewell, Ethan came across a folder which contained information of all featured participates for tomorrows proceedings, no more and no less. With his hand on his strong jaw, rubbing at his 5 o'clock shadow the young man began skimming through Sean's doc as quickly as he’s blue eyes could before it cut off, but just as he was about to read what most considered to be Sean’s signature Pokémon all the lights in the house flickered off, leaving Ethan completely in the dark. <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess they weren't kidding about the blackout, huh Adam?&quot; the trainer said to his Sableye, but the creature wouldn't respond, &quot;Right Adam?...Ada-&quot; A moment passed before a few carefully placed low voltage lamps turned on and gave the darkened space some illumination, finding his creature had peacefully fallen asleep right next to him, still clutching with his claw the bag of cookies he had been eating from while Ethan had spent his time on the computer.<br />
<br />
With the lights off and a pooped out Sableye next to him, Ethan figured there wasn't anything else to do but get some rest.<br />
<br />
Standing up and picking up his little creature from off of the couch without disturbing him, the young man carried him up onto his shoulders before kneeling down to pick up his pack and using the little light that was provided to him, carefully made his way up the stairs to the upper floor where his bedroom was. <br />
<br />
The room like the rest of the house was fully furnished, and everything was placed perfectly where it should be, it was like he was in a museum, and Ethan didn’t want to touch a thing. He had found a cabinet to put his things and pulled out a drawer for his Sableye to sleep in, placing in the hard wooden box a small blanket big enough for him, incase Adam got cold. Of course Adam never minded the cold.<br />
<br />
Ethan had been too tired and worn out to change his street clothes, deciding just to sleep in them. Looking at the large bed before him he collapsed onto the bed before pulling the sheets over him. The softness of it making it easy for him to quickly drift off to dreamland...<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
The next morning Ethan awoke to the alarm he had seen the night before set at 7am, the early morning sun kissing his cheek. Waking up refreshed the boy sat up and stretched looking at his little ghoul sleeping peacefully. He had completely forgotten what today was until he realized this wasn't some gutter he was waking up in, this was a bed! <br />
<br />
Quickly getting up Ethan rushed into the shower, scraping, shaving, brushing, changing...until he was ready, by the time he was out his Sableye had just got up himself growling, &quot;Well good morning to you too, sunshine!&quot; Ethan said before the creature began climbing his back till he reached the boy's shoulder and yawned happily~<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on let's go! We’re gone be late!&quot; he said grabbing his pack, running down stairs where he grabbed the complementary chocolate milk from yesterday, drinking it all on his way out of the door.<br />
<br />
Today was the day he would meet all the Gym leader's, and preform in front of a large crowd all for the Champion! He was almost sure a lot of people would look at him and wonder why he was chosen to compete, to be fair he didn't know himself but it didn't matter if they judged him or not, he and his Pokémon were going to give their all and that's that.<br />
<br />
He closed the door firmly behind him, and began to run down the red bricked road leading toward the stadium, when he wondered how Dorothy must of felt when she walked down the yellow bricked road heading toward The Emerald City...<br />
<br />
Making his way to the receptionist Ethan had completely forgotten about the note underneath his door the night before when the woman behind the desk greeted him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning Mr Ethan, did you sleep well? Best of lucks out there tonight, don't forget to put on a show! And let me know if you need us to hold onto something for you while you're out there, alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Crap, the Plates</i> he cursed inside his head. &quot;No.&quot; the boy said trying to see if the receptionist would bat an eye in response to him not leaving the plates with her, &quot;Just directions to where I need to go, from my understanding Gottfried’s speech is about to start and I want to make a good impression.&quot; <br />

<br />
<b>Stacey:</b> Utter desperation begins to set in at the millionth death you experience. Your mind starts to cave in, and just as you’re about to give up and accept your eternal fate, a glimmer of hope materializes in the palm of your hand. Realizing that the presence within may be your only hope of breaking the cycle – regardless of what must happen to Stantler to do so -, you hurl the Blue Cyberball straight at the incoming deer with the very last of your strengths. Your eyes follow the sphere’s path and watch as it collides with one of Stantler’s horns, temporarily staggering it and forcing the device open. From inside hops Dwemer, silent and resolute like always, and stoically stands between you and the quadruped who is about to resume its charge.<br />
<br />
The golem’s eyes narrow upon entering the battlefield, ready to carry out your gruesome orders without a hint of hesitation. It waits until the beast is in range and unleashes a vicious Dynamic Punch that stops Stantler dead in its tracks, completely halting its movement and almost knocking it out clean! Dazed beyond hope, the deer wobbles and looks around lost in confusion, but Dwemer’s not done with it… Grabbing the beast by the antlers, it <i>lifts the creature off the ground</i> and starts to pull, harder and harder, hoisting the victim helplessly in the air… until a loud <i>crack</i> echoes throughout the forest when the Pokemon’s horns are ripped from its skull! A crimson shower covers the heartless Ghost-Type as it releases the dead Stantler, throwing its carcass to the floor and leaving it in a pool of its own blood.<br />
<br />
For the first time in what feels like years, you lay on the ground unharmed; the sharp, unforgiving edge of those cruel horns didn’t pierce you, and never will again. Dwemer walks over to you and tries to help you back to your feet, but you’re too tired … Just then, a flash of light covers the forest, and everything around you – Dwemer, Reaper, Stantler’s body – disappears in an instant. There is only you and the light that washes over your body, somehow relieving you of all pain and fatigue… you find yourself able to get back up and do so; looking up, the figure of a woman covered in that same light stands in front of you. Her radiance is intense but you don’t feel the need to so much as cover your eyes; the light is strong enough that you can’t see the woman’s features, but at the same time it doesn’t blind you…<br />
<br />
The woman of light floats barely above the ground, and recites a poem in the most delicate, melodic voice you ever heard.<br />
<br />
<i>Once a happy, carefree man<br />
Darkness came and changed it all;<br />
At the hands of that foul beast<br />
One by one he watched them fall.<br />
<br />
Parents, scientists, all would die<br />
On the Glacier Isle that day.<br />
So did all others who tried<br />
Such evil they could not slay.</i><br />
<br />
She floats over to you, takes your hand in hers and presses something against your palm.<br />
<br />
<i>Heatran, Raikou, Articuno<br />
And the man who owned the three<br />
The hero of Fizzytopia<br />
Soon arrived to set him free.<br />
<br />
And although his life was saved<br />
Darkest dreams began to rise<br />
Overtime his mind collapsed<br />
So began the man’s demise…</i><br />
<br />
The brightness begins to fade, and soon the forest is back to the way it was before; Dwemer stands by your side, looking at you with what you assume is concern. The woman disappears along with the light, leaving you with a final message:<br />
<br />
<i>Save him…</i><br />
<br />
You look at what she gave you; as it turns out, it’s nothing more than a simple <b>1x Green Feather</b>… what is the meaning of all this? You ponder on the woman’s words and remember your previous assumption. This poem… who was she talking about? Was it really the mayor of Fizzytopia… or someone else?<br />
<br />
Just as you begin to dwell on the matter, a sudden feeling of drowsiness overpowers you, much like the one that your felt before you wound up here. Strength leaves your body once again and is replaced by an intense need to sleep; you fall back and your eyes close…<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
<b>Stacey:</b> Stone walls rise all around you, impenetrable and inescapable, forming a square area of considerable length. There’s a fine layer of sand beneath your feet, and dust kicks up when you walk. Empty wooden stands can be spotted to your right, and the whole place is in silence save for the rhythmic sound of metal against metal. Your hand instinctively reaches down to your belt… thankfully, the Cyberball is still there.<br />
<br />
Initially, you thought you were all alone. But it’s evident that you’re not; looking over to the source of the noise, you find someone clad in a suit of armour swinging a two-handed sword against a mannequin in chainmail. The knight stops as he too becomes aware of your presence; he turns to face you and removes his helmet, revealing… Felicia’s father?!<br />
<br />
-	Stacey! How kind of you to join me. I must apologize for the awkward meal…<br />
<br />
You expect him to elaborate, but instead he simply resumes his practice, striking the mannequin repeatedly with his claymore.<br />
<br />
-	How wonderful it must be to be called a hero, no? You should know the feeling, given your widespread reputation… I wouldn’t know, of course. I never did much of anything noteworthy, save for a speech or two… I fashion myself more of a survivor, but if I am so, it’s because of <i>others</i> who were destined to be heroes. Meant for greatness, public recognition and the unconditional love of the masses…<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the mannequin’s chainmail shatters into a million pieces, and the practice doll itself begins to dissolve and spill to the ground as a viscous mass of darkness. Then, spinning and rising, the shadows take the shape of a man, who bows before the old man as if he were a king.<br />
<br />
-	The world of today lacks real heroes, Stacey. Do you fashion yourself a <i>real</i> hero? How many lives have you ever saved? I’ve met true heroes myself, and they were nothing like you… They could defeat any danger, any creature, no matter how… <i>Evil</i>.<br />
<br />
The last word echoes across the arena in a completely different voice, booming with overwhelming malice. The shadow Man vanishes into the ground, and darkness sprouts back up only a couple of feet from where you stand; the shadows swirl and dance, until they give form… to a terrifying Hydreigon!<br />
<br />
Felicia’s father again resumes practicing his swordplay, nonchalantly talking to himself while he does so.<br />
<br />
-	Only true heroes can conquer evil… he was a true hero, wasn’t he? Oh yes he was…<br />
<br />
The three-headed behemoth roars as it lays eyes on you; it spreads its wings and takes to the skies, then begins to dive down straight at you! Quick, what do you do?!</span></span>

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver">As the blue orb left her hand Stacey slumped to the ground watching as it made its way towards its target. The Cyberball smacked the Stantler on the horn startling it and releasing the ghost from within. Dwemer stood before his trainer who lay covered in mud, a look of exhaustion and pain on her face, he turned from her to the charging Stantler. His orders were clear but gruesome but he never faltered in choice and as the Stantler bend its down down once more he slammed his fist into its skull with a <b>Dynamic Punch</b> that sent the beast sprawling back, nearly knocking it out with the one blow. The deer staggered about its eyes glassy and unfocused but Dwemer wasn't finished yet, his trainer had asked for him to kill the beast and he didn't look back to her to see if she had changed her mind. He approached the Stantler and grabbed it by the horns. Stacey lay in the dirt watching as her Pokemon forced the beast's horns apart with his Superpower until they snapped, the sound of the Stantler's death filling the dark forest. The sound was the greatest comfort Stacey could have ever asked for. As it died her she finally relaxed, her pain would never come again and as her Golett approached her covered his red war paint she felt no regret. She didn't regret her orders nor did she apologise for issuing them. Dwemer bent down and reached for Stacey but she didn't reach back, she not strength left to move. He lifted her so she leant against his strong body as he supported her in silence, enjoying the sound her of her breathing. Suddenly a flash of light erupts forth covering the forest and everything was gone, even Dwemer behind her, it was like she was supported in the air by nothing! Her body suddenly jolted, as if struck by electricity and she gasped, she felt normal again, no pain, no fear, no exhaustion and getting back to her feet she marvelled at the feeling. As she focused on her surroundings it was then she noticed the woman before her bathed in the bright white light but it didn't burn her eyes. She couldn't make out the woman's features but her attention was soon drawn to her voice as she floated towards her reciting a poem.<br />
<br />
<i>Once a happy, carefree man<br />
Darkness came and changed it all;<br />
At the hands of that foul beast<br />
One by one he watched them fall.<br />
<br />
Parents, scientists, all would die<br />
On the Glacier Isle that day.<br />
So did all others who tried<br />
Such evil they could not slay.</i><br />
<br />
She takes Stacey's hand in her hers and she felt something pressed into her palm as she continued her poem.<br />
<br />
<i>Heatran, Raikou, Articuno<br />
And the man who owned the three<br />
The hero of Fizzytopia<br />
Soon arrived to set him free.<br />
<br />
And although his life was saved<br />
Darkest dreams began to rise<br />
Overtime his mind collapsed<br />
So began the man’s demise…</i><br />
<br />
The light begins to fade away and Stacey was back in the forest with Dwemer by her side looking up at her with concern on his face. The woman disappears along with the light with a final plee ... &quot;Save him!&quot; As everything returned to 'normal' Stacey opened her hand to look down at the green feather there. There was nothing remarkable about it. The woman's words rang through her head, was she talking about that day? About the Mayor of Fizzytopia? She didn't have much more time to think about it as she started to feel a heavy weight on her eyes, all her energy fading once again just with the tainted meal and she fell back to the ground asleep once more.<br />
<br />
Stacey 'awoke' to find herself walking, had she been sleep walking? Her next thought was that she was no longer in the forest, tall thick stone walls formed an impressive square room to which she could see no exit. To the right were empty wooden stands and the only sounds bar her shoes kicking up dust as she was walked was the sound of metal hitting metal. It was repetitive, 'clang' 'clang' 'clang' and she reached down to her belt sighing with relief as she felt Dwemer's Cyberball in its rightful place. She was beginning to get tired of being dragged through these dreams and trips down memory lane. She didn't appreciate being messed with! She looked over to the source of the noise to see someone clad in a suit of armour sparring with a large broadsword against a chain-mail mannequin. As if finally sensing her presence the knight stops his training and turns around removing his helmet to reveal Felicia's father! Oh how nice of him to make an appearance in this mess! He greats her warmly apologising for the awkward meal and Stacey snorts, she had spent the last eternity feeling pain and sorrow, now she was just pissed off. He doesn't care to elaborate on his statement and returns to his sparring. He spoke to her once more, calling her a hero, he almost seemed bitter by the term and called himself a survivor, one left to drown in the shadows of those around him and as he finished speaking his mannequin shatters into a million pieces before swarming together into a black gooey mass. The darkness ripples and takes form of a man that bows to the mayor as if he was a King. <br />
<br />
-	The world of today lacks real heroes, Stacey. Do you fashion yourself a <i>real</i> hero? How many lives have you ever saved? I’ve met true heroes myself, and they were nothing like you… They could defeat any danger, any creature, no matter how… <i>Evil</i>.<br />
<br />
His last words seem to magnify, echoing throughout the room with utter malice and the shadow man dissolves, the darkness taking a new shape, this one much larger and more menacing. The shadow Hydreigon stands tall and terrifying, its three heads staring down at her, looking as if she was its next meal. Felicia's father picks up his sword and once again begins to practice with the weapon once more. <br />
<br />
-	Only true heroes can conquer evil… he was a true hero, wasn’t he? Oh yes he was…<br />
<br />
And with that the Hydreigon lets loose an almighty roar and spreading its wings it takes to the sky before diving back down with blistering speed right for her. There were several things she wanted to say to the deluded 'King' in his suit of armour that liked to play with darkness but right now he was the least of her problems. If she didn't move she was going to get crushed and she had experienced enough pain for one lifetime. She pulled Dwemer's ball free cursing how she felt as if she was moving in slow motion and dove to the side hoping that it would be enough distance and threw the Cyberball. Again she was calling on her young Golett to save her in a dire life-threatening situation. She was pushing him hard and this time she worried how it was scar him but he was her only hope. He had proven his loyalty before, now she called on his bravery. She mentally called out to him again ...<br />
<br />
<i>'Dwemer, the nightmare isn't over though I sincerely wish it was. I need you again my brave knight, a much larger threat is diving right at me now. If it wants to hit the ground so quickly how about you help it along with your <b>Gravity</b> and really slow it down with a <b>Trick Room</b>. Test the strength of the new reality with an <b>Earth Power</b>, lets see if we can bring the walls crashing down on top of the new beast in the room!'</i> </span></span></div>

<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> The course of action seemed obvious: stuck between two opponents but with ample room to maneuver to each side, you immediately order Godric to roll to the right and evade the incoming Flamethrower. The Nidoking seems to have been expecting the instruction, tenses the muscles in his legs and stares at the Magcargo with absolute concentration. Then, just as the fire slug releases the stream of flames, the Poison-Type leaps to the side and you watch as the flames barely miss Godric and instead hit the second Magcargo behind him!<br />
<br />
- YEEAAH, WAY TO GO, TAKE THAT!<br />
<br />
The nervous man seems ecstatic at the turn of events, but did he really have to be so... enthusiastic? For a reporter, he <i>really</i> doesn't seem used to any sort of actual danger...<br />
<br />
The Flamethrower engulfs the other Magcargo, who soaks up the flames as if they were nothing. However, Godric's timely evasion catches both wild slugs off-guard, and as they struggle to regroup he takes the opportunity to tighten his focus. The second they turn around to attack again, the Nidoking's eyes glow purple and both Magcargo start wincing in pain from an invisible force, staggering them even further.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, your eyes widen as Godric maintains his Psychic pressure on the foes - a stream of molten fire seems to fly all the from the river of lava nearby and hits your partner square in the back, making him fall over once more! You try to make out what happened and your heart sinks as you spot <i>two more</i> Magcargo emerging from the river and slithering toward you! One of them must have attacked with the <b>Lava Plume</b> you just saw... and what's worse, a large amount of that lava covers Godric's back, leaving him with a huge <span style="color: red"><b>Burn</b></span>!<br />
<br />
The first two opponents break free from the psychic grip and look even more pissed than before, although visibly weakened by the move. All four Magcargo surround you, Godric and the reporter, and your Nidoking is still reeling from the latest blow...<br />
<br />
- Oh boy, oh boy, this can't be good! Dude, come on, we gotta split!<br />
<br />
&quot;Split&quot; is exactly how any Trainer worth his salt would feel right now. Running away from a battle is always such a difficult decision to make...<br />
<br />
- Stop wasting time, we gotta go! I've been covering a story in this place for a while now, I know my way around! Look, I'm leaving with or without you!<br />
<br />
You believe in Godric, and you know you'd have good chances of beating any one of the Magcargo one on one; besides, you did come here in part to help your Pokemon get stronger, after all! On the other hand, this battle has just turned into a 4-on-1 assault and Godric has been Burned... It's time to make a choice!<br />
<br />
Do you hold your ground and fight off the Magcargo, or do you forfeit and follow the reporter to safety? </span></span> <br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>Arc_Angel &amp; lilbluecorsola</u>:</u></b> <i>((Lilblue: please don’t take it the wrong way, but that last part of your reply could be considered self-updating. Running for the lake is fine, making it there is alright but successfully dragging along an NPC into the water while a foe is targeting you is pushing it a little…))</i><br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Jess:</b> You run as fast as you can, fearing for your own life, but most importantly, Felicia’s. Not knowing how far the Magmortar will go, you act on instinct, refusing to release Lilith again. You tackle the absent-minded girl right into the lake along with you, disappearing from sight just as a fireball grazes the water’s surface…<br />
<br />
Suddenly, everything is cold and blurred. The Tympole flee, scared by the unexpected bodies that invaded their realm. You can’t breathe, lest you drown, but no matter what you don’t let go of the young woman you dragged along in hopes of preserving her well-being. Felicia, a blur among many, doesn’t struggle; in fact, she doesn’t move a muscle. She remains apathetic, much like she was after being engulfed by the darkness… She won’t even fight to hold her breath! Like a lifeless shell, she is content to sink deeper into the lake you pushed her into. Was it really a good idea after all?...<br />
<br />
You realize you’re in a perilous situation. If you remain underwater, you’ll run out of oxygen soon. On the other hand, the demon awaits you on the surface… While you try your hardest to come up with a solution, something even colder than the water around you begins to <i>crawl</i> along your arm, chilling you to the bone! Looking down, you see a shapeless black mass emerging from Felicia’s hand you’re holding and slowly engulfing your own arm… and all of a sudden, a familiar scene starts flashing before your eyes.<br />
<br />
You’re running across the crowded streets of Fizzytopia yet again. You’re tired, scared and lost; everyone around you is screaming and running in different directions. People bump into you repeatedly as you walk against the tide with a purpose. You have to find her! You have to find your sister?<br />
<br />
<i>But you don’t have a sister, do you?...</i><br />
<br />
The flames are closer; the burning zeppelin is only a few feet away! You have to know, you have to do something!<br />
<br />
-	Felicia, stop!! Get away from there!!<br />
<br />
You turn your head to the familiar voice. Your teary eyes find your father on the podium, right next to the Mayor of Fizzytopia. Dad had just finished his speech when the disaster happened…<br />
<br />
<i>But that isn’t your dad, is he?...</i><br />
<br />
Almost everyone has fled the scene by now. You can’t turn back now… your tiny hands are shaking at the sight of all this carnage. Bodies everywhere, victims of the crashing Hero’s Float, some partially burned, others crushed by debris. And among the corpses, two steps in front of you… was Serena’s. Your little sister is dead!<br />
<br />
<i>But you’ve never seen Serena before, have you?...</i><br />
<br />
That’s right… this all feels wrong. The sight of Serena’s body stirs up unspeakable emotions, but they’re foreign. The voice in the back of your head is appealing to your reason – none of this is your own reality. You understand now… you’re reliving Felicia’s memories! That’s why you know this girl, and that’s why – at long last – you know who their father is. Right there on the podium, minutes after revealing that “the creature has woken”…<br />
<br />
You start to cough. For some reason, you are unable to breathe. Your mouth feels wet, you start to choke… Oceanic Drive and all of Fizzytopia fade from view again, and you remember everything – you’re about to drown, and so is Felicia! You see in horror that the darkness has settled around your neck as well as Felicia’s, shaped like claws, squeezing the life out of you!<br />
<br />
<i>Break its hold, weaken its curse!</i><br />
<br />
A glowing light suddenly emanates from your free hand; as strength begins to leave you, your hand opens and the shining object in it floats upwards and into your blurred field of view. Shortly before you lose consciousness, you realize it’s the <b>Green Feather</b> you received earlier. Its glow intensifies as the voice is heard one last time…<br />
<br />
<i>Reach for the truth, the light to pierce these shadows…<br />
Who drugged you and put you in this world? Whose darkness is this? Who is responsible for making you see the deaths of your friends and the birth of Lilith? Who caused all this pain to Felicia?<br />
<b>What is that man’s name</b>?!</i> <br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
<b>Stacey:</b> The Hydreigon roars as it makes its way down, making the very earth tremble in its wake. You struggle to keep your footing, while the old man seems unfazed and continues to swing his blade randomly in the air, as if you weren’t there, lost in apathy. He seems to be under some kind of outside influence as opposed to being the cause of all this as it first seemed…<br />
<br />
You realize you’re helpless against a raging dragon on your own; besides, you’ve had enough pain to last you a lifetime. You vow that things will be different this time as you summon your faithful partner Dwemer once more. However, this is no wild Stantler…<br />
<br />
The Golett emerges from his Cyberball and faces up at the massive hydra with an unreadable expression, as always. He must know he’s outmatched, both in size and type, but if he’s in any way apprehensive he doesn’t let it shine through. The Hydreigon, in turn, doesn’t seem to even acknowledge the ghost’s presence, its six eyes firmly locked on you with murderous intent as it continues to dive down, looking to bite your head off in one fell swoop!<br />
<br />
Dwemer brings his hands together at the last minute, and suddenly the dragon changes trajectory to a much steeper angle; overpowered by the sudden increase in gravity, it collapses to the floor with a thud so powerful it actually knocks you off your feet and onto your back! Stone shards fly all over the place from the crater left by Hydreigon, who struggles to break free of the intense force pulling him down. Seizing the opportunity, Dwemer concentrates and erects a transparent dome around both him and the foe. Suddenly, it’s as if Hydreigon is moving in slow motion and Dwemer at double speed! The ground beneath you begins to rumble and shake slightly, and just as Dwemer is about to unleash his Earth Power, a sphere of pure darkness expands from the dragon’s body and everything turns black…<br />
<br />
<i>Wake up…</i><br />
<br />
You open your eyes, feeling exhausted. It’d been another nightmare. You wake up in an icy cave, yet another one, as a man that somehow feels familiar is preparing a meal by the bonfire. Connor, the celebrated Hero, looks at you with a smile and cracks a joke to calm you down.<br />
<br />
-	Another sleepless night? Poor child, those nightmares will be the end of you some day…<br />
<br />
<i>But you don’t know Connor, do you?...</i><br />
<br />
You nod and try to put the bad dream behind you. But you can’t forget about it; after all, the nightmares come back every night. You haven’t had a decent night’s sleep since the day the Beast destroyed your village. Since then, as if possessed by some dark entity, all your dreams end in violence in death…<br />
<br />
<i>But you’ve never seen the Beast before, have you?...</i><br />
<br />
Connor’s victory over the Beast had been the most important moment in the history of Fizzy Bubbles, and you witnessed it firsthand. The joy of such a momentous occasion should have been enough to lay your worries to rest, but every time you close your eyes, memories of your family burning to ash come back to haunt you, as if you’re trapped in a “dark void” that always envelops you when you fall asleep…<br />
<br />
<i>But Hydreigon can’t trap souls in <b>Dark Void</b>s, can they?...</i><br />
<br />
Hydreigon?... That’s right! You don’t belong here... you don’t know this man, these memories aren’t yours! But you know who they belong to… you can feel it – these are Felicia’s father’s memories!<br />
<br />
A cry of pain suddenly fills your ears and the ice cave fades from view. When you next blink, you find yourself back in the room and witness Hydreigon holding Dwemer in its enormous fangs, threatening to crush it if it keeps increasing the pressure! Unnatural shadows swirl around the three-headed beast and coalesce to vaguely remember a creature riding the dragon’s head…<br />
<br />
<i>Break its hold, weaken its curse!</i><br />
<br />
Something suddenly begins to glow in your hand; you open it to find the <b>Green Feather</b> from before, and watch as its shine grows stronger. The feather starts floating and a familiar voice echoes in the back of your mind.<br />
<br />
<i> Reach for the truth, the light to pierce these shadows…<br />
The old man isn’t who you think, as someone else is about to discover. But is he truly to blame for all this? Or is he too trapped in a dark void of neverending despair? Can a mere human do such a thing?<br />
<b>What is truly responsible for these nightmares</b>?!</i></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u> Electric Blue Eye</u>:</b> You decide to decline the woman's offer to keep any of your items, refusing to relinquish the Plates out of fear she may be in on the scheme to take them from you; instead, you ask for directions and she is happy to provide them - if she's upset in any way, she does a good job of hiding it.<br />
<br />
Following her instructions, you immediately quicken your pace toward the guarded entrance with a &quot;Competitors&quot; sign above it. The door is located to your right, whereas another one on your left (with considerably more people flocking to it) is meant for &quot;Spectators&quot;. You can't help but notice only 5 other people stand by the Competitor's door, waiting to be admitted. None look familiar, but as you remember the initial requirements for registration, you reason that they all must be formidable Trainers. Either that or they all had their acceptance conditions tweaked at the last minute, but somehow that seems extremely unlikely.<br />
<br />
You walk close to the guards and wait for your turn. One of them approaches you, checks the tablet he's holding and nods.<br />
<br />
- Challenger Ethan, welcome to the Grand Farewell Tournament. Please proceed to the door on the far end of this corridor, where you and the other competitors will be given honorary seats to listen to Champion Gottfried's speech. You will receive further instructions upon its conclusion.<br />
<br />
You pass through the door and find yourself on a long, narrow passage with a mahogany door on the far end, just like the man said. You walk along the red tapestry-covered corridor, noticing the walls adorned with several paintings and portraits. You recognize the faces of many world-class Trainers: Red, Green, Lance, Steven Stone, Wallace, Cynthia, Alder and Iris, all Champions from far-away regions; other notable photos include Fizzy Bubbles' Elite Five Arnold, Tess, Stacey, Stark and Hayward. In a way, it feels intimidating to be stared at by so many legends, even if they're only pictures...<br />
When you finally reach the large wooden gate, you notice it has been carved to resemble a lion's head, with a majestic flowing mane embedded with the <i>Daimonji</i> symbol. Your hand rests on the handle as you briefly wonder why this carving looks familiar, but you can't dwell on it too long as you hear the roaring crowd on the other side of the door. Breathing in deeply, you enter the Challengers' Room.<br />
<br />
- Ohhh~, another one?<br />
<br />
Your jaw almost drops from the sight before you. You find yourself in an open balcony with the floor covered in red carpet like the corridor; six chairs are lined in the middle, overlooking the entire arena. Countless spectators have gathered in the stands below you, a sellout crowd for sure. It's impossible to tell, but if you had to guess, there must be well over 50.000 people!<br />
<br />
The other five Trainers you'd spotted before are all gathered here, each of them having taken a seat already. One vacant chair remains, and one of the them urges you to take it.<br />
<br />
- Come on, join us! We're all moderately friendly, except for Kayl over there, he just doesn't care. The speech is about to start! I don't think Gottfried has ever made a public announcement in his life before; then again, that's kinda why they call him the &quot;Silent King&quot;... I wonder why he's stepping down. Legends like him should never go away!<br />
<br />
The Trainer is clearly passionate about this whole thing. It seems that Gottfried retiring is a huge deal around these parts. You can't help but feel curious as well... You take the remaining seat, and just as you sit down the entire crowd seems to get up! The noise intensifies, and when the unmistakable sound of a microphone going live is heard through the speakers, you know the speech is about to start! Suddenly, the other five Trainers look to their left and lean slightly off the balcony. You follow their gaze and finally understand... your seats were placed immediately to the right of the main balcony, twice the size of yours, where the star of the moment is standing! The layout of the place finally makes sense to you: The Champion is in the center, with the challengers to his right and eight people on a third balcony to his left, which you assume are the Gym Leaders that were invited.<br />
<br />
Your eyes finally rest on the man whom entire event was put together for, as Gottfried slowly makes his way from a large golden chair to the microphone on the edge of the main balcony.<br />
The man, while old, is enormous. Broad-shouldered and imposing, he wears a long, heavy-looking crimson cape that almost reaches the floor. It's hard to tell where you're standing what he's wearing underneath, since the cape pretty much covers his entire frame. He has a very serious expression, just like in that picture that Clyde showed you earlier, and has the same thick white beard, which is at first glance is vaguely shaped like the flames of a Fire Blast... His head is completely bald and his eyes are a cold light-blue. His entire figure commands respect, and although 50.000 people came to see him, he doesn't seem the least bit inclined to be here.<br />
<br />
<i>- THANK YOU GOTTFRIED! *clap clap clapclapclap* THANK YOU GOTTFRIED! *clap clap clapclapclap**</i><br />
<br />
The sight of all these people cheering for a single man is both heartwarming and awe-inspiring. They all seem to idolize the elder, despite his apparent posture; with a hardened, unreadable expression, his eyes are locked on the crowd, hardly blinking. He waits until the chants die down somewhat and takes the mic.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #B22222">- Just look at you.</span><br />
<br />
His voice is deep, raspy, powerful. And still, you notice a hint of fatigue.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #B22222">- Thousands upon thousands chanting for an old man, a dying legacy. You are all fools, each and every one of you without exception! And yet... I am moved.</span><br />
<br />
The deafening silence that had fallen over the arena as Gottfried uttered his first words suddenly broke out in cheers again.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #B22222">- That so many of you chose to be here today instead of moving on with your lives... is both foolish and rewarding.</span><br />
<br />
As Gottfried speaks, you notice a young man sitting on a chair next to the Champion's in the main balcony with a devastated look on his face. He's probably around your age, with blonde hair so light it could pass off as white; his eyes are green and he's dressed in a simple white shirt and matching pants. Gottfried pauses briefly, inhales deeply and continues.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #B22222">- I will not bore you with a long speech about myself, nor have I ever been inclined to do so. Know only that I no longer have the heart to battle, as my mind is turned to another pursuit. Since I cannot fully dedicate myself to defending the title of Champion anymore, I choose to step down rather than do so half-heartedly.</span><br />
<br />
The massive elder shifts his body slightly and holds his arm to the side, signaling the blonde man behind him.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #B22222">- As I withdraw from my position, I choose to appoint my apprentice, Johan of the Engel family, as the new Champion until such time when he is defeated in battle. I know he is ready and will do me justice. And it is him I have to thank for this event, which he orchestrated despite my vehement protests.</span><br />
<br />
You can tell he attempts to smile, but either due to lack of habit or his impressive beard, it's barely noticeable.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #B22222">- I tire of talking. Johan, Champion of Fizzy Bubbles, the spotlight is yours.</span><br />
<br />
The young man shifts uncomfortably in his chair before nodding, getting up and replacing Gottfried on the mic. The old man returns to his own seat and closes his eyes, as if exhausted for whatever reason. Johan clears his throat and addresses the audience.<br />
<br />
- I... thank you for the vote of confidence, sir. I will do my best to live up to your legacy. But ladies and gentlemen, this day isn't about me! Let's have one more round of applause for the Silent King, our true Champion, Gottfried!<br />
<br />
Once again the crowd erupts in cheers as Johan takes the opportunity to catch his breath. You wonder why Gottfried was so vague in his reasoning for stepping down; after all, shouldn't that be the main purpose of his speech in the first place? But you have a feeling his choice of words was deliberate and carefully weighed, and that he didn't let on any more than he intended. The people didn't seem to mind either, so perhaps it doesn't really matter, but still...<br />
<br />
- I envisioned the Grand Farewell as a tribute to our undefeated Champion, hoping to gather the best Trainers in the region and put on a memorable show. I could think of no better send-off to a man who, more than any other, made a name for himself on the field of battle. I would also like to thank the eight Gym Leaders who agreed to take part in the festivities, some of whom even helped fund this great event!<br />
<br />
The crowd now cheers for the men on the left balcony, most of whom rise to meet the applause.<br />
<br />
- This Tournament will determine the best of the best, and a fitting prize will be awarded to the winner - the privilege of raising an offspring of one of Gottfried's own Pokemon!<br />
<br />
To this announcement, the crowd explodes once more. You know nothing of the Champion's team, but there's no doubt in your mind that every single one of these 50.000 people know all about Gottfried's Pokemon. Several different chants break out, and you struggle to make out what people are saying. You seem to pick up &quot;Jotun&quot; and &quot;Sigurd&quot; cheers, but one chant is heard loud above all the others.<br />
<br />
- LEAR! LEAR! LEAR!<br />
<br />
Johan smiles and waits for everyone to calm down.<br />
<br />
- Who knows which one? If any of the challengers manage to stand tall above the eight Leaders, you will find out! The first round of battles will begin shortly. Please be patient!<br />
<br />
He turns to face his mentor, who seems to have fallen asleep in his golden chair. Johan shakes his head and smiles, as if used to it, and returns to his seat.<br />
Just then, the door you came in through opens again and the same security guard who gave you instructions earlier calls out to you and the other challengers.<br />
<br />
- It's time to head down to the arena. Please follow me.<br />
<br />
The six of you exchange brief stares before following the man out of the balcony, back through the corridor and into a separate chamber you hadn't noticed before.<br />
<br />
- This is the locker room where you will await your turn to battle. I trust you all know the Leaders you'll be facing, yes? If so, please step inside, and one of you will be called out to the arena for the first match. Best of lucks to you all gentlemen, please make our Champion proud!<br />
<br />
All six of you enter the locker room - a spacious area with several small-scale machines found commonly in Pokemon Centers, such as individual healing pods, laptops with access to e-mail (but blocked storage access as per the tournament's rules), etc - and find it lined with monitors on the walls. They're transmitting a live broadcast of the event, currently showing the arena being prepared for the first match. You all take a seat as the reporter covering the show announces on worldwide TV that the battles are about to start!<br />
<br />
You exchanged confused glances; if that's true, how come nobody told you anything yet? Just then, the monitor directly above the exit, the largest of the TV sets in the room, changes the display to photos of all six challengers. They begin to spin around until, one by one, they form a vertical line. The photo on top represents the first challenger to go out to the arena... and it's you!<br />
<br />
You jolt up immediately once you realize the situation. You're up next, about to battle in front of <i>fifty thousand people</i>! The door on the far end of the locker room opens, revealing the arena beyond. You quickly remember what the woman at the counter told you yesterday: <i>&quot;Each Pokemon is allowed to carry one Held Item, and the Trainer is allowed the use of up to 2 items from their Bag during each battle. Battles will be Singles Matches on Leader-selected Arenas, with each Trainer using 3 Pokemon; the challenger is allowed to switch, while the Gym Leader is not.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
You take a deep breath and step outside. The sun is shining and the air is warm; you try to focus, but the atmosphere of the place is absolutely overwhelming, the crowd erupting at the sight of the first challenger and the beginning of the Tournament. You finally make your way over to the battlefield, outlined in white, and stand in your designated circle. Looking around, you see a man in an elevated pod to your right wearing a black and white shirt, who you assume is the referee. And directly across you on the other end of the arena is a brown-haired man with a blue vest and a serious expression, who can only be your opponent - Gym Leader Sean!<br />
<br />
- The first match is about to start! Gym Leader Sean versus Pokemon Trainer Ethan! Please meet at the center and greet your opponent!<br />
<br />
Both of you make your way towards the middle of the arena. Sean holds out his hand in sportsmanship, but as soon your own hand meets his, the Leader pulls you in close and whispers in your ear.<br />
<br />
- Did you receive any sort of message or warning before this match?!<br />
<br />
His tone is dark and filled with urgency. You can't tell whether he's threatening you or just concerned; either way, he knows something's up. You try to remember what you read about this man in the file yesterday... is he trustworthy? Will he be an ally or an enemy?<br />
<br />
The wild crowd is growing restless with anticipation, there isn't much time to talk... What is your answer? </span></span> <br />

<span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>Aduro Island</i></span><br />
<br />
<b><u>Geyser Park</u></b><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> The course of action seemed obvious: stuck between two opponents but with ample room to maneuver to each side, you immediately order Godric to roll to the right and evade the incoming Flamethrower. The Nidoking seems to have been expecting the instruction, tenses the muscles in his legs and stares at the Magcargo with absolute concentration. Then, just as the fire slug releases the stream of flames, the Poison-Type leaps to the side and you watch as the flames barely miss Godric and instead hit the second Magcargo behind him!<br />
<br />
- YEEAAH, WAY TO GO, TAKE THAT!<br />
<br />
The nervous man seems ecstatic at the turn of events, but did he really have to be so... enthusiastic? For a reporter, he <i>really</i> doesn't seem used to any sort of actual danger...<br />
<br />
The Flamethrower engulfs the other Magcargo, who soaks up the flames as if they were nothing. However, Godric's timely evasion catches both wild slugs off-guard, and as they struggle to regroup he takes the opportunity to tighten his focus. The second they turn around to attack again, the Nidoking's eyes glow purple and both Magcargo start wincing in pain from an invisible force, staggering them even further.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, your eyes widen as Godric maintains his Psychic pressure on the foes - a stream of molten fire seems to fly all the from the river of lava nearby and hits your partner square in the back, making him fall over once more! You try to make out what happened and your heart sinks as you spot <i>two more</i> Magcargo emerging from the river and slithering toward you! One of them must have attacked with the <b>Lava Plume</b> you just saw... and what's worse, a large amount of that lava covers Godric's back, leaving him with a huge <span style="color: red"><b>Burn</b></span>!<br />
<br />
The first two opponents break free from the psychic grip and look even more pissed than before, although visibly weakened by the move. All four Magcargo surround you, Godric and the reporter, and your Nidoking is still reeling from the latest blow...<br />
<br />
- Oh boy, oh boy, this can't be good! Dude, come on, we gotta split!<br />
<br />
&quot;Split&quot; is exactly how any Trainer worth his salt would feel right now. Running away from a battle is always such a difficult decision to make...<br />
<br />
- Stop wasting time, we gotta go! I've been covering a story in this place for a while now, I know my way around! Look, I'm leaving with or without you!<br />
<br />
You believe in Godric, and you know you'd have good chances of beating any one of the Magcargo one on one; besides, you did come here in part to help your Pokemon get stronger, after all! On the other hand, this battle has just turned into a 4-on-1 assault and Godric has been Burned... It's time to make a choice!<br />
<br />
Do you hold your ground and fight off the Magcargo, or do you forfeit and follow the reporter to safety? </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">Keith gave a satisfied smirk as his quick thinking paid off- Godric was able to evade the Flamethrower perfectly, and the Fire-type move merely struck the other Magcargo. However, it quickly became clear that he wasn't the only one pleased at this turn of events, as the reporter's enthusiastic cheering. Keith spared a moment to give him an odd look, then turned his attention back to the battle, just in time to see Godric's Confusion take hold, dealing damage to both of the Magcargo.<br />
<br />
And then, to Keith's shock, a stream of lava seemed to fly right out of the river, striking Godric right in the back, causing him to roar in pain and fall over again. &quot;What the-&quot; began Keith, before he saw exactly what the; another pair of Magcargo slithering out of the river, one of them clearly having been the source of the Lava Plume attack. Keiith glanced at Godric, and was not pleased to see a huge burn on his back. Worse still, the original pair of Magcargo freed themselves from the Confusion attack's hold, and looked even more pissed than they already were. Clearly a lot weaker for the attack they had just endured, yes, but still.<br />
<br />
And now, the reporter was back to being nervous- he stated that they should split. Initially, Keith wasn't sure whether to agree with that- running from a battle wasn't exactly something a good Trainer does, and it's certainly not something Keith was willing to do ever. And yet, at the same time, he couldn't help but reflect on the many ways this battle was fixing to screw him over- Godric was outnumbered from the start, now moreso than before, the burn would do him no favors, he'd keep taking damage from that, and his Drill Run wouldn't be nearly as effective as usual anymore. Worst of all, Keith couldn't order Godric to use the one move that would surely end the battle on the spot- Surf required a nearby body of water, and somehow Keith doubted a river of lava was anywhere near close enough. And even if it was, Magcargo loved lava! It'd probably be more refreshing for them than anything else! As the annoying reporter persisted in his opinion that they should get out, Keith found himself highly skeptical of his claims that he knew the area well. However, he also knew that anyone who was stupid enough to shove a TV camera right in the faces of a pair of clearly pissed Magcargo could very likely be classified as &quot;too dumb to survive&quot;. A small thought occurred to Keith- perhaps he was only thinking that this sort of thing was such common knowledge because he grew up in Lavaridge Town, because he grew up seeing Fire-types like Slugma and Magcargo on a daily basis, maybe even because he had a Slugma of his own? He shook those thoughts out of his mind, however- no matter what the species, it's kinda easy to tell when a Pokémon is pissed at you, and any way you slice it, if you're the one shoving a TV camera in the face of said pissed Pokémon, you're doing nothing to help the situation, if you're not actively making it worse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Godric, return,&quot; Keith called. The Nidoking gave a surprised growl as he turned to look at Keith, a look of confusion on his face. &quot;You're outnumbered and burned,&quot; Keith continued. &quot;And if two more Magcargo just slithered out of that river now, what's stopping even more from coming in? We keep this up and you'll be toast, in a very literal sense of the term.&quot; Keith's words seemed to register in Godric's mind, as the look of confusion gave away. He stomped over to Keith, not too concerned about the Magcargo catching up (enraged though they were, the fact remained that Magcargo were not very fast), and Keith turned to face the reporter. &quot;Alright, let's get moving,&quot; he stated, both he and Godric ready to move as soon as this guy was.<br />
<br />
Inside, Keith was dwelling on his decision to forfeit the battle. It still didn't sit completely right with him, even if Godric was at an increasingly large and quite alarming disadvantage. He was starting to think like his Skorupi, who would rather die than forfeit a battle. At the same time, however, Keith knew that a good Trainer had to know when to throw in the towel for the sake of their Pokémon's safety. And there was no way in hell Keith was gonna legitimately put Godric's life at risk by forcing him to continue battling what could easily be a continually growing number of Magcargo. Overall, Keith felt he was making the right decision here... though he wasn't going to mention this little incident to Scorpius any time soon, that's for damn sure.</span></span></div>

It is basically a large iceberg sitting in the middle of the sea, which has provided a home to many ice types. Many have attempted to find out why the ice doesn't melt, but each of them has failed in turn. This is just one of the mysteries of this island that go unsolved. Possibly some clues lie in the depths of the iceberg?<br />

<br />
Sounds of helicopter blades chopped through the air with machine precision as Pokémon trainer Matthew Brown stuck his head from the open cargo door, carefully holding onto the guard rails for dear life. A canvas of pure white laid out as far as the eyes could see, only jutting shades of brown rock disrupted the winter wonderland. The Glacier Islands was familiar to him, the arctic zone being where he situated his first and only, for now, secret base, so the sights were nothing new. And yet this area still fascinated him. The chain of islands in the Southern Ocean were so similar to this, yet Cascadia's diverse landscape should have negated the formation of a singular iceberg, let alone one as large as this. <br />
<br />
Maatthew had yet to set foot outside of his base and subsidising acres of land in the Glacier Islands, so his choice to come all the way out to the Boreal Wastelands made him think, to question his own decisions <br />
<br />
<i>“I suppose having a base in a location makes you far less eager to explore the surroundings”</i>, he mused, breathing in a deep breath fresh mountain air. Seclusion and denial kept him in the Glacier Islands, and a need to train in the harshest conditions to overcome weaknesses of course, but the idea of what could lay out there, especially given his previous track record with Pokémon Adventures, made him nervous. Could he still situate himself in such a land should he discover evil around him?<br />
<br />
The air held the same bitter coldness; the same idea of constant danger of freezing; the same on-edge feeling one gets when they know one mistake could end it all. He was never sure if it was the chill that sent shivers down his spine, or the mere thought of death, but it always occurred in this setting. It made him sharper, however, on his toes at all times. Should a man ever experience life without knowing this feeling? It was a feeling that was almost unexplainable, and yet years living in such a frigid environment made him crave it even more. There was something to be said about a man's character if he could survive out here in the vast nothingness of bleak frostiness. <br />
<br />
“This is as far as I can go!” the pilot screamed down the Hi-Jack helmet at him as Matthew gave him a thumbs up signal. The cold had a serious impact on everything around it, even his mightest steed Aerodactyl would have troubles commandeering through the hyperborean clouds. Within moments the chopper's feet had landed on the surface, its weight pushing down the picturesque carpet of ivory; a deadly reminder of how treacherous the journey would be. <br />
<br />
“Thanks for the lift Ed. I'll give you a call when I need to be picked up. Don't worry about me, I've covered wars you know” Mattthew unclasped the helmet and tied it back onto the shuttle as he liaisoned with the captain a final time, finally running away from the helicopter's blast radius as it took to the skies once more. A cheeky goodbye, a minute of chaos then nothing. He was alone. <br />
<br />
… Well, not totally alone. He looked down at the miriad of brightly coloured Pokéballs on his belt, each capsule containing a companion ready to adventure into the wilds of the world with him, each searching for individuality in a world of pocket monsters. Once again he had decided to bring a crew of new and old faces, a brand of experience mixed with total novice gave him the truly remarkable blend of team-mates, one that could only bond together in the fires of travel. <br />
<br />
Grabbing two, Matthew released a couple of Pokémon; Deckard, the Porygon and Psyduck. In a flash they emerged, each unique personality coming to the forefront right away, Deckard silently hovering in mid-air, scanning its surroundings with a never-ending curiosity and Psyduck, immediately falling over. Matthew chuckled to himself, how had he managed to end up with such a team? Years ago, trapped by Team Rocket in Viridian City he would never have imagined such an occasion; to be surrounded by Pokémon, venturing out in the wide world.<br />
<br />
The Hiel Research Base, somewhere in the midst of this total pale expanse, was his intended destination. A similar place of science was considered one of his most valued experiences, the Research Lab in Talas' Sobek City was eventful, and had left a great impression on the young trainer many moons ago. Though he left with the building burnt to the ground, he had managed to stop a tyrant from re-appearing and a small Skull Fossil in his possession. It was that moment where he truly connected with the Pokémon of the past; seeing every fully evolved form in all their glory sparked an interest he had harbored since a small child.<br />
<br />
Now bearing down and intent on finding the Icelandic research lab in Cascedia, though with a more hopeful wish of adventure with a better non-burnt-down-building resolution, Matthew set off into the icy domain, knowing whatever lay ahead was certainly going to be an experience...</span></span></div>

<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> Survival instinct rings louder than pride in this instance, and you reluctantly recall the wounded Godric back into his Ball. You'll never know whether you'd have been able to defeat the four Magcargo, but you decide to prioritize safety over victory. Scorpius must never know.<br />
<br />
- Thank God you have a head on your shoulders! Come on, let's split!!<br />
<br />
The reporter waits briefly for you to get ready and runs as fast as he can away from the angry mob of fire snails. You manage to keep up with him with some effort; his speed suggests he's probably used to running for his life. You're hardly surprised.<br />
<br />
For all his lack of guts, the man does seem to know where he's headed. Without a second of hesitation, he guides you along the margin of the lava river, then through narrow rocky pathways away from the stream and deeper into the mountain, along ledges and crevices to a point where you can't tell where you are anymore. Is it really necessary to run this fast and for this long just to get away from a pack of Magcargo?...<br />
<br />
Sweat is running down your face and your clothes are drenched. Even having grown accustomed to the climate from your days in Lavaridge, exerting this kind of physical effort under these conditions is still strenuous, and you've been away from volcanoes for a while anyway. Whereas Pokemon like Heatstroke were born to live in this kind of places, humans really weren't. And yet the guy in front of you keeps going like an athlete on a sparring session... just what kind of conditioning does he have?! <br />
<br />
Suddenly, the reporter stops and turns around, causing you to almost bump into him. He has a very serious expression on his face as he clears his throat.<br />
<br />
- 'Kay, I think this is far enough, I think we lost 'em. Look dude, you were really ballsy back there, thanks for sticking your neck out for me. So yeah, since you did that and all, I gotta come clean about something...<br />
<br />
You feel the hairs on the back your neck stand on edge. From all your years of travelling, you've grown used to expecting the worst when someone introduces a new topic like this.<br />
<br />
- ... Truth is, I'm a bit of a coward. Yeah, I know - beneath the impeccable posture of a professional journalist, the drive to brave the most inhospitable places in the world and the decidedly above-average looks, I know it's hard to imagine! But it's the sad truth.<br />
<br />
You fight your hardest not burst out laughing in this guy's face, but you can't tell for sure if your eyebrow didn't rise instinctively.<br />
<br />
- Thing is, I'm not really a pro either. I'm a self-made journalist and radio host of my own show, Eyeland Network. My name's Kyle Styles, what's yours again? Didn't get it the first time when we were fighting those Magcargo.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;We&quot;?...</i><br />
<br />
- Anyway, the Network is still only a radio show but I've been gathering footage of Fizzy Bubble's most incredible spots so I can get a TV deal soon, just when I manage to find a sponsor. I've been all over the place, from the Glacier Islands to Cortoza's ruins! This seemed like the next logical step, but things aren't going so great. There's something really odd going on here... Like those Magcargo? Yeah, they were super-violent. No idea what set them off like that, but man, they were vicious!<br />
<br />
You can almost feel your eyes rolling all the way to the back of your head.<br />
<br />
- I've been fortunate so far, I guess. I've gotten close-up shots of a ton of Pokemon in my travels, and I'd never once gotten into an altercation. Turns out, when things go awry, I'm not that much of a fighter, am I? But you had my back, and I owe you one. So tell you what: what I do here is really demanding stuff, highly professional work. Gotta be, if I wanna get that sponsorship... but there's more to this place than meets the eye. Something's upsetting the balance of this place, I'm sure of it.<br />
<br />
You vaguely recall someone with a huge video camera upsetting the balance of the place, indeed... But Kyle seems to be talking seriously.<br />
<br />
- You've pretty much saved my life, and I'm not about to drag you into this - it's my scoop anyway, and I'm sure you have better stuff to do. As a reward of sorts, I'll share some info with you that the rest of the world may never know, lest they disrupt the delicate equilibrium of this habitat! When I was exploring this side of the mountain earlier, I found a handful of caves a bit more to the south with walls lined with precious minerals. I'm a sworn environmentalist so I'd never dare to strip the mountain of its resources, but if you wanna make a buck I guess I can turn a blind eye, as a way of saying &quot;thank you&quot; for earlier...<br />
<br />
He winks and smiles at you. Kyle may not have much in the way of brains, but he seems like a genuinely nice guy.<br />
<br />
- My own path of investigative journalism leads north, to the largest central caves of Mt Aduro... There's a group of Pokemon up there that desperately need my help and I can't let them down. Well, I have a case to crack so I'll be seeing you! Thanks again, and don't forget to tune in to Eyeland Network!<br />
<br />
Kyle turns around and begins making his way up, having lost his hi-tech camera but not his determination. You wonder what'll happen to a goofball like him in this kind of environment, but he's a man on a mission and seemingly nothing will sway him from his path... What about you?<br />
Kyle went north in his quest, and pointed you to some caves to the south filled with valuable stones as a reward for your timely intervention before.<br />
<br />
Where do you go from here? </span></span> <br />

<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Treepandaone</u>:</b> <i>((Welcome aboard Treep! I hope you like the adventure I have planned and that nobody put you through a similar plot yet! You've been around for a while so that's always a possibility...))</i><br />
<br />
Deckard and Psyduck stand at your side as you brave the frozen wasteland; while it's a familiar environment for you, that's not the case for either of your partners, and while the Porygon seems largely unaffected by the temperature, it's clear the Psyduck is somewhat uncomfortable - being a Water-Type helps withstand the harsh climate, but this is a rough habitat for almost any creature.<br />
<br />
Glacier Island is often described as a natural wonder. That such a microclimate exists in the Archipelago is a miracle in of itself, made all the more spectacular by the trademark rainbow sky brought about by the aurora borealis that has made the place famous. Inhospitable as the island may be, it's still widely regarded as a sight to behold.<br />
<br />
However, something feels off.<br />
<br />
For all the cold and hardships of the Boreal Wasteland, it feels even more barren than you'd have expected. Certainly well-conditioned Pokemon would be able to thrive here, namely several Ice-Types, especially in a place mostly untouched by humans... However, you've been walking for a while and not a single living creature has crossed your path thus far. Not only that - despite all the stories and photos of wonderful displays of color in the night sky you've been shown, everything from the horizon above is an unsettling <i>black</i>. Maybe it's a cyclic phenomenon, but you'd expect the sky to be much prettier than this on any given moment. All in all, the atmosphere of this place is decidedly strange...<br />
<br />
However, you count yourself half-fortunate. Another thing this wasteland is famous for are the deadly snowstorms that kick up every now and then. Right now, there isn't so much as a gentle breeze; it's almost as if the air is <i>stagnant</i>, come to think of it. You wonder how Deckard and Psyduck would handle a full-blown ice storm and count yourself lucky you aren't forced to find out. But if the weather is unnaturally forgiving at the moment, then why wouldn't the helicopter take you any closer to the research base? &quot;This is as far as I can go&quot;, said Ed earlier. Why? Was it really just because of the low temperatures?...<br />
<br />
Lost in thought, you lose track of time. You can't tell how far you've walked or if you're even going in the right direction; such a well-known research facility - and the only known human settlement in the entire island - really should be better marked... You decide to stop and take another look around. maybe you can spot something in the distance...<br />
<br />
You do.<br />
<br />
However, it's definitely not a building... you squint to make out what the large round shape several feet to your right could be. And there's no doubt about it... it's a large creature! Fallen on its side, with its back turned to you, the animal apparently isn't moving. You realize the beast is in fact a Beartic - what else could it be, with such a massive frame and characteristic light-blue fur? - but you can't tell if it's sleeping, hurt... or dead. You feel conflicted as to whether you should approach the wild Ice-Type. But as you keep looking, you catch a glimpse of something smaller hovering around the bear... As carefully and silently as you can, you draw in closer just enough so you can understand what the other shape is. And after a deathly chill runs down your spine, not of cold but something else, your eyes show you what your mind already knew - it's a ghost.<br />
<br />
The Frosslass floats above and around Beartic, with movements elegant and delicate as if it were dancing. All the while, the bear remains unmoving, and the whole scene spurs feelings of both curiosity and apprehension within you. These are the first creatures you've spotted in the entire wasteland, and their behavior is definitely odd... What's going on here?<br />
<br />
You don't know how these wild Pokemon will react to your presence once you're spotted; they could very well be hostile, and both of them are evolved forms. Besides, you've been wandering this place for a very long time, and your partners are likely getting tired - the sooner you make it to the base, the better. On the other hand, the image of a Frosslass dancing around a still Beartic is something you don't see every day, and maybe you could help the bear in case it's hurt...<br />
<br />
What choice do you make? </span></span> <br />

<i>&quot;We&quot;?...</i><br />

Turns out, when things go awry, I'm not that much of a fighter, am I? But you had my back, and I owe you one. So tell you what: what I do here is really demanding stuff, highly professional work. Gotta be, if I wanna get that sponsorship... but there's more to this place than meets the eye. Something's upsetting the balance of this place, I'm sure of it.<br />
<br />
You vaguely recall someone with a huge video camera upsetting the balance of the place, indeed... But Kyle seems to be talking seriously.<br />
<br />
- You've pretty much saved my life, and I'm not about to drag you into this - it's my scoop anyway, and I'm sure you have better stuff to do. As a reward of sorts, I'll share some info with you that the rest of the world may never know, lest they disrupt the delicate equilibrium of this habitat! When I was exploring this side of the mountain earlier, I found a handful of caves a bit more to the south with walls lined with precious minerals. I'm a sworn environmentalist so I'd never dare to strip the mountain of its resources, but if you wanna make a buck I guess I can turn a blind eye, as a way of saying &quot;thank you&quot; for earlier...<br />
<br />
He winks and smiles at you. Kyle may not have much in the way of brains, but he seems like a genuinely nice guy.<br />
<br />
- My own path of investigative journalism leads north, to the largest central caves of Mt Aduro... There's a group of Pokemon up there that desperately need my help and I can't let them down. Well, I have a case to crack so I'll be seeing you! Thanks again, and don't forget to tune in to Eyeland Network!<br />
<br />
Kyle turns around and begins making his way up, having lost his hi-tech camera but not his determination. You wonder what'll happen to a goofball like him in this kind of environment, but he's a man on a mission and seemingly nothing will sway him from his path... What about you?<br />
Kyle went north in his quest, and pointed you to some caves to the south filled with valuable stones as a reward for your timely intervention before.<br />
<br />
Where do you go from here? </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">As soon as Keith was ready, he and the reporter raced off (although Godric had walked over to Keith, intending to run alongside him, Keith returned the Nidoking to his Poké Ball in any case- he didn't want Godric overexerting himself with that burn). As they ran, Keith noticed how fast the other guy was moving. Judging by what he had seen so far, Keith wouldn't have been surprised if this was from years of experience of running for his life.<br />
<br />
The reporter, surprisingly, led Keith expertly down narrow paths, along ledges, deeper and deeper into the mountain. Clueless though he came across as in Keith's first impression of him, he actually seemed to know where he was going. That said, Keith was, in his mind, questioning the wisdom of going to such lengths to escape Magcargo. Surely they had a three-day lead on them already, at the very least? Besides, he was beginning to sweat. Sure, he grew up in Lavaridge Town, which made it that much easier for him to acclimate to hot environments, but with all this potentially unnecessary physical exertion being added on top of that, he wasn't very surprised at how much he was sweating right now. What did surprise him, however, was how well the other guy seemed to be doing- he didn't seem tired in the slightest!<br />
<br />
And then, suddenly, he stopped and turned around. Had Keith not been able to stop as quickly as he did, he surely would've bumped into the guy. The reporter sighed in relief, stating that he thought they lost them. &quot;Pretty sure we lost them a lot earlier than that,&quot; Keith muttered, but the reporter didn't seem to hear. He thanked Keith for helping him out back there, and then confessed that he was in fact a bit of a coward. Not exactly the earth-shattering revelation of the century, Keith thought to himself. Then, the guy went on about how it must be hard to believe, given the &quot;impeccable posture of a professional journalist, the drive to brave the most inhospitable places in the world, and the decidedly above-average looks&quot;. Hard to believe? Keith was finding it a lot harder to not explode with laughter right now! He may have instinctively raised an eyebrow to convey his extreme skepticism, though he wasn't sure whether he actually did or not- again, all his focus was either on listening to the guy or trying to not laugh.<br />
<br />
The reporter continued on, also admitting to not be a professional reporter, another confession that didn't surprise Keith in the least. The man explained that he hosted his own radio show, and introduced himself as Kyle Styles, and then asked for Keith's, but also remarked that he didn't get it the first time when they were fighting the Magcargo. Now Keith really did raise an eyebrow. When we fought the Magcargo? And what exactly did Kyle do again, aside from cheering when Godric dodged that Flamethrower? Oh, and antagonizing the Magcargo to begin with?<br />
<br />
Resisting the urge to bring any of that up, Keith instead replied, &quot;Keith. Keith Masters.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle went on to explain that even though his network was only a radio show at the moment, he was going around, getting footage of Fizzytopia's most incredible spots, and that the Cascadia Archipelago seemed the next logical step. Then he voiced the opinion that something strange was happening, citing the pissed-off Magcargo as an example. Keith resisted the urge to roll his eyes, given that it was clear to anyone with functioning brain cells what had set them off. However, Kyle then stated that he was certain that something was upsetting the balance of Arduro Island. Even though he was the one upsetting the balance for those Magcargo earlier, Keith felt somewhat inclined to listen anyway- he seemed to be speaking quite seriously, and there was every chance that he had heard of this upset of balance prior to having antagonized those Magcargo. The subject then turned to Keith having saved his life, and as his way of thanking him, Kyle revealed that south of their location, there were small caverns with walls lined with precious minerals. Though Kyle was a sworn environmentalist and thus not about to strip the mountain of such resources, he stated that he could turn a blind eye if Keith wanted to take advantage of this knowledge. Keith smiled at this- Kyle was almost certainly a few Exeggcute shy of a cluster, but his heart at least seemed to be in the right place. &quot;Thanks,&quot; Keith replied. Kyle continued on, saying that he was headed north, to come to the aid of a group of Pokémon, and then bid Keith farewell before heading off.<br />
<br />
For a moment, Keith considered following Kyle- there was always, and I do mean always, the possibility of him getting himself into some deep shit again, after all. Then again, Keith had seen firsthand just how good he was at running for his life, so he did at least have that going for him. And if he had made it this far in his exploration of the most incredible spots in the Fizzytopia region without dying, he had to be doing something right. He therefore decided against going along with Kyle, deciding to trust that he'd be able to complete his investigation without getting himself killed. Why, yes, Keith is a very optimistic person by nature, why do you ask? Instead, Keith headed off towards the southern caverns. A greedy person he was not, but still, the thought of those valuable minerals was... well, it was pretty tempting, to say the least. And even if he didn't find anything he himself was after, it was always possible he'd come across something one of his friends was after- perfect opportunity to help them out right there.<br />
<br />
At that moment, a Poké Ball on Keith's belt burst open. For a moment, Keith thought Godric was coming back out and was going to insist on staying out, but the flash of light flew onto Keith's shoulder before materializing into a decidedly feline form. &quot;Alright, wat's da deal?!&quot; Meowth exclaimed. &quot;Dat ferry ride has got ta be ova by now- eh? Where da hell are we?&quot; Meowth asked suddenly, upon noticing his volcanic surroundings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, man, I'm sorry, Meowth,&quot; Keith said sheepishly. &quot;Forgot to let you out of your ball- I got a very good reason, in my defense, but before I explain, just how is it you get seasick on that ferry, but when we sail on the <i>Banette's Revenge</i>, you're perfectly fine?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, gimme a break, da sea was rougher den usual,&quot; snapped Meowth.<br />
<br />
&quot;It <i>was</i> kinda rough,&quot; Keith conceded. &quot;Still, I can't believe it was so bad you actually wanted to go in your Poké Ball- you hate it in there!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; said Meowth. &quot;So, why didn't ya let me out as soon as ya got off da ferry? And where's Godric?&quot; he added, looking around.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK,&quot; sighed Keith. &quot;Long story short, Godric and I came across this journalist who was really annoying a pair of Magcargo, they started attacking, so I had Godric attack them, fend them off. Except they wound up burning Godric, and then two more Magcargo joined them, so I withdrew Godric and the journalist and I ran for our lives. The guy thanked me by telling me where I could find some rare minerals, and I'm going there now to check things out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, I guess dat'd explain it,&quot; admitted Meowth. &quot;Yer forgiven.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to hear it,&quot; nodded Keith as he started walking towards the supposedly rare mineral-packed caves, Meowth seated on his shoulder.</span></span></div>

<span style="color: lightblue"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>Glacier Island</i></span><br />
<br />
<b><u>Boreal Wastelands</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Treepandaone</u>:</b> <i>((Welcome aboard Treep! I hope you like the adventure I have planned and that nobody put you through a similar plot yet! You've been around for a while so that's always a possibility...))</i><br />
<br />
Deckard and Psyduck stand at your side as you brave the frozen wasteland; while it's a familiar environment for you, that's not the case for either of your partners, and while the Porygon seems largely unaffected by the temperature, it's clear the Psyduck is somewhat uncomfortable - being a Water-Type helps withstand the harsh climate, but this is a rough habitat for almost any creature.<br />
<br />
Glacier Island is often described as a natural wonder. That such a microclimate exists in the Archipelago is a miracle in of itself, made all the more spectacular by the trademark rainbow sky brought about by the aurora borealis that has made the place famous. Inhospitable as the island may be, it's still widely regarded as a sight to behold.<br />
<br />
However, something feels off.<br />
<br />
For all the cold and hardships of the Boreal Wasteland, it feels even more barren than you'd have expected. Certainly well-conditioned Pokemon would be able to thrive here, namely several Ice-Types, especially in a place mostly untouched by humans... However, you've been walking for a while and not a single living creature has crossed your path thus far. Not only that - despite all the stories and photos of wonderful displays of color in the night sky you've been shown, everything from the horizon above is an unsettling <i>black</i>. Maybe it's a cyclic phenomenon, but you'd expect the sky to be much prettier than this on any given moment. All in all, the atmosphere of this place is decidedly strange...<br />
<br />
However, you count yourself half-fortunate. Another thing this wasteland is famous for are the deadly snowstorms that kick up every now and then. Right now, there isn't so much as a gentle breeze; it's almost as if the air is <i>stagnant</i>, come to think of it. You wonder how Deckard and Psyduck would handle a full-blown ice storm and count yourself lucky you aren't forced to find out. But if the weather is unnaturally forgiving at the moment, then why wouldn't the helicopter take you any closer to the research base? &quot;This is as far as I can go&quot;, said Ed earlier. Why? Was it really just because of the low temperatures?...<br />
<br />
Lost in thought, you lose track of time. You can't tell how far you've walked or if you're even going in the right direction; such a well-known research facility - and the only known human settlement in the entire island - really should be better marked... You decide to stop and take another look around. maybe you can spot something in the distance...<br />
<br />
You do.<br />
<br />
However, it's definitely not a building... you squint to make out what the large round shape several feet to your right could be. And there's no doubt about it... it's a large creature! Fallen on its side, with its back turned to you, the animal apparently isn't moving. You realize the beast is in fact a Beartic - what else could it be, with such a massive frame and characteristic light-blue fur? - but you can't tell if it's sleeping, hurt... or dead. You feel conflicted as to whether you should approach the wild Ice-Type. But as you keep looking, you catch a glimpse of something smaller hovering around the bear... As carefully and silently as you can, you draw in closer just enough so you can understand what the other shape is. And after a deathly chill runs down your spine, not of cold but something else, your eyes show you what your mind already knew - it's a ghost.<br />
<br />
The Frosslass floats above and around Beartic, with movements elegant and delicate as if it were dancing. All the while, the bear remains unmoving, and the whole scene spurs feelings of both curiosity and apprehension within you. These are the first creatures you've spotted in the entire wasteland, and their behavior is definitely odd... What's going on here?<br />
<br />
You don't know how these wild Pokemon will react to your presence once you're spotted; they could very well be hostile, and both of them are evolved forms. Besides, you've been wandering this place for a very long time, and your partners are likely getting tired - the sooner you make it to the base, the better. On the other hand, the image of a Frosslass dancing around a still Beartic is something you don't see every day, and maybe you could help the bear in case it's hurt...<br />
<br />
What choice do you make? </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">Thanks for having me captain, I'm really looking forward to adventuring here. Don't worry about story-lines, I may have been here a long time but I still only have 3 adventures completed, and 1 of them was a failed one. I'm just happy to RP again :x<br />
<br />
<span style="color: deepskyblue"><i>What was I thinking?</i><br />
<br />
Matthew deliberated with himself as he tightened his grip on his clothing. From the relative warmth of a helicopter, protected by metal and air conditioning he had become too confident once more, a trait burdening his adventures like an overbearing presence. Now outside in the wide expanse of frost, even his warmest clothing couldn't protect him from the incredible chill of Cascedia's mysterious archipelago. Whipping winds crept through even the smallest of gaps, a light breeze compared to the infamous snow-storms of the region, yet still cold enough to make the Pokémon trainer shiver with each passing. <br />
<br />
One of his Pokémon was suffering too. Despite the water-typing certainly contributing to the bright side of life, Psyduck was feeling the effects too, the clumsy female he had acquired from his close friend Jessica finding life in the snow extremely tough, the outer limits of his base being within close proximity to a source of warmth something the trainer hadn't considered at all. The feeling of excitement in such an environment made him feel uneasy when he was just miles away from his nice, warm, heated base, and out here in the wasteland, there was no guarantee of that safety net out here. Life and death was in the hands of nature. One snow-storm and no sign of shelter could mean a slow agonizing demise.<br />
<br />
Matthew pulled himself from being lost in his thoughts, looking over at Deckard. In comparison, it had little problem with the weather, the man-made Pokémon suspected to have no recipitators for cold, warmth or any outside forces. It hadn't been forged by nature, evolved from bacteria over millennia to need to feel sunlight, forced to adapt and survive. It reminded him that he was nothing more than talking monkeys on an organic spaceship flying through the universe. They had evolved, however, and Deckard was certainly an example of that; a living life-form made of pure programming code. It was one of a few Pokémon that had been man-made, and with many speculations that others like Ditto, Genesect and Mewtwo were attempted Team Rocket clones of Mew, and a reminder to all of humanity's power of meddling. Still, though he hated Team Rocket with all his might, he was thankful that Porygon was on his team; the small polyhedron brought out a worldly curiosity. <br />
<br />
As it happened, that curiosity made Matthew follow the normal-typed gaze up at the sky, the majesty of the rainbow sky made trekking through the thick snow that little bit easier; his attention and wonderment filled with the idea of possibility. Here he was, lost in a field of white as far as the eye could see, on a massive glacier in a massive region of a massive nation of a massive world. And yet … everything was tiny in comparison to the universe; hundreds of millions of stars lay out in the distance, an infinite amount. The cosmos always staggered the young adult, and frequent theories of space Pokémon like Clefairy, Doexys and perhaps argued Elgyem, Solrock and Lunatone among others, combined with the advent of the Mossdeep Space Center over in Hoenn gave precedent for more potential outside of this world.<br />
<br />
The sights, however beautiful, still couldn't shake the feeling of something being off. Matthew's “sixth sense” was never something he relied on, often being wrong and very rarely feeling off in the most dangerous of circumstances, but this feeling continued to grow. A sort welling in the pit of his stomach. Anxiety. Butterflies. If there was something off, it was palpable to even him, and the danger therefore was greater than anything he could have imagined. The feeling of nervousness often came and went, but this was something different. He worked through the usual possibilities, liberal guilt over man-made Pokémon, feelings of how insignificance compared in the universe, worry for his Pokémon out here in the cold. Nothing stuck.<br />
<br />
Eventually it came to him. Darting his eyes and spinning 360°, Matthew finally found the source of his apprehension; the extent of the vast nothingness. It had been there all along, every thought and conversation had come back to the point but he had never actually thought about it. His subconscious was telling him all along, he had been travelling for what seemed like hours without a single sign of life. Here, in one of the few places untouched by the corrupting fingerprint of man there should be a teeming of Ice-Types making use of the tundra's natural habitat and eco-system. He had been told stories of this place, each as different as the last, but they all had encounters with some sort of Pokémon. <br />
<br />
There was something else too … Matthew harked back to his thought of the cosmos, taking another glance up at the sky to realize there was no sign of stars. Even the aurora Borealis shouldn't have stopped the light from seeping through like little dots, and there wasn't enough civilisation for there to be any sort of light pollution. And why couldn't Ed take him any further if the weather was acting calm? These was all questions he couldn't answer, theories he could only extrapolate on. It was better to not know than to make up an answer, he could be thankful the weather wasn't as ferocious as it could be. All his thoughts had him lose track of time in an instant. It was something the trainer was used to by now, becoming so over his head with knowledge that he became absent, drifting in an out of thought and reality until something brought him back. This time, his Pokémon conditions was the catalyst. For Porygon and Psyduck, this was their first adventure away from the base, and the toll both mentally and psychically was having an effect. They both looked tired, and Matthew didn't even know if he was heading in the right direction. For all he knew he could've spent the last few hours walking away from the Hiel Research Base. <br />
<br />
A small black shape in the distance gave the Pokémon trainer hope, however, as he squinted through the falling snow to identify the mysterious object. His heart sank when he saw it was too small to be a base of operations and stayed down when he saw a Pokémon fallen to one side. Creeping closer and closer to avoid being spotted, Matthew pulled out his Pokédex from his pocket and scanned it.<br />
<br />
<i>“Beartic, the Freezing Pokémon. Beartic's frozen breath can create fangs and claws made of ice. It lives in frigid northern areas”</i> the machine rang out<br />
<br />
<i>“Woah”</i> Matthew thought to himself, the towering lump of fur indicated the Pokémon to be a large size, and terrific feats of strength and carnivorous features had him back up a few steps, shielding his Pokémon to do the same. It was the first of its kind that Matthew had seen, but its lack of movement lead the trainer to believe it was injured or possibly dead. The unsurity of the situation had him conflicted, his need to help Pokémon that was injured and needed treatment pulled him to one side, but the relative weakness of his Pokémon pulled him the other, worried that if things went sour they wouldn't have the ability to overcome, and there was no way of outrunning a local Ice Pokémon in this snow. <br />
<br />
A snippet made Matthew look again, then again. He was immediately taken aback to see a Frosslass moving elegantly by its side, floating around like it was dancing. He had seen fights of predatory nature in the Safari region of Lyanazia where he witnessed a pair Pinsir fight for alpha status with bloody consequences, but this didn't seem like that, unless the Frosslass was channeling its inner Muhammad Ali, of course. <br />
<br />
He fought with himself for some time, weighing up possibilities and consequence. His tired low-leveled Pokémon made his decision even harder, they would surely be slaughtered in a 2v2 fight, but the image of Beartic laying in the snow injured and him walking on by was something he couldn't abide by. Like before, his usual brasness would have lead him to interrupt the scene immediate, but his recent <a href="http://www.serebiiforums.com/showthread.php?556185-Whale-Island-The-Hydro-Electric-Zone&amp;p=17056010#post17056010" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.serebiiforums.com%2Fshowthread.php%3F556185-Whale-Island-The-Hydro-Electric-Zone%26p%3D17056010%23post17056010&amp;hash=efe14462846b641a53fc1f28b640af1b" rel="nofollow noopener">failure</a> in Whale Island where he had been captured by the enemy because of his ego had left his masculinity rather bruised, and increase his willingness to fully flesh out the chances of success.<br />
<br />
Still, his good Samaritan side had always out-gunned any other. Ever since his arrival in the Fizzy Bubbles land years ago he couldn't help it, the feelings having started on his first adventure where a Shinx who had been following orders had been sentenced to die by an evil ruled. Even before that when his village was being oppressed by Team Rocket, he had sought to do right where they had not, the situation leading to his first companion, freeing Rhyhorn and setting in motion his adventures from then-on.<br />
<br />
Finally deciding, Matthew ushered his Pokémon to stay behind him but in sight. He didn't want either Pokémon to be startled by how many of them there were, that should be transparent, but he also didn't want them to be in the firing line should things go wrong.<br />
<br />
“Whatever happens <b>don't</b> attack. Whatever happens” Matthew whispered, leaning down to both Pokémon with the utmost importance in his voice. His plan, however incredibly flawed, was to announce his presence early. Standing upright, Matthew began slowly making his way towards the pair of Ice-types, leaving both hands outstretched in a non-dominant position, opening his body to show a non-aggressive stance. <br />
<br />
“Uh hello” he semi-shouted in a calm manor “My name is Matthew Brown. Is Beartic alright? I have some medicine in my backpack. I can heal your friend. Potions. Revives. Food” <br />
<br />
If there was anything to say about Matthew Brown, it was that he was consistently foolish … </span></span></div>

<b><u>The SS Leviathan Shipwreck</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u><u>CyberBlastoise</u>:</u></b> You realize that, unfortunately, treasure will have to wait. Healing Swift back to health is your top priority, although the basic care you already provided helped ease its pain, and the Pokeball’s interior is also designed to stabilize Pokemon in critical condition long enough for the Trainer to seek a dedicated Center; you hope the device’s technology can keep your precious Lumineon safe until you find help.<br />
<br />
Your surrounding are grim, dark and uninviting; the innards of the long-sunken ship, unexplored for Arceus-knows how long, are cold and humid, and the air is stagnant making it hard to breathe. Moss hangs from the broken planks, and not a single sound can be heard other than your lonely steps and the droplets of water than drip from the walls. You reason that your best bet is moving deeper within the ship and look for a way out on the other side, <i>behind</i> the Wingull that already gave you so much trouble. You can’t shake off the feeling that their attack was much too severe, much too coordinated for a regular flock of wild seagulls. What could have turned them so violent?...<br />
<br />
The journey into the bowels of the ship is lonely and done slowly; your common sense tells you that, despite the gravity of the situation, rushing blindly across the fragile wooden floor would be suicidal; who knows where the planks may be cracked, even broken, or what dangers lurk ahead? The ship itself feels much like a maze; a central walkway unfolds for what seems like miles ahead, although you can barely see five steps in front of you – the lack of proper lighting only helps to make the whole place feel spookier. And speaking of spooky, why did it get so cold all of a sudden?...<br />
<br />
Indeed, a chill runs down your spine as the temperature seems to drop even further for no apparent reason. It’s not that the air itself has gotten colder, but something about your surroundings feels… dead...<br />
<br />
<i>Leeeaaaave….</i><br />
<br />
The ominous voice filled with ill intent resonates in your mind, although your ears hear nothing. Your heart starts to race and a sense of urgency overtakes you; why do you feel the need to run for your life all of a sudden?!<br />
<br />
<i>Begooooooneeeeee…</i><br />
<br />
Again the terrifying, silent voice… It rings louder this time, without a sound, but its message is crystal clear. Suddenly, you spot two tiny red dots directly in front of you; when they begin to approach, your eyes slowly start to make out the form that stands in your way, and your heart sinks in your chest – it beat faster than usual before, but now it seems to have stopped. Reaching its ethereal arms out for you, promising a deathly embrace, a massive blue Jellicent blocks your path!<br />
<br />
You hastily look around, weighing your limited options. It’s hard to tell in the darkness, but there seems to be a wooden door on each side of the corridor – one to your left and one to your right. However, there’s no telling if either of them will budge, and even if either does, what might be lurking behind? If you try to flee but fail to enter a room, the Jellicent will easily catch up to you! On the other hand, you could always try to force your way through by battle, but how strong is the foe? It has already proven to be able to invade your mind and speak to you, a testament of considerable power in of itself…<br />
<br />
Quick, what do you do?!</span></span>

As much as Bill would have loved to just rush straight through the ship and get to safety, he knew that doing so would just end up with him is just as bad shape as Swift. He knew that he would have to go across this ship with extreme caution, especially since it hadn't been cared for in years. Rotten planks scattered the floor, who knows which ones were steady and which ones were ready to break? He decided to stick with the walls, as those are where the planks would be the sturdiest. Slowly and carefully walking across the room that he was in, however, he couldn't help but feel just how downright creepy this place is, and Bill was normally the type of person that finds ruins and the like interesting. Still, he had to press onward down the long narrow pathway for a bit, but he stopped dead in his tracks when he realized just how cold the room had gotten. Was there a storm approaching? That was the last thing he needed in an unstable ship.<br />
<br />
Leeeaaaave….<br />
<br />
What the? Bill heard someone else's voice, but he couldn't pinpoint where. It was almost as though it was in his head. His heart started racing as his eyes bounced around the room trying to find wherever the voice came from. The ship itself was way to dark for him to see anything of the sort. &quot;H-Hello?&quot; he said. Come on, Bill it was probably nothing. Besides this place has been deserted for a long time and there's no way someone else was in here as heavily guarded as this place was beforehand. <br />
<br />
Begooooooneeeeee…<br />
<br />
A much louder and more clear voice sounded. What the hell was going on? Bill looked around some more until he saw something directly in front of him. Two blood-shot circles floating in front of him. Bill froze in his tracks for a moment. &quot;Who...who are you?&quot; Why was he feeling this terror? Soon the circles starting getting larger and closer to the trainer until several blue tentacles appeared in front of him. This...creature was a Pokemon. In particular another water-typed Pokemon named Jellicent. There was no way through it it seemed, plus it seemed quick enough to just grab him if he tried to run straight through it. Bill quickly examined the room around him, there were two doors on opposite sides, one on the right and one on the left. Bill's only two pokemon with him are his Lumineon and his Carvanha, and even if Swift wasn't injured, they were both sea-faring Pokemon, a battle on land would not do. He couldn't turn around either, that would defeat the purpose of this, not to mention that if he did who knows how many times he'd have to backtrack. Bill decided to take a chance on one of the doors, calculating that the right of the ship is where he came in from, then maybe he could find an exit on his left. &quot;Look, I'm trying to leave. I just need to pass through here...&quot; Knowing full well from his previous experiences that the supernatural do not like people even going through their area, Bill jolted to the door on his left. &quot;Please be the right one...&quot; He hoped that the door had at least rotted enough for him to go through it with ease.<br />

<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> You figure Kyle, clumsy and coward as he is, has to be doing <i>something</i> right if he's managed to stay alive up until this point, especially if he has indeed been to all the places he claims. The prospect of gem-filled caverns sounds much more alluring than following this guy and potentially getting yourself into trouble again. You thank Kyle for the not-so-subtle pointer and decide to head south towards the precious caves.<br />
<br />
With Meowth firmly perched on your shoulder - a welcome company, given he's someone you can talk to -, you turn around and start walking the way Kyle indicated. Truth be told, that's the only thing you have to go on; there are no signs, no roads, just warm and sharp rocks all around. You carefully walk the downwards slope of the mountain, minding your every step in fear you may trip on a loose boulder. The river of lava is now far behind you, but you can still hear the rumbling of the liquid fire cascading somewhere in the distance. You also notice the occasional tremor, some of which threaten to make you lose your balance, signaling that this volcano is indeed active - precariously stable, but very much alive. <br />
<br />
The temperature seems to lower somewhat. The air is still hot enough for it to be hard to breathe, but your lungs no longer burns when you exert yourself. You figure the magma stream was responsible for the unbearable heat, and are more than happy to have left it and its inhabitants behind.<br />
After a while of aimlessly wandering down the mountain, and several twisted ankles later, Meowth excitedly points to your left. As you follow his pointer, you realize the cause for all the commotion – there’s a large hole on the rock some feet away from where you’re standing, more than wide enough for someone to go through! It’s a cave no doubt… but is this one of the precious mines Kyle spoke of, or did you get lost along the way? Your heart rate quickens as you approach the opening, hopeful and fearful at the same time. What if there are more violent Pokemon inside?...<br />
<br />
You step inside, cautiously at first, then a little more confident when no pillars of fire or any other hazards invite you out. In reality, nothing happens – nothing at all. The cave is so quiet, it’s hard to believe you’re inside a volcano. The sudden drop in temperature is also welcome – the air is cool and your skin no longer feels like it’s on fire.<br />
<br />
The walls are apparently made of ordinary stone. No glittering gemstones, gold nuggets or anything of the sort in sight. Are you in the wrong place after all?... You go a little bit deeper in, wondering if that’s really a good idea; the cave is pretty wide and seems to go on for miles ahead, but it’s too dark to tell. Suddenly, a very loud low-pitched noise booms from the depths of the cave… a roar? It’s too distorted to tell, but loud enough that the entire cave itself shakes slightly... During the tremor, something drops from the ceiling and lands right at your feet. You kneel down and pick it up: it’s a <b>

1x Red shard</b>!<br />
<br />
You hold onto the unexpected treasure and common sense kicks in… You instinctively look up; if this fell during the quake, maybe that means there are more where it came from! Lo and behold, the ceiling directly above you is <i>filled</i> with glowing red and yellow gems, a beautiful and priceless display of warm colors! Kyle was right!! Meowth is also awestruck at this incredible sight and the prospect of becoming filthy rich within the next few minutes. Until…<br />
<br />
All of a sudden a second tremor, much more violent than the first, shakes the entire cave with such force that you lose balance and land on your back. The walls begin to crack, as does the ceiling; a large chunk of rock falls <i>right next</i> to you, narrowly missing your chest, and you can only look up as a massive fissure splits the cave’s roof apart. You try to make it back to your feet as quickly as you can, made harder by the earthquake that still hasn’t subsided! Large sharp boulders keep falling all around you and Meowth… you have to move!<br />
<br />
In the heat of the moment, only two options seem viable: forward or backward! You’re already well inside the cave, the exit you came in from can still be seen in the distance if you squint, but there’s no telling if you’ll make it there in time. On the other hand, who knows what awaits you deeper inside the tunnel, or if the structure will even hold? Whether you make it or not, regardless of which direction you run, depends on the extent of the cave-in, and that’s anybody’s guess…<br />
<br />
Quick, which way do you go?!</span></span> <br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Treepandaone</u>:</b> Vehemently forbidding your Pokemon from attacking, you decide to approach the two Ice-Types you spotted in the distance. Making your way over to them in a deliberately slow pace, arms stretched out wide, you watch as Froslass continues to dance around the motionless Beartic. Its movements are mesmerizing, graceful and perfect even if you don’t see the point to them.<br />
<br />
Your heart races; how will the creatures react? Surely they’re not used to the presence of humans, which can be problematic. But it’s not in your nature to ignore a possibly injured Pokemon, even if it means putting yourself in jeopardy. If there’s any chance you can be of help, you’ll take that risk. And who knows, maybe they’ll even point you in the right direction if you aid them!<br />
<br />
You clear your throat and announce your intentions loud and clear. The last thing you want is for them to regard you as a threat. The Beartic doesn’t move a muscle, but the Froslass suddenly stops dancing. It turns around slowly, and as she faces you, you notice something is <i>very</i> off…<br />
<br />
The Ghost-Type’s usually white garments are filled with crimson stains, and its eyes aren’t the regular blue but an unsettling red. One hand holds a sharp, blood-filled <b>Ice Shard</b>, and it briefly hovers in the same spot while it looks at you with an unreadable expression. Just then, the Beartic rolls on its back and you feel your stomach turn. The bear is very much dead, with a bloody hole carved in its chest. Ice begins to coalesce <i>within</i> the wound, crystallizing in a familiar shape; the block then floats from the hole, covered in blood, having taken the form of a second Froslass with red eyes similar to the first, and both Ghosts start making their way over to you!<br />
<br />
You fight back the urge to vomit – the vision and ensuing terror would be enough to make many grown men pass out, and it’s a miracle you manage to hold it together. You instantly regret your choice, but how could you have guessed?! These Frosslass are far from normal, even as far as ghosts go. Are they born out of the corpses of other Pokemon? What the hell is going on here?!<br />
<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>CyberBlastoise</u>:</b> With the only two Pokemon in your possession being fish, land battles are virtually unwinnable. Quite the predicament, since there seem to be several areas of this ship that haven’t been flooded. What at first seemed like good news suddenly sank in as a terrifying reality – you can’t survive in water and you can’t battle on land. How are you supposed to make it out of here safely?!<br />
<br />
Your gut tells you to get the hell out of here. With no means to bring the fight to this terrifying opponent, fleeing is your only option, and you decide to go through the door on your left at the last second. Anything is better than standing still and being eaten alive by a ghost, and you seem to recall having entered the ship from starboard, meaning left is the side of the ship you haven’t explored. Jolting to the side, you slam your whole body weight against the rotting door… and the wood gives in, crumbling into a hundred pieces while you burst into the room!<br />
<br />
You tumble to floor down hard, not waiting the door to break so easily. But nevermind the pain, what about Jellicent?! You look over your shoulder, scared that the foe might have followed you inside... but there’s no side of it! The chill you felt earlier has vanished too, as if the ghostly presence had evaporated... You’re certain it wasn’t a mirage, but the place once gain feels as deserted as it did before. This doesn’t make any sense…<br />
<br />
You pull yourself back up and look around. The room, like most of the area you’ve explored thus far, almost completely dark; what little light fills the area is being given off by weird-looking mushrooms that have grown in the humid environment of the sunken ship’s confines. You kneel down and pick a couple of mushrooms to take a better look at these fungi; to be able to survive in these conditions, without nutrients, is amazing… You obtain <b>

Your eyes have adjusted to the low clarity of the room by now and you start scouting the room. It seems to have been a storage room at some point, but whatever goods it may have contained have long been destroyed. There is nothing of interest in the place, and with the Jellicent seemingly gone, you have to decide where to go now. There are only two doors leading out of the room other than the one you came in from. One on the far wall, and one on the wall to your left. You see a blueish-white smoke seeping in from beneath the first door, and as you approach it, an all-too familiar chill runs down your spine again, just like before. Could it be?...<br />
You turn to the other door, which is already half open, and there’s nothing remarkable about it. Except… your eyes shift from the door to the ground, and your stomach turns. Leading all the way from the door you came in from to the half-open one on the left, a trail of dry blood fills the floor. How did you not notice this before?! <br />
<br />
An open door with a path of blood and a closed one with ominous mist… Which one do you go through?</span></span> <br />

<br />
<b><u>Boreal Wastelands</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Treepandaone</u>:</b> Vehemently forbidding your Pokemon from attacking, you decide to approach the two Ice-Types you spotted in the distance. Making your way over to them in a deliberately slow pace, arms stretched out wide, you watch as Froslass continues to dance around the motionless Beartic. Its movements are mesmerizing, graceful and perfect even if you don’t see the point to them.<br />
<br />
Your heart races; how will the creatures react? Surely they’re not used to the presence of humans, which can be problematic. But it’s not in your nature to ignore a possibly injured Pokemon, even if it means putting yourself in jeopardy. If there’s any chance you can be of help, you’ll take that risk. And who knows, maybe they’ll even point you in the right direction if you aid them!<br />
<br />
You clear your throat and announce your intentions loud and clear. The last thing you want is for them to regard you as a threat. The Beartic doesn’t move a muscle, but the Froslass suddenly stops dancing. It turns around slowly, and as she faces you, you notice something is <i>very</i> off…<br />
<br />
The Ghost-Type’s usually white garments are filled with crimson stains, and its eyes aren’t the regular blue but an unsettling red. One hand holds a sharp, blood-filled <b>Ice Shard</b>, and it briefly hovers in the same spot while it looks at you with an unreadable expression. Just then, the Beartic rolls on its back and you feel your stomach turn. The bear is very much dead, with a bloody hole carved in its chest. Ice begins to coalesce <i>within</i> the wound, crystallizing in a familiar shape; the block then floats from the hole, covered in blood, having taken the form of a second Froslass with red eyes similar to the first, and both Ghosts start making their way over to you!<br />
<br />
You fight back the urge to vomit – the vision and ensuing terror would be enough to make many grown men pass out, and it’s a miracle you manage to hold it together. You instantly regret your choice, but how could you have guessed?! These Frosslass are far from normal, even as far as ghosts go. Are they born out of the corpses of other Pokemon? What the hell is going on here?!<br />
<br />
You immediately remember the instructions you gave to Deckard and Psyduck and decide maybe it’s time to reassess your priorities. Truth be told, if they just wanted you to leave, wouldn’t they have attacked already? Something tells you they want to deal with you in a specific way – but very little about the sight of two blood-dripping ice demons floating towards you suggests diplomacy. As you wonder how strong these creatures are and your odds of success should you engage them, only three options come to mind:<br />

<span style="color: lightblue"><div style="text-align: center"><i>“Demons made of snow and ice and cold...The ancient enemy. The only enemy that matters”</i>&#8203;</div><div style="text-align: right">- Stannis Baratheon&#8203;</div><br />
<br />
How would the creatures react was a valid question as Matthew approached the scene; attempting all the while to display a body language that was submissive. He had been at this adventuring game a long time, but not once had he made the correct first move. He looked back over his career with frustrations, a weakness of his personality that was highlighted in every adventure, one he strove to correct without success. He challenged the wrong opponents; got aggressive when he should have negotiated; trusted where he should have been on guard; got greedy where he should not have. But this was character, flawed as it may be, he couldn't help himself. In every situation he got carried away by excitement, his ego driving him forward as much as his love for Pokémon and hatred for evil. Perhaps he sought trouble to fight or escape, sought conquest for pride and prize, sought battle for strength and experience. <br />
<br />
He thought this situation, however, was different. There was no glory here, just two Pokémon who here in need of aid in the baron wasteland of ice and snow; the brutal reality of the circle of life that could be nudged in the direction of prosperity. Slinging his backpack from his back to his hand, Matthew held firm as he announced his presence, ready to delve into the canvas holder to pull a multitude of equipment to revive the injured Pokémon from its slumber.<br />
<br />
A vicious shudder echoed down Matthew's back like a lightning bolt as he found the Pokémon was not sleeping, but dead. The hypnotic dance of Frosslass faded to halt, its body and eyes tainted with the cardinal red equal to the sin it had just finished committing. A single Ice Shard dripping with fresh blood sent his stomach into overdrive as he fought back the need to vomit with every fiber of his being. The smell of decay and rot suddenly hit Matthew's nostrils, as if his brain had recognized the scene and played back the familiar smell like PTSD, the frozen disfigured corpse of Beartic having not smelled on Matthew's approach, but now he knew it's fate the environment linked like a bad glitch in the Matrix.<br />
<br />
A single hole in the middle of the Ursus maritimus begun to convulse with a clear energy, only to begin to converge into another being; a secondary Froslass. Beginning to panic, Matthew began to slowly step away, ushering his Pokémon to do the same as the Ghost-types' began to move towards the trainer with unreadable expressions, though he had no doubt unreasonable intentions. Butterflies near-tore his stomach apart at the thought of the terror wrought upon him should the Froslass catch up, the ability and clear want to convert them in the same way as Beartic had him searching for options, though each one looked dim. Scenarios played out a million times over in his head in what seemed like milliseconds, his brain scrambled to overtime with the imminent threat of death just meters away. <br />
<br />
He laughed a little inside, adding another notch to the poor decision making he had accumulated throughout his Pokémon adventures in the land of Fizzy Bubbles, another blunder on the foundation of trust and short-sightedness. The key, as always, was getting the next part right; avoiding the danger and keeping his Pokémon alive to see another day.<br />
<br />
Should he run? The thought was quickly erased from his mind. Though it seemed to most logical option, his Pokémon were tired from the journey and the trudge through the ice meant that, for Matthew and Psyduck at least, the natives could float over the ice and catch them in an instance.<br />
<br />
Should he fight? Another poor choice, but with his back up against the wall it seemed the only option; though he feared if Beartic couldn't save itself from a single one, how could his Pokémon? Psyduck knew only 6 moves and Deckard only 7, with only 3 of those being offensive and even 1 of those wasn't very effective. Neither had battled before, but on the positive Matthew had plenty of experience battling and the Ghost's had the disadvantage of their … condition, maybe slowing them down. Of course, there was the chance it made them extra strong, in which case running was the best bet.<br />
<br />
Should he talk? Only because he wanted to sound like he was in a movie. He had tried to bluff his way out of a situation in Whale Island only to be thrown in a metal cage for his troubles. That was against a security guard, not against red-eyed animals seeking the blood of fallen enemies to replicate itself. His loud mouth had gotten him into more trouble than he could count; brash egotistical driven dribble worked in movies but not for him; subtle vindictive sneers were always picked up on while quiet timid displays of willingness were exploited. <br />
<br />
He decided to opt for the latter mixed in with a safety net. He turned to his Pokémon with the softest voice he could muster, whispering orders while backing away to give his Pokémon the most time to hear and relay what he had to say while the Froslass were hopefully out of ear-shot.<br />
<br />
“Okay, Psyduck you conjure a <b>Hypnosis</b> while I speak and Deckard you <b>Sharpen</b> your senses for battle in case this gets ugly. If my speech doesn't work, Psyduck hit the one on the right with a <b>Scratch</b> then <b>Mud Bomb</b> combo. Deckard, you <b>Tackle</b> the one on the left then <b>Psybeam</b>. If they use a Ice attack, <b>Conversion 2</b> to resist the Ice type instead of the last Psybeam. Remember to hit and run, moving away immediately after using a physical attack to avoid being in close-range with these things”<br />
<br />
With a boxing-style strategy in mind, Matthew turned to the Froslass, hoping to use Psyduck's Hypnosis to sway their minds against attacking.<br />
<br />
“You don't want to attack us. You want to run. Run away. We are powerful. Run away. You don't want to cause us harm. Run away. Leave this area immediately or face extinction” <br />
<br />
If it didn't work, he was prepared to go down swinging rather than end up like Beartic. He hoped that his Pokémon's resolve, alongside whatever adrenaline they were feeling going into their first battle, would keep their tired legs from going out from under them and give the three of them a fighting chance at beaten the clutches of death, <br />
<br />

<br />
<b><u>Mt. Aduro</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>:</b> You figure Kyle, clumsy and coward as he is, has to be doing <i>something</i> right if he's managed to stay alive up until this point, especially if he has indeed been to all the places he claims. The prospect of gem-filled caverns sounds much more alluring than following this guy and potentially getting yourself into trouble again. You thank Kyle for the not-so-subtle pointer and decide to head south towards the precious caves.<br />
<br />
With Meowth firmly perched on your shoulder - a welcome company, given he's someone you can talk to -, you turn around and start walking the way Kyle indicated. Truth be told, that's the only thing you have to go on; there are no signs, no roads, just warm and sharp rocks all around. You carefully walk the downwards slope of the mountain, minding your every step in fear you may trip on a loose boulder. The river of lava is now far behind you, but you can still hear the rumbling of the liquid fire cascading somewhere in the distance. You also notice the occasional tremor, some of which threaten to make you lose your balance, signaling that this volcano is indeed active - precariously stable, but very much alive. <br />
<br />
The temperature seems to lower somewhat. The air is still hot enough for it to be hard to breathe, but your lungs no longer burns when you exert yourself. You figure the magma stream was responsible for the unbearable heat, and are more than happy to have left it and its inhabitants behind.<br />
After a while of aimlessly wandering down the mountain, and several twisted ankles later, Meowth excitedly points to your left. As you follow his pointer, you realize the cause for all the commotion – there’s a large hole on the rock some feet away from where you’re standing, more than wide enough for someone to go through! It’s a cave no doubt… but is this one of the precious mines Kyle spoke of, or did you get lost along the way? Your heart rate quickens as you approach the opening, hopeful and fearful at the same time. What if there are more violent Pokemon inside?...<br />
<br />
You step inside, cautiously at first, then a little more confident when no pillars of fire or any other hazards invite you out. In reality, nothing happens – nothing at all. The cave is so quiet, it’s hard to believe you’re inside a volcano. The sudden drop in temperature is also welcome – the air is cool and your skin no longer feels like it’s on fire.<br />
<br />
The walls are apparently made of ordinary stone. No glittering gemstones, gold nuggets or anything of the sort in sight. Are you in the wrong place after all?... You go a little bit deeper in, wondering if that’s really a good idea; the cave is pretty wide and seems to go on for miles ahead, but it’s too dark to tell. Suddenly, a very loud low-pitched noise booms from the depths of the cave… a roar? It’s too distorted to tell, but loud enough that the entire cave itself shakes slightly... During the tremor, something drops from the ceiling and lands right at your feet. You kneel down and pick it up: it’s a <b>

1x Red shard</b>!<br />
<br />
You hold onto the unexpected treasure and common sense kicks in… You instinctively look up; if this fell during the quake, maybe that means there are more where it came from! Lo and behold, the ceiling directly above you is <i>filled</i> with glowing red and yellow gems, a beautiful and priceless display of warm colors! Kyle was right!! Meowth is also awestruck at this incredible sight and the prospect of becoming filthy rich within the next few minutes. Until…<br />
<br />
All of a sudden a second tremor, much more violent than the first, shakes the entire cave with such force that you lose balance and land on your back. The walls begin to crack, as does the ceiling; a large chunk of rock falls <i>right next</i> to you, narrowly missing your chest, and you can only look up as a massive fissure splits the cave’s roof apart. You try to make it back to your feet as quickly as you can, made harder by the earthquake that still hasn’t subsided! Large sharp boulders keep falling all around you and Meowth… you have to move!<br />
<br />
In the heat of the moment, only two options seem viable: forward or backward! You’re already well inside the cave, the exit you came in from can still be seen in the distance if you squint, but there’s no telling if you’ll make it there in time. On the other hand, who knows what awaits you deeper inside the tunnel, or if the structure will even hold? Whether you make it or not, regardless of which direction you run, depends on the extent of the cave-in, and that’s anybody’s guess…<br />
<br />
Quick, which way do you go?!</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="font-size: 9px">As Keith ventured down the mountain, it occurred to him that Kyle's vague hint was all he had to go on- he gave no specific instructions as to exactly where to go to locate these particularly precious caves, and the scenery was no more helpful. No roads, no paths, no helpful signs, just sharp rocks in all directions.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, which way did dat reporter say dat da caves wit all da rare minerals was?&quot; Meowth asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly, he didn't get too specific,&quot; Keith admitted. Then, he couldn't help but give a small smile as he looked around at the scenery, all while making his way down the uneven mountainside with remarkable precision.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yer pretty good at dis,&quot; Meowth said, noting Keith's apparent adeptness at navigating such a rough terrain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, it's like being back home,&quot; grinned Keith. &quot;I've spent many days exploring the Jagged Pass- this really rough and uneven mountain path going up the side of Mt. Chimney. Spending a large portion of your childhood doing that tends to make you kinda used to this sort of terrain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Clearly,&quot; nodded Meowth. &quot;Phew, it's warm,&quot; he added.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is nothing,&quot; Keith stated. &quot;It's actually cooled down a lot from earlier. Probably because we're getting farther away from that river of lava. And those Magcargo, come to think of it. Not sure why Kyle was so quick in running away from them- we probably got a two-week head start on them already!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, if dey're anyting like how slow yer Slugma moves, I don't doubt it,&quot; grinned Meowth. &quot;I mean, Heatstroke's a good guy, but he don't move fast, ya know? And- ooh, hey, dat could be it!&quot; he exclaimed suddenly, pointing off to their left. Keith looked, and saw a large opening in the rock several feet away- a cave!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Keith grinned as he started to carefully walk towards the opening. &quot;Nicely spotted, Meowth! Yeah, let's go in, take a look.&quot; As he stepped closer, Keith's heart quickened- thrilled by the prospect of finding treasure he was, no question, though this was also out of fear- suppose there were more violent Pokémon inside like those Magcargo? Cautiously, he stepped inside the cavern, slowly regaining his confidence as no horrible catastrophes made themselves known right away. No attacking Pokémon, no torrent of magma, no raging flames, just peace and quiet. And nice, cool air, too! However, as Keith examined the walls, he could see that they were made solely of ordinary rock. His smile faded at this. &quot;Hmm,&quot; he remarked. &quot;Maybe this isn't the right cave after all...&quot;<br />
<br />
And then, a loud, low-pitched noise rumbled from deeper in the cave, causing the entire cave to shake slightly. It might've been a roar, but Keith couldn't tell for sure. What he could tell, however, is that whatever that noise was, it made Meowth tense up. He turned to look at Meowth, and opened his mouth to speak, when something fell from the cave's ceiling, clearly dislodged by the shaking. Keith crouched down and picked it up- a small, shiny shard, colored a vibrant red. &quot;A Red Shard!&quot; Keith murmured. &quot;Wow, these are kinda rare, aren't they?&quot; he grinned. And then, as Keith stood back up and admired the little piece of treasure, he blinked, something occurring to him. &quot;...Wait,&quot; he said. &quot;If... if this fell down from the ceiling... then... then maybe...&quot; He trailed off there as he slowly lifted his head and looked straight up, and the sight that met his eyes made his jaw drop.<br />
<br />
The entire ceiling of the cave was packed with gems! It was practically <i>made</i> of glowing red and yellow gemstones! Meowth followed Keith's gaze, and looked just as awed at this awe-inspiring sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;That- I- Holy Cacnea needles!&quot; Keith exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're rich!&quot; Meowth exclaimed. &quot;We're filthy stinkin' rich!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, easy, Meowth,&quot; Keith said. &quot;We're not gonna take all of them. Just as many as I can possibly cram into my backpack. And my pockets. And my hat, if it comes to that- what was that?&quot; he asked abruptly, for at that moment, another tremor rocked the cave, this one noticeably more violent than the first. Within seconds, the sudden and violent quake made Keith lose his balance, and he fell on his back. Meowth jumped off Keith's shoulder and managed to land safely on his feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Youse OK?&quot; Meowth asked Keith.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah,&quot; Keith groaned sarcastically. &quot;Yeah, see, this hard rock floor broke my fall!&quot; Just then, the still-ongoing tremor started to crack the walls and the ceiling of the cave. Meowth jumped what had to be three feet in the air as a chunk of rock fell right next to Keith, missing his chest by mere inches. This spurred Keith to hastily climb to his feet. All around him and Meowth, more sharp rocks kept falling.<br />
<br />
&quot;We gotta get outta here!&quot; Meowth exclaimed, starting to panic.<br />
<br />
&quot;No freaking duh!&quot; Keith replied, though also obviously in a panic. &quot;But the exit! It's so far away, we'll never make it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I'm likin' dose odds better den runnin' further inta da cave!&quot; said Meowth.<br />
<br />
Keith opened his mouth to respond to this, but at that moment, a large rock fell right behind them, spurring both Trainer and Pokémon to start running, and running fast. Only thing is, they were running further into the cave! Pure instinct had spurred them to run away from the large rock that had fallen right behind them, but it took them a few seconds to realize they were going further away from the exit. Still, they kept running, hoping to at least not get killed by falling rocks now that they had even less hope of getting to the exit than before. Keith took comfort in the fact that he could at least have one of his Pokémon Dig them out of the cave if it proved necessary, but for now, they kept running, hoping to escape the cave-in altogether... assuming they could, anyway, assuming the entire cave wasn't caving in all at once.</span></span><br />
