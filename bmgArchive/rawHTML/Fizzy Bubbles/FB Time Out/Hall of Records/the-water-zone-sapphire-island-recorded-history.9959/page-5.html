Shinjara &amp; Waterlight- You two agree to battle the Gyarados and send forth Tropius and Arbok! Tropius quickly unleashes a Sweet Scent which momentarily puts Gyarados' defense down, which is when Arbok gives it a vicious Glare! Gyarados is shaken, giving your Pokemon time to attack! Arbok launches Poison Sting needles from it's mouth while Tropius swings it's mighty leaves to launch a Razor Leaf attack! The two attacks hit Gyarados, knocking it back. Then, Tropius Flies up into the air and comes back down with a powerful hit! Gyarados is tossed back! Gyarados then shakes off the blows and gives another mighty Roar! Your Pokemon are shaken, almost to the point of running away. Energy begins to accumilate around Gyarados' mouth as it charges up for a Hyperbeam to finish you all off! With your Pokemon shaken, they cannot escape the attack fast enough. You all close your eyes to prepare for the coming doom. You hear the blast coming towards you and wait for the impact, but suddenly you hear Gyarados screamining in pain.<br />
<br />
You open your eyes to see a Wobbuffet standing before you, reflecting the attack with it's powerful Counter! Wobbuffet then begins to wobble around back and forth, shouting, &quot;WAAAAAH-BUFFETT!&quot; and looking quite pleased. Gyarados on the other hand is thoroughly battered and is making a quick escape into Lapis Lake. A few moments later you see a female trainer dressed in jungle camoflouge run up to Wobbuffet and pat it on the head. Then she turns to you and says, &quot;Is everyone alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of you check yourselves for any possible injuries and then proceed to nod, confirming your good health. &quot;Good, I saw the Gyarados attack you two and got worried when I saw it prepare to fire a Hyperbeam. It's a good thing me and Wobbuffet made it just in time I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
She pauses for a moment and looks ack at the falls, &quot;I wonder what cause a Gyarados to just come out and attack like that... I wanna check it out. If you two are headed there too, we should stick together. What do ya say?&quot;

</blockquote>&quot;Hmm... thanks for your assistance,&quot; Tom muttered shakily as he recovered from the attack, then turned to Kaya. &quot;Are you going to investigate aswell? I think I will, so we all may could go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tropius stomped over and sniffed the air, smiling despite the shock of the Hyper Beam. She approached the Wobbuffet and giggled at her saviour, so to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;First of all, what's your name, and secondly, are you, Kaya and I ready to depart?&quot; Tom questioned...</span></div>

</blockquote>Kaya watched in horror as Gaidoku flinched from the tremendous roar attack. Both she and her Cobra pokemon felt so terrified as the seasnake powered up a Hyper Beam in its mouth and fired it. This was it.. Kaya grabbed onto Gaidoku and held onto him tight, her eyes tightly shut as they awaited the impact from the attack.. But then she heard Gyarados roar in pain.. Opening her eyes, she saw a lone Wobbuffet standing before her, who seemed to have redirected the attack back at Gyarados.<br />
<br />
Watching as the collosal beast dived back into the lake, Kaya stood up and let go of Gaidoku, who was quite devastated. This had been his first battle, and he had the fright of his life. Kaya looked at him sympathetically and then gave him a quick pat on the head. A girl then approached her and Tom and asked if they were alright, checking herself over, she nods to confirm and says, &quot;Yeah, we were lucky you came along when you did..&quot; <br />
<br />
The girl then said, &quot;<i>I wonder what cause a Gyarados to just come out and attack like that... I wanna check it out. If you two are headed there too, we should stick together. What do ya say?&quot;</i> Kaya looked at Tom who looked back and said he was ready to leave. The previous events flashed through Kayas mind and she shuddered. She definetly needs to get to the bottom of this. But first she looked at Gaidoku, who was still in shock, &quot;I'm sorry about this Gaidoku, I think you should have a rest in your pokeball for a while&quot; Gaidoku nodded as he disappeared into the ball. Kaya then decided on a different pokemon for protection, she released her Wartortle, Kame and he stretched slightly and grins at the sight of the Diamond Waterfall, this was the perfect place for him. Kaya then nodded towards the girl and Tom and said, &quot;Well, if we're all ready, then lets go!&quot;</span></div>

<b><span style="color: seagreen">Alilatias-</span></b><span style="color: seagreen"> As your Pokemon play along the beach, you map out your trip through Sapphire Island. You easily find the best coarse of action and begin to move towards your goal. As you walk through the beach, you see a man screaming and kicking with a Shellder on his foot and a Mareep by his side. Weirded out, you walk past them quickly and ignore it. You reach the border between the trees of the jungle and the sands of the beach when suddenly an Aipom jumps out and blocks your path. Aipom shouts and waves it's hands around, denying your access to the jungle. Then it opens up one and and begins to point at it, then the jungle, suggesting that it wants some sort of entrance fee. What will you do?</span>

</blockquote>OOC: Thanks for updating me. Since Shinjara seems to have alot of stress with updating other people now, I won't bother her.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: seagreen">Alilatias noticed the little Apiom and noticed that it seemed to want something in exchange for entering the jungle. She then thought about something else...<br />
<br />
What would an Apiom want with any of her items? And how many other people that have entered the Emerald Jungle have been forced to give the Aipom something in return?<br />
<br />
She thought that this wasn't right, since many different Pokemon live in the Emerald Jungle, and this Aipom was acting like it owned the Emerald Jungle. She knew that you couldn't put a price on a section of the island if so many creatures, human and Pokemon alike, share the entire area and coexist with each other.<br />
<br />
This little Aipom here was just taking advantage of that. Alilatias and the Pokemon that were with her knew that they should do something about this, for this cannot go on.<br />
<br />
Faltzer and Hikari were growling at Aipom in a threatening gesture. Alilatias knew that they were going to battle the Aipom not only to gain entrance into the rest of the Emerald Jungle, but for everyone else on the island.<br />
<br />
She decided, &quot;Faltzer, come back here. Let Hikari handle this. Flying around might not be safe here, because there are lots of trees around here and you could be ambushed by something else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Faltzer then stopped growling at the Aipom for a while as he flew and landed on Alilatias' shoulder, then he began growling once more from there.<br />
<br />
Hikari couldn't contain his anger anymore. He began charging at Aipom as fast as he could.<br />
<br />
Alilatias shouted out, &quot;Hikari, use Thunder Wave to paralyze Aipom, then use Shock Wave followed by Swift!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hikari then began charging up electricity as he continued running towards Aipom...</span></span></div>

Well, here they are. Sorry for the delay. Again, go searching for your old updates if you haven't replied. Remember to quote and colour code yourselves. One last note, I'm not feeling too well, so if I have managed to miss you then it is an honest mistake, so PM me to let me know.. Enjoy ^^<br />

<span style="color: Aqua"><b>Ocean Water and Reefs:</b><br />
<br />
<b>DarkMagic &amp; ForeverFlygon</b>:Okay, you two are now adventuring together.<br />
<br />
As Aexlus climbs on his Salamence and begins to make his way over to the Ocean to find Feera, Feera’s pokemon Mikozou is still underwater, bleeding heavily from his tail. Mikozou then uses the only command Feera gave him, to use a Spark Attack. Mikozou charges his body up with Electricity and then shoots it off at Sharpedo, the electricity stuns the shark and causes it to let go of Mikozou’s tail. Feera sits upon Free as Mikozou surfaces, panting heavily with blood pouring from his tail. Sharpedo then also surfaces and Feera shouts out at Mikozou to use another Spark attack when.. Aexlus swoops on down on Salamence and blasts Sharpedo with a Dragonbreath! Sharpedo is hit for strong damage and dives down.. Aexlus flies over to Feera, who has just scooped up poor Mikozou, who is heavily damaged and close to fainting. The two of you have a small catch up when you notice the water below you begin to form into waves.. The sky turns a dark blue and rain begins to pour.. You both wonder whats going on until a Blastoise and a Feraligatr burst out of the water and roar intensely. The Sharpedo you had previously encountered floats behind them, with its fangs bared menacingly. Looks like Sharpedo had friends in high places. The two giant creatures then both fire Ice Beams directly at Flygon and Salamence! What will you both do?<br />
<br />
<b>Thibideau:</b> Sean listened to your reply with a huge frown on his face, his small nose scrunched up as high as he could muster. “Oh man! You’re so boring! I’m going out there no matter what you think! You don’t scare me Aiden!!!!!!” Sean then picked up Uksi, and sprayed a Super Potion on her and casually flung it over his shoulder and then watched as you and Pandora set off back into the Ocean. Taking out a Horror Novel, you casually read it as you swim across the ocean, the fresh, cool breeze hitting your face.. You don’t even notice the small bubble beneath you consisting of Sean and Uksi, seems they snuck after you.. After 20 minutes, you eventually reach where you descended before and Pandora alerts you she is ready to dive down into the depths. You put your book away as a huge dive bubble surrounds the both of you and you slowly descend into the water. You are greeted by a familiar sight, except this time an absolutely huge Lanturn with lilac and yellow markings is staring right at you.. It has a small glimpse of sadness in it’s eyes. It moved its head light to the left and there are hordes of Chinchou floating in the water KO’ed. You feel your heart skip a beat as you see this sight and Lanturn sighs and slowly speaks.. “Human.. I must ask your assistance. There is a boy.. He is devastating my kingdom in these reefs.. He at first appears feeble, but he is infact strong. I believe you saved him once…” As Lanturn says these words, a flush of anger comes upon you, its Sean. Lanturn observes you carefully as you look at the hordes of fainted Chinchou, the water around them is stained pale red with blood. You then hear a laugh, you and Pandora look up at Sean, who has Uksi, 3 Sharpedo and a Kingler surrounding him. Kingler ferociously clamps its pincers and the Sharpedo bear their teeth. Uksi begins to glow a bright white as she evolves into a Cloyster. Sean then looks at you, “I told you that you didn’t scare me, but then again I didn’t think you’d check up on me..” His tone is more serious and mature than it was before. Lanturn begins to swim towards you and speaks once more, “He is a poacher, employed by a human organization.. They want to destroy the schools of ChinChou and Lanturn and use the chemicals from within us to make lamps and lights for other humans..” Sean then laughs maniacally, “You were wrong to have saved me Aiden, but now you can’t stop me!” He then motions for his Kingler to attack you, the huge crab darts forward towards you with its pincer outstretched to smack you with a Crabhammer! Lanturn then flinches as 3 Sharpedo are sent towards it with their huge fangs beared. Lanturn panicks and looks at you, “Human, help!!” How will you react?<br />
<br />
<b>ZoraJolteon:</b> As Pelipper honed in on Wooper, Wooper began to glow, as a new attack entered her array of techniques. She then flung her body around and smashed into Pelipper, dealing a particularly fatal DynamicPunch attack, Pelipper takes heavy damage and then becomes confused by the heavy blow, the pelican pokemon flying around randomly without any purpose.. Wooper happily smiles and then summons some rocks which smash into Pelipper causing the bird pokemon a lot of heavy damage.. A Purple aura then surrounds Wooper as she receives powerups from the attack. Wooper then lands in the water and dives under then resurfaces and makes her way over to you whilst Slowqueen uses a Swagger to distract the 2 Wingull, the 2 of them becoming enraged to the point that their attack is raised, but they become confused as a result.. They begin to fly lower and lower as they attempt to attack Slowqueen who merely unleashes a Fury Cutter on the two bird’s wings, they cry in pain. But both of them power up Wing Attacks and smash into Slowqueen, causing her medium damage. Wooper manages to get over to you and you try to keep her as safe as possible until Pelipper spots where her lunch has gone and begins to swoop down towards you yet again, the confusion no longer holding her. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: Cyan"><b>Lapis Lake:</b><br />
<br />
<b>Golden Mew:</b> Releasing Geo, he listens to your orders, nods then crawls up to the edge of the lake and looks at Qwilfish, who stares back quite angrily. Considering that Qwilfish in the water, Geo looks at the water quite fearfully but then shakes his little head and dives towards Qwilfish for a tackle, he hit’s the Qwilfish but gets a nasty surprise as Qwilfish’s spikes dig into Geo’s delicate skin and he screams out in pain and drops into the water and he begins to sink. Qwilfish then looks at you with a sadistic grins and dives into the water to attack Geo some more. What will you do?<br />
<br />
<b>Faiyaa:</b> Rena, nodding after listening to your commands, begins to charge electricity and shoots the Thunder Wave across at Psyduck. It strikes the duck, and paralyzes it. Coincidentally, Psyduck loses its hold on you and you drop to the ground, landing on your backside pretty hard. As you sit there for a few minutes as your backside throbs, Rena looks over at you concerned and then focus on the battle. She flashes Psyduck, who holds its head in pain, the bright light provoking a headache. It then shouts out as a Gyarados bursts from the water and scoops the helpless duck into its huge mouth and then dives back in to the water. You begin to see blood rise to the surface of the water..and you realize what is happening to that poor Psyduck. Rena looks at you helplessly, she can’t go into the water. How will you react?<br />
<br />
<b>SkepticReptile:</b> Kimberley charges up her fist with Lightning energy and launches herself towards Corphish. Corphish then leaps into the air and lands in Lapis Lake with a grin on his face. Kimberley follows but then stops short of the Lake, not being able to swim working against her. Kimberly then decides to blast Corphish with a Dragonbreath, she does so, green flames bursting from her mouth, but Corphish simply dives into the water to dodge the potentially fatal attack, the Dragonbreath hit’s the waters surface and is cancelled out. Corphish then bursts from the water and fires a BubbleBeam at Kimberley, smacking her in the stomach for good damage. It then hardens in the water and then Leers Kimberley to intimidate her some. Kimberley, quite annoyed then uses Absorb which drains Corphish of some health and energy and restores it to Kimberley. Corphish then frowns and decides to step things up a notch. Its eyes glow a fierce blue as a huge wave appears from the lake and rises to about 12 feet tall. The wave is almost ready to crash down on the both of you.. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: MediumTurquoise"><b>Turquoise River:</b><br />

<br />
Deciding to use Axtan to battle the Remoraid, he listens intently to your commands and his eyes glow brightly as he uses Flash which blinds Remoraid. The small fish then begins to flop around in panic in the water and then dives into the water to buy some time to recover. Axtan hops forward and looks down into the water, but decides not to use Night Shade as it wouldn’t likely hit the small fish when it was that far down in the water. Remoraid then waits for Axtan to look away and then begins to swim rapidly up through the water, it bursts out suddenly and hits Axtan dead on for good damage and then flops back into the water and pokes its head out of the surface. Axtan, usually calm, but now enraged by the sneak attack, fires a black Nightshade out of his eyes, which Remoraid for good damage. Remoraid then fires a rainbow coloured Aurora Beam at Axtan which hits him for super-effective damage… Ouch. Axtan falls back, weakened but still able to fight. Remoraid is panting slightly and is preparing to use a Waterfall attack by spinning around to create a pillar of water to crash down on Axtan. What will you do next?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: LimeGreen"><b>Emerald Jungle:</b> <br />
<br />
<b>Joshua:</b> Calling Michael over with your whistle, you tend to his wounds with a Potion and put on a new accessory; some very stylish Blackglasses. Michael beams happily at you for his new boost item and then Michael listens intently to your commands, the bristles on his back standing up in anticipation for battle. Moving in front of you, Michael then speeds off and kicks dirt up from the ground which smacks Gloom in the eyes, making it difficult for the flower pokemon to see. She rubs her eyes as Michael moves fast and pelts her with a Pursuit attack and then gets ready to perform another when he is distracted by Gloom dancing in a very graceful and elegant manner. He tilts his head, wondering what on earth shes doing. You then work out whats happening and alert Michael that shes about to launch a Petal Dance attack! Gloom then releases a horde of petals which head towards Michael, he is hit dead on by most of them despite trying his best to dodge them and is knocked back. Gloom then stops dancing and holds her head. She is now disorientated and staggers up to Michael and attempts to use Double-Edge on him as he is knocked down, but simply falls flat on her face next to him. Michael recovers and shakes slightly and looks down at Gloom in confusion, wondering why she was next to him. Gloom then releases a Stun Spore from the ground in her confused state. What will you do?<br />
<br />
<b>Dark Scizor:</b> Mankey watches you, its eyes tinted an angry red. It bounces up and down, shouting out in rage. You then release Minerva, who listens to your commands, quite confused as to why you enraged the Mankey. Mankey begins to shake in rage.. Its breathing becomes quite heavy as it stares at you. Minerva then begins to use Flash, her eyes glowing brightly but Mankey anticipates this and jumps up into a tree and then slams down on Minerva, smashing her against the ground. Minerva cries out in pain as Mankey stands ontop of her, jumping up and down, whilst staring at you.. You open up your pokedex and it says this about Mankey, “Once Mankey gets into a rage, its almost impossible to flee its wrath. Mankey can be extremely dangerous.” Mankey hops off Minerva and then launches itself towards you, swinging its leg towards your ankle, knocking you down with a Low Kick. Minerva, watching you get beaten up, becomes enraged and becomes airborne once again and uses her immense speed to smack into Mankey and knock her off you using Quick Attack. You stand back up and thank Minerva who buzzes happily. Mankey however, is even more enraged than it was before and it is now focused on Minerva, its eyes filled with rage. Minerva frowns at Mankey whilst you think of what to do next.. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: SeaGreen"><b>Jade Swamp: </b><br />
<br />
<b>Sasuke-san:</b> Sarutobi stood in front of the looming wave and opened his mouth, firing a barrage of Bullet Seeds at Totodile. Totodile gasped as the seeds smacked her in the snout and knocked her down into the swamp. Unfortunately, the surf wave was becoming so huge that the disruption to its formation was in vain. The wave began to crash down, Sarutobi shielded himself with his leaves as you and Ino began to run off to the side to try and avoid it. As the wave hit Sarutobi, it deals him only slight damage, type disadvantage working in his favour. You and Ino manage to run away from most of the wave, but the very side of it strikes you and you are knocked into the air.. Sarutobi attempts to catch you, but he falls short as you land on the ground on your back. Ino lands on your stomach, and she smiles at you for breaking her fall. Meanwhile, Totodile is laughing at you, taunting you for your fall. You sit up, with swamp mud smeared all down your back and frown. Standing up, you look at Sarutobi who is standing, waiting for his attacks. Totodile then hops out of the water and bounces towards Sarutobi.. She looks up at him and roars at him, Sarutobi, not at all intimidated watches as the Totodile did a small dance and then jumped up into the air and landed on his head and clamped down with a Bite attack on Sarutobi’s head, taking him completely by surprise! Sarutobi then begins to feel uneasy, trying to knock the small creature off his head. However, the harder he tries, the harder Totodile bites down.. What will you do?<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Latias10:</b> Releasing Athrun, the Psychic Pig decides to have a little roll in the mud, before you scold him and focus him on the task at hand. Athrun looks at the tiny KO’ed Surskit and then murmurs, “Grummmmpiggggg..” as a blue aura surrounds Surskit and lifts it up. Swampert is powerless to stop him as he is powering up for a Bide attack. Athrun brings Surskit to you and drops it in front of you, the small bug looks up at you weakly and then passes out again.. In that one small moment, you could’ve sworn there was a smile on the small bugs face. Swampert then lets out a huge roar and fires a weak beam of Bide energy at Ledy, who simply summons a Reflect to defend against it. Athrun stands and watches by the sidelines just incase he is needed to attack. Swampert then roars out in frustration and is smacked by a Silver Wind launched by Ledy causing good damage to him. Swampert then moves out of the swamp slowly.. Each step it takes creating an almighty shakes in the ground. It then launches itself towards Ledy for a Take Down but is hit in the head by a Psybeam sent by Athrun! Swampert roars in pain and then retreats back to the swamp, Athrun’s psybeam causing good damage. Ledy then smiles at Athrun and thanks him silently. It seems that the Swampert isn’t as strong when its out of the swamp. What will you do?<br />
<br />
<b>Manji:</b> After pocketing some of the gemstones in excitement, you decide to finally refocus on the battle. Bandit begins to spin around, summoning sand from within his body, the fact that there is no sand in the Jade Swamp means that there is a Sandstorm but it isn’t as magnificent as it could be. Poliwag stepped back intimidated, and then fires some Bubbles to test the Sandstorm, they are all absorbed and Bandit remains undamaged. Poliwag then begins to fume, and runs towards the sandstorm and spins around ready to pelt it with a Double Slap, Bandit seizes the opportunity and darts out of the safety of the sandstorm and slashes Poliwag with a Scratch attack, and then follows up with a Cut to Poliwag’s torso. Crying in pain, Poliwag falls onto its back as Bandit disappears back into the Sandstorm. You congratulate Bandit on a good series of attacks, but yoy are surprised to see Poliwag stand up and bounce up and down in rage. You then watch as it runs towards the swamp and jumps in and begins to swim around in circles.. After a while a huge pillar of water begins to rise and stretches up high into the air, it then arcs and descends towards Bandit! Looks like Poliwag is smarter than he seems, using a Waterfall attack! What will you do? </span></div>

Coincidentally, Psyduck loses its hold on you and you drop to the ground, landing on your backside pretty hard. As you sit there for a few minutes as your backside throbs, Rena looks over at you concerned and then focus on the battle. She flashes Psyduck, who holds its head in pain, the bright light provoking a headache. It then shouts out as a Gyarados bursts from the water and scoops the helpless duck into its huge mouth and then dives back in to the water. You begin to see blood rise to the surface of the water..and you realize what is happening to that poor Psyduck. Rena looks at you helplessly, she can’t go into the water. How will you react?</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: Cyan">Though Gary's backside hurt a bit when he fell from the Psyduck's grasp, he smiled, congradulating Rena on her battling, while rubbing his rear end. He stood up and grinned as his strategy seemed to be in full effect on the Psyduck, while Rena blinds it. However, he stares in horror as the massive Gyarados jumps out of the water, scooping up the poor Psyduck, before splashing down with a bloody trail. Being as reckless as he usually is, Gary dropped his back pack and ran to the water's edge. &quot;Rena, there's a slight chance it could still be alive. When I lure the Gyarados to the surface, try using the same strategy, by Thunder Waving it, and if not, use Flash followed by Extrasensory.&quot; Before Rena had any time to protest, Gary had waded out, and doven under water. As Gary swam downwards, he realized that his plan was extremely flawed, as he had no way of luring the Gyarados to the surface. Also, he realized that this was a massive Gyarados he was going up against. He scanned the lake, in search of the Gyarados.</span></div>

<span style="color: LimeGreen"><b>P-Arts:</b> After Jiroubi’s little hissy fit, and your casual beating. You decide to watch out for whatever the creature was that attacked Jiroubi. Both of you feel a sense of paranoia.. That someone is watching. You hear a rustling in the trees, and Jiroubi turns and stares at the leaves, trying to Leer whatever it is out. Suddenly, a flash of blue appears next to Jiroubi and smacks him with a flurry of kicks and then disappears again. Jiroubi, even more annoyed by this, uses Rock Tomb and throws rocks all over the area. A yelp is heard as a very hostile looking Nidoran comes out from within the bushes.. She looks at you with an angry twinkle in her eye, her teeth bared and a hiss emitting from her tiny mouth. Jiroubi then charges his fist with fire energy and launches himself towards Nidoran, who merely take the attack, but then counters Jiroubi’s Fury Swipes by firing Poison Stings at his paws, each one piercing his skin. Jiroubi then staggers back, the Poison slowly taking effect. Nidoran growls at you fiercely.. What will you do?</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: LimeGreen">Jiroubi, after taking the humiliating beating from the female nidoran, leapt back and landed with a thump, wincing as the ground touched his paws.<br />
<br />
&quot;How the hell did it get so strong?&quot; exclaimed the bear angrily, not meeting James's eyes. <br />
<br />
His trainer grinned, &quot;Are you sure you're not just going soft?&quot; he asked innocently, &quot;I mean, it has been awhile since your last battle, and you were never that strong to begin with...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jiroubi growled, &quot;For the love of your future children, never finish that sentence. Now shut up, tell me what to do, and let Kage know this happened and I'll eat you.&quot;<br />
<br />
James coughed hastily, pulled out an Antidote and quickly sprayed it on the bear's paws, not wanting to meet his eyes in fear of laughing, &quot;Well, let's not beat around the bush-slash-jungle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hardey-freaking-har...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, you're angry, right?&quot; At the glare Jiroubi gave him, James thought it better to carry on, &quot;Well, er, channel that anger into a Metal Claw, catch it off guard with a Water Pulse...&quot; His expression quickly turned serious, &quot;Then activate your Berserk Gene. Now we're not sure how powerful this thing is, so, if you can, keep your attacks physical.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Any reason why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, er, yes. I don't want to be caught in the cross-fire.&quot;<br />

Wooper happily smiles and then summons some rocks which smash into Pelipper causing the bird pokemon a lot of heavy damage.. A Purple aura then surrounds Wooper as she receives powerups from the attack.

They begin to fly lower and lower as they attempt to attack Slowqueen who merely unleashes a Fury Cutter on the two bird’s wings, they cry in pain. But both of them power up Wing Attacks and smash into Slowqueen, causing her medium damage. Wooper manages to get over to you and you try to keep her as safe as possible until Pelipper spots where her lunch has gone and begins to swoop down towards you yet again, the confusion no longer holding her.

Minerva, watching you get beaten up, becomes enraged and becomes airborne once again and uses her immense speed to smack into Mankey and knock her off you using Quick Attack. You stand back up and thank Minerva who buzzes happily. Mankey however, is even more enraged than it was before and it is now focused on Minerva, its eyes filled with rage.

Corphish then leaps into the air and lands in Lapis Lake with a grin on his face. Kimberley follows but then stops short of the Lake, not being able to swim working against her. Kimberly then decides to blast Corphish with a Dragonbreath, she does so, green flames bursting from her mouth, but Corphish simply dives into the water to dodge the potentially fatal attack, the Dragonbreath hit’s the waters surface and is cancelled out. Corphish then bursts from the water and fires a BubbleBeam at Kimberley, smacking her in the stomach for good damage. It then hardens in the water and then Leers Kimberley to intimidate her some. Kimberley, quite annoyed then uses Absorb which drains Corphish of some health and energy and restores it to Kimberley. Corphish then frowns and decides to step things up a notch. Its eyes glow a fierce blue as a huge wave appears from the lake and rises to about 12 feet tall. The wave is almost ready to crash down on the both of you.. What will you do?</span>

Justin turns around and looks at the Corphish, then looks at the wave again. He decides to rethink a plan.<br />

&quot;Kimberly, if you don't mind getting a little wet, try and jump over the wave as fast as you can. Then hit Corphish with a powerful <b>thunderpunch</b> while it's still in the lake. If this plan works, we'll be having fried crawfish tonight!&quot;<br />

Deciding to use Axtan to battle the Remoraid, he listens intently to your commands and his eyes glow brightly as he uses Flash which blinds Remoraid. The small fish then begins to flop around in panic in the water and then dives into the water to buy some time to recover. Axtan hops forward and looks down into the water, but decides not to use Night Shade as it wouldn’t likely hit the small fish when it was that far down in the water. Remoraid then waits for Axtan to look away and then begins to swim rapidly up through the water, it bursts out suddenly and hits Axtan dead on for good damage and then flops back into the water and pokes its head out of the surface. Axtan, usually calm, but now enraged by the sneak attack, fires a black Nightshade out of his eyes, which Remoraid for good damage. Remoraid then fires a rainbow coloured Aurora Beam at Axtan which hits him for super-effective damage… Ouch. Axtan falls back, weakened but still able to fight. Remoraid is panting slightly and is preparing to use a Waterfall attack by spinning around to create a pillar of water to crash down on Axtan. What will you do next?</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: mediumturquoise">Axtan now seems to be in flames, shoots out the nightshade that was instructed, but it was countered by an aurora beam. Being a flying type, he was weak against ice types, so he fell back, weak. Centin comes near Axtan and tries to not let it get too hasty and lose focus by grabbing it. However, Axtan was persistent enough and wanted to fight more. &quot;Ah, fine, fine. This is your first fight anyway, I should aid you and support you through the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Centin reached his back and gave a potion for Axtan to drink. He then commanded his natu to use faint attack to grab the remoraid's attention while doing some decent damage to it. &quot;Axtan, after that, use fly. Grab it in the air, it should be vulnerable since it's out of water, and then we'll see how everything goes before I give you the next command. Shouldn't be hard to follow isn't it?&quot;</span></div>

<span style="color: yellow"><b>Th3d-</b>You run over to the young woman. She's definitely unconscious and you try to wake her up. You shake her for a bit, but she's not responding. Then you say, loudly, &quot;Hmm... maybe I'll have to do CPR...&quot;<br />
<br />
Still, no response. So you hunch over and creep closer and closer to her lips. Suddenly...<br />
<br />
POW!<br />
<br />
You're smacks on the side of your face with some hard red thing. You look back to see what hit you and spot a Krabby. Krabby stands between you and the sleeping lady and looks very upset and concerned about her. It then turns to you and threatens you with it's claws. What will you do?</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: Yellow">Approaching the girl Thed was cautious at first. He checked his surroundings; making sure that the area was generally safe to enter. He bent down to the girl and tried to wake her up. He said in a loud voice while shaking her, &quot;Hey wake up!!! Can you hear me? Wake up!!&quot; But, to no avail; she just layed there still unconscious.<br />
<br />
Thed thought to himself, <i>Well... a litle CPR wouldn't hurt. Heck it might just wake her up.</i> He bent down lower so that his face was right in line with hers. His face going lower and lower almost touching hers; he closed his eyes. <i>Almost there....</i>, he thought to himself. But, before he knew it he was smacked in the face by something. Caught off guard and of course not one to like being hit in the face Thed sat up furious.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK who did that!?!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked around the beach with fire in his eyes. He spotted something red next to the girl; it was a Krabby. &quot;So, you were the one who hit me huh?&quot; Thed said angrily. The Krabby was not taking a liking to Thed and it's mouth started bubbling. Thed, also, was not taking a liking to the Krabby and his face started getting red.<br />
<br />
&quot;You... Grrrr... this girl is in need of help here and you're stopping me from doing so!!! And I really doubt you'll be able to give her the necessary help that she needs. Errr... you're getting on my nerves you little crab. Ok I'm over this..&quot;<br />
<br />
With that Thed threw a ball out and it opened up revealing a Magnemite. It buzzed and whirred for a second and then looked at the Krabby; it's mouth still bubbling in anger. Magneto then turned towards its trainer still looking furiously towards the Krabby. Magneto was a bit entertained by the sight for it never saw its trainer so angry. It then spied the exotic girl and then realized why its trainer was so pissed off... his animal instincts were at work. It gave a bit of a sigh and knew he would have to do something about this situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Magneto we need to help this girl out but the Krabbys in the way. Get it away from the girl by using a Metal Sound. Then once it's backed off use a Thunder Wave to paralyze it and buy me some time. I'll carry the girl to a safer spot, but if the Krabby somehow fights off the paralysis you'll need to fend it off with Tackles.&quot;</span></div>

<span style="color: Aqua"><b>Ocean Water and Reefs:</b><br />
<br />
<b>Thibideau:</b> Sean listened to your reply with a huge frown on his face, his small nose scrunched up as high as he could muster. “Oh man! You’re so boring! I’m going out there no matter what you think! You don’t scare me Aiden!!!!!!” Sean then picked up Uksi, and sprayed a Super Potion on her and casually flung it over his shoulder and then watched as you and Pandora set off back into the Ocean. Taking out a Horror Novel, you casually read it as you swim across the ocean, the fresh, cool breeze hitting your face.. You don’t even notice the small bubble beneath you consisting of Sean and Uksi, seems they snuck after you.. After 20 minutes, you eventually reach where you descended before and Pandora alerts you she is ready to dive down into the depths. You put your book away as a huge dive bubble surrounds the both of you and you slowly descend into the water. You are greeted by a familiar sight, except this time an absolutely huge Lanturn with lilac and yellow markings is staring right at you.. It has a small glimpse of sadness in it’s eyes. It moved its head light to the left and there are hordes of Chinchou floating in the water KO’ed. You feel your heart skip a beat as you see this sight and Lanturn sighs and slowly speaks.. “Human.. I must ask your assistance. There is a boy.. He is devastating my kingdom in these reefs.. He at first appears feeble, but he is infact strong. I believe you saved him once…” As Lanturn says these words, a flush of anger comes upon you, its Sean. Lanturn observes you carefully as you look at the hordes of fainted Chinchou, the water around them is stained pale red with blood. You then hear a laugh, you and Pandora look up at Sean, who has Uksi, 3 Sharpedo and a Kingler surrounding him. Kingler ferociously clamps its pincers and the Sharpedo bear their teeth. Uksi begins to glow a bright white as she evolves into a Cloyster. Sean then looks at you, “I told you that you didn’t scare me, but then again I didn’t think you’d check up on me..” His tone is more serious and mature than it was before. Lanturn begins to swim towards you and speaks once more, “He is a poacher, employed by a human organization.. They want to destroy the schools of ChinChou and Lanturn and use the chemicals from within us to make lamps and lights for other humans..” Sean then laughs maniacally, “You were wrong to have saved me Aiden, but now you can’t stop me!” He then motions for his Kingler to attack you, the huge crab darts forward towards you with its pincer outstretched to smack you with a Crabhammer! Lanturn then flinches as 3 Sharpedo are sent towards it with their huge fangs beared. Lanturn panicks and looks at you, “Human, help!!” How will you react?</span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: aqua">Aiden was filled with regret for helping such a monster. He should've known better then to trust anyone by now. The frightened Lanturn looked to Aiden with fear as the 3 Sharpedo lunged in to attack. With a Kingler quickly moving towards him and Pandora he had to move fast. Knowing he was submerged in the ocean he decided to take advantage of that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pandora, Use <b>Whirlpool</b> to trap the Sharpedo. If you get them stuck in the Whirlpool good then fling some <b>Icicle spears</b> at them. After that use <b>Protect</b> and brace for what ever they throw at us. Lanturn I need to you to go and get the rest of your school. It's going to take a joint effort to knock this guy out. Go now!&quot;<br />
<br />
While Pandora was preparing to attack he still had the problem of the Kingler was was getting ever so closer. Reaching to his belt he plucked off a pokeball and enlarged it in his hand before releasing the trigger. In a flash of light a Tangela took form inside the dive bubble. It was Athene, Aiden's trusty little grass type.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there little lady. Ready for a battle?&quot; Aiden asked with a smile. Tangela looked around and saw the Kingler and nodded in agreement. &quot;That's my girl. Now lets show him what we're capable of eh. Use <b>Constrict</b> to hold it still and hit it with a <b>Leech seed</b>. Once you've made it that far hit him with a <b>Mega drain</b> to get some good damage in.&quot;<br />
<br />
With two of his pokemon ready to defend him at all costs Aiden looked at his opponents and smiled. &quot;Lets do this.&quot;</span></div>

<span style="color: Sienna"><b>Ushi No Tane-</b>You quickly run away from the native back into the trees to plan some way of getting into the temple grounds. He stands there now just as confused by the encounter as you were with his speech. You ignore the possible use of the island's translators and quickly think of some way the guard. You bang your head on the tree and make weird faces when an idea pops up. You order Mightyena to put the guard to sleep so you can sneak in.<br />
<br />
Mightyena reluctantly agrees and walks by the guard and opens it's mouth wide for a big <i>Yawn</i>. The guard hears it and begins to yawn himself. He begins to get drowzy and then falls asleep standing, leaning on a stick he's holding. Successful with your scheme, you and Mightyena begin to tiptoe past him to enter the Temple Grounds. As you walk closer and closer, you begin to notice the paved ground and the statues of what look like various Pokemon. You then come to a fork in the road. There are signs that point off in each direction, but you can't read them. There's a path to the right and a path to the left. What will you do?</span>

</blockquote><div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: sienna">Havining managed to successfully sneak past the guards (albeit rather...wrongfully), Kris took a brief moment to let out a muffled, blood-curdling sqeal, careful to bury her face in roch's neck as tostiffle her gleeful sounds.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're in! Weire in! WE'RE IN!&quot;, she cooed. &quot;You know, I almost feel guilty, but...it's all for education, right? I mean, it's not like we're defiling sacred earth or anything...&quot;<br />
<br />
Roch's ear's pricked as he snorted in discontentment.<br />
<br />
&quot;...'Kay...so maybe we are. But religion is just a fool's security blanket anyway, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ignoring her hound's soulful eyes which begged them to turn back before things got bad, Kris began tapping her chin in mock thought as she pondered the routes. As far as she was concerned, this was a once-in-a-lifetime trip. She'd never be n this island again, and she wouldn't have to deal with reprocutions, so she might as well get out some of her frustration while she still had a suitable place to act out. She hadn't had much of a childhood, she admitted, and this sort of mischief was her way of catching up. Catching Roch gently by the nap of the neck, she smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I love you, right?&quot;, she mused, hoping to cushion the news that they were going in deeper. &quot;Well, even if you don't, I do love you, and I know that you love me sooooo much, so...we're headin' in. You'll protect me if things get nasty...right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Roch shook his furry black head in disbelief, before planting a soft slurp of his tongue on her cheek in agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fantastic. Now, c'mon, we're burning daylight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Padding off, feet crunching over the dirt path, Roch flicked his tail and followed his trainer down the left path, and she singed poorly some song about left-handed scissors...or...something.</span></span>&#8203;</div></div>

<b>Joshua:</b> Calling Michael over with your whistle, you tend to his wounds with a Potion and put on a new accessory; some very stylish Blackglasses. Michael beams happily at you for his new boost item and then Michael listens intently to your commands, the bristles on his back standing up in anticipation for battle. Moving in front of you, Michael then speeds off and kicks dirt up from the ground which smacks Gloom in the eyes, making it difficult for the flower pokemon to see. She rubs her eyes as Michael moves fast and pelts her with a Pursuit attack and then gets ready to perform another when he is distracted by Gloom dancing in a very graceful and elegant manner. He tilts his head, wondering what on earth shes doing. You then work out whats happening and alert Michael that shes about to launch a Petal Dance attack! Gloom then releases a horde of petals which head towards Michael, he is hit dead on by most of them despite trying his best to dodge them and is knocked back. Gloom then stops dancing and holds her head. She is now disorientated and staggers up to Michael and attempts to use Double-Edge on him as he is knocked down, but simply falls flat on her face next to him. Michael recovers and shakes slightly and looks down at Gloom in confusion, wondering why she was next to him. Gloom then releases a Stun Spore from the ground in her confused state. What will you do?</span>

His mind races with ideas for how to bypass the cloud of spores, running through Michael's attacks. In it's confused state, Gloom is vulnerable, it's only defense the cloud of spores hanging over its head.<br />

An idea sparks in Joshua's head, and he calls out to Michael. &quot;Michael, use a Sand Attack to hopefully blow the spores out of the way. Then race in with another Pursuit, and then blast it with Thunderbolt!&quot;</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: seagreen">Saru stood bravely in the path of the oncoming wave, which was creating a tremendous roar as it continued to grow in size, and travel forwards with mounting power.<br />
<br />
Sasuke on the other hand was high-tailing it out of there, with Ino clutched tightly in his hands giggling with every bounce. He daren’t look over his shoulder, but he knew the murky swamp water was gaining on him, getting out of range of it’s full impact was all that mattered.<br />
<br />
Saru puffed up his cheeks and began to spit out a stream of bullet seeds like a Gatling gun. They ripped into the water near Totodile, then with a slight readjustment of his aim Saru struck the crocodile pokemon in the snout with the powerful attack, knocking her backwards into the swamp with a splash. <br />
<br />
Ino, straining to peer around Sasuke as he ran, sniggered with glee, but the powerful surf wave continued to surge forward, too strong by this point to be stopped. Sasuke cursed his luck and arched his neck round to look at Saru, who was lifting his leaves above his head and steadying himself, braced for the impact. Sasuke winced as his Shiftry disappeared under the water which crashed down on top of him, but then turned his concern to Ino and himself. The wave was gushing towards him now, the level high above his head and not dropping quickly enough due to the sheer amount of water it contained. With resignation he grasped Ino and turned his back to the torrent, gripping her tightly against his chest where she trembled softly in his arms. Soon enough the wave crashed into him, sweeping his legs from underneath him and tossing him into the air like a ragdoll. He landed with a sickening thud on his back and skidded along the floor, then had the wind knocked out of him as Ino landed with a bounce on his stomach, laughing happily. <br />
<br />
Totodile had re-emerged after her watery fall by this point, and was pointing and laughing, jumping up and down with glee at the mess her attack had caused. Sasuke groaned and sat himself up, turning his attention first to Saru, who didn’t seem to have taken to much damage from the attack, his resistance to water paying off. Instead he merely shook himself violently, shaking slime from his leaves and mane. Sasuke arched his neck to look at his back, which had the icky substance smeared all over it. <i>”My favourite top,”</i> he moaned, taking it off and furiously throwing it aside. <i>”Now it’s personal,”</i> he didn’t say, ‘cause that would have been corny.<br />
<br />
Totodile, tired of waiting, lunged out of the protection that the swamp provided and sprinted towards Saru, who watched without moving, stunned at the brave attack. For the first time Sasuke could see the sheer size of this mutant pokemon who seemed to be twice as big as any other of her species. It was easy to see why she was the boss of these parts, and Saru felt the full force of her powerful jaws and she leapt in the air, clamping her mouth around his head. The comical scene at first caused Sasuke to just watch as his Shiftry stumbled about trying to shake the turquoise crocodile pokemon off his head, but he soon became concerned, realising that her grip was only tightening, and Sarutobi was starting to look worried. <i>”Saru!”</i> he shouted urgently, <i>”quickly plant her with a leech seed and make sure it wraps tight, then harden to shake her free. After that, strike her with all your strength.”</i> He watched nervously as his Shiftry began to attack and place Ino back onto his shoulder, from where she could watch the battle resume.</span></div>

It shines across the a good portion of the cave and you see a Lairon there, turning away from the bright light. Lairon then charges towards Nuzleaf! Nuzleaf quickly responds with a <i>Fake Out</i>, stunning the beast temporarily. With that, you and Nuzleaf make a run for it. Deeper into the cave.

The old man smiles. &quot;Thank you. Perhaps you will accomplish what many others have not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have lived for many years. My people have always asked for my advice and for my aid. But now, I've grown too old. I can no longer carry out my duty as the Village Shaman, so I must step down for the betterment of my people. But my grandson, he does not take his shaman training likely. He knows he is the only one from the village who can become shaman. But now that I have found you, I hope I can encourage him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You also have the abilities to be a shaman. Your spirit energy is strong and your connection to these ghosts strengthens you. I want you to also participate in shaman training at the Temple Grounds. If my grandson sees another person who could take his title, you may yet be able to inspire him to take his training seriously.&quot;<br />
<br />
He hands you a necklace with a golden feather at the end of it. &quot;Take this with you, so the people will know I have chosen you as a possible future heir. Then head for the Temple Grounds.

</blockquote><span style="color: royalblue">The old man smiled at Stacey, seemingly happy with her reply. He thanks her with a small bow and begins to tell her of what it is that is troubling him. Stacey moved to be more comfy in her chiar and Lucius floated down to rest in her lap.<br />
<br />

He knows he is the only one from the village who can become shaman. But now that I have found you, I hope I can encourage him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stacey smiled gently at the old man for the sorrow in his eyes for having to give up his position. It seemed odd to her that his grandson would not consider helping out his village in such a honourable position and became confused when the old man said that she could help. Lucius began to figit in her lap, his chocolate fix begin to wear off and his withdrawl symptoms kicking in. Stacey softly stroked his cold head in a soothing manner, listening to the old man still.<br />
<br />
&quot;You also have the abilities to be a shaman. Your spirit energy is strong and your connection to these ghosts strengthens you. I want you to also participate in shaman training at the Temple Grounds. If my grandson sees another person who could take his title, you may yet be able to inspire him to take his training seriously.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stacey smiled at Lucius at this point, the ghost smiling back, a strong connection was there and it was no surprise that the old man had caught up on it. She gasped when he asked her to participated in the shaman training. She had never done anything like this, where would you begin. He told her that this would be a way to get his grandson inspired and Stacy bit her lip, thinking hard. His hand reached forth and placed a delicate necklace with a golden feather hanging on the end into her hand and closed her fingers over the top of it. Stacey studied the necklace and could see how beautiful it is.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take this with you, so the people will know I have chosen you as a possible future heir. Then head for the Temple Grounds. If you are strong enough to travel through this perilous land all the way there, it will prove that my choice was not a mistake.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stacey looked unsure but a little nudge and grin from Lucius helped her make her mind up. She placed the necklace around her neck and stood up. <br />
<br />
&quot;I will do as you ask, and I do hope that I can get your grandson to take this honoruable position seriously. I will reach the Temple grounds and compete in the shaman training. I would like some help though. You wouldn't perhaps be able to point me in the right direction of the Temple Grounds please&quot; she asked him waiting for his response</span></div>
