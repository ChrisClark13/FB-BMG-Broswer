<b>Joshua:</b> Gloom listens to every word you say and nods, ready to take the battle one step further. Michael growls lowly as you issue your commands and the you could almost see the bristles on the back of his neck stand on end, he was psyched for battle. Gloom pulsates the petals on her head once more, releasing a Sweet Scent but Michael remains one step ahead and kicks up a Sand Attack which cancels out the Sweet Scent. Gloom then begins to absorb more nutrients as Michael runs towards her, a black aura engulfing him and he hits her full force for a Pursuit attack, which rips the Ingrain roots from the ground and Gloom is sent flying to the ground. Michael then charges up more dark energy and smashes into her once more, the two hits combined dealing very heavy damage. Gloom struggles to get up, now panting for breath. Michael is doing pretty well, the Super Potion having given him a good boost in health. Gloom remains on the ground, seems she underestimated Michael’s abilities. What will you do?</span></span>

<br />
&quot;Michael, let's put your new ability to the test, and blast Gloom with a burst of Icy Wind! If it's still standing, strike it with another, then finish it with another Pursuit attack!&quot;<br />
<br />
Joshua smiled at his Umbreon, and relaxed slightly, ready to watch Michael strike down Gloom. He smiled at the glistening emeralds that surrounded them, and he smiled at the green glow Michael's beautiful rings and fur took on under their shine.</span></div>

Neptune nodded in affirmative as you issue your commands. Neptune begins to spin very rapidly, picking up leaves and debris as she raises her attack power with a Sword’s Dance. Stopping, she then further boosts her skills by Focusing her Energy, a blue aura engulfs her body as she closes her eyes and raises her awareness and power. Mankey watches this motionless, and doesn’t even see Neptune coming with a full blown boosted Double Edge attack! She smashes into him, dealing heavy damage, which knocks the small pig monkey flying backwards. Neptune then buzzes back to you, and you smile confidently after her assault. Mankey, stunned by the attack, hops back onto his two feet and bounces up and down and then begins to run towards Neptune and delivers a few Fury Swipes to her torso before she manages to buzz away. Mankey begins to get more angry and begins to Focus his own Energy as Neptune waits for further commands. What will you command?</span></span>

</blockquote>Note to Shinjara: My Beedrill is Male.<br />
<span style="color: LimeGreen">Saturn was bored. That battle was taking too much time. His Beedrill needed to finish the battle soon. He turned to the bee.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can´t wait here forever so use String Shot to inmobilize that Mankey. Then, use Poison Sting and finish it with a multiple Fury Cutter. If those attacks don´t work, use Substitute and we run away.&quot;<br />
<br />
Saturn knew that the Substitute was going to confuse the Mankey enough time to escape. That old trick worked with other pokemon in the past, including Mankeys. He hoped for the best when his bug prepared for the attack.</span></div>

The beauty of nature...how overrated it was. It looked great in the books and magazines, and on TV, but in real life, it was a mosquito infested, dirty and all together miserable place.<br />
<br />
In any case....best to stay close to the shore for now,and explore the beach. This island was still mostly uncharted, and it wouldn't do good to get lost so soon after arriving.<br />

Pulling out an apple to nibble on, and slinging his water bottle over his shoulder, he slowly starts to make his way east along the beach.</span></div>

<b>Thibideau:</b> Feeling quite overwhelmed by the scale of the battle, you bravely continue on. Athene begins to glow blue as a blue aura also surrounds Kingler and a wave of confusion hits Kingler’s mind. He jolts back, holding his claws to his head in pain, the Confusion taking its toll on his mind. Feeling confused Kingler, swims about randomly as Athene smacks him with a Vine Whip, sending the crab further back, who is flailing about in confusion. Meanwhile, the Sharpedo are bounding towards Pandora who cooly allows them to approach, charging up a Protect barrier. The Sharpedo bounce off it and fly backwards then begin to approach once again for a lethal Crunch attack.. Pandora retreats into her shell to get ready to use Rapid Spin until you see the Shiny Lanturn appear with other Lanturn and Chinchou. They blast the Sharpedo with Spark and the sharks all fall.. KO’ed. Thankful for the help you call over to Lanturn and he states, “Thankyou for your help so far.. We’ll take care of that human and his Cloyster..You carry on here..” The focus for you is now on Kingler, who is suffering from Confusion. Athene readies herself for a hard battle as you watch the Lanturn swim after Sean and Uksi, trying to attack them. What will you do next?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: aqua">With the Sharpedo now disabled, Aiden could focus soley on Kingler and knocking it down a peg. As the Lanturn and Chinchou swam off to battle Sean and Uksi Aiden smiled and called to them.<br />
<br />
Aiden:&quot;Be careful guys!&quot;<br />
<br />
Not wasting much time he re-focused on Athene's battle with Kingler. Seeing the Lanturn and Chinchou use Spark had given Aiden an idea.<br />
<br />
Aiden:&quot;Alright Athene, you can take this crab. Use <b>Mimic</b> on the Spark attack that the Lanturn used and send a Spark at Kingler. Follow up with <b>Mega drain</b> and use <b>Vine whip</b> to keep it away from us.<br />
<br />
The battle had shrunk a great deal and Aiden could relax if only slightly. He was anxious to get his hands on that punk Sean, and couldn't wait to finish up here and go over to have a chat with him.<br />

<span style="color: SeaGreen"><b>Latias10:</b> After ensuring Surskit’s safety, the small bug looks up at you with hope glimmering in her eyes. Swampert roars loudly, still riddled by confusion and Surskit flinches in your arms. Ledy opens his mouth and charges a Psybeam for a few moments as Swampert begins to slowly make his way out of the swamp. As soon as both his huge feet are on the solid part of the swamp area, Ledy fires off the full charged Psybeam, smacking Swampert in the head for strong damage. Due to the power of the beam, Swampert’s confusion worsens and he feels so confused he drops to the ground, creating a huge thud which causes an Earthquake effect and you are knocked to the ground. Ledy then takes the opportunity and fires close to Swampert and unleashes a Silver Wind right in his back, causing the swamp creature to roar in pain. Seems like Swampert is almost ready to pass out. What will you do?</span>

She check on Surskit to see if the little buggy was alright. She then turned her attion to the battle and watched as Ledy gave the creature pain when he launched his Silver Wind attack. Catherine knew that the Swampert could probably not take much more suffering. All she probably had to do was get Ledy to launch a few more attacks and it would be down. But you never knew what was going to happen next in the Fizzy Bubbles world.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ledy we almost have it beat, so try and finish it off with a Psybeam and then a Silver Wind. If it manages to survive that than launch another Psybeam,&quot; Catherine told her bug.<br />
<br />
Ledian nodded he to knew that this battle would not last much longer and he also knew that his chances of wining were good.</span></div>

<b>Joe:</b> As the huge wave closes in on Plusle, she summons all of her speed and shoots to the left and is only caught by part of the wave. She falls on her side, but recovers and shakes herself dry. Plusle then begins to run in Lotad’s direction, does a graceful flip into the air with her small fist glowing a bright white and slams it into Lotad’s lily pad.. Lotad screams out and then it’s eyes glow a green and so does Plusle’s body. Lotad begins to Absorb some of Plusle’s health and energy back. After about 2 minutes of absorbing, Plusle is dropped to the ground. Lotad then Growls once again, as Plusle shakily stands up and then regains her composure. She shoots off a Thunder Wave which strikes Lotad and paralyzes the little lily pad. Lotad then finishes off by firing a Mist attack to reduce visibility around itself. What will you do?</span>

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Cyan">As Joe watched the battle play out, he wondered if Plusle was up to it, but he soon discarded this thought when Plusle looked back with an angry look on her face. When Lotad was finished with attacking her, she ran back over to Joe, and waited for another set of orders. &quot;Right, start of by using Charge, then quickly follow up with a Spark. That should do some good damage, being powered up and all. Straight after that, use Rain Dance, followed by an almighty Thunder, ok?&quot; he asked, and Plusle nodded. &quot;Oh yeah, and if it tries to attack you, just get out of the way with an Agility,&quot; he continued, and Plusle nodded again. She smiled at Joe, before zooming off, getting ready to attack the Lotad.</span></span></div>

Wooper’s tail then glows a light blue, charging with Ice energy, she then leaps from the water just as Pelipper approaches and smashes into its head with an Ice Punch and then spins around and Slams it into the water! You watch as Pelipper sinks into the water, KO’ed. **Wooper receives 1 Level up** Meanwhile, Slowqueen looks up at the Wingull and uses Fury Ctuter, slashing at their wings further causing them considerable pain, they both cry out in pain as Slowqueen fires off a Confusion which first hits one of the Wingull and instantly knocks it down, KO’ed.. It floats on the surface of the water. The attack then strings on and hit’s the 2nd Wingull, which gets a nasty shock and then flees in the air when it realises its left on its own. You grin triumphantly, the battle finally over. You look ahead and see a huge wooden raft floating in the middle of the ocean with a group of people cheering at you. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
&quot;Zora are winnor.&quot; he announced to his new audience, Slowqueen muttering under he breath, well not technically her breath as her telepathic communication was not tied to her respiratory systems, it's just a figure of speech which Zora is probably overanalysing, disgraced, but not atall surprised by her trainer's ego. In contrast, Wooper had no such problems, leaping excitedly onto Zora's head, plunging him underwater for a few seconds until she realised she was the only one with gills. Charmed, rather than angered by the amphibian's affection, he gave her a quick hug, before swiming towards the raft. &quot;So, erm, why exactly are you floating around here? I know I made great watching, but you wouldn't of known to come without an invitation.&quot;</div>

It was a beautiful and yet strange world, which was to Jon's liking, a very similar description to his own, the self declared beautiful and strange. He looked around the vast scape of the beach, and quickly made up his mind that this would be were he would start his journey!<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Kristen ITC'">&quot;There's no place like a beach to start an adventure!&quot;</span> Jon exclaimed. <span style="font-family: 'Kristen ITC'">&quot;Besides, this gives me the perfect chance to lazy about the seaside too!&quot;</span> he finished.<br />
<br />
Jon was never one to be taken to seriously, but he always managed to make something fun out of the present situation. He continued on... to... nowhere in particular, frolicing around the beachside.<br />

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: SeaGreen">His Shiftry burst forward instantly, infuriated by the turquoise crocodile now and eager to prove himself. He held his arms high above his head as a crackling green aura started to surround his body, then roared and unleashed the mystic natural power towards the Totodile who stood transfixed. At first nothing happened, but Sasuke felt the ground beneath him begin to rumble, and the swamp waters started to rise. Augmenting into a huge pillar, the muddy water surged towards the crocodile pokemon, the spiralling column of water engulfing her and spinning her about helplessly. <i>”Saru that’s enough!”</i> shouted Sasuke, sensing the anger in the attack, and feeling a twinge of mercy for the Totodile. His Shiftry shrugged and suddenly the wave crashed to the floor, dropping the Totodile from a great height onto her back, where she lay in the mud. Sasuke took a Premier Ball from his waist and stepped forward, ready to make the capture, but suddenly the crocodile pokemon stood back up, panting heavily but ready to battle on. <i>She really is strong,</i> Sasuke thought to himself, admiring her courage and strength. Though some might call it stupidity, she wasn’t going to give in if she could help it, and stepped forward to attack. Saru sneered and glared at the Totodile as his eyes started to glow white, the intensity grew and soon the light was blinding her, as she frantically fired off a few Water Gun attacks which missed their target by a long way. Feeling pity on her Saru launched himself forward, and cut the Totodile across the torso as he rushed past. She gasped as a splash of blood burst from the wound, splattering the ground red before she fell forward onto it, knocked out cold. <br />
Ino covered her eyes with her ears and started to tremble, and Sasuke stepped forward slowly. He held up the Premier Ball which was already in his hand towards the fainted pokemon and opened it, and with a flash of red drew her inside. It struggled violently in his hand as he stood there with his arm outheld, but after about thirty seconds began to subside. With literally no energy left to resist, Totodile succumbed, and the pokeball stopped moving. He respectfully clipped it to his belt and smiled, but Ino whimpered from on his shoulder. <br />
Sasuke stepped towards Saru who was stood with his eyes closed, panting for breath after the victory, but just then the skies ominously began to turn grey. At first a few specks of rain began to fall, but then the heavens opened and a torrent of water began to pour onto the swamp, which was already difficult to navigate. Sasuke cursed his luck and withdrew his Shiftry, thanking him for winning the battle as he did so, then cradled Ino in his arms. She lifted her ears as a makeshift umbrella to block the rain, as Sasuke began to run towards cover. He hadn’t got very far though when a huge wave rose up infront of him, blocking his path. He turned to the side but it happened again, and he gulped, having no idea what was keeping him trapped. The entire swamp waters, which were rising rapidly due to the rain, began to churn once more. <br />
Hearing a noise he span round to see two huge scythes lunge out of the swamp and impale themselves into the bank of the swamp. With a roar a shadowy creature pulled itself out of the murky waters. Sasuke struggled to see what exactly it was, he desperately tried to wipe some water from his eyes and make out the figure but it was no use. The creature tore it’s scythes from out of the mud and crossed them above him in the air, then roared to the skies. Ino was shaking terribly and Sasuke took a step backwards, but the creature moved towards him. As it got closer he could make out the features more clearly. A flat, wide, brown head, long bony legs, a hard armoured body and the beady eyes of a long-thought to be extinct pokemon – Kabutops. Sasuke gasped and began to backpeddle more urgently but the creature began to murmur. At first Sasuke could only hear random noises but in his head they began to untangle, forming words he could clearly understand. <br />
<div style="text-align: center"><i>’The flow of peace has been disturbed .. new successor will be me .. for capturing her .. your punishment will be death.’</i>&#8203;</div>Sasuke barely had time to comprehend what was happening before the fossil pokemon crouched down then sprang majestically through the air, landing with a thud only feet infront of him. From such a short distance Sasuke could see every minute detail of this ferocious pokemon. It’s scythes looked razor sharp and it’s hard armoured body looked impenetrable. Struggling to think what to do a pokeball at his belt began to tremble. Looking down it was a white Premier Ball, but not that of his newly captured Totodile. The ball sprang open of its own accord and stood in the pouring rain before him was his Mankey. <i>”What are you doing?”</i> Sasuke asked in shock, <i>”this is no time to be macho.”</i> His pokemon turned around and looked him in the eye, then nodded determinedly and faced Kabutops, who seemed amused by the display of foolishness and flashed his scythes menacingly. <br />
Suddenly Sasuke gasped as his Mankey began to glow a fierce white. Against the murky swamp the light was almost blinding and Kabutops shielded his eyes as the radiance grew even stronger still. As it faded Sasuke turned back to where his Mankey had stood, to see a rabid Primeape in his place. He smiled and looked at his old friend who turned to him and nodded again, Sasuke nodded back resolutely, <i>”OK Enma,”</i> he said, <i>”let’s do this.”</i> His Primeape pounded his two huge fists together and faced Kabutops, who seemed more intrigued by the challenge now, and stepped forward to battle. Enma was snorting heavily and twitching from side to side, eager to fight against this worthy opponent. <i>”NOW focus your energy and attack with fury swipes,”</i> Sasuke shouted through the rain, <i>”If he comes at you with those scythes give him a low kick.”</i> His Primeape snarled and beat his chest as Sasuke watched with interest, while the rain continued to pour down around them and the two pokemon went to battle.</span></div>

<b>ForeverFlygon &amp; DarkMagic:</b> You both voice your commands as the two Ice Beams come towards you, Feera commands Free to evade and he only manages to dodge half of the beam, and is smacked in the side for heavy damage, whereas Aexlus’ Salamence does the same and only barely manages to avoid the Ice Beam from Feraligatr. Looks like the two Water titans have chosen their opponents. Feera’s choice to withdraw from the battle isn’t too wise as Blastoise looks up at Free and licks its lips, extending its cannons and charging a Hydro Pump.. Aexlus then releases two more pokemon to attack with; Marshtomp and Flaafy. They land in the water, with Flaafy trying to balance on Marshtomp. Marshtomp then begins to fire off Water Guns on the 3 pokemon and Flaafy then sends some powerful ThunderShock in amongst them to cause some good damage.. To your surprise however, Sharpedo is the only one to feel the damage, roaring out in pain and then fleeing underwater, leaving you to deal with Blastoise and Feraligatr who didn’t seem to be affected much by the attacks.. Marshtomp and Flaafy look up at Aexlus helplessly as they flee to a safe distance until they receive more commands. Feraligatr looks up and licks his lips at the sight of Salamence.. He then roars loudly, and you both feel the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. Blastoise then fires a high pressure Hydro Pump at Free, which smacks him in the stomach for good damage. Feraligatr then decides to add insult to injury by releasing an ear splitting Screech attack. You both cover your ears, but find your dragon pokemon to be descending, out of their control. You both panic as you loom closer to the titans as Blastoise looks at Feera and Free and then begins to charge another Hyper Beam. Feraligatr meanwhile, focuses on Flaafy and Marshtomp rushing towards them with his huge jaws wide open for a Crunch. What will you both do?<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: aqua"> Watching the events unfold I knew there was trouble as very strong pokemon had come to the aid of the evil shark. To my horror my plan had no real effect on them as I saw only the finned pokemon flee from the pain. What was worse was that FF was in even more of a terrible situation than before. Focusing back onto the battle I grabbed my head from the ear splitting Screech that pierced the ocean. I held onto Salamence holding for dear life and needed to thinkof something quickly. FF was going to focus on Blastoise while I had to deal with Feraligatr. That seemed quite well especially since the huge croc was trying to eat my pokemon. I smiled as I knew my pokemon were worth much more than fish food.<br />
<br />
&quot;Marshtomp and Flaaffy listen and do it quick! Fire a Mud Shot and Cotton Spore right into that unsuspecting croc's mouth. Let's see how he likes that taste in his mouth! Salamence get a hold of yourself! I reassured my dragon pokemon to focus and whispered to do something daring. Salamence fire a Dragon Breath right at the back of Feraligatr so it will turn its direction back at you. With this distraction I want you to follow it up with a Tri Attack!&quot;<br />
<br />
The plan began to take shape in my mind as I became more excited. My hat almost fell off from my excitement. My eyes gleamed like fire as my eyes met that of FF's. I smiled and began to issue my final commands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Marshtomp and Flaafy focus again and this time let's go for something different! Marshtomp I would be thinking Feraligatr has a bad taste in its mouth and is thoroughly distracted by Salamence so I want you to get as close as possible. Flaaffy jump off Marshtomp's back and hit Feraligatr with a Rock Smash. As this happens Marshtomp hit the croc with an Ice Punch. I want Flaaffy to climb back onto Marshtomp's back and then swim towards our direction making sure that Salamence is in front of you and Feraligatr.&quot;<br />
<br />
I then realized it wouldn't be enough. I enlarged another red and white pokeball and threw it towards FF's direction. Go Sp00ninator! My Alakazam appeared behind FF and with its silver spoons twirling I gave her the commands necessary to complete FF's orders. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sp00ninator use a Reflect to stop that Hyper Beam! I want you to hit that giant turtle with a Psybeam for good measure!&quot;<br />
<br />
As I finished my orders I hoped that we would be able to hurt these water titans more than that measly shrugging off of that electrical surge. Never before had I been in such a battle involving so many strong pokemon. Never had I fought in such a desperate situation like this. Never had those two water titans met such a determined duo as Aexlus and FF. With that thought my eyes lit up again as I smiled and watched my pokemon spring into action in a battle that would forever be seared in our minds and one that I was determined in telling everyone else. Because I, FF and our pokemon were going to live through this tale no matter what fate would throw at us. </span></div>

Deciding that Feera takes on Blastoise while Aexlus takes on Feraligatr, you both discuss what you’re going to do and issue attacks. Feraligatr who is bounding through the water at high speed, with his almighty fangs exposed, is met with a nasty combination of a Mud Shot and Cotton Spore right in the mouth. Feraligatr stops and begin to spit and choke on the attacks as Salamence levitates over the top of Feraligatr’s head and fires a greeny blue flame at him, causing good damage and stunning him. Feraligatr then stares right up at Salamence and roars loudly. As Salamence fires off a Tri Attack at Feraligatr, it is met with a Hydro Pump which pushes the attack back up at Salamence and knocks him back, and Aexlus only just manages to keep his balance. Aexlus then releases Alakazam, who appears behind Feera, twirling her spoons, setting up a Reflect barrier to block the Hyper Beam. Blastoise fires off the beam and Reflect only just manages to keep it held back. Feera then releases Nookie, as Nookie appears from the ball, shiny stars surround him as he nods at the commands he is given. Flying in front of Blastoise, his eyes glow a white as hypnotic waves are released. Blastoise looks at Nookie and laughs out loud as he smashes into the Owl with an Ice punch, sending him flying backwards, plummeting towards the sea. Free then blasts Feraligatr with a Dragonbreath followed with a Hidden Power laced with the Fire Element. The attacks hit their mark, but don’t seem to damage Feraligatr much, who is concentrating on attacking Marshtomp and Flaaffy.<br />
<br />
As Flaaffy jumps off of Marshtomps back, she lands on Feraligatr and hits him with a Rock Smash, Feraligatr receives only light damage from this and hardly feels the Ice Punch that Marshtomp just delivered. Blastoise then looks to Feraligatr and nods. The two water titans then roar loudly in unison and Blastoise opens the turrets in his shell and fires off a powerful Hydro Cannon towards Free and Feera and then Feraligatr swings his mighty tail and knocks Flaaffy and Marshtomp flying away and then turns to Salamence and growls, glowing brown and then sending an Ancient Power attack at them. <br />

<b>ZoraJolteon:</b> The group of people all look at you and cheer again, and you naturally revel in the attention. One of them steps forward, he looks about 60 years of age and is wearing quite ragged clothes. He looks at you and then says, “Are you for real? We haven’t seen anyone in months.. We’ve been stranded on an island for a long time, and we’ve only just built this raft to find civilisation.” He then looks at the poke balls on your belt. “Oh, you’re a trainer huh? We came into trouble with those Pelipper and Wingull.. They attacked our raft and you distracted them, we thank you for defeating them..” The old man then looks to the group of 5 people behind him and sighs, “We were all trainers in a tournament on the nearby island of Ruby Island; the sister island of Sapphire Island, but one day, there was an eruption and all hell broke loose, literally. Lava covered the island and everything was destroyed, thousands were killed. We have no idea how we survived, but we did and that’s all that matters. We just want to find a place to live, can you please tell us, are we near Sapphire Island? And would you consider being a bodyguard for us?” The old man looks at you and raises an eyebrow as you ponder the situation. The group of 5 behind him look at you, and you notice a radio next to one of the people.. What will you say? <br />

<b>Thibideau:</b> Anxious to get some information from Sean, you command Athene who nods and glows White as knowledge of a new technique enters her brain, she then crackles with electricity and you can see a wicked grin reflected in her eyes as she fires off a Spark, which is intensified by the water and it strikes Kingler, causing some heavy damage to the crab. Crackling with the leftover particles of electricity, Kingler’s movements have been restricted. Athene then glows a green as Mega Drain saps energy from Kingler, who is beginning to weaken, his health and energy now fuelling Athene further. Kingler then slowly moves further away from you, and Hardens himself to raise his defense and then opens his larger claw and releases a black Haze into the ocean, shrouding his whereabouts. Athene, puzzled by Kingler’s choice in attacks, sends a Vine Whip into the shroud to attempt to pull Kingler back, but she fails and looks at you, with a puzzled look in her eyes. Kingler remains in the shroud, what will you do?<br />

Gyarados flails around, his sight only barely recovering. Each roar that the giant serpent makes sends shivers down your spine. Shuri listens intently and begins to carry out her assault. As Gyarados shakes his head about, he begins to charge a Hydro Pump in his mouth, Shuri, aware of this, darts from side to side so she is out of range. As Gyarados releases the attack, it shoots past you and hit’s a tree, knocking it down with the sheer pressure of the attack. You gulp, realising how strong Gyarados is. Shuri then appears behind Gyarados and flaps her wings at a high speed creating an Icy Wind which hits Gyarados, who roars in pain as his scales are left coated with an icy glaze. Turning around, Gyarados is met with another Flash attack, but it doesn’t blind him too much as his eyes are pressed shut. He then swings his tail around and smacks it into Shuri, who falls to the ground and Gyarados towers over her. Panicking, Shuri recovers and gets back into the air, and fires a Silver Wind into Gyarados face, knocking the serpent back, she then glows a bright white as her stats are all boosted a tad. Gyarados’ sight then returns as he roars loudly, stunning Shuri as he whips up a Twister which scoops Shuri up and spins her around, leaving her very very dizzy. What will you do?<br />
<br />
<b>Joe:</b> Plusle nods as you issue your commands and she runs towards Lotad, who is glaring at her. A bright yellow orb of electrical energy surrounds Plusles small body as she Charges herself full of electrical power. Meanwhile, Lotad begins to wiggle his small body as a small seed emerges from his lily pad. When Plusles Charge diminishes, Lotad sends the Seed flying towards Plusle, and it lands on her tail, and vines slowly being to emerge from within it. You wonder why it isn’t doing it straight away but diminish the thought from your mind as Plusle sends a powered up Spark attack towards Lotad, striking him for good damage. Lotad is sending flying back as the Leech Seed on Plusle’s tail opens further, the vines now covering her tail completely. Lotad stands up and grins as Plusle begins to spin and dance around, summoning the Rain to fall from the sky. When she stops, she begins to charge a Thunder, huge surges of electricity crackle on her body as the rain causes its power to be increased. Lotad stands still and watches, as he glows a bright red. Plusle then fires off the Thunder attack, which shoots into the sky and then crashes down on the small pokemon, engulfing him. You grin confidently, adamant that the pokemon wouldn’t be able to survive such an attack. But then everything clears, Lotad is staring right at you, the Endure attack had saved him from fainting. Lotad then glows green as the vines extract health from Plusle through her tail and restore some of his health back. Plusle looks at her tail and frowns, frustrated, unable to get free of them. Again, you find yourself pondering why the attack is acting like this. What will you do?<br />

<b>Ythrelancus:</b> Releasing Hemy into her first battle, you give her the commands. She looks at you, with a puzzled expression on her face as you talk about your ‘next move’. Regardless, she begins to concentrate on using a Powder Snow if she needed to. You take the Lure Ball out of your pocket and throw it at the Remoraid, unfortunately Remoraid flicks the ball back at you with his tail and the ball smacks you in the chest. Hemy then moves forwards and opens her mouth, blasting the small fish with a Powder Snow, as it collides with the Remoraid, it flops around and then stops. Stepping forward to look, you are taken by surprise as a surprise Water Gun smacks Hemy in the torso and sends her rolling back. Seems Remoraid has a bit of fight left in him. What will you do?<br />

<br />
<b>Joshua:</b> Feeling confidence flush over you, you give Michael possibly the final commands for this testing battle. As Gloom manages to get on her feet, Michaels nostrils emit a freezing cold vapour as he charges up an Icy Wind. He darts off towards Gloom, who weakly cries out as a harsh gust of Icy Wind is unleashed upon her, her movements are limited as icicles hang off of her. Releasing a Sweet Scent to try and slow Michael down so they are on an equal footing, Michael keeps low to the ground as the pink cloud lingers above him. Gloom pants heavily as another Icy Wind strikes her and she falls KO’ed .. **Level up for Michael** <br />
<br />
The other Gloom and Oddish look at each other, whispering different things whilst Michael stands triumphant, although tired.. The sun shines through the trees and lights his form, making him look quite majestic. You wonder why the sky lighted up so brightly until a Bellossom comes through the crowds, a smile on her face, and her skirt adorned with lots of emeralds. She approaches you and speaks, “Human, you have proved your worth, please take these emeralds as proof that you have been accepted by us, the Bellossom clan of this forest. You may proceed on further into our safe sanctuary, but be wary, not all is safe.” A worried look now covers the small Grass Pokemon’s face. “The Poison side of our family has gotten out of control..“ motioning over to a darker side of the forest, she then begins to explain, “We used to be one large clan, until we began to have arguments, some of the Vileplume that had evolved formed a rival group and began to resent those in our clan, who wanted to become Bellossoms.. They then moved into another part of the forest and completely separated themselves from us. We want to make peace, but they are very hostile, so we try to live as peacefully as we can between the fight they initiate.” The Oddish that followed you before looks up at you and nods. Bellossom then says, “Oh I’m sorry, I’ve kept you far too long, please feel free to explore the forest as you wish. This Oddish here tells me she‘d like to join you on your exploration if you wish to go” What will you do? (You are free to capture Oddish, if you wish) <br />
<br />
<b>Dark Scizor:</b> Saturn buzzes happily as you issue your next commands. Nodding, he takes to the air and looks down at Mankey who is bouncing up and down angrily. He then fires a fine String Shot at Mankey and it collides with his legs, tieing them together and subsequently knocks the Pig Monkey to the ground. Landing with a thud, Mankey’s temper begins to flare up as he rolls around angrily, trying to break free. Neptune’s two huge stingers glow a bright white as hundreds of needles are unleashed on Mankey, each one piercing his skin and releasing a small amount of Poison. Mankey, now weakened, writhes around in pain as he scratches at the String Shot and frees himself. As Mankey weakly stands, he glows white as he focus his energy as Neptune approaches for a hard hitting Fury Cutter attack. As Neptune reaches out to cut Mankey, he lashes out with a Karate Chop and knocks him back. He then lashes out at Neptune, hitting him once more, before landing on the ground, signalling the beginning of a Rage attack. Seems Mankey still has quite a bit of energy left. What will you do next? <br />

<br />
<b>Sasuke-san:</b> Enma’s new form stood proud in front of Kabutops, the rain dripping from his fur as a blue aura surrounds his body, closing his eyes and Focusing all his Energy. After honing his energy, he stands silent, the occasional twitch being his only movement. Kabutops eyes Enma wearily, and then lifts his scythes, signalling the beginning of the fight. Enma rushes towards Kabutops and leaps up to his torso and begins to furiously swipe at the fossil pokemon. Kabutops is barely affected by this and merely Hardens his body to reduce the damage. Swinging one of his almighty scythes he collides it with Enma who is sent flying backwards and is knocked into you, knocking you off your feet. You land on your back with a thud as Kabutops roars loudly. Sitting up you look at the colossal beast as he looks at you, a sadistic look in his eyes.. Enma looks at you, and you could almost see a tinge of worry reflected in his eyes. Kabutops then steps forward and begins to speak again, “You call that an attack? One swipe of my scythe and your Pig Monkey has fallen. Care to try again, human? An ancient creature such as myself will not succumb to mere swipes..” Groaning, you sit up and look at Enma who is sat next to you, looking quite downhearted. Kabutops roars yet again as the Swamp waters begin to overflow over the bank due to the heavy rain flow. What will you do?<br />
<br />
<b>Manji:</b> Bandit looks at Poliwag and grins, ready to further test his new abilities. Poliwag gasps, as the Poison begins to take effect. Bandit takes the opportunity to further the damage and fires off more Poison Stings which embed themselves in Poliwags skin. Poliwag begins to panick and then fires a Water Gun towards Bandit, who merely stands there and doesn’t move. The jet of water hits him in the torso but he doesn’t seem to mind. Poliwag frowns as Bandit jumps into the air and then bursts into the ground, his long claws serving him well. After a few moments, Bandit bursts from the ground, claws first and cuts Poliwag who screams in pain and drops to the ground, KO’ed. **Level up for Bandit** Bandit lands a few feet away and pants a little. You look at the Poliwag, who is badly damaged with a giant cut across his torso. The swamp bubbles away as unusually, the sun comes out, but its not a pleasant warmth, its really really hot. Bandit doesn’t seem to mind, but you certainly do, tugging at the collar of your shirt. You look about and notice that not too far away, there is an orange beam shooting up into the sky. What will you do?<br />
<br />
<b>Latias10:</b> Ledy, who is visibly getting quite exhausted from the battle, approaches Swampert, who weakly stands and stares Ledy right in the eyes. Ledy, intimidated by this, flies back slightly as Swampert roars loudly, trying to dishearten him from continuing his assault. Shouting words of encouragement, Ledy summons the courage and opens his mouth and charges the biggest Psybeam he can muster, releasing it upon Swampert, it hit’s the Swampert right in between the eyes. The psychic energy is absorbed in Swampert’s brain and confuses him even more. Stumbling about, Swampert tries a last attack to finish Ledy off; A Mud Shot, which strikes Ledy in the chest, causing a lot of discomfort and pain to him. Summoming every last part of his energy, Ledy fires off a Silver Wind which strikes Swampert and due to lack of energy and health, Swampert drops to the wet swamp ground, KO’ed. **Level up for Ledy** <br />
<br />
Unusually, the swamp waters rise and engulf Swampert, and drag the huge beast back into its depths. After congratulating Ledy you turn your attention to the Surskit in your arms. She looks up at you, and weakly smiles.. Then a light blue aura surrounds her as the swamp waters begin to rise at the bank, the water lifts in to the air in a huge block and Surskit shouts out, “KIT!” and the water separates into pillars and snakes off in to the distance. Walking to the bank, you notice a set of steps that snake downwards, however you cannot see what is down there. You look at Surskit who smiles and psychically sends a message to your mind, “I’ll see you later.. Congratulations..” She then disappears. What will you do?<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: Cyan">Gary smiled, quite pleased with the results of the battle. &quot;Keep up the good work, Shuri! Take a minute to sake off the dizzyness, you're doing great! When you feel ready enough to battle, start off with a Swords Dance and Harden! Then use a Screech as you fly in for a Fury Cutter! But as you attack, hit it, and then immediately fly to a safe distance before attacking again! I know these are a lot of commands, but I know you can do it!&quot; Gary turned for a minute to the sleeping psyduck. &quot;Don't worry, little guy, you'll be rid of this monster soon enough.&quot; he whispered to him before turning back to the battle. He hoped that Shuri wouldn't get too cocky, or else a Hydro Pump or Hyper Beam could be the end.</span></div>

He started to think about how he could actually beat the Lotad, and it suddenly came to him. Speed. Plusle was much faster than the Lotad, and she could probably use that to her advantage. &quot;Plusle, start off by rushing towards Lotad, and hitting it with Quick Attack! Straight afterwards, use a quick Spark, and then follow up with another Quick Attack!&quot; Joe ordered, and Plusle nodded, with an evil looking smile on her face. Joe stared at her as the evil look came over her face, and it slightly unnerved him. &quot;Erm...and try not to bite any of it's limbs off!&quot; he added.</span></span></div>

Ledian then waits for the perfect opportunity to use Supersonic. Whiscash’s eyes then begin to glow a purple and a wind is summoned, but then subsides after only a few minutes. Ledian looks around confused and then Whiscash smiles dopily and charges it’s body with electricity and leaps out of water and hits Ledian with a Spark attack. Using Ledian as a rebound, the fish then elegantly lands back in the swamp where it holds the advantage. Ledian tries to shake off the damage but finds herself slightly paralysed. What will you do?</span></span>

<span style="color: DarkOliveGreen">Knowing that this battle was going to be very long if we didn't get this Wishcash out of the water, or fainted. Frustrated by this, Matt looked through Scarlet's move pool, and pondered on her best attack for this battle. 'Swift would probably be the best choice, seeing as it never fails, and a Reflect would help stop some of the attacks this thing would throw at us'. Scarlet panted a little, but kept fluttering there, awaiting her next attack orders. &quot;Bah! Lets start off with a Swift attack. Then set up a Safegaurd around yourself if it sends any attacks your way. If you can, use one of your powerful Dragonbreath attacks!&quot; Scarlet nodded, then fluttered off. Matt stepped back, as this could get a bit messy.</span></span></div>

Nodding, he takes to the air and looks down at Mankey who is bouncing up and down angrily. He then fires a fine String Shot at Mankey and it collides with his legs, tieing them together and subsequently knocks the Pig Monkey to the ground. Landing with a thud, Mankey’s temper begins to flare up as he rolls around angrily, trying to break free. Neptune’s two huge stingers glow a bright white as hundreds of needles are unleashed on Mankey, each one piercing his skin and releasing a small amount of Poison. Mankey, now weakened, writhes around in pain as he scratches at the String Shot and frees himself. As Mankey weakly stands, he glows white as he focus his energy as Neptune approaches for a hard hitting Fury Cutter attack. As Neptune reaches out to cut Mankey, he lashes out with a Karate Chop and knocks him back. He then lashes out at Neptune, hitting him once more, before landing on the ground, signalling the beginning of a Rage attack. Seems Mankey still has quite a bit of energy left. What will you do next?</span></span>

After returning his poison bee Pokémon back to his ball, he took a ball from his backpack and released his bug/steel Pokémon. He turned to the red bug to give him orders.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you to use Wing Attack, the move that you re-learned from the Move Tutor, followed by Metal Claw and Silver Wind. If that Mankey want to fight after those hits, use False Swipe and finish it with Quick Attack.&quot;<br />

She looks at Jiroubi curiously, almost laughing at the prospect of battling him. If she could talk, she’d be insulting him. Whilst shes distracted, you throw the poke ball which hit’s the small Nidoran (F), sucking her within the poke ball. It wobbles a bit then pings, signifying a capture. *Congratulations, you have captured a Level 6 Nidoran (F)!* Jiroubi nods and then reactivates the Berserk Gene, any shred of morality in him disappears as his body fills with overwhelming power once more, holding his head, his eyes turn a blood red and he roars out loud. Looking at the Nidoqueen, a single trail of drool falls from his mouth in anticipation as he runs towards her and slams into her bulky body, using all his strength, Nidoqueen is knocked back but grabs Jiroubi by the foot and then glows white as she uses SuperPower and slams him into the ground using every ounce of her strength. Jiro lays on the ground stunned, but the Berserk Gene causes him to battle on. He stands, his leg heavily damaged by Nidoqueen’s grip. Filled with rage, he goes in and unleashes some Fury Swipes on Nidoqueen’s torso, ripping open some of her natural armour. She roars loudly and then fires some Poison Stings at Jiroubi, the lethal needles embedding themselves into his injured leg. Flinching even more on the inside Jiroubi feels the need to continue on, the Berserk Gene’s influence on him taking away all his sense of pain and rational thinking. He then runs towards Nidoqueen to Slash her, but collapses on the way, the damage to his leg stopping him from moving. Nidoqueen stomps over to Jiroubi and looks down at him and gets ready to Body Slam him. What will you do?</span></span>

&quot;Damn it!&quot; roared James as he watched his teddiursa get slammed onto the hard jungle floor, only to be closed followed by the powerful nidoqueen. &quot;Jiroubi, get out of there!&quot; The bear looked up angrily before roaring at the sky in pain and glaring at James, menace clear in his eyes... <br />
<br />
&quot;Return!&quot; screamed the trainer, raising a pokeball into the air, which lit up in red light before a small beam of energy hit his teddiursa, who let out a hasty snarl before being absorbed back into his ball. His trainer let out a sigh of relief before bringing the pokeball to eye-level and staring in shock.<br />
<br />
<i>Just how dangerous is that Berserk Gene...?</i><br />
<br />
Shaking his head, James unclipped a second ball from his belt and threw it as high into the air as he could, before it erupted in white light. A thirty foot steel snake ripped its way into existance, blood red eyes snapping open, and a body of hardened metal boulders with cuts and scratches all over them stood mighty and proud, with spikes sticking from seemingly random places along it's frame. A large head with an enormous jaw stared from the top of steel-type, crimson eyes narrowed, while the tail of the beast whipped out as it landed on the ground, ripping up nearby trees.<br />
<br />
Despite the ferocious appearance of the pokemon, James smiled gratefully. &quot;Necross...&quot;<br />
<br />
The steelix bowed its large head to his trainer, before slithering around to face the opposing nidoqueen. Calm eyes never leaving the enraged poison type, he spoke softly to his trainer, &quot;What is it you ask of me?&quot;<br />
<br />
James couldn't help but be awed by his pokemon's calm presence, but stuck to the point - they didn't have time to waste.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Matrise's mother... you know what's happened so far in this area, the little girl must of told you...&quot; James looked away, feeling slightly ashamed, &quot;This nidoqueen's powerful. She took out Jiroubi, with the Berserk Gene active - you know what that means.&quot;<br />
<br />
The steelix nodded his in acknowledgement of both Jiroubi's and the nidoqueen's strength. &quot;I see only the path with the least bloodshed... but if she is not to be reasoned with...&quot; The steelix's body unwound, and his head looked through the gaps in the top of the rainforest, bathing in the light from the sky above, &quot;Then I will fight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Necross looked suddenly back at the nidoqueen and let out a tremendous roar which shook his trainer to the core. Through the noise, James screamed out, &quot;RAGE AND ROLLOUT!&quot;</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: cyan">ZoraJolteon: The group of people all look at you and cheer again, and you naturally revel in the attention. One of them steps forward, he looks about 60 years of age and is wearing quite ragged clothes. He looks at you and then says, “Are you for real? We haven’t seen anyone in months.. We’ve been stranded on an island for a long time, and we’ve only just built this raft to find civilisation.” He then looks at the poke balls on your belt. “Oh, you’re a trainer huh? We came into trouble with those Pelipper and Wingull.. They attacked our raft and you distracted them, we thank you for defeating them..” The old man then looks to the group of 5 people behind him and sighs, “We were all trainers in a tournament on the nearby island of Ruby Island; the sister island of Sapphire Island, but one day, there was an eruption and all hell broke loose, literally. Lava covered the island and everything was destroyed, thousands were killed. We have no idea how we survived, but we did and that’s all that matters. We just want to find a place to live, can you please tell us, are we near Sapphire Island? And would you consider being a bodyguard for us?” The old man looks at you and raises an eyebrow as you ponder the situation. The group of 5 behind him look at you, and you notice a radio next to one of the people.. What will you say?</span><br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm. Why do I get the feeling this is going to end with you trying to eat me or something? Meh, I'm so fantabulous that I'll be able to pull a win from somewhere anyways. Very well. Lord Zora IV at your service.&quot; Grabbing two Great Balls from his belt, he tossed them at Wooper and the still disgruntled Slowqueen, returning them in flashes of deep blue light. Grabbing a different ball, he tossed this one into the air, where it eruped, this time in a burst of green.<br />
&quot;Roooo!&quot; his compainion cooed, the flapping of his leafy wings stirring up a small wake.<br />
&quot;Right Tropius&quot; Zora announced, &quot;We need some sort of towing monkey or tree dinosaur, as the case may be.&quot; Rummaging in his pack for a conveniently located length of rope, he proceeded to tie it to both the raft and his Pokémon's hind legs. Tropius began to flap harder, the rope taking the strain, as Zora pointed in the direction of what he hoped was land. &quot;Tally Ho!&quot; he called out, awaiting a hopefully prosperous journey.</div>

<b>Joshua:</b> Feeling confidence flush over you, you give Michael possibly the final commands for this testing battle. As Gloom manages to get on her feet, Michaels nostrils emit a freezing cold vapour as he charges up an Icy Wind. He darts off towards Gloom, who weakly cries out as a harsh gust of Icy Wind is unleashed upon her, her movements are limited as icicles hang off of her. Releasing a Sweet Scent to try and slow Michael down so they are on an equal footing, Michael keeps low to the ground as the pink cloud lingers above him. Gloom pants heavily as another Icy Wind strikes her and she falls KO’ed .. **Level up for Michael** <br />
<br />
The other Gloom and Oddish look at each other, whispering different things whilst Michael stands triumphant, although tired.. The sun shines through the trees and lights his form, making him look quite majestic. You wonder why the sky lighted up so brightly until a Bellossom comes through the crowds, a smile on her face, and her skirt adorned with lots of emeralds. She approaches you and speaks, “Human, you have proved your worth, please take these emeralds as proof that you have been accepted by us, the Bellossom clan of this forest. You may proceed on further into our safe sanctuary, but be wary, not all is safe.” A worried look now covers the small Grass Pokemon’s face. “The Poison side of our family has gotten out of control..“ motioning over to a darker side of the forest, she then begins to explain, “We used to be one large clan, until we began to have arguments, some of the Vileplume that had evolved formed a rival group and began to resent those in our clan, who wanted to become Bellossoms.. They then moved into another part of the forest and completely separated themselves from us. We want to make peace, but they are very hostile, so we try to live as peacefully as we can between the fight they initiate.” The Oddish that followed you before looks up at you and nods. Bellossom then says, “Oh I’m sorry, I’ve kept you far too long, please feel free to explore the forest as you wish. This Oddish here tells me she‘d like to join you on your exploration if you wish to go” What will you do? (You are free to capture Oddish, if you wish)<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: LimeGreen">Joshua smiles as Michael manages to defeat the Gloom, and listens intently to the Bellossom. His heart twinges at their plight, and with a flash of red, an emerald green dragon floats beside him, Hayley the Flygon ready to help.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bellossom, Gloom, Oddish. I thank you for your hospitality.&quot; He kneels down beside the little Oddish, and sweeps her up in his arms. &quot;And although I'd love to take this little one with me, I feel the need to help you and your clan in your hour of need.<br />
<br />
Bellossom, if you and this little Oddish will accompany me to the territory of the Vileplume, I can help negotiate an end to your war. You have no reason to fear them whilst I am with you...&quot; And to prove Joshua's words, Hayley threw her head back, and unleased a stream of fire at the sky.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you allow me to help you?&quot; Joshua asks the Bellossom.</span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px">Okay so here are another set of updates. Apologies for the lateness, been held up. Loki is currently having computer issues and will be back soon with updates. I would like all inactive updatees of mine to post stating whether or not they will be continuing their adventures, so I can find out for definete how many people I'm updating and whether or not I can take new people who are waiting to enter the zone. People who are currently participating in battle 3 attacks is ideal in a one-on-one, but the maximum is 5, don't wanna confuse me now <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite7" alt=":p" title="Stick Out Tongue    :p" data-shortname=":p" /> Enjoy. <br />

<span style="color: MediumTurquoise"><b>Turquoise River: Please reply in<u> MediumTurquoise</u></b><br />

<b>Ythrelancus:</b> Releasing Hemy into her first battle, you give her the commands. She looks at you, with a puzzled expression on her face as you talk about your ‘next move’. Regardless, she begins to concentrate on using a Powder Snow if she needed to. You take the Lure Ball out of your pocket and throw it at the Remoraid, unfortunately Remoraid flicks the ball back at you with his tail and the ball smacks you in the chest. Hemy then moves forwards and opens her mouth, blasting the small fish with a Powder Snow, as it collides with the Remoraid, it flops around and then stops. Stepping forward to look, you are taken by surprise as a surprise Water Gun smacks Hemy in the torso and sends her rolling back. Seems Remoraid has a bit of fight left in him. What will you do?<br />

<br />
<span style="color: mediumturquoise">&quot;Grr,&quot; it seems that Centin is having a much of a problem dealing with this remoraid, one that started off as a peaceful journey on the turquoise river, now raging into an intense battle of two sides. &quot;Return, Hemy,&quot; and his spheal was returned to its pokeball. &quot;Good job Hemy, now you should rest, while I continue this with Axtan,&quot; out comes a natu from its pokeball. &quot;I sure hope you are feeling much better Axtan, we are going to finish this,&quot; Centin stared grinly at the remoraid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Axtan, use flash, we don't want to take damage any longer. Fly up high, you don't want it to reach you. Finally, night shade him, your only far range attack that could do wonders than words can describe,&quot; commanded and urged his natu to accomplish. Axtan received a flashback about how its previous trainer dedicatedly asked it to use flash everyday to light up her sight, especially in dark areas and times, until one day she decided to sell her natu to Centin for more money, and she waved goodbye to her natu. Axtan never really had any chance to use flash anymore since it was its favourite move and its trainer now hardly ever uses it, but in this battle, it seems that it is truly vital for itself and its trainer. Meanwhile, Centin whispered to himself, &quot;And then when I'm done with you, I shall capture you in this lure ball..&quot;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px">To Shinjara: I'm assuming that when the lure ball flicks back at me, it should be able to work, unless it's beam ray has been weakened. If so, then let me use my wereball ^^<br />
No offence to Tess as she was used during this storyline, all typed words are meant to serve the story purposes only...meh <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite7" alt=":p" title="Stick Out Tongue    :p" data-shortname=":p" /></span></span></div>
