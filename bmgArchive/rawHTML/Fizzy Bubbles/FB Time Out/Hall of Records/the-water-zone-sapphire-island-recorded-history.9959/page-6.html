<span style="color: SeaGreen"><b>Latias10:</b> Releasing Athrun, the Psychic Pig decides to have a little roll in the mud, before you scold him and focus him on the task at hand. Athrun looks at the tiny KO’ed Surskit and then murmurs, “Grummmmpiggggg..” as a blue aura surrounds Surskit and lifts it up. Swampert is powerless to stop him as he is powering up for a Bide attack. Athrun brings Surskit to you and drops it in front of you, the small bug looks up at you weakly and then passes out again.. In that one small moment, you could’ve sworn there was a smile on the small bugs face. Swampert then lets out a huge roar and fires a weak beam of Bide energy at Ledy, who simply summons a Reflect to defend against it. Athrun stands and watches by the sidelines just incase he is needed to attack. Swampert then roars out in frustration and is smacked by a Silver Wind launched by Ledy causing good damage to him. Swampert then moves out of the swamp slowly.. Each step it takes creating an almighty shakes in the ground. It then launches itself towards Ledy for a Take Down but is hit in the head by a Psybeam sent by Athrun! Swampert roars in pain and then retreats back to the swamp, Athrun’s psybeam causing good damage. Ledy then smiles at Athrun and thanks him silently. It seems that the Swampert isn’t as strong when its out of the swamp. What will you do?</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: SeaGreen">Catherine smiled pleased with her pokemons teamwork and also that the powerful creature before her might have a weakness. She knew that Ledy was doing well and could probably handle this on his own but she did have a use for Athrun. She carefully and slowly placed the Surskit on the ground in a safe space and then she stood up. She then quickly sliped of the straps on her backpack and threw it over to Athrun. Athrun caught it and stared at it in surprised not sure what to do with it. He then looked up at his trainer with a confused look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Athrun since Ledy is doing great and I am busey with the battle I want you ro search for a Revive in my backpack and use it on the Surskit,&quot; Catherine told her confused pig. She then looked over to Ledy and told him, &quot;You are doing a great job. Start off with a Supper Sonic and hopefully get the creature out of the water. You will launch a Psybeam when the Swampert is above the water.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ledy noded and got perpared for his attack while Athrun mumbled annoyed in the job he had been given. He unzipped the bag and then stuck his head in as he searched for the revive. Catherine stared at him a bit surprised at his method of finding. She then shruged and turned her attion to the battle before her.</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper">MetalGardevoir- [Why didn't you just make an account?] You arrive at the Devon Settlement. There you see many Devon workers constantly working to keep the settlement working as well as helping to expand it. As you walk through the camp, you notice that most trainers aren't interested in battling as much as helping somehow. Many are using their Pokemon to help lift large crates of supplies while others volunteer to help escort scientists around the island. Someone taps you on the shoulder and says, &quot;Hello. You must be one of the trainers Devon brought here. Most trainers that come to the settlement are here to help out, otherwise they'd just run off into the wilderness.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, youthful recklessness.&quot; She gazes at the sky for a moment and then look back towards you and says, &quot;We could use escorts for the scientists. Would you like to help out?&quot;<br />
<br />
===================================================<br />
<br />
OOC: I tried to make an account, but it can only stay logged in for one page.<br />
<br />
Seeing that this settlement is bursting with opportunities, MG stands in awe, admiring the helpful spirit of everyone. Laughing inwardly at the fact that he'd probably be going into the wilderness, too, with the action he's about to take, MG turns to meet the lady behind him.<br />
<br />
“Yes, I would like to help out. Thank you.” MG says, a little anxious at this task, calling out Sneasel to keep him company.</div>

As Aexlus climbs on his Salamence and begins to make his way over to the Ocean to find Feera, Feera’s pokemon Mikozou is still underwater, bleeding heavily from his tail. Mikozou then uses the only command Feera gave him, to use a Spark Attack. Mikozou charges his body up with Electricity and then shoots it off at Sharpedo, the electricity stuns the shark and causes it to let go of Mikozou’s tail. Feera sits upon Free as Mikozou surfaces, panting heavily with blood pouring from his tail. Sharpedo then also surfaces and Feera shouts out at Mikozou to use another Spark attack when.. Aexlus swoops on down on Salamence and blasts Sharpedo with a Dragonbreath! Sharpedo is hit for strong damage and dives down.. Aexlus flies over to Feera, who has just scooped up poor Mikozou, who is heavily damaged and close to fainting. The two of you have a small catch up when you notice the water below you begin to form into waves.. The sky turns a dark blue and rain begins to pour.. You both wonder whats going on until a Blastoise and a Feraligatr burst out of the water and roar intensely. The Sharpedo you had previously encountered floats behind them, with its fangs bared menacingly. Looks like Sharpedo had friends in high places. The two giant creatures then both fire Ice Beams directly at Flygon and Salamence! What will you both do?<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: Cyan">Feera looked at Mikozou, examining his injuries, and it didn't look good. He ripped off a part of his shirt, and used it as a bondage to stop the flowing blood. Miko was sweating, both by pain, and the stress caused of being out of water.<br />
<br />
Feeras eyes widen in horror as he sees the two Ice Beams coming right at them.<br />
&quot;Flygon, evade!&quot; He yells, holding Mikozou closer. &quot;Aexslus, attack them with another Dragonbreath, and then follow me back to the camp. Fly high, we don't want any nasty surprises in the form of more Ice Beams!&quot;<br />
He decides not to take further part in any battle until Mikoxou is healed again.</span></div>

<b>Manji:</b><span style="color: SeaGreen"> After pocketing some of the gemstones in excitement, you decide to finally refocus on the battle. Bandit begins to spin around, summoning sand from within his body, the fact that there is no sand in the Jade Swamp means that there is a Sandstorm but it isn’t as magnificent as it could be. Poliwag stepped back intimidated, and then fires some Bubbles to test the Sandstorm, they are all absorbed and Bandit remains undamaged. Poliwag then begins to fume, and runs towards the sandstorm and spins around ready to pelt it with a Double Slap, Bandit seizes the opportunity and darts out of the safety of the sandstorm and slashes Poliwag with a Scratch attack, and then follows up with a Cut to Poliwag’s torso. Crying in pain, Poliwag falls onto its back as Bandit disappears back into the Sandstorm. You congratulate Bandit on a good series of attacks, but yoy are surprised to see Poliwag stand up and bounce up and down in rage. You then watch as it runs towards the swamp and jumps in and begins to swim around in circles.. After a while a huge pillar of water begins to rise and stretches up high into the air, it then arcs and descends towards Bandit! Looks like Poliwag is smarter than he seems, using a Waterfall attack! What will you do?</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: SeaGreen">Nathen nodded, a decisive grin on his face. Bandit may have been crass, uncivilized, vulgar, and rash, but he wasn't stupid. His attacks came off flawlessly and Nathen congratulated his stalwart pokemon while secretly beaming at how smart he himself had been.<br />
<br />
However, he was forced to rethink as the ever-annoying Poliwag returned Bandit's assault with a potentially devastating Waterfall attack. Even Nathen, who unlike Bandit didn't possess a dry, scaly exterior, didn't much fancy getting hit with a fountain of stinking high-pressure water. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bandit, there's nothing for it!&quot; Nathen declared, his mind racing. &quot;The whole place is water, so there's nowhere to run. Use Defense Curl and try and weather the damage. Then I want you to strike right back with Scratch and Poison Sting! If this guy's pissing you off that much - and as far as I can tell, you're madder than a rhino that's just been kicked in the arse - you'll hit him with everything you've got!&quot;</span></div>

<br />
<b>DarkMagic &amp; ForeverFlygon</b>:Okay, you two are now adventuring together.<br />
<br />
As Aexlus climbs on his Salamence and begins to make his way over to the Ocean to find Feera, Feera’s pokemon Mikozou is still underwater, bleeding heavily from his tail. Mikozou then uses the only command Feera gave him, to use a Spark Attack. Mikozou charges his body up with Electricity and then shoots it off at Sharpedo, the electricity stuns the shark and causes it to let go of Mikozou’s tail. Feera sits upon Free as Mikozou surfaces, panting heavily with blood pouring from his tail. Sharpedo then also surfaces and Feera shouts out at Mikozou to use another Spark attack when.. Aexlus swoops on down on Salamence and blasts Sharpedo with a Dragonbreath! Sharpedo is hit for strong damage and dives down.. Aexlus flies over to Feera, who has just scooped up poor Mikozou, who is heavily damaged and close to fainting. The two of you have a small catch up when you notice the water below you begin to form into waves.. The sky turns a dark blue and rain begins to pour.. You both wonder whats going on until a Blastoise and a Feraligatr burst out of the water and roar intensely. The Sharpedo you had previously encountered floats behind them, with its fangs bared menacingly. Looks like Sharpedo had friends in high places. The two giant creatures then both fire Ice Beams directly at Flygon and Salamence! What will you both do?<br />
</span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: aqua"> I grinned as I saw Salamence was able to ward off the evil shark pokemon. I began talking to Feera catching up on things. I noticed that Mikozou was really hurt and we needed to get out of here. As we began preparing to leave I noticed that clouds began to form and rain out of nowhere was pouring down. I looked out in the open water to see it churn and become alive. To my horror a Blastoise and Feraligatr appeared roaring fiercely. I gave a quick glance to see Feera's face drain of color. I knew this had to be some friends of Sharpedo since I haven't seen many strong evolved pokemon often. I saw its evil eyes and its fangs. I wanted to punch it in the face myself when I saw the 2 water pokemon fire Ice Beams at our Dragons.<br />
&quot; Salamence dodge the attacks quickly!!! Salamence get down here quick we have to get out of their range. Feera get on to Flygon and return Mikozou back into its ball. I have a plan that just might work. As I climbed my dragon pokemon's back I threw out another pokemon revealing my Flaafy. Hey there buddy I haven't used in a bit, but this is quite the oppurtunity. Flaafy get on top of Marshtomp and fire off Thundershocks directly into the water to fry all 3 of those pokemon. Marshtomp you'll be fine thanks to your dual ground type. To make sure that they aren't able to power through or ingore the pain of the electrical current, I need you Marshtomp to be strong and hit them with Water Guns as well. While you guys are doing this I want you to back away slowly since I'm not too sure if they'll want to attack up close. We need to leave since they are really strong.&quot;<br />
My dragon soared us up into the rainy sky alongside Feera, hopefully out of range. As we began to slowly circle, I watched as Flaafy took a determined stance and began charging up power as Marshtomp began inhale its breath to begin a Thundershock Water Gun Combo attack. </span></div>

<br />
<b>ForeverFlygon &amp; DarkMagic:</b> You both voice your commands as the two Ice Beams come towards you, Feera commands Free to evade and he only manages to dodge half of the beam, and is smacked in the side for heavy damage, whereas Aexlus’ Salamence does the same and only barely manages to avoid the Ice Beam from Feraligatr. Looks like the two Water titans have chosen their opponents. Feera’s choice to withdraw from the battle isn’t too wise as Blastoise looks up at Free and licks its lips, extending its cannons and charging a Hydro Pump.. Aexlus then releases two more pokemon to attack with; Marshtomp and Flaafy. They land in the water, with Flaafy trying to balance on Marshtomp. Marshtomp then begins to fire off Water Guns on the 3 pokemon and Flaafy then sends some powerful ThunderShock in amongst them to cause some good damage.. To your surprise however, Sharpedo is the only one to feel the damage, roaring out in pain and then fleeing underwater, leaving you to deal with Blastoise and Feraligatr who didn’t seem to be affected much by the attacks.. Marshtomp and Flaafy look up at Aexlus helplessly as they flee to a safe distance until they receive more commands. Feraligatr looks up and licks his lips at the sight of Salamence.. He then roars loudly, and you both feel the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. Blastoise then fires a high pressure Hydro Pump at Free, which smacks him in the stomach for good damage. Feraligatr then decides to add insult to injury by releasing an ear splitting Screech attack. You both cover your ears, but find your dragon pokemon to be descending, out of their control. You both panic as you loom closer to the titans as Blastoise looks at Feera and Free and then begins to charge another Hyper Beam. Feraligatr meanwhile, focuses on Flaafy and Marshtomp rushing towards them with his huge jaws wide open for a Crunch. What will you both do?<br />
<br />
<b>ZoraJolteon:</b> Wooper, floating in the water looks up at Pelipper, who eyes her hungrily and then swoops in for another try. Wooper’s tail then glows a light blue, charging with Ice energy, she then leaps from the water just as Pelipper approaches and smashes into its head with an Ice Punch and then spins around and Slams it into the water! You watch as Pelipper sinks into the water, KO’ed. **Wooper receives 1 Level up** Meanwhile, Slowqueen looks up at the Wingull and uses Fury Ctuter, slashing at their wings further causing them considerable pain, they both cry out in pain as Slowqueen fires off a Confusion which first hits one of the Wingull and instantly knocks it down, KO’ed.. It floats on the surface of the water. The attack then strings on and hit’s the 2nd Wingull, which gets a nasty shock and then flees in the air when it realises its left on its own. You grin triumphantly, the battle finally over. You look ahead and see a huge wooden raft floating in the middle of the ocean with a group of people cheering at you. What will you do?<br />
<br />
<b>Thibideau:</b> With your battle orders all arranged, the battle gets underway. The 3 Sharpedo’s which are approaching Lanturn are trapped successfully by the 3 Whirlpools Pandora just formed. They are spun around and around so fast that they all become dizzy and disorientated. Pandora then fires off a dozen Icicle Spears.. 4 hitting each respective Sharpedo. They all roar in pain as you release Athene to aid with the Kingler. . Athene listens to your orders and gets ready to attack, her vines extending from her body and wrapping around Kingler, greatlyestricting it’s movement, she then fires 1 lone Leech Seed which wraps around Kingler and begins to slowly sap its energy.. That is until Kingler begins to use Swords Dance and spins around so fast the Leech Seed can’t get its hold and then falls off and eventually she cannot keep ahold with her constrict attack.. It then charges its huge claw with metallic energy and swims towards Athene to smack her with a Crabhammer attack! Athene prepares to use Mega Drain when it hits.. Meanwhile, Lanturn nods and says, “Human.. I will go and get the rest of the school as fast I can.. We will attempt to knock out those Sharpedo..” Lanturn tries to hide the fear in its eyes as it swiftly swims off, the Sharpedo still entrapped in the Whirlpool formed by Pandora.. Next, Kingler smacks Athene with a Crabhammer, giving some decent damage but then has a good deal of energy sapped from him from the Mega Drain she just used! Seems the battle is underway.. Sean grits his teeth as he remains with Uksi..He then shouts out, “SHARPEDO! Enough nonsense, retaliate with a Crunch attack as soon as you can.. Go for that stupid Aiden and his precious Pandora!” How will you react?</span><br />

<b>Faiyaa:</b> With all sorts of thoughts rushing through your mind you decide to do quite a brave, yet foolish thing by running towards the waters edge, carelessly dropping your backpack on the ground. As you issue your commands to Rena, you wade into the water, the water is absolutely freezing and you feel your breath taken away from you. Taking a moment to adjust, you take a huge breath and dive under the water, with Rena standing.. Waiting patiently to see what will happen. You see Gyarados through the clear water, and it looks up at you, with Psyduck in its mouth. You see an anger in its eyes as it rushes up towards you with Psyduck hanging from its mouth! You panic and turn to swim back up towards the surface, but you’re too slow as Gyarados smashes into your bottom half and carries you to the surface. As you and Gyarados burst from the water, you grab Psyduck and hold it close to you as the two of you plummet to the ground and land with a thud. Gyarados roars ferociously, unhappy you took it’s meal and stares at you until Rena charges a Thunder Wave and it covers Gyarados in electric tendrils. Gyarados lets out an ear-splitting roar as it struggles to move. Rena then frowns at Gyarados as it opens its mouth and charges a Hyper Beam, aiming it at both you and Psyduck! Psyduck is in a critical condition. How will you react?<br />
<br />
<b>SkepticReptile:</b> Kimberley looks at the sheer size of the wave and panics slightly but tries to jump regardless. She only manages to jump to about 3 quarters of the size of the wave and finds herself engulfed by its tremendous force, it carries her backwards as you run away to dodge it and she is left lying on the floor, severely weakened. You rush to her as she sits up, clearly shocked by the ideal. Corphish meanwhile, grins happily at his attack and then hops out of the water and begins to Taunt Kimberley, he shouts the most foulest language you’ve ever heard and even you yourself feel enraged by this. Kimberley feels the full effects of the Taunt as she stands to her feet, more determined to battle. Corphish then begins to spin around in circles raising his attack power with Swords Dance! His claw then begins to glow white as he approaches Kimberley for a devastating Crabhammer. Your reaction?</span><br />

<br />
<b>Ythrelancus:</b> Offering the Potion to Axtan, he drinks it and then recovers some health and hops back onto his feet. Commanding him to use Faint Attack, he begins to move around the Remoraid with speed and then gets behind Remoraid and slams into him, causing moderate damage. Remoraid squeals in pain as it turns to face Axtan and then fires a Water Gun in his face! Axtan flies back startled, receiving some good damage as Remoraid charges a Psybeam and fires it into Axtans face, only causing a little damage to him, due to Type resistance. Axtan then follows your next command and flies into the air above Remoraid and descends, grabbing the fish with his small claws. He has a steady grip, but if Remoraid struggles then Axtan could drop it at any moment. Your next commands?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: LimeGreen"><b>Emerald Jungle: Please reply in <u>LimeGreen</u></b><br />
<br />
<b>P-Arts:</b> Jiroubi, his pride clearly beaten after Nidoran’s string of attacks, nods in affirmative of your commands. He channels some Steel energy into his claw, which begins to glow as he launches towards Nidoran. Nidoran simply opens her mouth and lets out an ear splitting Supersonic towards Jiroubi. Jiroubi lets out a cry as he cannot concentrate on his attack and falls back, feeling slightly confused and all the more pissed off. Nidoran then makes her way over to Jiroubi and opens her mouth, charging a Poison Sting attack, but Jiroubi uses his initiative and smacks her with a Water Pulse, sending the Poison Rabbit flying backwards. Jiroubi then stands confidently, as the Berserk Gene he was holding began to glow black and waves of dark energy began to surround Jiroubi. His eyes turned blood red as his body mass begins to bulk up considerably, he lets out a roar as a dark light engulfs him and then disappears. Nidoran trembles in fear slightly at the sight of Jiroubi, but then shakes her head and grins, ready for the challenge. Jiroubi stands still for a moment, trying to gain control of this new power. You approach him and are shocked when he stares at you menacingly, his eyes shining red and he holds up his paw, which is glowing brightly.. He then growls lowly as he charges towards Nidoran, his paw engulfed in flames. Nidoran stares him down until the last moment and meets his Fire Punch with a Disable attack. Jiroubi is held still as Nidoran then smacks him with a Double Kick knocking him back away from her. When Jiroubi is released from Disable’s hold he seemed to get more and more enraged. He then begins to move around the area as fast as the speed of light, moving in to a Faint Attack into the back of Nidoran, knocking her down. He then begins to unleash some Fury Swipes on her whilst shes on the ground. Nidoran takes a heavy beating, but Jiroubi’s not finished yet as he begins to Thrash Nidoran repeatedly until she lets out a huge high pitched noise.. And then is KO’ed on the spot.. Jiroubi roars loudly in triumph.. *Jiroubi receives 1 Level-Up* But is interrupted by the sound of stamping feet, feeling slightly confused by the Thrash attack, he is smacked by a large tail of a Nidoqueen! Jiroubi is launched towards you, knocking you off your feet. Jiroubi, still enraged by the Berserk Gene stands and then growls lowly at the Nidoqueen, who is clearly here to protect her offspring, and you’ve pissed her off.. What will you do?<br />
<br />
<b>Joshua:</b> Michael nods at your commands and then begins to dig his back paws into the ground, and kicks up some dirt. Although it doesn’t have the desired effect, you find it mixes with Stun Spore and makes it less effective. Gloom sits up and holds her head and shakes it.. Trying to shake off the confusion holding her. Michael then charges himself with Dark energy and begins to run towards Gloom and knocks her back with a Pursuit. Gloom unluckily snaps out of confusion thanks to the heavy blow and then stands up, panting quite heavily. Michael is too, feeling the effects of the battle. Gloom then slowly roots into the ground, using Ingrain, she then begins to absorb nutrients from the rich soil, raising her health and energy. Michael snorts and then charges himself with Electrical energy, unleasing a ferocious Thunderbolt which hits Gloom directly, but because she is rotted into the ground, simply travels through her into the ground. Without any more commands to follow, Michael watches as Gloom releases another Acid attack from her mouth which hits Michael in the eyes, he cries out in pain again, the familiar stinging and burning sensation causing him distress.. What will you do? <br />
<br />
<b>Dark Scizor:</b> Mankey opens his nostrils and fires off some steam as Minerva nods at your commands and flies up in to the trees. Mankey looks and then stares at you angrily, clearly still pissed off and then leaps into a tree to try to track Minerva. Minerva begins to move stealthily through the trees, well camouflaged by the scenery. Mankey hops from branch to branch, the more he needs to look, the more enraged he becomes. Minerva then sees her opportunity to attack and tackles Mankey right in the back, knocking him from the tree and then swoops back into the leaves to hide herself. Mankey lands flat on his face and then gets up and lets out the most earsplitting Screech to draw Minerva out, he succeeds as Minerva drops to the ground, her hearing battered by the Screech. A sadistic grin fell on Mankeys features as he approached her and cracked his knuckles and unleashed a Cross Chop which slams into Minerva’s back and KO’s her on the spot.. Mankey then grins and looks to you, his rage continuing.. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />

<br />
<b>Sasuke-san:</b> As Totodile tightened her grip, Saru’s discomfort begun to grow. Just as you issued your commands, Totodile sickenly dislocates her jaw so her mouth can open wider, and she then clamps down again, Saru lets out a cry of pain as he then fires a Leech Seed into the air which lands on Totodile’s tail and opens out, revealing the vines within, which stretch out and engulf Totodile, sapping her health and energy and transferring it to Saru. Totodile lets go and drops to the ground, squirming in pain as the Leech Seed does its work. You think Totodile is helpless, and Ino seems very pleased to see this. You look to her and smile until you hear the snap of the vines and Totodile on her feet, clicking her jaw back into place. Saru, feeling re-energised by the Leech Seed then launches himself towards Totodile, summoning every bit of Strength he has, as he approaches Totodile, she grins and opens her mouth wide and releases a Hydro Pump which smacks against Saru and holds him back, unable to move forwards due to the immense pressure of the water. It causes only a small amount of damage, due to type resistance. Totodile then grins and fires an Ice Beam at Saru! Saru tries his best to move to the side, but finds his right arm to be frozen solid. He glares angrily at Totodile, who is beginning to get tired, but is bouncing up and down happily, taunting the Wickid Pokemon. She then wanders up to Saru and looks up at him, grinning widely, she then pulls a Scary Face. Her jaw dislocates and hangs lowly, she pulls her eyelids down and growls, which slightly freaks Saru out, he steps back, flinching from the damage to his arm. He then looks back at you with a concerned look on his face. Ino flinches at the sight of his arm as you try to think things through.. Your reaction?<br />
<br />
<b>Manji:</b> Bandit looks at you helplessly as you issue your attacks, he then curls up defensively as the huge arc of water smashes ontop of him.. As it hits him it spreads outwards creating a makeshift pool of water. You panic and wait and see if Bandit is alright.. As the water clears, you see him in one piece. He uncurls and all you can see is the most vulgar expression across his face.. Muttering a few obscenities.. You can almost see the steam he is emitting from pure rage. Poliwag hops out of the swamp and giggles loudly, which only seems to make Bandits rage even worse! Bandit then begins to sprint towards Poliwag, he jumps ontop of the small creature and Scratches him ferociously and then unleashes a barrage of Poison Stings into the wound, the poison seeping to Poliwag;s bloodstream, which will soon take effect. Poliwag cries out in pain and fires a Water gun at Bandit to knock him off it and then struggles to his feet. Bandit lands on his back with a sickening thud as Poliwag laughs once more, but is beginning to pant from being so tired.. Bandit is also getting tired.. What will you do next?<br />
<br />
<b>Latias10:</b> As you threw the backpack to Athrun, he picks it up off the ground and opens it, sticking his head right in to look for a Revive, a peculiar way of searching, indeed. Meanwhile, you issue your commands to Ledy, who nods, understanding what you want to do. He opens his mouth and emits Supersonic waves which Swampert can’t manage to avoid. He covers his ears and becomes confused, shaking his head trying to shake it off, but it doesn’t work. Enraged with confusion, he moves out of the swamp and stands on the bank, staring at Ledy and charging a Water Gun in his mouth. Ledy takes the opportunity to fire a Psybeam at Swampert’s head, causing some heavy damage and knocking him onto his back. He then fires the Water Gun in the air from the damage and his confusion, wasting energy.. Swampert pants heavily and is unable to get up from being on his back. Ledy waits for his next order as Athrun finally finds the Revive in your bag. He takes it out using Psychic and then sprayed it on to Surskit, whose eyes opened slowly and she let out a quiet, “Surrrs….?” Athrun looked at Surskit and smiled gently as he picked her up and waved to you, signalling that Surskit is safe. What will you do next?</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: LimeGreen"><b>Dark Scizor:</b> Mankey opens his nostrils and fires off some steam as Minerva nods at your commands and flies up in to the trees. Mankey looks and then stares at you angrily, clearly still pissed off and then leaps into a tree to try to track Minerva. Minerva begins to move stealthily through the trees, well camouflaged by the scenery. Mankey hops from branch to branch, the more he needs to look, the more enraged he becomes. Minerva then sees her opportunity to attack and tackles Mankey right in the back, knocking him from the tree and then swoops back into the leaves to hide herself. Mankey lands flat on his face and then gets up and lets out the most earsplitting Screech to draw Minerva out, he succeeds as Minerva drops to the ground, her hearing battered by the Screech. A sadistic grin fell on Mankeys features as he approached her and cracked his knuckles and unleashed a Cross Chop which slams into Minerva’s back and KO’s her on the spot.. Mankey then grins and looks to you, his rage continuing.. What will you do?</span></span>

<br />
&quot;Why when I use a pokemon it gets KOed instantly? Are they so weak or I am a bad trainer?&quot;<br />
<br />
He didn´t wanted to know the answer. That Mankey was causing too much trouble. He took another ball from his backpack, after returning Minerva to her ball, and called for Neptune, his Beedrill. When the Poison Bee pokemon appeared, he ordered the following:<br />
<br />
&quot;Neptune, this Mankey is very annoying so use Swords Dance to raise your attack, then use Focus Energy and finally use Double Edge to stop it.<br />
<br />
Neptune was prepared. This fight was personal. Some time ago, a Mankey defeated him and this was the perfect opportunity for his revenge agaisnt this kind of pokemon.</span></div>

<b>Faiyaa:</b> With all sorts of thoughts rushing through your mind you decide to do quite a brave, yet foolish thing by running towards the waters edge, carelessly dropping your backpack on the ground. As you issue your commands to Rena, you wade into the water, the water is absolutely freezing and you feel your breath taken away from you. Taking a moment to adjust, you take a huge breath and dive under the water, with Rena standing.. Waiting patiently to see what will happen. You see Gyarados through the clear water, and it looks up at you, with Psyduck in its mouth. You see an anger in its eyes as it rushes up towards you with Psyduck hanging from its mouth! You panic and turn to swim back up towards the surface, but you’re too slow as Gyarados smashes into your bottom half and carries you to the surface. As you and Gyarados burst from the water, you grab Psyduck and hold it close to you as the two of you plummet to the ground and land with a thud. Gyarados roars ferociously, unhappy you took it’s meal and stares at you until Rena charges a Thunder Wave and it covers Gyarados in electric tendrils. Gyarados lets out an ear-splitting roar as it struggles to move. Rena then frowns at Gyarados as it opens its mouth and charges a Hyper Beam, aiming it at both you and Psyduck! Psyduck is in a critical condition. How will you react?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: Cyan">In the short instant that Gary was in the freezing water, he was instantly thrust out into the air, with the Psyduck in his hands. Gary held onto the Psyduck tight, as he shouted while they flew and then fell, breaking their fall so Psyduch wouldn't get hurt any further. Gary weakly congradulated Rena as she strangled the Gyarados with her Thunder Wave, but then noticed that it had begun to charge up for a massive Hyper Beam. In a panick, Gary quickly returned Rena to her pokeball, and then sent out Shuri, his Ninjask. &quot;Alright, Shuri, use Flash on it before it can launch its attack, and try to use a Silver Wind at its face! If those don't work, follow it up by a Faint Attack!&quot; Shuri nodded and rapidly flew off towards the charging Gyarados. Gary then turned to the Psyduck and laid it down behind him, so the Hyper Beam would hit him instead of the Psyduck if it went through. &quot;Don't worry, I'll take care of you,&quot; he said gently to it. He then looked back up at Shuri and wondered how her attacks would work.</span></div>

<b>Joshua:</b> Michael nods at your commands and then begins to dig his back paws into the ground, and kicks up some dirt. Although it doesn’t have the desired effect, you find it mixes with Stun Spore and makes it less effective. Gloom sits up and holds her head and shakes it.. Trying to shake off the confusion holding her. Michael then charges himself with Dark energy and begins to run towards Gloom and knocks her back with a Pursuit. Gloom unluckily snaps out of confusion thanks to the heavy blow and then stands up, panting quite heavily. Michael is too, feeling the effects of the battle. Gloom then slowly roots into the ground, using Ingrain, she then begins to absorb nutrients from the rich soil, raising her health and energy. Michael snorts and then charges himself with Electrical energy, unleasing a ferocious Thunderbolt which hits Gloom directly, but because she is rotted into the ground, simply travels through her into the ground. Without any more commands to follow, Michael watches as Gloom releases another Acid attack from her mouth which hits Michael in the eyes, he cries out in pain again, the familiar stinging and burning sensation causing him distress.. What will you do? </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: Lime">Joshua cries out as Gloom's Acid attack strikes Michael in the eyes, Michael crying out in pain. Joshua races beside Michael, lifting him into his arms.<br />
<br />
His hand quickly flies to his backpack, a Super Potion the object of his search. He gently sprays it across Michael's eyes, and the little black fox sneezes as some of the spray enters his nose.<br />
<br />
Joshua turns to Gloom, Michael still in his arms. &quot;Gloom, I commend you. You obviously don't trust humans, and I can understand that. But I will not have Michael hurt just to prove to you that I can be trusted. If you wish to continue this battle, then fine, but be warned, I am through playing around.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joshua kneels down, and places Michael on the ground. &quot;Be ready for anything. Since it's used Ingrain, we have to be careful of spore attacks, so use a Sand Attack to clear some of the spores, then strike it with a double Pursuit. Always be ready to dodge its attacks though.&quot;</span></div>

<b>Thibideau:</b> With your battle orders all arranged, the battle gets underway. The 3 Sharpedo’s which are approaching Lanturn are trapped successfully by the 3 Whirlpools Pandora just formed. They are spun around and around so fast that they all become dizzy and disorientated. Pandora then fires off a dozen Icicle Spears.. 4 hitting each respective Sharpedo. They all roar in pain as you release Athene to aid with the Kingler. . Athene listens to your orders and gets ready to attack, her vines extending from her body and wrapping around Kingler, greatlyestricting it’s movement, she then fires 1 lone Leech Seed which wraps around Kingler and begins to slowly sap its energy.. That is until Kingler begins to use Swords Dance and spins around so fast the Leech Seed can’t get its hold and then falls off and eventually she cannot keep ahold with her constrict attack.. It then charges its huge claw with metallic energy and swims towards Athene to smack her with a Crabhammer attack! Athene prepares to use Mega Drain when it hits.. Meanwhile, Lanturn nods and says, “Human.. I will go and get the rest of the school as fast I can.. We will attempt to knock out those Sharpedo..” Lanturn tries to hide the fear in its eyes as it swiftly swims off, the Sharpedo still entrapped in the Whirlpool formed by Pandora.. Next, Kingler smacks Athene with a Crabhammer, giving some decent damage but then has a good deal of energy sapped from him from the Mega Drain she just used! Seems the battle is underway.. Sean grits his teeth as he remains with Uksi..He then shouts out, “SHARPEDO! Enough nonsense, retaliate with a Crunch attack as soon as you can.. Go for that stupid Aiden and his precious Pandora!” How will you react?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: aqua">With so much happening around him, Aiden tried his hardest to stay focused on the battle at hand. Athene was in the thick of a battle while Pandora was busy trying to keep the trio of Sharpedo at bay. With the hopes of possible re-enforcements on the way Aiden knew he just had to keep up the juggling act a little while longer. First thing at hand was keeping the Sharpedo at bay. Pandora had done well so far, but the Whirpool wouldn't hold them for ever. Knowing they would soon be coming for himself and pandora he thought of something to keep them away. bu he enjoyed mocking his competition and this was no different. <br />
<br />
Aiden:&quot;OK precious lets do a super fantastic job!&quot;<br />
<br />
Pandora simply rolled her eyes at her trainer and looked back at her enemy.<br />
<br />
Aiden:&quot;Heh, sorry Pandora. Wait for them to get in close and then use <b>Protect</b>. After that use <b>Rapid spin</b> to knock them back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pandora nodded and smiled confidently as the Sharpedo came in. Turning ihs attention yet again to Athene and her current battle he saw that things were pretty evenly matched but Kingler was proving to be quite fiesty.<br />
<br />
Aiden:&quot;You're doing great Athene. You have this crab no problem. Lets throw our weight around a little. Use a <b>Confusion</b> and <b>Vine whip</b> combo to knock it around a little. After that spread some <b>Poison powder</b> around.</span><br />

<br />
<b>Ythrelancus:</b> Offering the Potion to Axtan, he drinks it and then recovers some health and hops back onto his feet. Commanding him to use Faint Attack, he begins to move around the Remoraid with speed and then gets behind Remoraid and slams into him, causing moderate damage. Remoraid squeals in pain as it turns to face Axtan and then fires a Water Gun in his face! Axtan flies back startled, receiving some good damage as Remoraid charges a Psybeam and fires it into Axtans face, only causing a little damage to him, due to Type resistance. Axtan then follows your next command and flies into the air above Remoraid and descends, grabbing the fish with his small claws. He has a steady grip, but if Remoraid struggles then Axtan could drop it at any moment. Your next commands?</span><br />
<br />
</span>

<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: mediumturquoise">The movement of the remoraid somehow does not let Centin to stay in one place. The remoraid looks like it is going to escape if he does not put any effort to win the battle. There not much that his natu could do while grabbing the remoraid, so it might pose a problem when using a problem, such as dropping the remoraid back into the water, giving back its mobility.<br />
<br />
&quot;Axtan, hang in there, try to get on land. You may drop it off here, on the land, it won't be able to do anything on the land. It will probably struggle to get back into the river, but we can manage that later on by just attacking it. Otherwise, just do your best to flash it and then night shade it if it happens to free itself from your grasp,&quot; commanded Centin although he knew that it was a highly invalid response towards the situation.</span></div>

Meanwhile, you issue your commands to Ledy, who nods, understanding what you want to do. He opens his mouth and emits Supersonic waves which Swampert can’t manage to avoid. He covers his ears and becomes confused, shaking his head trying to shake it off, but it doesn’t work. Enraged with confusion, he moves out of the swamp and stands on the bank, staring at Ledy and charging a Water Gun in his mouth. Ledy takes the opportunity to fire a Psybeam at Swampert’s head, causing some heavy damage and knocking him onto his back. He then fires the Water Gun in the air from the damage and his confusion, wasting energy.. Swampert pants heavily and is unable to get up from being on his back. Ledy waits for his next order as Athrun finally finds the Revive in your bag. He takes it out using Psychic and then sprayed it on to Surskit, whose eyes opened slowly and she let out a quiet, “Surrrs….?” Athrun looked at Surskit and smiled gently as he picked her up and waved to you, signalling that Surskit is safe. What will you do next?</span></span>

<br />
&quot;Ledy wait until the Swampert comes out of land and then blast it with a Psybeam and a Silver Wind. Be patient because it probably will come out some time,&quot; Catherine said knowing that she could trust Ledy.<br />
<br />
Ledy noded and looked down at the water where Swampert was perpared to attack at any moment necacary. Catherine then bent down to Athrun and carefully took the Surskit from him. With his job done Catherine returned him back to his pokeball. &quot;You will be perfectly fine you little sweety,&quot; Catherine whispered to the bug type pokemon in her arms as she stood to her feet. She then continued to watch the battle knowing that Ledy could beat the swampy creature.</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: SeaGreen"><span style="font-size: 9px">Just as Saru was about to perform his attacks the problematic Totodile unhinged her jaw even further, and clamped down again violently around the Shiftry’s head. Saru let out a hallowing moan and fired a leech seed from his arm into the air, which spiralled upwards and unravelled, wrapping around the tip of Totodile’s tail. The crocodile pokemon let go suddenly, and began to writhe in pain, thrashing at the vines with her claws, which were now reaching along her back, and tightening. Ino wiggled her ears contently at the sight, and even Sasuke began to think to himself that the battle was heading in his favour. A look of horror soon replaced his smug grin, as Totodile clamped her teeth around the leech seed and tore it away from her body, snapping the vines, which fell harmlessly to the floor. She then grabbed hold of her mouth with both hands, and with a sickening crack relocated her jaw, causing Ino to recoil slightly and almost topple from her perch. <br />
<br />
Saru, who had been momentarily stunned, chose the moment to muster up his strength and attack. Just as he was within striking distance he was hit by a powerful hydro-pump attack, which managed to dampen his assault in more ways then one, holding him back from the mischievous Totodile. She grinned, and Sasuke watched nervously as the water from her mouth began to freeze, turning into a type-effective ice beam. Saru grunted and tried to leap to the side, but didn’t manage to escape in time, his right arm becoming partially frozen solid. The fatigued Totodile was still bouncing happily, and ambled towards Saru, then hung her huge jaw down with her big tongue sticking out, and pulled her eyelids down. The Wickid Shiftry looked fairly nonplussed, if anything the disrespectful scary face only aggravated him further. He tried to lunge forward but the weight of his arm was hindering his movement. Instead, he looked forlornly over his shoulder at Sasuke, who wracked his brain desperately. He spotted his bag to his left, some of it’s contents sprawled over the swamp floor, so he ran over and picked it up, emptying it out into a pile. He found what he was looking for, a glowing pinkish potion, and ran over to his Shiftry. He held Saru’s arm was one hand and sprayed the ice heal over it with the other. His pokemon howled in pain as the ice began to steam, but he kept his arm steady, bearing the pain. <i>’’There now the frost should wear off shortly,’’</i> he looked his Shiftry in the eye, <i>’’can you still battle effectively ‘til then?’’</i> Saru nodded aggressively and turned back towards the Totodile as a sign of determination. <i>’’Okay then,’’</i> started Sasuke, <i>’’attack that Totodile with your nature power. If she tries to attack blind her with your flash, and then cut her down to size.’’</i> His Shiftry burst forward instantly, infuriated by the turquoise crocodile now and eager to prove himself. Ino bounced happily on Sasuke’s shoulder and let out a yelp of joy.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: cyan"><b>ForeverFlygon &amp; DarkMagic:</b> You both voice your commands as the two Ice Beams come towards you, Feera commands Free to evade and he only manages to dodge half of the beam, and is smacked in the side for heavy damage, whereas Aexlus’ Salamence does the same and only barely manages to avoid the Ice Beam from Feraligatr. Looks like the two Water titans have chosen their opponents. Feera’s choice to withdraw from the battle isn’t too wise as Blastoise looks up at Free and licks its lips, extending its cannons and charging a Hydro Pump.. Aexlus then releases two more pokemon to attack with; Marshtomp and Flaafy. They land in the water, with Flaafy trying to balance on Marshtomp. Marshtomp then begins to fire off Water Guns on the 3 pokemon and Flaafy then sends some powerful ThunderShock in amongst them to cause some good damage.. To your surprise however, Sharpedo is the only one to feel the damage, roaring out in pain and then fleeing underwater, leaving you to deal with Blastoise and Feraligatr who didn’t seem to be affected much by the attacks.. Marshtomp and Flaafy look up at Aexlus helplessly as they flee to a safe distance until they receive more commands. Feraligatr looks up and licks his lips at the sight of Salamence.. He then roars loudly, and you both feel the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. Blastoise then fires a high pressure Hydro Pump at Free, which smacks him in the stomach for good damage. Feraligatr then decides to add insult to injury by releasing an ear splitting Screech attack. You both cover your ears, but find your dragon pokemon to be descending, out of their control. You both panic as you loom closer to the titans as Blastoise looks at Feera and Free and then begins to charge another Hyper Beam. Feraligatr meanwhile, focuses on Flaafy and Marshtomp rushing towards them with his huge jaws wide open for a Crunch. What will you both do?</span><br />

<span style="color: LimeGreen"><b>P-Arts:</b> Jiroubi, his pride clearly beaten after Nidoran’s string of attacks, nods in affirmative of your commands. He channels some Steel energy into his claw, which begins to glow as he launches towards Nidoran. Nidoran simply opens her mouth and lets out an ear splitting Supersonic towards Jiroubi. Jiroubi lets out a cry as he cannot concentrate on his attack and falls back, feeling slightly confused and all the more pissed off. Nidoran then makes her way over to Jiroubi and opens her mouth, charging a Poison Sting attack, but Jiroubi uses his initiative and smacks her with a Water Pulse, sending the Poison Rabbit flying backwards. Jiroubi then stands confidently, as the Berserk Gene he was holding began to glow black and waves of dark energy began to surround Jiroubi. His eyes turned blood red as his body mass begins to bulk up considerably, he lets out a roar as a dark light engulfs him and then disappears. Nidoran trembles in fear slightly at the sight of Jiroubi, but then shakes her head and grins, ready for the challenge. Jiroubi stands still for a moment, trying to gain control of this new power. You approach him and are shocked when he stares at you menacingly, his eyes shining red and he holds up his paw, which is glowing brightly.. He then growls lowly as he charges towards Nidoran, his paw engulfed in flames. Nidoran stares him down until the last moment and meets his Fire Punch with a Disable attack. Jiroubi is held still as Nidoran then smacks him with a Double Kick knocking him back away from her. When Jiroubi is released from Disable’s hold he seemed to get more and more enraged. He then begins to move around the area as fast as the speed of light, moving in to a Faint Attack into the back of Nidoran, knocking her down. He then begins to unleash some Fury Swipes on her whilst shes on the ground. Nidoran takes a heavy beating, but Jiroubi’s not finished yet as he begins to Thrash Nidoran repeatedly until she lets out a huge high pitched noise.. And then is KO’ed on the spot.. Jiroubi roars loudly in triumph.. *Jiroubi receives 1 Level-Up* But is interrupted by the sound of stamping feet, feeling slightly confused by the Thrash attack, he is smacked by a large tail of a Nidoqueen! Jiroubi is launched towards you, knocking you off your feet. Jiroubi, still enraged by the Berserk Gene stands and then growls lowly at the Nidoqueen, who is clearly here to protect her offspring, and you’ve pissed her off.. What will you do?</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: LimeGreen">&quot;Oh... shit!&quot; said James, already panicking, &quot;What're we gonna do?! She'll kill us dead, she'll kill us--&quot;<br />
<br />
Smack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut the hell up,&quot; snapped Jiroubi, an insane grin on his face, &quot;'Cos it's on.&quot;<br />
<br />
James couldn't comprehend what he said for a few seconds, but when he did he merely stared and pointed at the Berserk Gene, &quot;What in God's name is in that thing? Pott? Because you're acting high, mate.&quot;<br />
<br />
The bear shrugged and flexed his rather non-existent-completely-dependant-on-the-Berserk-Gene-muscles before grinning, &quot;Maybe, I dunno. I'm feeling an awesome buzz.&quot;<br />
<br />
The trainer would of banged his head on a table, had there been one in the middle of a jungle, but there wasn't. So he had to make do with a tree. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Feel better?&quot; asked Jiroubi seriously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; James whined, &quot;My head hurts - I have to stop doing that... anyway. Re-activate the Berserk Gene, then - if you can stay in control - show the nidoqueen your Strength and knock her back, then Rock Tomb, then get her attention away from her kid with a Faint Attack,&quot; The teen chucked a pokeball idly in the air, &quot;Then I'll try and catch that nidoran...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jiroubi glared, &quot;Are you sure this stuff-&quot; he pointed at the Berserk Gene, &quot;-isn't contagious? Because you have to be out of your God damn mind to want to catch that tiny little--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jealous?&quot; asked James with a grin, &quot;'Cause I want to keep her after she kicked your ass?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She did not 'kick my ass'!&quot; Jiroubi snarled, and if looks could kill James would have had his skull crushed in and his grave pissed on, &quot;I won. Easily!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You keep telling yourself that... now let's go.&quot;<br />

<b>Thibideau:</b> Feeling quite overwhelmed by the scale of the battle, you bravely continue on. Athene begins to glow blue as a blue aura also surrounds Kingler and a wave of confusion hits Kingler’s mind. He jolts back, holding his claws to his head in pain, the Confusion taking its toll on his mind. Feeling confused Kingler, swims about randomly as Athene smacks him with a Vine Whip, sending the crab further back, who is flailing about in confusion. Meanwhile, the Sharpedo are bounding towards Pandora who cooly allows them to approach, charging up a Protect barrier. The Sharpedo bounce off it and fly backwards then begin to approach once again for a lethal Crunch attack.. Pandora retreats into her shell to get ready to use Rapid Spin until you see the Shiny Lanturn appear with other Lanturn and Chinchou. They blast the Sharpedo with Spark and the sharks all fall.. KO’ed. Thankful for the help you call over to Lanturn and he states, “Thankyou for your help so far.. We’ll take care of that human and his Cloyster..You carry on here..” The focus for you is now on Kingler, who is suffering from Confusion. Athene readies herself for a hard battle as you watch the Lanturn swim after Sean and Uksi, trying to attack them. What will you do next?</span><br />

<b>Faiyaa:</b> As Gyarados charged a fatal beam of energy, you release Shuri to do her stuff. She buzzes about happily as you state your orders. Shuri seems optimistic considering the circumstances you find yourselves in. Concentrating all her energy into a bright light she emit’s a bright Flash which blinds Gyarados, who begins to thrash about wildly, the orb of energy in his mouth still there. You flinch, knowing that this could get really dangerous, ensuring that Psyduck remains safe. It looks up at you, weakly saying, “…Duck?” You could swear that the small duck was smiling at you, grateful for your help. Shuri then decides on a different tactic, she suddenly disappears, moving too fast for you to see. Gyarados, completely blinded can’t even anticipate it when Shuri reppears to the side and knocks Gyarados with a Faint Attack, knocking the huge beast off course for his Hyper Beam. Gyarados then fires off the fatal beam, and luckily for you and Psyduck, it skims the two of you, leaving a huge tunnel in the ground. You feel a wave of relief flood over you as Gyarados begins to roar loudly, trying to regain his sight. What will you do? <br />
<br />
<b>SkepticReptile:</b>Kimberley drinks the Soda Pop, the fluid regaining her some health and energy. Corphish watches curiously and if Corphish could snort, then he’d most certainly be snorting right about now. Kimberley then listens to your orders and launches herself towards Corphish who braces himself with a Hardening of the body. The Thunderpunch that Kimberley just launched is effective, and Corphish feels a bit paralysed as a result. Paralyzed to the spot, Kimberley takes her chance at another Thunderpunch, and Corphish charges a Crabhammer and smashes it into Kimberley’s fist and she is send hurling backwards from the impact. Corphish then crouches over, his energy levels dropping. Kimberley’s head leaf then glows green as the remains of Corphishs health and energy are transferred to her. Corphish then drops to the ground, KO’ed. **Kimberley gains 1 Level-Up!** Will you capture it, or will you continue on with your journey? </span><br />

<b>Ythrelancus:</b> Axtan flaps his wings as hard as he can and manages to hover over the land and drops the Remoraid onto the ground, it flops around wildly firing off Aurora Beams in every direction. Axtan lands on the ground and approaches the fish, using a Flash attack. You cover your eyes as the bright flash blinds the small fish and it begins to panick more, firing off an Aurora Beam that hits Axtan in the wing, severely damaging it. Axtan cries out in pain and hops backwards, firing off a NightShade in retaliation which hits Remoraid for good damage. Remoraid is now blind and his health is dropping a lot. Axtan’s wing is too damaged for him to fly. What will you do?</span><br />

<b>P-Arts:</b> Jiroubi steps forward and braces himself to face Nidoqueen. She looks at Jiroubi curiously, almost laughing at the prospect of battling him. If she could talk, she’d be insulting him. Whilst shes distracted, you throw the poke ball which hit’s the small Nidoran (F), sucking her within the poke ball. It wobbles a bit then pings, signifying a capture. *Congratulations, you have captured a Level 6 Nidoran (F)!* Jiroubi nods and then reactivates the Berserk Gene, any shred of morality in him disappears as his body fills with overwhelming power once more, holding his head, his eyes turn a blood red and he roars out loud. Looking at the Nidoqueen, a single trail of drool falls from his mouth in anticipation as he runs towards her and slams into her bulky body, using all his strength, Nidoqueen is knocked back but grabs Jiroubi by the foot and then glows white as she uses SuperPower and slams him into the ground using every ounce of her strength. Jiro lays on the ground stunned, but the Berserk Gene causes him to battle on. He stands, his leg heavily damaged by Nidoqueen’s grip. Filled with rage, he goes in and unleashes some Fury Swipes on Nidoqueen’s torso, ripping open some of her natural armour. She roars loudly and then fires some Poison Stings at Jiroubi, the lethal needles embedding themselves into his injured leg. Flinching even more on the inside Jiroubi feels the need to continue on, the Berserk Gene’s influence on him taking away all his sense of pain and rational thinking. He then runs towards Nidoqueen to Slash her, but collapses on the way, the damage to his leg stopping him from moving. Nidoqueen stomps over to Jiroubi and looks down at him and gets ready to Body Slam him. What will you do?<br />
<br />
<b>Joshua:</b> Gloom listens to every word you say and nods, ready to take the battle one step further. Michael growls lowly as you issue your commands and the you could almost see the bristles on the back of his neck stand on end, he was psyched for battle. Gloom pulsates the petals on her head once more, releasing a Sweet Scent but Michael remains one step ahead and kicks up a Sand Attack which cancels out the Sweet Scent. Gloom then begins to absorb more nutrients as Michael runs towards her, a black aura engulfing him and he hits her full force for a Pursuit attack, which rips the Ingrain roots from the ground and Gloom is sent flying to the ground. Michael then charges up more dark energy and smashes into her once more, the two hits combined dealing very heavy damage. Gloom struggles to get up, now panting for breath. Michael is doing pretty well, the Super Potion having given him a good boost in health. Gloom remains on the ground, seems she underestimated Michael’s abilities. What will you do?<br />
<b>Dark Scizor:</b> After Minerva’s defeat, you call upon your Poison Bee to carry on the fight. Neptune nodded in affirmative as you issue your commands. Neptune begins to spin very rapidly, picking up leaves and debris as she raises her attack power with a Sword’s Dance. Stopping, she then further boosts her skills by Focusing her Energy, a blue aura engulfs her body as she closes her eyes and raises her awareness and power. Mankey watches this motionless, and doesn’t even see Neptune coming with a full blown boosted Double Edge attack! She smashes into him, dealing heavy damage, which knocks the small pig monkey flying backwards. Neptune then buzzes back to you, and you smile confidently after her assault. Mankey, stunned by the attack, hops back onto his two feet and bounces up and down and then begins to run towards Neptune and delivers a few Fury Swipes to her torso before she manages to buzz away. Mankey begins to get more angry and begins to Focus his own Energy as Neptune waits for further commands. What will you command? </span><br />

<b>Sasuke-san:</b> Totodile was stood right in front of Saru as a green aura surrounded his body, closing his eyes, the hair on his body begins to rise, and the ground begins to shake as the waters in the swamp began to rise. Totodile, looks around confused as the Swamp water forms into a pillar and comes hurling towards her, she begins to run but is engulfed by the Muddy Water attack Saru just generated. Saru then controls the attack, sending the pillar of water in circles, making Totodile not only hurt, but dizzy aswell. After a few moments, he finishes the attack and Totodile drops to the ground, heavily damaged and panting. Taking a Premier Ball out of your bag, you get ready to capture her, but not before she weakly stands up for the last round. Saru, quite impressed by Totodile’s determination stands forwards once more and blasts her with a Flash, blinding her, causing her to fire off Water Guns randomly, not able to see her target. Saru then decides to end it and launches himself towards Totodile and slices her torso as he moves past her. Totodile gasps and drops to the ground, KO’ed. *Level up for Saru* You then throw the Premier Ball and it hits Totodile on the head and she is sucked within it, the ball drops to the ground and wobbles to and fro. Totodile almost manages to escape free, but the ball keeps her restrained. You hear the “ping” noise to confirm the capture. *Congratulations, you just captured a Level 7 Female Totodile, with the item “Swamp Queen Crown” attached* (This item has no real use except for decoration) <br />
<br />
As you approach Saru to congratulate him on his victory and pick up the ball containing Totodile, the cloussuddenly turn dark and it begins to rain fiercely. Cursing under your breath you stand next to Saru, his form sheltering you slightly. The swamp waters began to become disturbed once again, and two scythes appear from the swamp waters, and they dig deep into the bank of the swamp. The loudest roar can be heard and you step back in fear as the creature begins to emerge from the swamp, a brown flat head emerges, with a pair of eyes so fierce they intimidate you to no end. Saru stands back as the creature’s thin body emerges.. The resulting pokemon being a Kabutops. It rips its scythes from the ground and holds them in the sky, roaring so loudly you could almost feel your eardrums burst. It looks down directly at you and the Premier Ball containing Totodile and holds the scythe out, “The flow of peace has been disturbed.. By capturing her, the swamp has become unbalanced. The new successor to rule this area of Sapphire Island will be me.. But things will be different, that queen was young and clueless, she didn’t think with her head, her spirit for battle being her downfall. Now look at her, entrapped within that ball in your hand. Well human, your punishment for intruding in MY lands will be death! I’ve laid dormant for years waiting for this day… Prepare yourself!” Kabutops then launches himself from within the swamp and lands in front of you, snarling at you fiercely. You feel fear wash over you as you step back, and drop to the ground, the prospect of battling a Fossil pokemon quite daunting. What will you do?<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Manji:</b> Bandit’s now calm state comes as a surprise to you, and you throw the gemstones to him so he can attack with them. He catches them and well, throws them at Poliwag, who flinches as each one hits. Poliwag then runs towards Bandit to use a Body Slam but Bandit is one step ahead and has skilfully dug underground to avoid the hit. Digging underground, Bandit then senses where Poliwag is and bursts from underneath the surface of the ground and hits Poliwag for good damage. Poliwag is knocked down, panting further. Bandit then begins to glow a bright white, the glow almost blinding you. You watch in amazement as his form grows larger and his small claws elongate into long scythes. Quills burst out of his back all the way down, and the claws on his feet also elongate. As the light disappears, the quills turn a brown colour and Bandit is now a Sandslash! You watch in awe as he opens his mouth and blasts Poliwag with a barrage of lethal Poison Stings, each one embedding into Poliwags skin, and the poison begins to seep into its bloodstream. Poliwag then stands up and flinches, the poison beginning to take its toll. Looks like its almost ready to faint. Bandit looks back to you and grins confidently, ready to try out his new form. What will you do now?<br />
<br />
<b>Latias10:</b> After ensuring Surskit’s safety, the small bug looks up at you with hope glimmering in her eyes. Swampert roars loudly, still riddled by confusion and Surskit flinches in your arms. Ledy opens his mouth and charges a Psybeam for a few moments as Swampert begins to slowly make his way out of the swamp. As soon as both his huge feet are on the solid part of the swamp area, Ledy fires off the full charged Psybeam, smacking Swampert in the head for strong damage. Due to the power of the beam, Swampert’s confusion worsens and he feels so confused he drops to the ground, creating a huge thud which causes an Earthquake effect and you are knocked to the ground. Ledy then takes the opportunity and fires close to Swampert and unleashes a Silver Wind right in his back, causing the swamp creature to roar in pain. Seems like Swampert is almost ready to pass out. What will you do? </span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Cyan"><b>Faiyaa:</b> As Gyarados charged a fatal beam of energy, you release Shuri to do her stuff. She buzzes about happily as you state your orders. Shuri seems optimistic considering the circumstances you find yourselves in. Concentrating all her energy into a bright light she emit’s a bright Flash which blinds Gyarados, who begins to thrash about wildly, the orb of energy in his mouth still there. You flinch, knowing that this could get really dangerous, ensuring that Psyduck remains safe. It looks up at you, weakly saying, “…Duck?” You could swear that the small duck was smiling at you, grateful for your help. Shuri then decides on a different tactic, she suddenly disappears, moving too fast for you to see. Gyarados, completely blinded can’t even anticipate it when Shuri reppears to the side and knocks Gyarados with a Faint Attack, knocking the huge beast off course for his Hyper Beam. Gyarados then fires off the fatal beam, and luckily for you and Psyduck, it skims the two of you, leaving a huge tunnel in the ground. You feel a wave of relief flood over you as Gyarados begins to roar loudly, trying to regain his sight. What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: Cyan">Gary sighed in relief as the Hyper Beam just missed them. &quot;Great job, Shuri! Keep up the good work! Now try using an Icy Wind on it, and when you finish, try another Flash! It seems to be working well. If that fails, use a Silver Wind on it, followed by a Fury Cutter. Keep trying to aim for the head too, but always keep your distance if it startes to attack physically!&quot; Gary then turned to the Psyduck. &quot;See? Everything will be alright. Shuri and I will make sure that no Gyarados will come near you!&quot; He smiled and gently pet it on the head, trying to calm it down. In his opinion, if the Psyduck were to start panicking, that could be a problem.</span></div>

<b>SkepticReptile:</b>Kimberley drinks the Soda Pop, the fluid regaining her some health and energy. Corphish watches curiously and if Corphish could snort, then he’d most certainly be snorting right about now. Kimberley then listens to your orders and launches herself towards Corphish who braces himself with a Hardening of the body. The Thunderpunch that Kimberley just launched is effective, and Corphish feels a bit paralysed as a result. Paralyzed to the spot, Kimberley takes her chance at another Thunderpunch, and Corphish charges a Crabhammer and smashes it into Kimberley’s fist and she is send hurling backwards from the impact. Corphish then crouches over, his energy levels dropping. Kimberley’s head leaf then glows green as the remains of Corphishs health and energy are transferred to her. Corphish then drops to the ground, KO’ed. **Kimberley gains 1 Level-Up!** Will you capture it, or will you continue on with your journey? </span>

&quot;What do you think, Kimberly? Should we capture it, or let it continue to live in the lake?<br />
<br />
Kimberly is just emerging from her astonishing victory. Out of fury, she launches several stars at the body. It barely moves. The Grovyle is clearly still irritated by Corphish. Justin knows what he should do, now.<br />
<br />
&quot;That thing has quite an attitude problem, and I don't want it influencing any of you guys.&quot; Kimberly sighs out of relief. &quot;How about we continue exploring the island? <b>Turqouise River</b> looks quite nice.&quot;<br />

<b>Ythrelancus:</b> Axtan flaps his wings as hard as he can and manages to hover over the land and drops the Remoraid onto the ground, it flops around wildly firing off Aurora Beams in every direction. Axtan lands on the ground and approaches the fish, using a Flash attack. You cover your eyes as the bright flash blinds the small fish and it begins to panick more, firing off an Aurora Beam that hits Axtan in the wing, severely damaging it. Axtan cries out in pain and hops backwards, firing off a NightShade in retaliation which hits Remoraid for good damage. Remoraid is now blind and his health is dropping a lot. Axtan’s wing is too damaged for him to fly. What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: mediumturquoise">&quot;Yes good, drop it drop it. Here here, yes!&quot; Axtan successfully dropped the fish onto the ground. Centin covered his eyes so that he will not be blinded by the flash attack. However, the remoraid begins to panic even more. Soon, it hit Axtan, damaging it's wing. It's chain reaction led it to a night shade attack, with cause the remoraid to be severely hit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Return, Axtan,&quot; Centin returns his natu to the pokeball. &quot;Go, Hemy,&quot; and out comes a Lv 5 female spheal into play. &quot;Alright Hemy, your first battle. Take a good grip of concentration, and use powder snow if it retaliates and if I fail this next move,&quot; said Centin to his new pokemon. Of course, Hemy didn't know what does <i>her master's next move</i> meant, so she just concentrated to trying to do a powder snow if anything out of the ordinary happens, she just assumed that her master will inform her about any sort of failure. &quot;Go, lureball,&quot; Centin throws a lure ball to the remoraid with an attempt to catch it.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 9px">Note: Just so you know, I'm going to be on vacation for 1 or 2 weeks, so I left both my natu and my swinub in the daycare.
