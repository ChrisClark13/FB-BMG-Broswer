<b>Latias10:</b><span style="color: SeaGreen">Ledy, who is visibly getting quite exhausted from the battle, approaches Swampert, who weakly stands and stares Ledy right in the eyes. Ledy, intimidated by this, flies back slightly as Swampert roars loudly, trying to dishearten him from continuing his assault. Shouting words of encouragement, Ledy summons the courage and opens his mouth and charges the biggest Psybeam he can muster, releasing it upon Swampert, it hit’s the Swampert right in between the eyes. The psychic energy is absorbed in Swampert’s brain and confuses him even more. Stumbling about, Swampert tries a last attack to finish Ledy off; A Mud Shot, which strikes Ledy in the chest, causing a lot of discomfort and pain to him. Summoming every last part of his energy, Ledy fires off a Silver Wind which strikes Swampert and due to lack of energy and health, Swampert drops to the wet swamp ground, KO’ed. **Level up for Ledy** <br />
<br />
Unusually, the swamp waters rise and engulf Swampert, and drag the huge beast back into its depths. After congratulating Ledy you turn your attention to the Surskit in your arms. She looks up at you, and weakly smiles.. Then a light blue aura surrounds her as the swamp waters begin to rise at the bank, the water lifts in to the air in a huge block and Surskit shouts out, “KIT!” and the water separates into pillars and snakes off in to the distance. Walking to the bank, you notice a set of steps that snake downwards, however you cannot see what is down there. You look at Surskit who smiles and psychically sends a message to your mind, “I’ll see you later.. Congratulations..” She then disappears. What will you do?</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: SeaGreen">After Ledy finished off the Swampert Catherine took a shiny red and white pokeball from her belt and pressed the button on it. A red light came out and hit the tired bug sucking him into it. Catherine then put the pokeball back to its spot. Catherine looked down at the Surskit and smiled at the little bug She then stared in surprised as the creature glowed blue and the waves began to do very odd things. She was even more surprised when she noticed the steps heading downards. Catherine then heard Surskit's message play in her head before the bug disappeared. Catherine blinked slowly not sure whatto think of what the bug had said. Could the bug and the Swampert be working together she asked herself. She then decided to head down the steps and see what adventure awaited her down there. So she carefully started to make her way down them.</span></div>

<b>ZoraJolteon:</b> Releasing Tropius and returning Wooper and Slowqueen, you use Tropius to tow the raft. The old man’s eyes light up in glee as you fling rope over Tropius’ legs and attach it to the raft. Letting out a solemn roar, Tropius flapped his huge wings and began to move towards what you hope you pointed to was Sapphire Island. Sfter about 5 minutes of travelling, you realise that you’re nowhere near land and you turn to the old man, who you assume is the leader of the group. He stares back at you with bright red eyes and laughs sinisterly, “Well well well.. “ He says in a low tone, “Seems we’re lost again eh?!” His body then began to twitch wildly as his form began to shrink, and his clothes fell off his form. A wicked laugh floods your hearing as a Dusclops stands where the old man was.. “You see, the thing is human, I’m starving and well, me and the others think that you and your pokemon will make a grand meal..” As Dusclops says this, the others then ‘melt’ into the raft, leaving a pile of clothes behind them. And 6 Ghosts appear; Haunter, Gastly, Shuppet, Duskull, Sableye and a Misdreavus. They all look at you madly and lick their lips. “We have been stranded for months in this vast open sea, we once lived on the island we spoke about, it was a harmony for Ghost types and they were all wiped out.. The island is no more and now we search for a new island to take over and call our own.. But we need food first. And you served your purpose!” Dusclops then sends a Shadow Punch at you, and Tropius begins to flail as he flies causing the ghost to tumble and miss. You gasp in relief and look into the distance as Dusclops rises onto his feet. You notice what looks like a small port. You assume its Sapphire Island and it will take you 10 mins to get there. What will you do?<br />

<b>Faiyaa:</b> Shuri shakes her small head, which feels like its spinning. Shaking off a slight feeling of nausea, she spits something up which resembles vomit onto Gyarados’ back. If Shuri could laugh, she most certainly would be now as Gyarados roared in what would be disgust. He glares directly at Shuri and then begins to spin around? His movements become quite smooth as he jiggles about performing a Dragon Dance, raising his Attack and Speed. As Gyarados does this, Shuri begins to spin around rapidly, creating a small twister of her own, when she stops, you look at her claws and they look sharper, and she feels ready to take on Gyarados, she then Hardens her body so she is even more prepared to take on Gyarados. As Gyarados goes for Shuri to have a Bite of her, she Screeches loudly! You cover your ears to try and stop your eardrums from bursting and Gyarados seems to react in a similar fashion, shaking his head around wildly in pain, almost knocking Shuri’s small form flying. <br />
<br />
Shuri then takes the iniative and flies into Gyarados and cuts him with a Fury Cutter and then immediately takes off and flies back round for another, which has increased in attack power, she slashes Gyarados in the chest and leaves a huge slash mark which begins to seep blood.. Gyarados then roars in pain, and begins to move around in circles in the water, thinking it’s another Dragon Dance, Shuri keeps her distance; a wise choice as a huge Dragon Rage water tornado emerges from the water of the lake. Gyarados emerges from within the attack and grins at you, his fangs beared as he looks down at Psyduck who is scooped up in your arms. Letting out a shiver-inducing roar, the tornado begins to move towards you and Shuri.. How will you react?<br />
<br />
<b>Joe:</b>As the next round of the battle begins, you issue commands to Plusle and she nods, bearing an evil grin on her face. Lotad stands still, eyeing the vines which now cover Plusle’s tail and begins to chuckle at her. Furious, Plusle begins to charge towards Lotad, who doesn’t move as the vines extend further from the Leech Seed and begin to sap energy from Plusle’s body. She stops dead in her tracks and screeches in pain as the Leech Seed takes a good amount of energy. Lotad then glows green and his size doubles, Plusle’s energy feeding his growth. Plusle shakes herself and then restarts her assault, her body crackling with electrical energy, she slams into Lotad and sends him hurling backwards, and he lands in the water. Plusle stands at the bank of the lake and stares at him as Lotad flips back over, now double the size of Plusle and swims towards her. He stops in front of her and smirks as she prepares to smack him with a Quick Attack and she stops again, the vines have now engulfed her entire body and she is glowing a bright yellow as her energy is sapped to Lotad and she passes out KO’ed. The glow then subsides, and Lotad is now about 3 foot tall with a Plusle’s tail poking out of his rear. The Leech Seed retracts it’s vines back into the seed and it flies into Lotad’s mouth. Looking at you, he grins again and hops into the water, submerging into the depths. You rush to Plusle, and she has turned pale with lack of energy, and is deeply unconscious. You look about helplessly and notice a car coming towards you with a lady in. She pulls up and hops out, and you instantly recognise her to be Nurse Joy! Looking at you worriedly she says, “Oh goodness! What are you doing here?” Her eyes then wander to Plusle and she gasps, “Oh no! Did your Plusle get attacked by that Lotad? This is serious..Whats happened?” She questions. What will you do? </span><br />

<b>Ythrelancus:</b> You return Hemy and release Axtan again, who flaps about ready to finish off the battle. You ask him to perform a Flash attack, his eyes light up and you shield your eyes as a huge light blinds Remoraid, causing the small fish to panick even more. It flops about as you ready your Lure Ball. Axtan then flies up into air and his eyes glow black and a dark bolt of Nightshade strikes the small fish in the side, hitting it for good damage and causing the small Remoraid to faint. It reamins still and Axtan eyes it, ensuring it won’t get up for another round. Determined, you throw the Lure Ball, which bounces off Remoraid’s head and sucks the small fish within. It wobbles to and fro and the ping sound indicates a capture. **Congratulations! You have captured a Level 5 Male Remoraid** You pick up the Lure Ball and grin contentedly. You can now explore the River more, or go somewhere else. What will you do? <br />

<b>Joshua:</b> As Hayley blasts a Flamethrower into the sky, Bellossom watches in awe and turns to you, a glimmer of hope shining in her eyes. “Very well, I shall come with you!” She exclaims excitedly. She turns to another Bellossom and nods to it, the other Bellossom nods in return and takes the rest of the pokemon away to a safe place. Oddish wriggles about in your arms as Bellossom motions you to follow her. You do so and after about 5 minutes of walking, your surroundings drastically change. The sun no longer shines through the trees and you realise instantly that you must be within the Vileplume’s territory. Looking up to the tress, a thick layer of Stun Spore floats above you and you cover your mouth and nose to protect yourself from breathing the lethal powder in. Bellossom begins to cough, not used to this harsh environment. Oddish, who is bundled up in your arms looks up to you and says, “Oddd..ish?” It seems that she doesn’t like being here. All is quiet until you hear a loud voice, you all run to a bush and peer through it and you are greeted by the sight of a lot of Vileplume, Oddish’s with purple leaves and some Gloom with a man standing on a platform in front of them. He is adorned with a huge cloak covered in the lush jewels that are found in this part of Sapphire Island. You begin to eavesdrop and you hear the words, “And now, we’ll destroy those pathetic pokemon of the Bellossom clan and take over the Emerald Forest! It has been our dream since I first arrived here!” All of the pokemon cry out enthusiastically as you feel an anger take over you. Bellossom gasps quietly and begins to cry, fearing for her group. What will you do?<br />
<br />
<b>Dark Scizor:</b> Deciding that Neptune may not be able to muster the Pig Monkey’s next attacks, you summon Scizor to finish off the battle. In a flash of red, he stands tall, the sun which shines through the trees reflecting off his majestic red metal body. Speaking your orders, he keeps a tight focus on Mankey and nods solemnly. His wings begin to flutter as he takes to the air, with Mankey staring him down determinedly. As Mankey leaps up to attack Scizor with a Rage attack, Scizor’s wings glow a bright white as he slams in to Mankey and deals heavy damage. Scizor then powers up his right claw, it glows silver as he smashes Mankey who crashes to the ground, KO’ed (Mankey is capturable). Scizor then lands on the ground and eyes the small Pig Monkey, who doesn’t make a move. All is silent in the forest until you hear a loud screech. Both you and Scizor look up into the sky trying to find the cause of the noise. Until you hear a grunt and a thump.. And a Primeape stands on a tree stump in front of you. Unusual for a Primeape, he is stood quite still, but you see his eye twitching lightly. He pounds his fists together as he stares at you directly, you feeling unsure of how to react. Scizor raises his claws, taking a defensive stance as Primeape points at you, not even murmuring a sound. Suddenly a gust of wind flies through the forest and you could swear that you could hear the word “Enma…” in its howl. You find yourself unable to take your eyes away from Primeape’s and he stares at you directly, and you feel a shiver fall down your spine and land in your toes. Gulping, you wonder what he heck is going on. How will you react?<br />
<br />
<b>P-Arts:</b> Nidoqueen raises her arms in triumph as Jiroubi is returned to the safety of the Pokeball. Letting out a roar, she glares directly at you as you release Necross into the Emerald Forest. The 30foot Steelix filling the area quite easily, he releases a tremendous roar which causes the forest to shake. Shouting out your commands, Necross nods and his eyes flash a dark crimson red as his usual calm manner transforms into that of a blinded rage. He roars once more as he swings his huge tail and slams it into Nidoqueen who is sent hurling backwards. She slams into a tree and knocks it down, holding her head she stands up and an orange aura surrounds her as she uses her SuperPower, approaching Necross and slamming into him, knocking him back. However Nidoqueen’s counter attack enrages Necross further and a red aura engulfs his huge body as his attack power is heightened. Letting out an intense roar yet again, he makes his way across the ground, his immense weight causing the ground to shake, Nidoqueen looks up helplessly as he slams his midriff into her torso, winding her and sending the Poison behemoth hurling backwards landing on her back, but she doesn’t get up. This sight causes Necross’ rage to diminish and he takes a deep breath, his mindset returning to normal. <br />
<br />
Nidoqueen struggles to get up and then flexes her arms, cracking the joints back into place. Necross then curls into a tight ball as best he can and begins to roll around for a few moments to build up momentum, he then approaches Nidoqueen, his Rollout attack causing all obstacles in his way to be hurled to the side as if they weighed as much as a feather. Nidoqueen braces herself and places her arms in front of her, and waits for Necross to impact. She glows a bright white as she summons as much energy as she can for her Strength attack. Necross hits her full on and she roars out loud as she slams her arms into his body, holding the huge beast back with an impressive display of Strength. She then realises that her arms can’t hold out and is crushed as Necross’ weight falls over her, whipping up a cloud of dust. As the dust clears, Necross has managed to stop himself and Nidoqueen is laid on the ground, panting heavily, she slowly gets up and raises her arms, roaring. Turning his head, Necross nods to you as he waits for his next orders. What will you do? <br />

<b>Latias10:</b> Returning Ledy you slowly approach the stairs and peer down them, being unable to see the bottom. You decide to venture down them and you do so with great care, taking each step carefully and cautiously. After a good 10 minutes of descending you come across the bottom, and a huge temple is stood in front of you which is coated in a brown aura. It stands tall, with pictures of different water pokemon etched into its stone structure. You approach it slowly and a bright light comes over the area, lighting it up so you can see clearly. Wondering where it came from a Lanturn appears in front of you and bounces about, looking at you curiously. “Ah chosen one you are yes?” You’re unsure of what to do until Lanturn says, “Well well I say I say, we’d better get acquainted then uh huh uh huh!!” Lanturn then does a spin and laughs out loud. “If you want to know my name then I have some questions for you. No worries lady, all the information you give will remain confidential!” A cheesy grin spread over Lanturns face as a slab of stone and a chisel appear in front of you with these questions on to answer;<br />
<br />
Name:<br />
Age:<br />
Pokemon on your team:<br />
How the heck did you get here?!: <br />
<br />
Lanturn nods, “Take as long as ya like, got plenty of time ya know!!! When ya done, pass me the slab and we’ll get acquainted.. Oh yes!” You blink, completely confused by this eccentric Lanturn. What will you do?<br />
<br />
<b>Silver Wind:</b> Issuing your commands to Scarlet, she nods and buzzes in anticipation as Whiscash looks at the both of you dopily and lets out a big yawn, showing how thrilling he actually thinks this battle is. Scarlet frowns and then opens her mouth, releasing a barrage of star shaped rays which pelt Whiscash in the head, and he moans in pain and then glares at Scarlet who begins to concentrate as a harsh wind picks up and a Future Sight attack suddenly appears which strikes Scarlet who sets up her Safeguard, protecting her from damage. Whiscash then snorts loudly and comes to the bank of the swamp and opens his mouth and just sits there.. Scarlet then bursts forward and releases a barrage of green flames; a Dragonbreath right into Whiscash’s mouth, and it disappears into his bowels, causing no harm at all. Whiscash licks his lips and then wiggles his whiskers about for a moment and 4 Whiscash’s appear from within his body, a Double Team. All 5 Whiscash’s then hop onto the bank, each one causing a thud as they land, sending tremors through the ground which causes you to fall on your backside. Looking at them, you wonder why he wants to battle on the land, which would put him at a disadvantage.. Scarlet buzzes above them looking down confused. What will you do?<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Cyan"><b>Faiyaa:</b> Shuri shakes her small head, which feels like its spinning. Shaking off a slight feeling of nausea, she spits something up which resembles vomit onto Gyarados’ back. If Shuri could laugh, she most certainly would be now as Gyarados roared in what would be disgust. He glares directly at Shuri and then begins to spin around? His movements become quite smooth as he jiggles about performing a Dragon Dance, raising his Attack and Speed. As Gyarados does this, Shuri begins to spin around rapidly, creating a small twister of her own, when she stops, you look at her claws and they look sharper, and she feels ready to take on Gyarados, she then Hardens her body so she is even more prepared to take on Gyarados. As Gyarados goes for Shuri to have a Bite of her, she Screeches loudly! You cover your ears to try and stop your eardrums from bursting and Gyarados seems to react in a similar fashion, shaking his head around wildly in pain, almost knocking Shuri’s small form flying. <br />
<br />
Shuri then takes the iniative and flies into Gyarados and cuts him with a Fury Cutter and then immediately takes off and flies back round for another, which has increased in attack power, she slashes Gyarados in the chest and leaves a huge slash mark which begins to seep blood.. Gyarados then roars in pain, and begins to move around in circles in the water, thinking it’s another Dragon Dance, Shuri keeps her distance; a wise choice as a huge Dragon Rage water tornado emerges from the water of the lake. Gyarados emerges from within the attack and grins at you, his fangs beared as he looks down at Psyduck who is scooped up in your arms. Letting out a shiver-inducing roar, the tornado begins to move towards you and Shuri.. How will you react?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: Cyan">Upon seeing the giant Dragon Rage twister heading for them, Gary stood up, and pulled out a Potion from his bag with one hand, holding the Psyduck with the other. &quot;You're doing a great job, Shuri, use this; it'll make you feel better.&quot; He quickly sprayed her with the Potion. Still standing on his feet, ready to run from the twister if he had to, he called out to Shuri, &quot;Alright, keep up the good work! This guy means business, and so do we. Keep up with the Screeching at it; it seems to distract it a lot. then, try and fire some more Silver Winds at it. Mix the Silver Winds with a Gust too, to make your Silver Wind tornado combo! Remember to try and keep your distance too, I'm not sure how many close-up attacks you can take.&quot; Gary bit his lip and watched intently, slightly nervous about both his Ninjask's and the Psyduck's safety.</span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: LimeGreen"><b>Emerald Jungle: Please reply in <u>LimeGreen</u></b><b>P-Arts:</b> Nidoqueen raises her arms in triumph as Jiroubi is returned to the safety of the Pokeball. Letting out a roar, she glares directly at you as you release Necross into the Emerald Forest. The 30foot Steelix filling the area quite easily, he releases a tremendous roar which causes the forest to shake. Shouting out your commands, Necross nods and his eyes flash a dark crimson red as his usual calm manner transforms into that of a blinded rage. He roars once more as he swings his huge tail and slams it into Nidoqueen who is sent hurling backwards. She slams into a tree and knocks it down, holding her head she stands up and an orange aura surrounds her as she uses her SuperPower, approaching Necross and slamming into him, knocking him back. However Nidoqueen’s counter attack enrages Necross further and a red aura engulfs his huge body as his attack power is heightened. Letting out an intense roar yet again, he makes his way across the ground, his immense weight causing the ground to shake, Nidoqueen looks up helplessly as he slams his midriff into her torso, winding her and sending the Poison behemoth hurling backwards landing on her back, but she doesn’t get up. This sight causes Necross’ rage to diminish and he takes a deep breath, his mindset returning to normal. <br />
<br />
Nidoqueen struggles to get up and then flexes her arms, cracking the joints back into place. Necross then curls into a tight ball as best he can and begins to roll around for a few moments to build up momentum, he then approaches Nidoqueen, his Rollout attack causing all obstacles in his way to be hurled to the side as if they weighed as much as a feather. Nidoqueen braces herself and places her arms in front of her, and waits for Necross to impact. She glows a bright white as she summons as much energy as she can for her Strength attack. Necross hits her full on and she roars out loud as she slams her arms into his body, holding the huge beast back with an impressive display of Strength. She then realises that her arms can’t hold out and is crushed as Necross’ weight falls over her, whipping up a cloud of dust. As the dust clears, Necross has managed to stop himself and Nidoqueen is laid on the ground, panting heavily, she slowly gets up and raises her arms, roaring. Turning his head, Necross nods to you as he waits for his next orders. What will you do?<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: LimeGreen">&quot;B-bloody hell, Necross!&quot; exclaimed James in shock as he stared at the scene of destruction caused by the Rollout attack, &quot;Next time, please watch it... you just missed me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Necross gave his trainer a patient look, clearly finding something amusing about the situation, &quot;No, I did not - you were over here.&quot;<br />
<br /> 
James shuffled nervously, &quot;Yeah, well... it seems weird, with you getting all &quot;mwahahahahaha&quot; on me. Boy, that sounded alot straighter in my head.&quot;<br />
<br />
Necross shook himself tensely, all humour gone, &quot;She... is very powerful.&quot;<br />
<br />
James bit his lip, &quot;Yeah... she is... you think Matrise could be like that someday?&quot;<br />
<br />
The steelix nodded, &quot;She has much potential... this has proven it to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The trainer looked at the hulking steel type, &quot;Alright, I've thought of something...&quot; He glanced nervously at the nidoqueen, &quot;Surpise her with a Rock Throw, then Dig, use momentum to force her into the air and another Rock Throw - when she goes for you--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll dissapear into the earth.&quot; The snake twisted towards his opponent, and the same seriousness shown earlier was on his features, before a powerful roar echoed into the skies, &quot;COME!&quot;</span></div>

<br />
<b>ForeverFlygon &amp; DarkMagic:</b> <span style="color: Red">You two need to reply together and ensure you're working together effeciently, sometimes you're confusing me and this isn't really any good. I'm advising you issue 3 attacks each for this battle, and only use 2 pokemon each as things are getting way out of hand and I'm feeling overwhelmed. Sorry about the trouble, and thanks for hopefully understanding.. </span><br />
Deciding that Feera takes on Blastoise while Aexlus takes on Feraligatr, you both discuss what you’re going to do and issue attacks. Feraligatr who is bounding through the water at high speed, with his almighty fangs exposed, is met with a nasty combination of a Mud Shot and Cotton Spore right in the mouth. Feraligatr stops and begin to spit and choke on the attacks as Salamence levitates over the top of Feraligatr’s head and fires a greeny blue flame at him, causing good damage and stunning him. Feraligatr then stares right up at Salamence and roars loudly. As Salamence fires off a Tri Attack at Feraligatr, it is met with a Hydro Pump which pushes the attack back up at Salamence and knocks him back, and Aexlus only just manages to keep his balance. Aexlus then releases Alakazam, who appears behind Feera, twirling her spoons, setting up a Reflect barrier to block the Hyper Beam. Blastoise fires off the beam and Reflect only just manages to keep it held back. Feera then releases Nookie, as Nookie appears from the ball, shiny stars surround him as he nods at the commands he is given. Flying in front of Blastoise, his eyes glow a white as hypnotic waves are released. Blastoise looks at Nookie and laughs out loud as he smashes into the Owl with an Ice punch, sending him flying backwards, plummeting towards the sea. Free then blasts Feraligatr with a Dragonbreath followed with a Hidden Power laced with the Fire Element. The attacks hit their mark, but don’t seem to damage Feraligatr much, who is concentrating on attacking Marshtomp and Flaaffy.<br />
<br />
As Flaaffy jumps off of Marshtomps back, she lands on Feraligatr and hits him with a Rock Smash, Feraligatr receives only light damage from this and hardly feels the Ice Punch that Marshtomp just delivered. Blastoise then looks to Feraligatr and nods. The two water titans then roar loudly in unison and Blastoise opens the turrets in his shell and fires off a powerful Hydro Cannon towards Free and Feera and then Feraligatr swings his mighty tail and knocks Flaaffy and Marshtomp flying away and then turns to Salamence and growls, glowing brown and then sending an Ancient Power attack at them. <br />

</blockquote><span style="color: aqua">Watching as the plan worked, in stopping the croc from eating my pokemon my smirk disappeared as the rest of the plan failed. These water behemoths refused to be pushed around. I hastily returned my Alakazam, Marshtomp, and Flaafy as I knew they would be in tremendous danger (not to mention they were about to get crushed by that ancient power). I looked back at FF and yelled at him to try a combination Hypnosis. I released Osiris my starting pokemon, my purple flying bug Venomoth. Emerging from the red light, the Venomoth fluttered its wings in surprise as it had never fought at an ocean before.<br />
&quot;Osiris listen closely these 2 pokemon here came to protect its evil friend who hurt our friend's pokemon. I want you to make them pay. Osiris you and Nookie should concentrate on that Blastoise. Salamence here, wants to take on Feraligatr.&quot;<br />
Salamence snorted blue flames from its nostrils as it narrowed its eyes and gave another steely gaze at the giant croc pokemon. <br />
&quot;Listen Salamence I want you to power up with a Dragon Dance then hit another Dragon Breath at it, then swoop down and hit another Tri Attack all the time aiming for its head and upper body.&quot;<br />
&quot;Osiris I want you to use Hypnosis with Nookie and then spread a Poison Powder at the direction of the two water pokemon. Follow this up by getting close to Blastoise and suck up health and energy with Giga Drain.&quot;<br />
I wasn't so sure what would happen now. These two pokemon had taken everything our pokemon could dish out so far and had shrugged off most of the attacks with ease. I turned back to FF to see what he would do to collaborate with my pokemon besides the double Hypnosis attack.....<br />
I shook my head as Osiris and Salamence began preparing their attacks. </span></div>

<b>Joshua:</b> As Hayley blasts a Flamethrower into the sky, Bellossom watches in awe and turns to you, a glimmer of hope shining in her eyes. “Very well, I shall come with you!” She exclaims excitedly. She turns to another Bellossom and nods to it, the other Bellossom nods in return and takes the rest of the pokemon away to a safe place. Oddish wriggles about in your arms as Bellossom motions you to follow her. You do so and after about 5 minutes of walking, your surroundings drastically change. The sun no longer shines through the trees and you realise instantly that you must be within the Vileplume’s territory. Looking up to the tress, a thick layer of Stun Spore floats above you and you cover your mouth and nose to protect yourself from breathing the lethal powder in. Bellossom begins to cough, not used to this harsh environment. Oddish, who is bundled up in your arms looks up to you and says, “Oddd..ish?” It seems that she doesn’t like being here. All is quiet until you hear a loud voice, you all run to a bush and peer through it and you are greeted by the sight of a lot of Vileplume, Oddish’s with purple leaves and some Gloom with a man standing on a platform in front of them. He is adorned with a huge cloak covered in the lush jewels that are found in this part of Sapphire Island. You begin to eavesdrop and you hear the words, “And now, we’ll destroy those pathetic pokemon of the Bellossom clan and take over the Emerald Forest! It has been our dream since I first arrived here!” All of the pokemon cry out enthusiastically as you feel an anger take over you. Bellossom gasps quietly and begins to cry, fearing for her group. What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: Lime">Anger surges through Joshua, raising like magma inside a fiery volcano. &quot;Take Oddish, and hide somewhere safe,&quot; Joshua hisses to the grass Pokemon.<br />
<br />
Joshua bursts from the shrub which was once his hiding place, and a brilliant flash of red light surrounded him. Hayley the Flygon hovered at his right hand, and the monstrous behemoth Jamie the Swampert stood at his left. Beau the Scizor floated behind him, and Michael the Umbreon stood in front of him. His team of four valiant members stood, staring down the Vileplume.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, it's maggots like you who give humanity its bad name. Take over the Emerald Forest? How lame and unoriginal can you possibly be? And the whole cloak thing is just so pathetic. Ooh, he's wearing a scary cloak, and he's covered it in gems he's stolen. Big whoop from me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I challenge you, Mr. Tall, Dark and Screwy. Battle me and my team mates. We win, you...&quot; Joshua bites his tongue, to stifle the curses. &quot;You leave this place, and these poor Pokemon, and go to Hell. You win, I won't oppose you in your domination attempt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joshua's four Pokemon stood, ready for battle. Hayley herself was readying a Flamethrower, in case of emergencies.</span></div>

<b>Ythrelancus:</b> You return Hemy and release Axtan again, who flaps about ready to finish off the battle. You ask him to perform a Flash attack, his eyes light up and you shield your eyes as a huge light blinds Remoraid, causing the small fish to panick even more. It flops about as you ready your Lure Ball. Axtan then flies up into air and his eyes glow black and a dark bolt of Nightshade strikes the small fish in the side, hitting it for good damage and causing the small Remoraid to faint. It reamins still and Axtan eyes it, ensuring it won’t get up for another round. Determined, you throw the Lure Ball, which bounces off Remoraid’s head and sucks the small fish within. It wobbles to and fro and the ping sound indicates a capture. **Congratulations! You have captured a Level 5 Male Remoraid** You pick up the Lure Ball and grin contentedly. You can now explore the River more, or go somewhere else. What will you do? <br />

</blockquote><span style="color: mediumturquoise">&quot;Alright, I finally caught <i><b>the</b></i> remoraid. I never dream that this day would finally arrive!&quot; shouted and gasped Centin while jumping up and down like his swinub, well almost. His natu looked at him and flies towards him, having question marks on all over its face. &quot;Oh Axtan, you don't know? I know this remoraid since my field examination, it is where I met Denulge as well. You should ask Denulge, they are both from the same tribe..colony..flock, or just any quantifier you can use, he should be able to tell you more about Radii,&quot; explained Centin in a soothing pleasantry way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, where do we go from here?&quot; Centin sat down and opened up his map. He really wanted a change of pace, from the waters and soil, to the haze and gravels. Therefore, he has decided to go to the misty and icy Crystal Peak. But that decision wasn't just final yet. &quot;Hey, Axtan, come here and look at this,&quot; Centin calls his natu to come nearer to his map. He points and moves his fingers on the map as if directing them both to a certain location, which is the Crystal Peak. He did it twice in fact and then he asked his natu, &quot;So Axtan, we have 2 choices from here to the Crystal Peak. Which direction should we choose? I can't really pick, and since you gladly won this battle, I thought that it would be wiser to let you pick our next journey.&quot;<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: cyan"><b>Joe:</b>As the next round of the battle begins, you issue commands to Plusle and she nods, bearing an evil grin on her face. Lotad stands still, eyeing the vines which now cover Plusle’s tail and begins to chuckle at her. Furious, Plusle begins to charge towards Lotad, who doesn’t move as the vines extend further from the Leech Seed and begin to sap energy from Plusle’s body. She stops dead in her tracks and screeches in pain as the Leech Seed takes a good amount of energy. Lotad then glows green and his size doubles, Plusle’s energy feeding his growth. Plusle shakes herself and then restarts her assault, her body crackling with electrical energy, she slams into Lotad and sends him hurling backwards, and he lands in the water. Plusle stands at the bank of the lake and stares at him as Lotad flips back over, now double the size of Plusle and swims towards her. He stops in front of her and smirks as she prepares to smack him with a Quick Attack and she stops again, the vines have now engulfed her entire body and she is glowing a bright yellow as her energy is sapped to Lotad and she passes out KO’ed. The glow then subsides, and Lotad is now about 3 foot tall with a Plusle’s tail poking out of his rear. The Leech Seed retracts it’s vines back into the seed and it flies into Lotad’s mouth. Looking at you, he grins again and hops into the water, submerging into the depths. You rush to Plusle, and she has turned pale with lack of energy, and is deeply unconscious. You look about helplessly and notice a car coming towards you with a lady in. She pulls up and hops out, and you instantly recognise her to be Nurse Joy! Looking at you worriedly she says, “Oh goodness! What are you doing here?” Her eyes then wander to Plusle and she gasps, “Oh no! Did your Plusle get attacked by that Lotad? This is serious..Whats happened?” She questions. What will you do? </span></span>

He quickly took out her Pokeball, and returned her, so she could get some rest. He then turned to the Nurse Joy that had arrived on the scene. After hearing her questions, Joe answered quickly. <br />
&quot;Yes....Lotad....attack........Plusle.......Absorb.....Leech Seed...Lotlusle!&quot; <br />
Maybe a bit too quickly. He composed himself, and looked at the Nurse Joy. &quot;Right, we found the Plusle, and it attacked me, so I sent out Plusle, attacked it back, we battled, had fun, until Lotad got angry. It used Leech Seed, absorbed all of Plusles energy or health or whatever, and then it spouted a Plusle's tail out of it's backside. What do we do?&quot; Joe asked, and he waited for Nurse Joy to answer, while eyeing the Lotad-Plusle hybrid, warily.</span></span></div>

In a flash of red, he stands tall, the sun which shines through the trees reflecting off his majestic red metal body. Speaking your orders, he keeps a tight focus on Mankey and nods solemnly. His wings begin to flutter as he takes to the air, with Mankey staring him down determinedly. As Mankey leaps up to attack Scizor with a Rage attack, Scizor’s wings glow a bright white as he slams in to Mankey and deals heavy damage. Scizor then powers up his right claw, it glows silver as he smashes Mankey who crashes to the ground, KO’ed (Mankey is capturable). Scizor then lands on the ground and eyes the small Pig Monkey, who doesn’t make a move. All is silent in the forest until you hear a loud screech. Both you and Scizor look up into the sky trying to find the cause of the noise. Until you hear a grunt and a thump.. And a Primeape stands on a tree stump in front of you. Unusual for a Primeape, he is stood quite still, but you see his eye twitching lightly. He pounds his fists together as he stares at you directly, you feeling unsure of how to react. Scizor raises his claws, taking a defensive stance as Primeape points at you, not even murmuring a sound. Suddenly a gust of wind flies through the forest and you could swear that you could hear the word “Enma…” in its howl. You find yourself unable to take your eyes away from Primeape’s and he stares at you directly, and you feel a shiver fall down your spine and land in your toes. Gulping, you wonder what he heck is going on. How will you react?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: LimeGreen">Saturn was happy for getting rid of the Mankey but when he was celebrating, the pig monkey´s evolution, a Primeape, appeared. After seeing the fighting Pokémon in front of him, Saturn didn´t know what to do. His Scizor was wondering what was stopping his trainer from ordering attacks. Saturn finally decided that the best option was to battle. The last time that he tried to talk to one of those Pokémon, was a completely fail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Scizor, attack that Primeape with your Metal Claw followed by your Silver Wind. Finish it with a Wing Attack.&quot;<br />

Here's my last update and reply... so that means I want to continue my adventure<br />
<br />
Summarized it's like this... Arrived at beach, big wave came and slammed on me, got up and seen young breast-ful woman on shore unconscious, about to do CPR on her, Krabby smacks me, and now I'm mad and just sent out Magneto in this reply <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite8" alt=":D" title="Big Grin    :D" data-shortname=":D" /><br />

<b><span style="color: yellow">Southern Beach</span></b><br />
<br />
<span style="color: yellow"><b>Th3d-</b>You run over to the young woman. She's definitely unconscious and you try to wake her up. You shake her for a bit, but she's not responding. Then you say, loudly, &quot;Hmm... maybe I'll have to do CPR...&quot;<br />
<br />
Still, no response. So you hunch over and creep closer and closer to her lips. Suddenly...<br />
<br />
POW!<br />
<br />
You're smacks on the side of your face with some hard red thing. You look back to see what hit you and spot a Krabby. Krabby stands between you and the sleeping lady and looks very upset and concerned about her. It then turns to you and threatens you with it's claws. What will you do?</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: Yellow">Approaching the girl Thed was cautious at first. He checked his surroundings; making sure that the area was generally safe to enter. He bent down to the girl and tried to wake her up. He said in a loud voice while shaking her, &quot;Hey wake up!!! Can you hear me? Wake up!!&quot; But, to no avail; she just layed there still unconscious.<br />
<br />
Thed thought to himself, <i>Well... a litle CPR wouldn't hurt. Heck it might just wake her up.</i> He bent down lower so that his face was right in line with hers. His face going lower and lower almost touching hers; he closed his eyes. <i>Almost there....</i>, he thought to himself. But, before he knew it he was smacked in the face by something. Caught off guard and of course not one to like being hit in the face Thed sat up furious.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK who did that!?!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked around the beach with fire in his eyes. He spotted something red next to the girl; it was a Krabby. &quot;So, you were the one who hit me huh?&quot; Thed said angrily. The Krabby was not taking a liking to Thed and it's mouth started bubbling. Thed, also, was not taking a liking to the Krabby and his face started getting red.<br />
<br />
&quot;You... Grrrr... this girl is in need of help here and you're stopping me from doing so!!! And I really doubt you'll be able to give her the necessary help that she needs. Errr... you're getting on my nerves you little crab. Ok I'm over this..&quot;<br />
<br />
With that Thed threw a ball out and it opened up revealing a Magnemite. It buzzed and whirred for a second and then looked at the Krabby; it's mouth still bubbling in anger. Magneto then turned towards its trainer still looking furiously towards the Krabby. Magneto was a bit entertained by the sight for it never saw its trainer so angry. It then spied the exotic girl and then realized why its trainer was so pissed off... his animal instincts were at work. It gave a bit of a sigh and knew he would have to do something about this situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Magneto we need to help this girl out but the Krabbys in the way. Get it away from the girl by using a Metal Sound. Then once it's backed off use a Thunder Wave to paralyze it and buy me some time. I'll carry the girl to a safer spot, but if the Krabby somehow fights off the paralysis you'll need to fend it off with Tackles.&quot;</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px">Okay so as you know theres been a big rearrangement of updatees and this is who is in my group:<br />
<br />
<u>Emerald Forest:</u> P/Arts, Joshua, Dark Scizor<br />
<u>Lapis Lake:</u> Faiyaa, Joe, Golden Mew.<br />
<u>Jade Swamp:</u> Sasuke, Manji, Latias 10, <br />
<u>Ocean Waters and Reefs:</u> Dark Magic, Forever Flygon.<br />
Skrusti is also in my group, and I'm waiting for an introductory post from you ^^ Radical Edward, your request is being sorted out and I'll PM you if you are entering my group. <br />
<br />
So heres updates for those who replied to the last batch. Enjoy.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: Aqua"><b>Ocean Waters and Reefs: Please reply in <u>Aqua</u></b><br />
<br />
<b>DM &amp; FF:</b> I cannot update you two if only one of you posts. Please endeavour to work together in future as in the end you're both missing out on your adventure :\<br />
</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: Cyan"><b>Lapis Lake: Please reply in <u>Cyan</u></b><br />
<br />
<b>Faiyaa:</b> As the seering twister of flame and dragon energy came bounding towards you, parting the Lapis Lake waters as it did so. You quickly sprayed a Potion onto Shuri, relieving her and boosting her health, whilst doing so you reissue attacks to counter the approaching Dragon Rage. Gyarados pants heavily as the energy he used to summon his Dragon Rage drained him ever so slightly more. Psyduck wriggles around in your arms, panicking about the impending attack and squeaks weakly, “Psy psy..” whilst holding his head in ..pain? Shuri begins to whip a Gust attack, and then glows silver as she blasts some Silver Winds into the Gust for good measure, creating a beautiful tornado of a silver colour, the particles of the Silver Wind shining in the bright day sun. <br />
<br />
Shuri then lurches forward, which sends the SilverGust Tornado straight towards the Dragon Rage and the two attacks collide and stay still? You peer at them and are completely confounded until you notice Psyduck’s eyes glowing a dark blue; hes using Disable to stop the attacks! Psyduck groans in pain as the headache intensifies and the attack is sent hurling into the sky by a Confusion attack and it explodes, sending blasts of Silver Wind, Gust and Dragon Rage hurling across the sky. Psyduck’s eyes return to normal and he passes out, exhausted. Thanking the small duck quietly you watch as Gyarados begins to thrash about, getting increasingly irritated by the battle, while at the same time, he is panting deeply. Shuri backs away from Gyarados. Seems the next round could be the last, what will you do?<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Joe:</b> Nurse Joy looks at you with worry as you spout out random words until you find your composure and explain the situation somewhat calmly. Nurse Joy nods and then looks to Plusle, who is very pale and breathing heavily. “I see, well I think our main task is to help your Plusle first. Come with me in the car and we’ll go to the Pokemon Center I work at and I’ll explain more..” You tentatively nod as you and Nurse Joy hop into her pink car embellished with a red cross. After 5 minutes of driving you come to the Lapis Lake branch of the Pokemon Center and Nurse Joy ushers you in. As you enter, 2 Blisseys rush forward and take Plusle and take her to the Intensive Care unit to see what they can do. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile Nurse Joy sits down with you on a sofa and begins to explain whats happening. “Lately, we’ve had reports of a group of Lotad which have mutated somehow and can sap the energy, attacks and some of the characteristics of the pokemon they target. They use an advanced Leech Seed, which has the same concept as a normal Leech Seed but this one takes longer to activate and therefore the effects are much more deadly. It saps the lifeforce and Lotad uses it to grow large then it steals a body part which it will effectively use to aid the attack it stole from Plusle..” You feel your heart sink as Joy tells you this, and she then continues, “We’ve been trying to stop this group but they have a ringleader, as most groups do, this ringleader has been breeding with some unknown pokemon and we believe this is how they have obtained these weird characteristics” Suddenly, the Blisseys come out and nod to you, “Oh!” proclaims Nurse Joy, “Sounds like you can see Plusle now” she says with a smile. You move into the ward and Plusle is awake, she looks up at you weakly as Joy says, “Plusle is weak, and will need a lot of rest to get back to full strength, she was lucky” You nod as Nurse Joy begins to think and then asks you, “You know, we could prevent this from happening if we consult the Ringleader of this pack of Lotad ..Would you be willing to help me before other pokemon are injured?” What will you say?<br />
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: LimeGreen"><b>Emerald Jungle: Please reply in <u>LimeGreen</u></b><br />
<br />
<b>Joshua:</b> Bellossom and Oddish run off to hide as you bravely burst forth from the bushes to challenge the man. He looks at you and begins to laugh as the army of Vileplume around him wiggle their petals to warn and remind you of the deadly powders which reside within them. One of the Vileplume steps forwards and the man swings his arm outwards to stop her, “No Vileplume, I shall make this boy respect me as I made you respect me when I got here..” He smirks as he eyed Hayley curiously, and then a wicked smile spread across his features. “I know, we shall have a small tournament to decide what happens. The type we use must always be the same .. Now boy, my name is Narius, you’d best remember it!” Smirking, Narius reached down to his belt and plucked an Ultra Ball from it and threw it into the air revealing his pokemon.<br />
<br />
A red flash occurred and a huge dragon formed in the sky above the forest. A huge red body with red majestic wings sprouting from his back. The now released Salamence snarled at you, bearing a mouthful of sharp fangs. It then descends to the forest and lands on the ground and you can now see it quite clearly; its body is covered with scars and marks from previous battles, all in all the dragon looks quite battered. Nevertheless, the Vileplume all quiver at the sight of the huge dragon and Narius nods, “You shall see why they quiver in fear! Salamence, take to the skies! Come boy, let us battle!” Letting out a cackle, Narius readies himself for battle. What will you do?<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Dark Scizor:</b> Deciding to attack the Primeape, you issue attacks to Scizor, who nods and gets ready to attack and yet again a gust of wind flies through the forest. His right pincer glows grey as it powers up with Steel energy and he flies forwards and slams his claw into Primeape .. That is if Primeape was there, Scizor looks down to see his claw jammed into the tree trunk that Primeape was previously stood upon. Struggling to free himself, he looks around eagerly for the Pig Monkey to reappear. He flutters his wings slightly to prepare a Silver Wind just incase he is sneak attacked, but he isn’t. Scizor looks at you helplessly, perhaps Primeape wasn’t there at all?<br />
<br />
Suddenly you hear a loud voice coming from behind you, you turn and a girl is stood there. “HEYYY!” She shouts loudly and approaches you. “You didn’t by chance just see a Mankey or Primeape did you? Did you?!” She gasps as she sees the knocked out Mankey on the ground and she runs to see it. “What happened here?!” She demands, waiting for an answer. What will you do?<br />
<br />
<b>P-Arts:</b> Feeling quite nervous after your steel behemoth’s demonstration of ferocious power, you issue another set of attacks, and Necross listens solemnly, envisioning how the attacks will be performed in his head; a strategy to ensure maximum accuracy. Lifting his huge tail into the air, Nidoqueen prepares herself, expecting to be slammed by it, but is surprised as the tail is sent hurling into the ground, shaking the entire Emerald Forest and sending some large rocks from the earth beneath you. Nidoqueen braces herself and then clenches her fists, as Necross smashes his tail against the rocks sending them right towards her. Nidoqueen then opens her mouth and blasts the rocks with a coating of Icy Wind, then she spins around and smacks them with her tail, sending the Icy Rocks right back at Necross. Using his initiative, Necross hurls his huge form into the air and then smashes into the ground, leaving a huge crater where he entered. The Icy Rocks land in the hole, not touching Necross as his huge form tears through the earth.<br />
<br />
Nidoqueen closes her eyes and tries to sense where Necross is currently at but fails as the behemoth bursts from the earth, sending chunks of debris all over. You dart about the area, dodging the debris as it crashes into the ground. Necross smashes into Nidoqueen and sends her flying, she shuts her eyes tight as she regains her composure in the air and lands on her feet, panting heavily. She then charges her right fist with Fire energy and rushes towards Necross, who is feeling quite drained of energy after his assault and smashes the fist into his torso. Letting out an eardrum splitting roar of pain, Necross smashes Nidoqueen away with a flick of his tail and inspects the burn Nidoqueen just inflicted .. Seems it could get worse. Nidoqueen is panting heavily now and Necross has been burned. What will you do?<br />

</blockquote>Tom trudged off the boat and fumbled around for the map in his bag. After a few minutes and half of his bag upturned, the tattered map of the Water Zone appeared among the Pokéballs of his Pokémon in the side pocket of the bag. As he unrolled it, a small amount of dust blew into the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't think it was <i>that</i> long since I was last here. Anyway, from the look of the map, I may aswell investigate Diamond Falls. Other people may have not being able to find the underground source, but they've never had an experienced Water Trainer having a look,&quot; Tom muttered as he traced the route with his finger, over to the falls. &quot;From the look of it, a river runs from the Waterfall, so I may aswell ride on Guardian there,&quot;<br />
<br />
At that, he brandished a Pokéball from his bag and brought it to his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;You ready Gyarados? You're gonna have to help me alot!&quot;<br />

With that, he readied himself for the journey to <b>Diamond Falls</b>...</div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Cyan"><b>Faiyaa:</b> As the seering twister of flame and dragon energy came bounding towards you, parting the Lapis Lake waters as it did so. You quickly sprayed a Potion onto Shuri, relieving her and boosting her health, whilst doing so you reissue attacks to counter the approaching Dragon Rage. Gyarados pants heavily as the energy he used to summon his Dragon Rage drained him ever so slightly more. Psyduck wriggles around in your arms, panicking about the impending attack and squeaks weakly, “Psy psy..” whilst holding his head in ..pain? Shuri begins to whip a Gust attack, and then glows silver as she blasts some Silver Winds into the Gust for good measure, creating a beautiful tornado of a silver colour, the particles of the Silver Wind shining in the bright day sun. <br />
<br />
Shuri then lurches forward, which sends the SilverGust Tornado straight towards the Dragon Rage and the two attacks collide and stay still? You peer at them and are completely confounded until you notice Psyduck’s eyes glowing a dark blue; hes using Disable to stop the attacks! Psyduck groans in pain as the headache intensifies and the attack is sent hurling into the sky by a Confusion attack and it explodes, sending blasts of Silver Wind, Gust and Dragon Rage hurling across the sky. Psyduck’s eyes return to normal and he passes out, exhausted. Thanking the small duck quietly you watch as Gyarados begins to thrash about, getting increasingly irritated by the battle, while at the same time, he is panting deeply. Shuri backs away from Gyarados. Seems the next round could be the last, what will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: Cyan">Gary smiled as the Psyduck tried to help out and prevent whatever explosion would have happened by the two massive attacks colliding. He made sure he was okay, and thanked him. &quot;Thanks for the help, but you need to rest. You must be exhausted, and need all the health you can get.&quot; He then looked at the Gyarados and made good note of its state. &quot;Alright, Shuri, you're doing excellent work. The Gyarados is getting tired, and I'm not sure how much longer it will last. Try and save your own energy by continuing to keep your distance. Use a Double Team to confuse it, and then a Screech, followed by a Silver Wind from all directions! I know you can do this, keep it up!&quot; He watched the two battling pokemon, hoping that the Gyarados won't make a powerful final burst of energy.</span></div>

Deciding that Feera takes on Blastoise while Aexlus takes on Feraligatr, you both discuss what you’re going to do and issue attacks. Feraligatr who is bounding through the water at high speed, with his almighty fangs exposed, is met with a nasty combination of a Mud Shot and Cotton Spore right in the mouth. Feraligatr stops and begin to spit and choke on the attacks as Salamence levitates over the top of Feraligatr’s head and fires a greeny blue flame at him, causing good damage and stunning him. Feraligatr then stares right up at Salamence and roars loudly. As Salamence fires off a Tri Attack at Feraligatr, it is met with a Hydro Pump which pushes the attack back up at Salamence and knocks him back, and Aexlus only just manages to keep his balance. Aexlus then releases Alakazam, who appears behind Feera, twirling her spoons, setting up a Reflect barrier to block the Hyper Beam. Blastoise fires off the beam and Reflect only just manages to keep it held back. Feera then releases Nookie, as Nookie appears from the ball, shiny stars surround him as he nods at the commands he is given. Flying in front of Blastoise, his eyes glow a white as hypnotic waves are released. Blastoise looks at Nookie and laughs out loud as he smashes into the Owl with an Ice punch, sending him flying backwards, plummeting towards the sea. Free then blasts Feraligatr with a Dragonbreath followed with a Hidden Power laced with the Fire Element. The attacks hit their mark, but don’t seem to damage Feraligatr much, who is concentrating on attacking Marshtomp and Flaaffy.<br />
<br />
As Flaaffy jumps off of Marshtomps back, she lands on Feraligatr and hits him with a Rock Smash, Feraligatr receives only light damage from this and hardly feels the Ice Punch that Marshtomp just delivered. Blastoise then looks to Feraligatr and nods. The two water titans then roar loudly in unison and Blastoise opens the turrets in his shell and fires off a powerful Hydro Cannon towards Free and Feera and then Feraligatr swings his mighty tail and knocks Flaaffy and Marshtomp flying away and then turns to Salamence and growls, glowing brown and then sending an Ancient Power attack at them. </span></span>

Watching as the plan worked, in stopping the croc from eating my pokemon my smirk disappeared as the rest of the plan failed. These water behemoths refused to be pushed around. I hastily returned my Alakazam, Marshtomp, and Flaafy as I knew they would be in tremendous danger (not to mention they were about to get crushed by that ancient power). I looked back at FF and yelled at him to try a combination Hypnosis. I released Osiris my starting pokemon, my purple flying bug Venomoth. Emerging from the red light, the Venomoth fluttered its wings in surprise as it had never fought at an ocean before.<br />
&quot;Osiris listen closely these 2 pokemon here came to protect its evil friend who hurt our friend's pokemon. I want you to make them pay. Osiris you and Nookie should concentrate on that Blastoise. Salamence here, wants to take on Feraligatr.&quot;<br />
Salamence snorted blue flames from its nostrils as it narrowed its eyes and gave another steely gaze at the giant croc pokemon. <br />
&quot;Listen Salamence I want you to power up with a Dragon Dance then hit another Dragon Breath at it, then swoop down and hit another Tri Attack all the time aiming for its head and upper body.&quot;<br />
&quot;Osiris I want you to use Hypnosis with Nookie and then spread a Poison Powder at the direction of the two water pokemon. Follow this up by getting close to Blastoise and suck up health and energy with Giga Drain.&quot;<br />
I wasn't so sure what would happen now. These two pokemon had taken everything our pokemon could dish out so far and had shrugged off most of the attacks with ease. I turned back to FF to see what he would do to collaborate with my pokemon besides the double Hypnosis attack.....<br />
I shook my head as Osiris and Salamence began preparing their attacks.

</blockquote></span><span style="color: Cyan">Feera's eyes flicked from the battlefield the the pokemon who had just regained his balance and was now hoovering next to him, and owl with red wings. The wings reflected the sunlight like the blade of a knife, only a little more in the shade of red instead of clear silver, and Feera smiled inwards, he knew his friend would help him and DM overcome their opponents, and he had just the idea as to how that would happen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nookie, combine a Hypnosis with Venomoth, and make Feraligatr a tad bit sleepy! If you are succesful in that, Sky Attack Blastoise after sensing his action with Foresight! If you fail with Hypnosis, try a Fly attack from behind aimed at Feraligatr!&quot;<br />
<br />
Being hopeful that his and DM's plan would work, Feera fiddled with another pokéball just incase, but he eventually decides against using any other pokemon in this fight other than Nookie, unless he would become severely hurt.<br />
<br />
He held Mikozou a little closer, whispering to him as he looked down at his injured companion, and the bondage now applied to the bitten tail of the small fish. He hoped that keeping pressure on the wound would stop the bleeding. Blood was already over the bottom of Feera's shirt and his pants, but he didn't care in that exact moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, you'll be just fine soon enough.&quot; With gritted teeth he looked down at his opponents, and swore a silent oath he'd make them pay for what they had done, and what the possible could if they didn't stop them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Free, listen. Make sure you are as so that you can avoid any attack the water beasts send at you, but close enough so we can dive in if something should happen, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Free nodded slightly, eyeing the scene before him, the only thing to be heard was the wind in Nookies feather and Free's scaled wings, their quiet flapping, just like the quiet before the storm. Feera held his legs around Free's throat harder, to prevent falling of in case his dragon needed to do an avoiding maneuver.</span></div>

If you want to continue your current adventure, don't worry about finding the lastest update/reply; I've gotten the lastest reply/updates from all of you. I know that you, Archaic, had never gotten updated yet (since Loki was your last updator), so that takes care of you, unless you want to go somewhere else. <br />
<br />
If you want to start a new adventure, make sure to mention where you want to go next. Please have either answers sent in PMs, so I should be waiting for 5-6 PMs if possible.<br />
<br />
And just a little notice for ~*Centin*~: Me and Shinjara were not clear on where you want to go, since it sounds like you want to go to both places, so please PM me if you want to go to Lapis Lake or Emerald Village.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if I get all PMs by the end of this week, I should have updates next week.<br />
<br />
So until then, I'll be waiting. <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" data-shortname=":)" /> </span></div>

<br />
<span style="color: seagreen">His Primeape snarled and beat his chest as Sasuke watched with interest, while the rain continued to pour down around them and the two pokemon went to battle. Kabutops raised it’s brow slightly as Enma began to glow an electric blue as he focused his energy, his fur crackling with power and standing on end. Working himself up into a rage he burst forward, swiping furiously at Kabutops who hardened it’s shell to lesson the damage. Seemingly unimpressed the shellfish pokemon swung one of it’s arms, clouting Enma with the flat side of the scythe and sending him reeling backwards. Sasuke tried to dive out of the way but his Primeape barrelled into him, knocking him backwards into the mud for a second time.<br />
<br />
Sasuke cursed as he stood up and brushed himself off, just as Kabutops began to roar at the top of it’s voice and clash it’s scythes together. He walked over to help Enma, reaching out a hand to pull up his companion who grunted and knocked it to the side, bouncing up onto his feet without any sign of hesitation in his eyes. <i>’’That’s it Enma, you can do this,’’</i> Sasuke encouraged him through gritted teeth.<br />
<br />
Looking up to the skies desperately for a sign, he formulated a plan in his head. The heavy rain was still pouring down his face and showing no signs of stopping. Looking over at Kabutops he noted that it too was dripping wet, and the rain would magnify any electric attacks. <i>’’Go and pummel it with Thunderpunches,’’</i> Sasuke commanded instantly, <i>''but aim for the soft parts around it's shell,''</i> he added as an afterthought, remembering how little damage fury swipes had done. <i>’’And remember this time!’’</i> he ordered as Enma moved forward, the metal collars around his fists already crackling with electricity. <i>’’If it makes any attempt to hit you with those scythes duck and give it a low kick to the legs. Then seismic toss it to the ground.’’</i> Enma grunted furiously, flashing Kabutops a look of pure hatred. Sasuke almost smiled to himself at the thought that the angrier his Primeape got the harder he would try, but this Kabutops was a foe unlike any other he had faced before.</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: LimeGreen">Kaya found herself stepping off the boat onto the warm beach of Sapphire Island. Sheilding her eyes from the sun, she smiled and stretched; she for one couldn't wait to get off that darned boat. &quot;Damn seasickness..&quot; she grumbled. Looking about, she watched as all the other trainers moved to the areas they wanted to explore. Eyeing the TPP she had just received, she placed it into her bag, making a mental note to remember it was actually there incase of trouble. If only it could help her decide where to go.<br />
<br />
Plucking a pokeball from her belt, she smiled and released her newest companion; Sakura. The Victreebel screamed in delight as she realised she was on a warm beach in the sun. She moved her leaf into the sky to absorb as much sunlight as possible. &quot;Wow Sakura&quot; Kaya smiled, &quot;You look more beautiful thanks to that sunlight already&quot; Sakura smiled at her trainer then bounced up and down. &quot;Well we need to decide where to go.. any suggestions?&quot; Sakura bounded over to Kaya and stretched her vine to point over into the direction of the Emerald Forest. Kaya then giggled, &quot;Asking a Poisonous Grass type where they want to go .. of course they'd want to go to the forest&quot; Kaya giggled as Sakura frowned a little. <br />
<br />
Giving Sakura a stroke on the leaf, the two then set off to the <b>Emerald Forest.</b></span></span></div>

<span style="color: LimeGreen"><span style="font-size: 9px"><b>Dark Scizor:</b> Deciding to attack the Primeape, you issue attacks to Scizor, who nods and gets ready to attack and yet again a gust of wind flies through the forest. His right pincer glows grey as it powers up with Steel energy and he flies forwards and slams his claw into Primeape .. That is if Primeape was there, Scizor looks down to see his claw jammed into the tree trunk that Primeape was previously stood upon. Struggling to free himself, he looks around eagerly for the Pig Monkey to reappear. He flutters his wings slightly to prepare a Silver Wind just incase he is sneak attacked, but he isn’t. Scizor looks at you helplessly, perhaps Primeape wasn’t there at all?<br />
<br />
Suddenly you hear a loud voice coming from behind you, you turn and a girl is stood there. “HEYYY!” She shouts loudly and approaches you. “You didn’t by chance just see a Mankey or Primeape did you? Did you?!” She gasps as she sees the knocked out Mankey on the ground and she runs to see it. “What happened here?!” She demands, waiting for an answer. What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: LimeGreen">Saturn replied to the impatient girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mankey was in a tree and I thought that its tail was some kind of stick. It was blocking my way so I took it away. But then, I realized that the thing that I tossed was a Mankey and it was very angry. He tried to attack me so I used my Yanma but it defeated her. After that, I used my Beedrill but he was almost defeated. Finally, I released my Scizor and he won the battle. While we were celebrating, Primeape appeared. I thought that it was going to act like Mankey so I ordered Scizor to attack. Before it was hit by the attacks, it vanished. That is the whole story.&quot;<br />
<br />
After he finished talking, Saturn returned his bug Pokémon back to his ball and waited for the girl´s reaction.</span></div>
