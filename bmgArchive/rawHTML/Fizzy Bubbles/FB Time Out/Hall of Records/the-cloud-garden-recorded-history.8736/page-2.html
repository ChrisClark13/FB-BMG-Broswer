<br />
Shooting a deathly glare toward the bushes where Treecko has hidden, you soon turn your attention to the Mankey in front of you, a look of disdain clear upon your face, and a hint of malice appearing in your eyes. Your impatience is beginning to show and while you feel battling this Mankey is beneath you, you decide to humour Treekco just for the hell of it. Swiftly releasing Omekekashi, who appears from her Pokéball in a dazzlingly bright flash of light, she stares at Mankey with disapproval, obviously sharing the same sentiments as her trainer - that this Mankey is beneath her.<br />
<br />
While Mankey attempts to show off and intimidate Omekekashi by jumping up and down, screeching loudly while beating it’s chest, Omekekashi simply Leers right back at it, but Mankey doesn’t appear to be paying too much attention as it is so full of itself and it’s supposed “intimidation tactics”, a move it soon realises is useless, not to mention very stupid indeed, as Omekekashi lowers her head and charges the monkey, inflicting a rather nasty gash just above Mankey’s left leg with Horn Attack. Mankey immediately halts its power play attempts, its arrogant shrieking turning into pain filled cries in less than a second.<br />
<br />
Furious that its attempts to intimidate Omekekashi haven’t proven successful, and that it is now paying for it with an injury, Mankey quickly retaliates, swiping out at Omekekashi with Scratch, it’s sharp nails swiping her across the face. Omekekashi isn’t the least put off by the attack though, if anything it has only made her more determined to show this creature exactly what she is capable of. Lunging forward once more she uses her horn to gouge deeper into Mankey’s wound. Mankey is stunned by the sheer ferocity of it’s opponent and decides in a split second that it is time to fight rather than show off. Glaring at Omekekashi with hatred, Mankey attempts a Low Kick, falling backward onto it’s hands, and lashing out with it’s leg to hit Omekekashi in the right leg. Fortunately for Omekekashi, Mankey has kicked with it’s injured leg and while it does impact Omekekashi, it causes her little damage. Mankey then hops to it’s feet, no longer interesting in playing and more interested in mashing Omekekashi to a pulp as it stares hard at her with rage in its eyes.<br />
<br />
Your reaction?</span></span>

<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="font-size: 10px"><span style="color: Lime">A smirk finds its way onto Mamoru's face at watching Omekekashi's performance. She's doing even better than he expected. He'll have to find some way to reward her properly later. For now though...<br />
<br />
&quot;And still it refuses to give up? This Mankey is either very brave, or very stupid. Likely the latter, given what it's just attempted. It shouldn't pose you any further problems. Finish the job <a href="http://bmgf.bulbagarden.net/showpost.php?p=158505&amp;postcount=6" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fbmgf.bulbagarden.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D158505%26postcount%3D6&amp;hash=d774bf921586c8912d45313a0f5c8840" rel="noopener">Omekekashi</a> my dear. This foolish Mankey can be of no more entertainment to us. It can't even fight back through your hard shell. Gouge into it with your Horn Attack until it learns its lesson and its place, or can never learn anything again.&quot;<br />
<br />
The battle which had up until this point held Mamoru's attention utterly now starts to disinterest him, and he turns his head slowly to focus his gaze upon where the Treeko dived into the bushes.<br />
&quot;I believe we've passed your test. Are you coming out, or do we need to come in after you? I can guarentee that you won't like the latter.&quot;</span></span></div>

<span style="color: limegreen"><span style="color: lime">Quilava: While you watch Nidoran and Nidoqueen curiously, Mike watches you out of the corner of his eye as though contemplating something before finally speaking, “Well, there is something you may be able to help with....” he replies hesitantly, as though still not sure he should be mentioning it to you, but he continues anyway. “About five years ago now, there was a large rock slide in the section of forest the Nidoran herd reside in. They had settled in a valley located next to a mountain containing special ores, some of those ores being special shards and stones which are responsible for their evolution. Unfortunately the rock slide cut off the entrance to the tunnels leading into the mountainside and the Nidoking and Nidoqueen, being the strongest of the herd, who tried to clear the passage, were killed in subsequent rock slides due to the instability of the mountain. Over the past few years we’ve managed to stabilise a lot of the land and clear a good portion of the tunnel with controlled detonations, but we’ve come to a standstill as there is something behind a wall of rocks preventing us from going any further. We don’t know what it is but we can’t risk blasting that blockage without causing a cave in.”</span><br />
<br />
Watching you carefully, Mike continues with the story. “Recently we’ve discovered another entrance to the mountain coming in from the other side but unfortunately the opening is far too small for any humans to enter. We don’t own any Pokémon small enough to get inside and find out what the obstruction is and while we could use explosives to make the entrance larger, it will be at least three months before any more will arrive and in the meantime the Scyther have been attacking the Nidoran, picking off their young one by one over the past several months in an attempt to show their superiority here in the forest.”<br />
<br />
Shaking his head sadly, Mike looks to you once more, “I wouldn’t normally ask a stranger for help, but if you have any Pokémon small enough to enter the second tunnel, and if you are willing to help, we would appreciate your aide....”</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: lime">Stephen stares and listens attentively as Mike tells the story of what has been happening in the forest. As he hears Mike's request, Stephen gulps, before he looks at Mike with a smile. &quot;I would be glad to help.&quot; Stephen begins. &quot;Now, as for the Pokemon necessary...&quot; Stephen reaces to his belt, and throws two Pokeballs, containing Taillow and Bulbasaur. Bulbasaur looks around, a bit out of place, as just five minutes ago it had been caught in the Haunted Mansion. However, it embraces the oppurtinity, and looks to Stephen, as Taillow lands on his shoulder. &quot;Well, I'm not sure exactly the size of Pokemon that you will need. Taillow and Bulbasaur are willing. However, if these are not suitable, I have a Trapinch and a Spinarak, which I plan to evolve into an Ariados soon, which I can withdraw from Daycare on Monday, and use them for this task. So, I will give you the choice.&quot;</span></div>

<span style="color: red"><b>ades: </b>Deciding to begin your Cloud Garden journey upon the flat plateau of Comet’s Corner which overlooks most of the Cloud Garden, you stand and stare at the skies wondering if the rumours of shooting stars and meteor showers which are supposed to be common in this area, are true. Setting forth upon your adventure you release Water, your Onix, to provide you with a little company as your venture forth. While walking, you notice how deserted the land appears to be when you eventually come across an enormous crater in the earth which appears to span for miles. Oddly enough, you note there are many dwellings down there, at the bottom of the crater. It appears there is civilisation way out here after all, but who would want to live here, in the middle of nowhere? You see several trails leading to the bottom of the crater, some smooth which are most likely used for vehicles gaining access to the crater while others are more rugged, like makeshift stairs. At the top of one of the “stairways” leading to the crater is a signpost reading “Beta Settlement”. Will you investigate or would you prefer to move on?</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: Red">John struggled to keep his voice level as he peered down into the massive, absolutely gigantic crater below him. Feeling his legs shake unsteadily, he dropped down onto his knees and hugged the edge of the crater lip. Nestled within the crater were patches of houses and buildings. From this high up, they were nothing more than dots.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did I mention I was scared of heights?&quot; John said in a trembling voice.<br />
<br />
Water casually swung his tail around so John could hold on, and he did so with unabashed relief, for at that moment, a strong gust of wind nearly toppled him. John took a deep breath and closed his eyes.<br />
<br />
<i>Okay, okay. Now what do I do? I saw a path down there and it would be nice to have a break from all that walking. But on the other hand, I won't be catching any Pokemon. What to do...</i><br />
<br />
Water decided for him and with a huff of impatience, started to snake his way down into the crater. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! WAIT UP!&quot; <br />
<br />
John hastily followed Onix, cursing and shouting all the way down the steep flight of stairs. As he did so, John noticed a signpost with the words 'Beta Settlement' written upon it.</span></div>

<span style="color: burlywood"><b>Radical Edward: </b>Trying not to make any sudden movements, you back away from Tauros slowly, never breaking eye contact as you reach for Bast’s Friend Ball. Hoping you are a safe enough distance away before releasing your elegant kitty, your rise to your feet as Tauros’ attention focuses upon Bast whose fur bristles up upon catching sight of the wild bull.<br />
<br />
She immediately obeys your orders, attempting to Attract Tauros by making herself look as gorgeous as possible, but Tauros simple snorts derisively, not at all interested in her. With it’s Tail Whipping madly about causing dust to stir from the ground behind it, you begin to wonder if it was such a good idea pitting Delcatty against this creature, but it is too late to back out now, as Bast is already preparing to make her next move. With her body crouching close to the ground, she wriggles her behind in typical feline pouncing fashion before leaping forward and then streaking around to Tauros’ side to hit it with Tackle. Unfortunately for Bast, Tackling a Tauros is not unlike butting heads with a brick wall and she falls back to the ground, Tauros barely even feeling the hit.<br />
<br />
Finding itself under attack, Tauros becomes angry, rearing up high into the air while releasing a terrifyingly loud rumble that sounds like it’s somewhere between a roar and a long, drawn out snort before it’s front hooves hit the ground with a thud and it begins pawing at the ground with it’s head lowered and it’s eyes full of rage. Bast backs away quickly, awaiting your next orders, when Tauros begins charging for her, prepared to gouge her insides out with Horn Attack. What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: Burlywood">Ben watches as Bast's attacks bounce of tauros,who seems not even to feel them.He then watches in horror as the tauros's eyes grow even more furious at Bast's repeated attempts at harming it.Thinking fast, Ben shout's to her,hoping his orders will give Bast the upper hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bast! Try to sing to it and lull it to sleep, than, if it falls asleep, We'll try to tag team it!,&quot;with this, he releases Fealty the Electrike, the little electric puppy happily bouncing about and barking, eager for his orders.&quot;Alright little one,&quot;Smiles Ben, amused at the pokemon's antics in the face of danger,&quot;After Bast is done with her part, I need you to focus your speed into one burst, tackling the tauros's leg to try and cripple it, than use a thunder wave!&quot;</span></div>

:::Rainbow Waterfalls:::<br />
<br />
&quot;I am so glad we chose to explore here first Fleece.&quot; I smiled as I gazed down at my fluffy Mareep partner. The sun shone upon each droplet from the waterfall, acting as if the water were made of prisms. Rainbows flooded the place, and all in all it seemed like this place was the essence of peace. Sitting on a rock near the water I peered into my pack and looked over the things I had been given and bought when I started my journey. Potions, in case my pokemon fainted. Antidotes, poison was a nasty thing. Revives, just in case though I hoped not to ever have to use them. Escape ropes, again just in case. And pokeballs. I couldnt wait to use these. There were so many pokemon in the world, so many new creatures to study. I couldnt wait to watch the numbers rise on my pokedex. My hand rested on the Lure ball in my pack. Pulling it out I looked at it carefully. This was a special pokeball. Made just for catching water pokemon. This sent a shiver of excitement through me. Water pokemon were my favorite, though I chose Fleece and love her my first passion was water pokemon. I knew Fleece would have to be careful though, electric pokemon were strong against water and if she wasnt careful she could KO the pokemon before Id be able to catch it. But Id worry about that when the oppurtunity presented itself. For now I was content to explore the area and all it had to offer. </span></div>

Shooing Chowder off the bed so she can’t see what you get up to, she does what any typical Slowpoke would do - she takes a while to respond. When the door finally opens and the girl enters the room, passing lightly over the puddle of drool you had left on the floor, she gives you a cheeky smile when she sees you’re not only very much awake (in more ways than one), but are waiting for her.<br />
<br />
“It’s nice ta see ya ready an’ waitin’ luv,” she says, her eyes roaming hungrily over you before they fix upon Chowder who still hasn’t moved. “Oooooh! Ain’t she a lil’ dearie!” the girl cries, leaping across the bed (and you), to scoop Chowder up in her arms and give the little water Pokémon and affectionate cuddle.<br />
<br />
Frowning, you’re not too impressed with your Pokémon receiving the “attention” you should be, but before you have a chance to respond, you hear the sound of gunshots outside.<br />
<br />
“Blimey!” the girl cries, jumping to her feet. “The silly buggers are at it agin’!” Dropping chowder into your lap she races out of the room leaving you rather flustered and very much confused. What will you do?</span><br />

&quot;Jesus Bloody Christ what the hell is this? Can't a guy gets some sodding piece and quiet please?&quot;<br />

Hopping off of the bed he quickly gets dressed and Scoops Chowder up in his arms to take her along for the ride to see whats happeneing, moving towards the door ready to see what the hell is going on that needs gun fire around...&quot;unless it's a Robbery..or something..Oh this is all I need&quot; </span></div>

<br />
<span style="color: limegreen"><b>Quilava: </b>Mike eyes your two Pokémon, listening closely to your every word. He still seems a little hesitant, perhaps because he is unwilling to endanger your Pokémon, but he is obviously quite desperate to have asked for your help in the first place. “Any of those Pokémon should do,” he replies quietly, “but with the Scyther attacking on a more frequent basis, we’ll have to hurry. This little Nidoran, “ he continues, nodding toward the frightened Pokémon, “is one of only five left in the herd. There were once dozens of babies but....&quot; his words trailing off into silence as he stares at Nidoran cowering away from it’s newly evolved mother.<br />
<br />
“We must leave immediately,” he pipes up a few moments later, walking over to Nidoran who runs to him for protection. Having known Mike all of it’s life, Nidoran currently feels safer with him than with it’s mother. Mike lifts Nidoran into his arms, cradling the little Pokémon gently while his gaze turns toward Nidoqueen. “Don’t worry, give Nidoran some time and he’ll be fine. Now let’s head back to the valley so we can sort out this problem once and for all.” <br />
<br />
Nidoqueen nods and follows Mike as he joins you and leads you deeper into the forest. After a half hour walk you emerge into a beautiful valley with a river running through it, but what immediately catches your attention is a work camp set up by the side of the mountain. There are bulldozers and various other forms of heavy machinery littering the area, piles upon piles of rubble and two other forest rangers who wave to Mike as you approach. You see the tunnel entrance they are trying to unblock and the ranger’s obvious surprise at the sight of Nidoqueen makes this situation really hit home for you. You’ve walked into something much bigger than you had initially thought and it’s now making you rather uneasy.<br />
<br />
Mike quickly explains what has happened before leading you into the tunnel. You can see the work they have done has indeed stabilised the mountainside, but when you see the wall of rocks blocking them from going any further you understand that something needs to be done. Half an hour later you find yourself standing on the opposite side of the mountain with Mike who had left Nidoran and Nidoqueen behind with his workmates.<br />
<br />
“This is it,” Mike says nervously, eyeing the small hole which is no larger than a soccer ball. Gazing into it you can see there is a small tunnel leading further into the mountainside but you cannot see very far due to the darkness inside. “You can send in a Pokémon and we’ll attach this video camera to it,” he says, holding up a small helmet like thing with a camera on the top and a strap underneath, obviously to hold the helmet securely in place. “There is a flashlight fused onto the camera so your Pokémon can see what is ahead and a small microphone is set into the inside of the helmet.” Mike then hands you a walkie talkie. “You can communicate with your Pokémon using this. He’ll be able to hear everything you say, so if you think it’s too dangerous you can call him back at any time. Also, as an added safety measure we’ll attach this rope to him,” Mike continues, holding up a thin, but heavy duty length of chord. “If anything unexpected happens and he’s unable to return of his own accord, we can pull him out to safety.”<br />
<br />
Mike then looks at you earnestly. “I know I’m asking a lot of you but the final decision is yours. Please know that you don’t have to do this if you think it’s too dangerous.” Looking back and forth between Mike and the teeny tiny hole in the mountainside, you begin to weigh the options, wondering what to do.....</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: limegreen"><b>Archaic: </b>Mankey begins screeching in frustration, realising that its injured leg has severely hindered its chances of winning this battle, but arrogance aside, this is one feisty little monkey and it isn’t about to allow you to win without a fight. Hopping back up onto its feet it lunges for Omekekashi, attacking with a completely feral flurry of Scratches, completely giving in to its frustration from the humiliation it suffered during the last round of battle. Omekekashi is helpless to defend herself against Mankey’s onslaught, having no choice but to wait out Mankey’s attack and hope it tires out quickly. This happens soon enough, and although Omekekashi has taken a good amount of damage from the attack, she retaliates quickly, driving her horn deep into Mankey’s side the moment she has a chance. Mankey screeches in agony before being thrown to the ground where it clutches it’s bleeding belly tightly. While on the ground it lashes out with it’s good leg, hitting Omekekashi with Low Kick. She stumbles backward slightly but quickly regains her balance, attacking the injured Mankey with yet another Horn Attack but Mankey rolls out of the way at the last second, evading the full brunt of the attack.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, you turn to the bushes where Treecko had vanished, making it perfectly clear to the little wood gecko that you’re far from pleased with it’s childish tricks. Treecko slowly emerges from the bushes, it’s eyes showing the slightest hint of fear, perhaps a little regret for thinking it had underestimated you, but mostly it’s expression is showing respect, something it had not shown before. <br />
<br />
“Well,” Treecko says in a chirpy voice, obviously trying to hide the fact it is slightly intimidated by you now, “You are good, but not out of the woods yet.” It then nods toward Omekekashi and Mankey. Omekekashi has been injured, but nowhere near as badly as the exhausted and bleeding Mankey. It won’t take much to put this one out of it’s misery, if it doesn’t escape first. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: mediumorchid"><b>MYSTERY ISLAND</b></span><br />
<span style="color: mediumorchid"><b>Arn: </b>Less than impressed to find that playtime is over, you quickly get yourself together, scoop Chowder up and head out the door to see what’s going on. Surprisingly enough the Saloon, which had been full only a few moments before, is now empty except for the bartender who is calmly wiping down the bar as though nothing has happened. His expression is bland, showing he is used to this sort of behaviour, so you head down the stairs and out through the Saloon doors, briefly wondering how the mess of your Missy/Glalie battle had been cleared up so quickly.<br />
<br />
Once outside you find there are people everywhere, mostly gathered along either side of the street as though watching a parade. There are Rapidash tied to the railing outside of the Saloon who are drinking from a trough of water, and the people in the street are dressed strangely, kind of like they did in the old cowboy movies. Ignoring the faint tune of Time Warp playing somewhere in the back of your mind, you take a few steps forward to get a better view of what’s going on when you see two men facing off against one another in the middle of the street, their hands hovering over gun holsters on their hips. <br />
<br />
Trying to come to grips with what is going on, the sudden stark realisation of exactly what is happening chills you to the core. You don't know how or why this has happened, but you are no longer exploring a ghost town, you are standing in the middle of a <b>real</b> town, a town of the <b>past</b>, and you are about to witness your very first cowboy showdown.<br />
<br />
You notice the same girl you had encountered in the room moments before, standing on the sidelines with everyone else. You also notice that she’s looking more worried than excited/curious as she had been when she raced down here, and just as you see the two cowboys reach for their guns she runs into the street toward one of them screaming out, “NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!” Your reaction?</span><br />

<span style="color: red"><b>ades: </b>Rather nervous at the prospect of approaching a strange settlement way out in the middle of nowhere, you stare down into the crater for quite some time, wondering what on earth to do before Water finally makes the decision for you, dashing off down the side of the crater. Left with no choice but to follow, you race off after him, taking the rugged stairs two at a time in a desperate attempt to catch up. You almost tumble a few times and briefly wonder if you’ll make it down there without breaking your neck in the process, but after a minute Water suddenly stops dead in the middle of the trail. Finally catching up with him, panting heavily while trying to catch your breath, you don’t even think to find the reason for his abrupt halt until you hear a faint, “Nineeeee,” close by. Frowing, you look up and see an injured Ninetales laying on the path. It looks pretty badly beaten up and the fang marks on it’s neck cause a chill to run up and down your spine. This Ninetales has not only been outnumbered in battle judging from the condition it’s in, but it’s been poisoned. You’re going to have to seek some medical attention for it quickly if it has any hope of surviving.<br />
<br />
Carefully lifting the beautiful cream-colored fox into your arms you place it gently on Water’s back before climbing up behind it to hold it steady, and without even waiting for your instructions, Water continues his advance down into the depths of the crater, knowing there must be help available somewhere within the Beta Settlement. After a few minutes you reach the bottom of the crater only to find there aren’t many people around but you soon come across a sign with several arrows pointing toward the locations printed on it.<br />

<span style="color: aqua"><b>WolfinOutlawAsi: </b>Deciding to do the touristy thing and take a trip to the Rainbow Waterfalls you find you are awestruck by the magnificence of the place. Set in a deep valley, the mountains surrounding the area are a perfect backdrop for the many dozens of waterfalls cascading into the river below which winds off somewhere into the distance. The spray from the water creates a fine mist which seems to hang in the air causing a permanent array of rainbows to hang in the skies above, and the lush green foliage has attracted many Pokémon, some of which you can see wandering around in the valley below. There are several long wooden bridges spanning the area high above the river and you can see manmade trails leading down the side of the mountain. There are many people about, some travelling alone, some travelling in groups, as well as several couples finding this to be the perfect romantic setting as they traverse the area, totally absorbed in one another.<br />
<br />
So while there appear to be several options available to you, you eye the river below, deciding to hike down one of the mountain trails leading to the bottom of the valley as this is where you are most likely to find the Water Pokémon you are searching for. You can hear the sounds of movement in the bushes by the side of the trail, possibly wild Pokémon frightened off by the sound of somebody approaching, but you soon find yourself faced with something rather interesting. The Ekans and Sunkern lazing by the side of the path, soaking up the warm rays of the sun, don’t interest you half as much as the Treecko hanging upside down from an overhanging tree branch. It’s staring at you with a big smile on it’s face, and when you stop to take a closer look at it, it sticks out it’s tongue in a playful manner. Looks like you’ve encountered one cheeky little gecko. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: burlywood"><b>DELIBIRD RIDGE</b></span><br />
<span style="color: burlywood"><b>Radical Edward: </b>Worried about Bast’s ability to handle Tauros on her own you release Fealty, unable to suppress a smile due to your amusement over his antics, despite the immediate danger. Quickly returning your attention to the matter at hand you instruct Bast to trying Singing Tauros to sleep and so she begins to emit a soft, soothing tune which drifts lazily through the crisp morning air. Tauros, still full of rage, charges for her, seemingly unaffected by Bast’s song, but Bast doesn’t stop singing, her sweet tune becoming louder with each passing moment. <br />
<br />
Seeing his friend in danger, Fealty leaps into action, charging straight for Tauros’ front leg, colliding hard with the rampaging bull. Tauros stumbles, falling heavily onto it’s front legs, roaring in agony as hits the ground. Unfortunately for Fealty, Tauros comes crashing down on top of him, pinning him beneath its enormous weight. Desperately trying to save himself from being crushed to death, Fealty releases a Thunder Wave, and as Tauros’ body begins to shudder from the electrical current moving through it, Fealty manages to wriggle out from beneath it. Unfortunately, Tauros had inflicted quite a lot of damage upon your electric pup due to the sheer force of the impact as it came crashing down, and Fealty is panting hard, trying to catch his breath. Bast on the other hand is in perfect condition, saved by her teammate, her song still filling the air as Tauros manages to somehow regain it’s feet. <br />
<br />
You stare at the bull in disbelief, amazed it can even stand after taking such heavy damage to it’s front legs, not to mention the electrical assault, but it’s up and it’s angry. As it focuses upon Bast it’s eyelids begin to droop, but the pain it is feeling from its ungraceful fall is helping it fight the effects of Bast’s sleep inducing song. Tauros lurches forward, albeit unsteadily, to Tackle Bast but she reacts quickly, her stealthy feline moves allowing her to evade the attack just in the nick of time. What will you do now?</span></span></div>

<span style="color: limegreen"><b>Archaic: </b>Mankey begins screeching in frustration, realising that its injured leg has severely hindered its chances of winning this battle, but arrogance aside, this is one feisty little monkey and it isn’t about to allow you to win without a fight. Hopping back up onto its feet it lunges for Omekekashi, attacking with a completely feral flurry of Scratches, completely giving in to its frustration from the humiliation it suffered during the last round of battle. Omekekashi is helpless to defend herself against Mankey’s onslaught, having no choice but to wait out Mankey’s attack and hope it tires out quickly. This happens soon enough, and although Omekekashi has taken a good amount of damage from the attack, she retaliates quickly, driving her horn deep into Mankey’s side the moment she has a chance. Mankey screeches in agony before being thrown to the ground where it clutches it’s bleeding belly tightly. While on the ground it lashes out with it’s good leg, hitting Omekekashi with Low Kick. She stumbles backward slightly but quickly regains her balance, attacking the injured Mankey with yet another Horn Attack but Mankey rolls out of the way at the last second, evading the full brunt of the attack.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, you turn to the bushes where Treecko had vanished, making it perfectly clear to the little wood gecko that you’re far from pleased with it’s childish tricks. Treecko slowly emerges from the bushes, it’s eyes showing the slightest hint of fear, perhaps a little regret for thinking it had underestimated you, but mostly it’s expression is showing respect, something it had not shown before. <br />
<br />
“Well,” Treecko says in a chirpy voice, obviously trying to hide the fact it is slightly intimidated by you now, “You are good, but not out of the woods yet.” It then nods toward Omekekashi and Mankey. Omekekashi has been injured, but nowhere near as badly as the exhausted and bleeding Mankey. It won’t take much to put this one out of it’s misery, if it doesn’t escape first. What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: Lime">&quot;I thank you for your concern, but I assure you, it's entirely unnecessary. My girl knows how to take care of herself, and it's not like we didn't come prepared for a few a few slight scratches in any case. She'll be well rested and ready to battle again soon enough. And until then...well, it's not like I <i>only</i> brought Omekekashi with me either...&quot;<br />
<br />
Still smirking, Mamoru half-turns back to the battle, being careful to keep an eye on Treecko, not trusting the little bugger to scamper off if it saw an opportunity. It might be scared of him now, but just being intimidated doesn't mean it's going to obey every single little word he said. Best to not give it any chances to have any &quot;smart&quot; ideas.<br />

:::Rainbow Waterfalls:::<br />
Grinning despite myself and stifling a laugh, I couldnt keep my eyes off the silly pokemon in front of me. It had stuck out its tounge at me, completly unafraid, and this both amused me and made me curious. Certainly humans had come down here before, so it couldnt be that hes never seen one. Even more amused at my next thought I figured he must have seen humans before but found them as playthings rather than a big threat. Fleece hid behind me, slightly afraid of the fact that the other pokemon was unafraid. I placed one hand on Fleece, stared at the Treecko for a long moment, then began to sneak closer to it. &quot;Ok Fleece..&quot; I whispered as we got slightly closer. &quot;When I give the word I want you to do <b>Flash</b>. With any luck it will at least fall out of the tree...&quot; I found myself trying not to laugh again. XD <br />
&quot;Then I want you to <b>Tackle</b> it, but show some restraint. When its weakened enough I want to try to catch it.&quot;<br />
After all, catching a pokemon is the best way to study it ^v~</span><br />

Seeing his friend in danger, Fealty leaps into action, charging straight for Tauros’ front leg, colliding hard with the rampaging bull. Tauros stumbles, falling heavily onto it’s front legs, roaring in agony as hits the ground. Unfortunately for Fealty, Tauros comes crashing down on top of him, pinning him beneath its enormous weight. Desperately trying to save himself from being crushed to death, Fealty releases a Thunder Wave, and as Tauros’ body begins to shudder from the electrical current moving through it, Fealty manages to wriggle out from beneath it. Unfortunately, Tauros had inflicted quite a lot of damage upon your electric pup due to the sheer force of the impact as it came crashing down, and Fealty is panting hard, trying to catch his breath. Bast on the other hand is in perfect condition, saved by her teammate, her song still filling the air as Tauros manages to somehow regain it’s feet. <br />
<br />
You stare at the bull in disbelief, amazed it can even stand after taking such heavy damage to it’s front legs, not to mention the electrical assault, but it’s up and it’s angry. As it focuses upon Bast it’s eyelids begin to droop, but the pain it is feeling from its ungraceful fall is helping it fight the effects of Bast’s sleep inducing song. Tauros lurches forward, albeit unsteadily, to Tackle Bast but she reacts quickly, her stealthy feline moves allowing her to evade the attack just in the nick of time. What will you do now?</span></span>

<span style="color: Burlywood"><span style="font-size: 9px">Ben lets out a sigh of relief as Fealty manages to struggle out from under the bull,Badley hurt, but still alive.he then recalls the little pup,and presses the &quot;Send&quot; button on his pokedex,sending Fealty to his new owner, thanking him silently for saving Bast and wishing him a good new life.Running over to bast, he quickly feeds her a small capsule,an X-Attack,knowing that she'll need all the power she can get in the battle against the hugely aggressive bull.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bast, start this round with an assist, than sing a bit more to keep Tauros drowsy,alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bast nods her head in agreement, than braces herself for the next round.Ben,however, is still concerned for her safty, and reaches for the pokeball attached to his Bandolier, throwing it on the ground.in a burst of white light, Atlas appearsarching his neck and roaring, glad to be out in the open air.Ben smiles at the majestic sight, than gives him his instructions<br />
&quot;Alright,Atlas,You shall be Bast's backup.if she gets in over her head, you must see that she lives through it, than return to my side,OK?&quot;<br />
<br />
The large pokemon then nods solemnley, turning his head toward the battle.</span></span></div>

<span style="color: red"><b>COMET’S CORNER</b></span><br />
<span style="color: red"><b>ades: </b>Rather nervous at the prospect of approaching a strange settlement way out in the middle of nowhere, you stare down into the crater for quite some time, wondering what on earth to do before Water finally makes the decision for you, dashing off down the side of the crater. Left with no choice but to follow, you race off after him, taking the rugged stairs two at a time in a desperate attempt to catch up. You almost tumble a few times and briefly wonder if you’ll make it down there without breaking your neck in the process, but after a minute Water suddenly stops dead in the middle of the trail. Finally catching up with him, panting heavily while trying to catch your breath, you don’t even think to find the reason for his abrupt halt until you hear a faint, “Nineeeee,” close by. Frowing, you look up and see an injured Ninetales laying on the path. It looks pretty badly beaten up and the fang marks on it’s neck cause a chill to run up and down your spine. This Ninetales has not only been outnumbered in battle judging from the condition it’s in, but it’s been poisoned. You’re going to have to seek some medical attention for it quickly if it has any hope of surviving.<br />
<br />
Carefully lifting the beautiful cream-colored fox into your arms you place it gently on Water’s back before climbing up behind it to hold it steady, and without even waiting for your instructions, Water continues his advance down into the depths of the crater, knowing there must be help available somewhere within the Beta Settlement. After a few minutes you reach the bottom of the crater only to find there aren’t many people around but you soon come across a sign with several arrows pointing toward the locations printed on it.<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center">Pokémon Center <span style="font-size: 9px">--&gt;</span><br />

</blockquote><span style="color: Red">John fought back the bile that forced itself up as he examined the Ninetales' injuries. What sort of despicable creature could do such a thing? Its cream coloured coat was stained with dark bruises and dried blood, but John could still feel the silky smoothness of the fur as he held Ninetales in his arms. John worried that Ninetales could be in serious trouble. The wild Pokemon lay silent and twitched every so often- a clear sign of poison.<br />
<br />
A shudder ran through Water's body as the crater finally flattened out into a clear plain. They were almost there.<br />
&quot;Don't worry Ninetales, we're here. Water, lets go to the Pokémon Centre.&quot; John said, spying a sign that gave the directions of the town. <br />
<br />
Absently, John wondered why Water was listening to him now. He had never let John ride on him before, and did so with no argument at all. Definitely strange, although maybe Water realised that Ninetales was in no condition to be jolted around by walking.<br />
<br />
Water sped towards the Pokemon Centre carefully.</span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: limegreen"><b>Quilava: </b>Mike eyes your two Pokémon, listening closely to your every word. He still seems a little hesitant, perhaps because he is unwilling to endanger your Pokémon, but he is obviously quite desperate to have asked for your help in the first place. “Any of those Pokémon should do,” he replies quietly, “but with the Scyther attacking on a more frequent basis, we’ll have to hurry. This little Nidoran, “ he continues, nodding toward the frightened Pokémon, “is one of only five left in the herd. There were once dozens of babies but....&quot; his words trailing off into silence as he stares at Nidoran cowering away from it’s newly evolved mother.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px">“We must leave immediately,” he pipes up a few moments later, walking over to Nidoran who runs to him for protection. Having known Mike all of it’s life, Nidoran currently feels safer with him than with it’s mother. Mike lifts Nidoran into his arms, cradling the little Pokémon gently while his gaze turns toward Nidoqueen. “Don’t worry, give Nidoran some time and he’ll be fine. Now let’s head back to the valley so we can sort out this problem once and for all.” </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px">Nidoqueen nods and follows Mike as he joins you and leads you deeper into the forest. After a half hour walk you emerge into a beautiful valley with a river running through it, but what immediately catches your attention is a work camp set up by the side of the mountain. There are bulldozers and various other forms of heavy machinery littering the area, piles upon piles of rubble and two other forest rangers who wave to Mike as you approach. You see the tunnel entrance they are trying to unblock and the ranger’s obvious surprise at the sight of Nidoqueen makes this situation really hit home for you. You’ve walked into something much bigger than you had initially thought and it’s now making you rather uneasy.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px">Mike quickly explains what has happened before leading you into the tunnel. You can see the work they have done has indeed stabilised the mountainside, but when you see the wall of rocks blocking them from going any further you understand that something needs to be done. Half an hour later you find yourself standing on the opposite side of the mountain with Mike who had left Nidoran and Nidoqueen behind with his workmates.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px">“This is it,” Mike says nervously, eyeing the small hole which is no larger than a soccer ball. Gazing into it you can see there is a small tunnel leading further into the mountainside but you cannot see very far due to the darkness inside. “You can send in a Pokémon and we’ll attach this video camera to it,” he says, holding up a small helmet like thing with a camera on the top and a strap underneath, obviously to hold the helmet securely in place. “There is a flashlight fused onto the camera so your Pokémon can see what is ahead and a small microphone is set into the inside of the helmet.” Mike then hands you a walkie talkie. “You can communicate with your Pokémon using this. He’ll be able to hear everything you say, so if you think it’s too dangerous you can call him back at any time. Also, as an added safety measure we’ll attach this rope to him,” Mike continues, holding up a thin, but heavy duty length of chord. “If anything unexpected happens and he’s unable to return of his own accord, we can pull him out to safety.”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px">Mike then looks at you earnestly. “I know I’m asking a lot of you but the final decision is yours. Please know that you don’t have to do this if you think it’s too dangerous.” Looking back and forth between Mike and the teeny tiny hole in the mountainside, you begin to weigh the options, wondering what to do.....</span></span></span>

</blockquote>Happy B-day again Tess. =) *can not think of anything to give you*(=P)<br />
<br />
<span style="color: lime">Listening intently to Mike's words, Stephen sighs a sigh of relief, as he finds that the Pokemon that he chooses to use could be in slight danger, though could be pulled to safety at any time. Stephen sighs, and then sharply inhales. &quot;Hm...&quot; Stephen murmurs, as he mulls over the situation in his head. &quot;Well, there's no time like the present.&quot; He kneels over. &quot;Bulbasaur, I know I just met you, but do you think that you could do this for me?&quot; Bulbasaur stares into Stephen's eyes for a few moments, before she looks to the ground. Suddenly, she looks up at Stephen, with a cry of &quot;Bulba!&quot;, in agreement. Stephen takes the helmet from Mike, and places it on Bulbasaur's head. Stephen attaches the rope, and nods. Bulbasaur nods as well, and jumps into the hole. Stephen bites his lip, as he quietly mutters, &quot;Be careful.&quot;</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: red">Wayne sighed in relief as he entered the Cloud Garden. Looking at the beautiful scenery in front of him, Wayne then looked down and then bent down to carry his companion, his brave, grass dinosaur. “Hey Bulbasaur, don’t you think this is the most beautiful place you’ve ever seen? You could probably enjoy any place in the Cloud Garden, wouldn't you Bulbasaur.” Nodding in agreement Bulbasaur then started to move around, as a sign of wanting to get down from his trainers arms. Letting Bulbasaur down easily Wayne then smiled. “Don’t you think Venonat would enjoy this weather and panorama?&quot; Bulbasaur then started to move around playfully and happily at the thought of being with his teammate. Wayne then unclipped a pokeball from his belt and then the round device released a purple bug. Grinning at his two playful pokemon Wayne then decided where to go. “Hey guys how do you feel about going to the Comet’s Corner? They say it‘s one of the most pleasant places of the Cloud Garden.” The two pokemon started to jump in joy and then the two pokemon and the trainer, one in each side of their trainer, started to walk towards their new destination, The Comet’s Corner.</span></span></div>

<span style="color: mediumorchid"><b>Arn: </b>Less than impressed to find that playtime is over, you quickly get yourself together, scoop Chowder up and head out the door to see what’s going on. Surprisingly enough the Saloon, which had been full only a few moments before, is now empty except for the bartender who is calmly wiping down the bar as though nothing has happened. His expression is bland, showing he is used to this sort of behaviour, so you head down the stairs and out through the Saloon doors, briefly wondering how the mess of your Missy/Glalie battle had been cleared up so quickly.<br />
<br />
Once outside you find there are people everywhere, mostly gathered along either side of the street as though watching a parade. There are Rapidash tied to the railing outside of the Saloon who are drinking from a trough of water, and the people in the street are dressed strangely, kind of like they did in the old cowboy movies. Ignoring the faint tune of Time Warp playing somewhere in the back of your mind, you take a few steps forward to get a better view of what’s going on when you see two men facing off against one another in the middle of the street, their hands hovering over gun holsters on their hips. <br />
<br />
Trying to come to grips with what is going on, the sudden stark realisation of exactly what is happening chills you to the core. You don't know how or why this has happened, but you are no longer exploring a ghost town, you are standing in the middle of a <b>real</b> town, a town of the <b>past</b>, and you are about to witness your very first cowboy showdown.<br />
<br />
You notice the same girl you had encountered in the room moments before, standing on the sidelines with everyone else. You also notice that she’s looking more worried than excited/curious as she had been when she raced down here, and just as you see the two cowboys reach for their guns she runs into the street toward one of them screaming out, “NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!” Your reaction?</span><br />

</blockquote><span style="color: mediumorchid">Waltzing out of the lavish bedroom and into the main Sallon area he sudenly realised that the saloon he was in weas the exact same one that MissyD and her friend occupied, but as he looked around nistead of death, and the ocassional Ghostie there was life and hell it looked like a lot of it, the bar tha he destroyed a tad while battling MissyD Was clean, it was like brand new and lookde bloody amazing, scanning the room about he saw the girl who enterde the bedroom runnig outside with a weird look on her face, following dwonthe stairsh burst through the swinging doors to be meated with yet another amazing sight, the sun was shininghevily, the decaying buildings standing as strong as ever and people...atual living andbreathing people were walking and talking, and screamin where the large crowd was infront of him that the girl was pushing thruogh, continuing his followign he got to the front where 2 cowboys were standing across from each other, bothhands dangling over a Gun holster that held two seperate silver guns awaiting their usage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, looks like a showdown at Dawn type of thing, never thought i'd get to see one of these while I was alive, but this is a....&quot; As he was in midsentence e notices the girl running straight towards one of the Shooters screaming for him to stop, looking at the other he sees the gunh olster popping open and thinking quickly he comes up with a plan, of sorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, this is bad bad bad, Chowder you need to act as quick as possible Cast a Double Reflect infront of the Guy and Girl to hopefully protect them from the bullet.&quot;</span></div>

<br />
<span style="color: limegreen"><b>Quilava: </b>Bulbasaur eagerly agrees to help, possibly partly to impress her new master, possibly because the thought of a little adventure and/or excitement appeals to her, but whatever the case she is happy to feel useful and once buckled up to all of her safety equipment and with her helmet securely in place, enters the miniscule hole in the mountainside showing no fear whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Mike grins, impressed with Bulbasaur’s bravery, but his expression soon turns to one of concentration as he watches the monitor held in his hands, examining the tunnel carefully as Bulba proceeds along it. Glancing over his shoulder you also watch her progress, the small flashlight attached to her helmet giving off enough light for her to see at least a meter in front due to the small confines of the tunnel walls. At one point Mike notices something on the monitor and asks Bulba to look to her right so he can have a better view, but it turns out to be nothing more than some moist clay embedded within the tunnel wall. <br />
<br />
Proceeding further along the tunnel you can see that it is becoming wider, and as Bulbasaur looks around, you can also see there is more head room above her. Mike smiles, pleased with this development as this means it will be possible for him to send Bulbasaur back in with Pokéballs containing larger and stronger Pokémon should they be needed. Bulba travels further the tunnel which appears to be growing larger and is now at least one meter wide and almost two metres high but Bulbasaur soon stops, pointing her head downward to reveal a large drop in front of her. As the camera attached to her helmet peers into the darkness there is no way to tell just how far it goes but neither you or Mike are prepared to endanger her so he instructs her to look around the edges of the hole and you can see that on the left there is just enough of a ledge for her to make it to the other side though it does look slightly unstable.<br />
<br />
Mike ensures that the safety rope attached to Bulbasaur is nice and taut before instructing her to move <i>slowly</i> forward. At one point the ledge begins to crumble and although Mike pulls on the safety line, Bulbasaur is safe, having regained her balance quickly. She tests her weight on it again, carefully making her way across, and after a couple of minutes in which you held your breath almost the entire time, she makes it safely to the other side.<br />
<br />
Releasing a sigh of relief you both smile, happy to see she is still safe and sound and that things are progressing well when all of a sudden you see movement dead ahead of her. Mike quickly turns the volume control up so you can hear what’s going on on Bulba’s end and all you can hear is a terrible screeching sound and the pattering of feet as something moves closer to her. The monitor goes grainy and you can see a lot of static, making it almost impossible to make out what is coming for her when you see a flash of purple and two fangs on the screen in front of you as whatever it is attacks Bulbasaur. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: limegreen"><b>Archaic: </b>Being sure to let Treecko know who is in charge here, you order Omekekashi to finish Mankey off. She gives you a sly grin, nodding slightly before turning back to the monkey and Tackling it while it is still on the ground, her horn gouging deeply into Mankey’s wound causing it to faint dead away in an instant. <b>Level up for Omekekashi.</b> In the branches above the other Mankey begin hopping up and down, screeching with rage before dropping to the ground in front of Omekekashi, looking ready to gang up on her. She simply Leers at them however, with a rather sadistic look in her eye and they think better of it. Backing away, they pick their fallen friend from the ground and disappear into the trees, one of the Mankey casting one final, filthy look back over it’s shoulder before disappearing into the brush.<br />
<br />
Returning to your side for some well-deserved praise, Omekekashi stares at Treecko in a way that makes his heart skip a beat and he unwittingly takes a step back, self preservation obviously very high on it’s list of priorities. Treecko chooses to ignore Omekekashi’s death stare however, preferring to turn his attention to you. While the look in your eye isn’t any more friendly than Omekekashi’s, the fact that you don’t have a horn dripping with Mankey bloody protruding from your forehead eases his nerves slightly.<br />
<br />
“Well done!” Treecko praises, feigning excitement over your win. “Well... err... We’d better get moving then! We have a long trek ahead of us!” and before you have an opportunity to respond he begins walking, obviously hoping to avoid a confrontation due to your obvious displeasure for the trap he had set for you.<br />
<br />
Following close on Treecko’s heels you glance at your surroundings, taking in every detail so that you may find your way out again should the mischievous gecko somehow escape you, but while you take note of where you are, you’re careful not to let Treecko out of your sight, and after having seen the way you battle, and that you’re not as easily fooled and he had first thought, Treecko doesn’t attempt anything stupid, at least not yet.<br />
<br />
A couple of hours later, Treecko slows his pace, raising a finger to his lips. “Shhhh!” he warns, nodding toward the dense foliage ahead. “We are near Stagbeetle country and they do not like intruders. We will have to be careful but I warn you,” he continues, “Do not show the beetles disrespect or you will not see another day.” <br />
<br />
You stare at Treecko for a moment, but something in his tone and expression strikes you as sincere so you nod, following silently behind him as he tiptoes forward. Suddenly some rustling in the bushes to your right catches your attention and both you and Treecko stop dead in your tracks, watching the bushes alertly, yet a moment later you see it is only a Venonat who comes hurtling out of the foliage at such high speed that it doesn’t see you and it crashes straight into your legs. It rebounds, landing flat on it’s back, looking up at you with a mixture of surprise and fear. You can see it is badly battered and you can’t help but wonder what had attacked it. Squeaking with fright, it hops to it’s feet and races for the bushes on the opposite side of the path, determined to escape whatever it is fleeing from when a split second later four Pinsir come crashing though the bushes from where Venonat had appeared.<br />
<br />
Seeing you standing there, the Pinsir decide you are much more interesting than the little insect they had been pursuing and they quickly surround you. You hear Treecko take a deep frightened breath as he has nowhere to hide. Looks like you have a situation here. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: limegreen"><b>Solarsaur: </b>Heading through the forest with Bulbasaur by your side you enjoy the beautiful calming effect of the morning sun as it filters through the canopy of leaves above, the streaks of sunlight dancing about as a gentle breeze causes the leaves to rustle slightly in its wake. The sounds of nature fill your ears as the inhabitants of the forest go about their daily business. After several minutes of peaceful wandering Bulbasaur suddenly stops dead in his tracks, his head cocked to one side as though listening to something. With a small frown creasing your brow you watch him curiously for a moment, wondering what it is he can hear when a low rumble suddenly issues from his throat. Slightly nervous now you look in the direction Bulbasaur is staring when you notice the foliage is rustling as something moves through it headed in your direction. A moment later the bushes part to reveal a Shuckle who looks just as surprised to see you as you are to see it. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: mediumorchid"><b>MYSTERY ISLAND</b></span><br />
<span style="color: mediumorchid"><b>Arn: </b>Surprisingly enough, the stark realisation of the fact that you are now living in an era that existed 100 years before you were even born is of little importance to you as you have more urgent matters on your mind. Despite the fact that you didn’t get any of the action you had been hoping for, your instinct to protect this girl from being hurt kicks in. Wasting no time you order Chowder to cast a double Reflect in front of the girl and the young man she has leapt out to protect and as the crowd cries out when the other gun totin’ cowboy fires his pistol a faint golden sheen is seen to appear in front of them both and the bullet bounces off, ricocheting off the Reflective Wall and slamming harmlessly into the middle of the dirt street.<br />
<br />
For a few long seconds there is total silence before someone in the crowd screams out, “WITCH!” and before you even realise what is happening the crowd the rest of the crowd has also started crying “WITCH!” and have surged forward and grabbed the girl, dragging her off up the street despite her cries of protest, and into the Sheriff’s Office to have her locked up until she can be dealt with. So surprised by this startling turn of events, you can do nothing but stand still and watch, rooted to the spot as you are shocked by the reaction of these people to something as innocent as a Pokémon’s defensive attack. Finally feeling sensation return you make a step to move after the crowd but feel a restraining hand placed gently on your shoulder. “I wouldn’t do that if I were you.”<br />
<br />
Spinning around you see the Barman who must have followed you outside. “I saw what you did,” he says calmly, “but if these people know it was you responsible for reflecting that bullet then you’ll be burned at the stake right alongside Faith.” Uh-oh, looks like trouble. Whatever shall you do?</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red"><b>COMET’S CORNER</b></span><br />
<span style="color: red"><b>ades: </b>Reading the sign in front of you, you gently stroke Ninetales, giving it whispered words of encouragement while trying to reassure it that all will be fine. Even Water doesn’t need to be told where to go next, he takes one look at the sign before speeding off to the right. A few minutes later you find yourself in civilisation of sorts. There are buildings around now, some industrial, some residential, and right smack in the middle is the Pokémon Centre. Dismounting Water, you take Ninetales gently in your arms before returning your stony friend to his Pokéball and dashing through the front doors of the Centre. You are met by a blast of cool air and excited chatter as you notice a group of school children standing around a nurse who looks up the moment you walk in. Her curious expression at the sight of a stranger in these parts disappears in a split second when she sees Ninetales in your arms and she rushes toward you through the crowd of children gathered around her. <br />
<br />
“Oh my!” she cries, distressed. “That’s Annabelle! Little Katie’s Ninetales! She’s been missing since last night!” Immediately calling for a stretcher the nurse turns back to you. “Where did you find her?”<br />
<br />
Explaining where you had found Ninetales, the nurse nods, obviously not too surprised by your story. By this time the stretcher has arrived and she takes Annabelle from your arms, laying her gently on the stretcher. “Annabelle is very lucky that you happened upon her when you did,” she says, her voice filled with worry. “Even now I can’t be sure she’ll make it after having laid beaten and poisoned for so long, but at least she has a slim chance now, thanks to you.” The nurse then turns and rushes off into the emergency room with Ninetales leaving you alone in the waiting room with several children eyeing you suspiciously. <br />
<br />
Just then the doors to the Pokémon Center slide open and a very distressed little girl of about seven, with tears streaming down her face, comes charging through the doors with another child in tow who had obviously run off to get her the moment you had arrived. She races up to you and begins pounding her little fists against your chest screaming, “WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MY ANNABELLE YOU MONSTER? WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO HER!” but before you have a chance to react to this startling turn of events, a man who must be her father, pulls her away from you.<br />
<br />
He looks to you apologetically. “I’m sorry about that little outburst. We were only informed that Annabelle had been found a few minutes ago,” he says, nodding toward the boy who had entered the Center with Katie, “and when Katie heard Annabelle had been badly hurt she became hysterical. I could barely keep up with her on our way over here.”<br />
<br />
By now Katie has her arms wrapped tightly around her father and is sobbing heavily, her tears making a large, damp patch on his trouser leg. “I want to thank you for bringing Annabelle in here, but I am curious as to where you found her. We’ve been searching all night.”<br />
<br />
After explaining again what had happened, Katie’s father holds out his hand. “I’m John, he says, introducing himself, “And it appears we owe you for finding and saving Annabelle. If there is ever anything we can do for y....” but his words are cut off as the nurse appears from the emergency room. Her expression is glum, and she can barely break a welcoming smile when she sees John and Katie which doesn’t make you feel very hopeful regarding Annabelle’s prognosis.<br />
<br />
The nurse explains that Annabelle has severe internal injuries and that there are large amounts of poison which had spread throughout her entire system. She has done all she can for Annabelle’s physical injuries which will heal given time, and that Annabelle has been treated with a larger than usual dose of anti-venom, but after having suffered through such massive toxic poisoning, there is no guarantee she’ll make it through the night. <br />
<br />
Her words send Katie into a renewed bout of tears, and John’s expression turns dark, his thoughts unreadable. The nurse explains there is nothing that can be done now but to wait and she allows John and Katie a few minutes to visit their injured Pokémon. Several minutes later they return, thanking the nurse before walking up to you. <br />
<br />
“Please let me thank you for what you have done,” John says, his voice thick with restrained emotion. “I can show you around, help you with anything you wish to know about the area, and if you need a bed for the night I can offer your our spare room for the duration of your stay.”<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span><br />

<span style="color: red"><b>Wayne: </b>Deciding to begin a new journey upon the flat plateau of Comet’s Corner which overlooks most of the Cloud Garden, you stand and stare at the skies with Bulbasaur and Venonat by your side. Wondering if the rumours of shooting stars and meteor showers which are supposed to be common in this area, are true, you take in the beauty of the land but soon find yourself itching for adventure and so head off into the distance, wondering what kind of mysteries await you. Several minutes later, a sudden meteor shower captures your attention and you watch, awestruck, as beautiful streaks of light trail though the night sky. One of the streaks looks to be a little too close for comfort and you find yourself worried slightly as it comes closer, streaking in at a fast rate. With the sudden realisation that it is about to hit land you dive for the ground when you feel the earth tremble beneath you. The trembling lasts for what seems an eternity but is only in actual fact a few minutes, before finally abating. Rising to your feet and looking in the direction of the crashed meteor you see a smoke trail rising into the air a few miles from where you are standing. What will you do?</span><br />

Eyeing it thoughtfully, unable to suppress an amused grin, you turn to Fleece who is slightly intimidated by Treecko’s boldness. Gently encouraging Fleece to engage in battle, your little lamb moves closer to Treecko, waiting for just the right moment to make her first move. Watching Treecko closely, Fleece gains some confidence from your encouragement, feeling she can do this if she sets her mind to it. Without any warning at all, both Pokémon make their moves in the same split second, Fleece releasing a bright Flash of light from her woollen coat just as Treecko swings from the tree branch, somersaulting in midair before landing on the ground in front of the surprised Fleece. Thanks to Treecko’s deft movements, it had managed to evade the full effect of Fleece’s blinding flash but it is a little disoriented, blinking rapidly while trying to focus upon it’s “playmate”. Fleece, seeing her opening, leaps forward, hitting Treecko with Tackle, grounding the little wood gecko who punches forward with it’s fist, Pounding Fleece hard in the chin. Fleece leaps backward, surprised by Treecko’s blind hit while Treecko rises to it’s feet, grinning broadly, obviously enjoying this game despite its slightly impaired vision. What will you do now?</span><br />

It’s most definitely the strangest sight you’ve ever seen but it’s effect is brilliant as it streams into Tauros’ eyes, temporarily blinding the enraged beast who immediately charges for Bast, slipping in the mud which has now formed at its feet due to the assault from the water attack. Tauros takes another painful tumble and you can’t help but flinch in sympathy for the bull as you hear the bones in its knees crunch upon impact with the ground. It’s having a great deal of difficulty rising to it’s feet this time after it’s second fall and while it’s still down, Bast begins Singing once more, hoping to lull it to sleep. <br />
<br />
With Tauros writhing in agony on the ground, it’s pain filled cries turning into frustrated, painful snorts, you can’t help but feel sorry for it. Bast continues Singing, and it’s obvious Tauros is beginning to wear down, it’s drowsiness a welcome bliss as it falls slowly into slumberland despite the excruciating pain it is experiencing.

<span style="color: lime">Solarsaur: Heading through the forest with Bulbasaur by your side you enjoy the beautiful calming effect of the morning sun as it filters through the canopy of leaves above, the streaks of sunlight dancing about as a gentle breeze causes the leaves to rustle slightly in its wake. The sounds of nature fill your ears as the inhabitants of the forest go about their daily business. After several minutes of peaceful wandering Bulbasaur suddenly stops dead in his tracks, his head cocked to one side as though listening to something. With a small frown creasing your brow you watch him curiously for a moment, wondering what it is he can hear when a low rumble suddenly issues from his throat. Slightly nervous now you look in the direction Bulbasaur is staring when you notice the foliage is rustling as something moves through it headed in your direction. A moment later the bushes part to reveal a Shuckle who looks just as surprised to see you as you are to see it. What will you do?</span>

<span style="color: aqua"><b>Will: </b>The boy stares at you, horrified to think that you'd even dare enter the river with all of those Tentacruel lurking about in its depths, but after gaping at you for several long seconds, he leaps onto Milotic's back, holding on to you tightly. &quot;I hope you know what you're doing....&quot; he says, as Milotic begins to wade out into the river. Forming a bubble of air around you so you can breathe underwater, Milotic begins to descend into the lake and is soon completely submerged. &quot;I'm Mike by the way,&quot; the boy says, before falling silent again, not exactly sure what else to say.<br />
<br />
The water is surprisingly clear, and you find yourself able to see well enough, but one thing that strikes you immediately is the lack of sea life down here. There are no water Pokémon whatsoever, and Milotic, sensing danger, immediately heads to the bottom of the lake to hide in amongst the tall reeds. Nothing happens for several minutes as you and Mike look around, trying to find any sign whatsoever of where the Tentacruel could have disappeared to, but there is nothing. Suddenly, you hear some movement from above and notice a little girl splashing about in the water with her Squirtle while her father releases a Blastoise to watch over the pair before returning to the river bank to unpack the picnic lunch he had prepared for them.<br />
<br />
You immediately sense something ominous, and you watch, knowing what is about to happen. You want to warn the man to get his daughter and Pokémon out of the water, but you also know that if you want to find Gyarados and Feraligatr then you must stay where you are. It is only moments before you see two Tentacruel appear from a murky patch of water by the riverbank, rising out of the reeds they had been lurking in while awaiting their next victim. Approaching from beneath, the first Tentacruel grabs hold of Blastoise, dragging it down while Blastoise struggles to fight it off. The second Tentacruel then moves in, helping the first to secure it's victim, before both submerge with Blastoise in their grasp.<br />
<br />
You can hear the faint screams of the terrified girl above, muffled due to the fact that you are underwater, but it is now time for you to find where the Tentacruel are going and so you watch as they drift lazily over to the base of the waterfall, disappearing through the cloudy, churning water that is crashing into the river from above. Whatever shall you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: aqua">Loki offers his hand to the boy as he jumps on Milotic's back saying, &quot;I hope you know what you're doing....&quot; Loki thinks to himself, <i>&quot;Yeah, me too!&quot;</i><br />
<br />
As Milotic takes them under, the kids says, &quot;I'm Mike by the way.&quot; Loki replies, &quot;Loki, nice to meet you.&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as they get under, Loki quickly notices the unsettling view. Almost nothing is there besides them. Milotic quickly senses something and dives deep to the bottom of the lake to hide amoung the reeds.<br />
<br />
Not too long after, they hear splashing above. A child and her Squirtle. A Blastoise that watches over them. They know the danger is coming. The Tentacruel will be there soon to take them away, just like Gyarados and Feraligatr. Loki signals Mike to stay silent, otherwise they'll be caught themselves.<br />
<br />
Soon enough, the Tentacruel show up! Quickly they entangle the Pokemon with their tentacles and drag them off. The girl's screams put a knife through Loki's heart, knowing her pain and tears are the cost of retrieving Gyarados. He thinks to himself, <i>&quot;Her pain will be over when we save all the Pokemon that have been captuered.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Loki watches carefully as the Tentacruel drag their victims under the Waterfall. Loki gestures Milotic to follow stealthily, but he holds great concern for Mike. Witnessing such a horrifying event might hurt his spirit. Still, he continues, getting closer and closer to the enemies' lair. Soon they will see just what has happened to their companions. And the time for vengeance is at hand.</span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: limegreen"><b>Archaic: </b>Being sure to let Treecko know who is in charge here, you order Omekekashi to finish Mankey off. She gives you a sly grin, nodding slightly before turning back to the monkey and Tackling it while it is still on the ground, her horn gouging deeply into Mankey’s wound causing it to faint dead away in an instant. <b>Level up for Omekekashi.</b> In the branches above the other Mankey begin hopping up and down, screeching with rage before dropping to the ground in front of Omekekashi, looking ready to gang up on her. She simply Leers at them however, with a rather sadistic look in her eye and they think better of it. Backing away, they pick their fallen friend from the ground and disappear into the trees, one of the Mankey casting one final, filthy look back over it’s shoulder before disappearing into the brush.<br />
<br />
Returning to your side for some well-deserved praise, Omekekashi stares at Treecko in a way that makes his heart skip a beat and he unwittingly takes a step back, self preservation obviously very high on it’s list of priorities. Treecko chooses to ignore Omekekashi’s death stare however, preferring to turn his attention to you. While the look in your eye isn’t any more friendly than Omekekashi’s, the fact that you don’t have a horn dripping with Mankey bloody protruding from your forehead eases his nerves slightly.<br />
<br />
“Well done!” Treecko praises, feigning excitement over your win. “Well... err... We’d better get moving then! We have a long trek ahead of us!” and before you have an opportunity to respond he begins walking, obviously hoping to avoid a confrontation due to your obvious displeasure for the trap he had set for you.<br />
<br />
Following close on Treecko’s heels you glance at your surroundings, taking in every detail so that you may find your way out again should the mischievous gecko somehow escape you, but while you take note of where you are, you’re careful not to let Treecko out of your sight, and after having seen the way you battle, and that you’re not as easily fooled and he had first thought, Treecko doesn’t attempt anything stupid, at least not yet.<br />
<br />
A couple of hours later, Treecko slows his pace, raising a finger to his lips. “Shhhh!” he warns, nodding toward the dense foliage ahead. “We are near Stagbeetle country and they do not like intruders. We will have to be careful but I warn you,” he continues, “Do not show the beetles disrespect or you will not see another day.” <br />
<br />
You stare at Treecko for a moment, but something in his tone and expression strikes you as sincere so you nod, following silently behind him as he tiptoes forward. Suddenly some rustling in the bushes to your right catches your attention and both you and Treecko stop dead in your tracks, watching the bushes alertly, yet a moment later you see it is only a Venonat who comes hurtling out of the foliage at such high speed that it doesn’t see you and it crashes straight into your legs. It rebounds, landing flat on it’s back, looking up at you with a mixture of surprise and fear. You can see it is badly battered and you can’t help but wonder what had attacked it. Squeaking with fright, it hops to it’s feet and races for the bushes on the opposite side of the path, determined to escape whatever it is fleeing from when a split second later four Pinsir come crashing though the bushes from where Venonat had appeared.<br />
<br />
Seeing you standing there, the Pinsir decide you are much more interesting than the little insect they had been pursuing and they quickly surround you. You hear Treecko take a deep frightened breath as he has nowhere to hide. Looks like you have a situation here. What will you do?</span></span>

<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: Lime">Mamoru smirks proudly as Omekekashi returns to his side, pulling a pair of potions out of his pocket and handing them to her, then turning back to Treeko.<br />
<br />
Glad that it finally seems to be getting on with the job it promised, Mamoru follows close on Treecko’s heels, glancing at his surroundings, taking in every detail, so that he may find his way out again should the annoyng gecko somehow escape him, but still careful not to let Treecko out of his sight.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hours later...<br />
Surrounded by Pinser, Mamoru smirks. Perfect...<br />
&quot;Well, well, what fine specimens we have here....I do believe you deserve your fee Treeko. Not only have you brought us to Pinser territory, as promised, but the Pinser here seem to be exactly what we've been looking for. Such rich dark tints to their carapaces....is that natural I wonder, or is it an effect produced by dried blood? What do you think Omekekashi? Do you see any that take your fancy, my dear? I'm sure there must be one here that suits your tastes and mine.&quot;<br />
Beside him, Omekekashi simply licks her lips, taking a good look at the Pinser surrounding them. Either which way, this <i>will</i> be fun indeed...</span></div>
