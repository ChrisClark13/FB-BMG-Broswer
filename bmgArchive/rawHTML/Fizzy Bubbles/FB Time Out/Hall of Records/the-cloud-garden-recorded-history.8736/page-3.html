<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px">QUILAVA R T3H MINE!!!!!!!11111<br />
<br />
<span style="color: limegreen"><b>Quilava: </b>Bulbasaur eagerly agrees to help, possibly partly to impress her new master, possibly because the thought of a little adventure and/or excitement appeals to her, but whatever the case she is happy to feel useful and once buckled up to all of her safety equipment and with her helmet securely in place, enters the miniscule hole in the mountainside showing no fear whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Mike grins, impressed with Bulbasaur’s bravery, but his expression soon turns to one of concentration as he watches the monitor held in his hands, examining the tunnel carefully as Bulba proceeds along it. Glancing over his shoulder you also watch her progress, the small flashlight attached to her helmet giving off enough light for her to see at least a meter in front due to the small confines of the tunnel walls. At one point Mike notices something on the monitor and asks Bulba to look to her right so he can have a better view, but it turns out to be nothing more than some moist clay embedded within the tunnel wall. <br />
<br />
Proceeding further along the tunnel you can see that it is becoming wider, and as Bulbasaur looks around, you can also see there is more head room above her. Mike smiles, pleased with this development as this means it will be possible for him to send Bulbasaur back in with Pokéballs containing larger and stronger Pokémon should they be needed. Bulba travels further the tunnel which appears to be growing larger and is now at least one meter wide and almost two metres high but Bulbasaur soon stops, pointing her head downward to reveal a large drop in front of her. As the camera attached to her helmet peers into the darkness there is no way to tell just how far it goes but neither you or Mike are prepared to endanger her so he instructs her to look around the edges of the hole and you can see that on the left there is just enough of a ledge for her to make it to the other side though it does look slightly unstable.<br />
<br />
Mike ensures that the safety rope attached to Bulbasaur is nice and taut before instructing her to move <i>slowly</i> forward. At one point the ledge begins to crumble and although Mike pulls on the safety line, Bulbasaur is safe, having regained her balance quickly. She tests her weight on it again, carefully making her way across, and after a couple of minutes in which you held your breath almost the entire time, she makes it safely to the other side.<br />
<br />
Releasing a sigh of relief you both smile, happy to see she is still safe and sound and that things are progressing well when all of a sudden you see movement dead ahead of her. Mike quickly turns the volume control up so you can hear what’s going on on Bulba’s end and all you can hear is a terrible screeching sound and the pattering of feet as something moves closer to her. The monitor goes grainy and you can see a lot of static, making it almost impossible to make out what is coming for her when you see a flash of purple and two fangs on the screen in front of you as whatever it is attacks Bulbasaur. What will you do?</span></span>

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: lime">Stephen watches as Bulbasaur continues successfully into the tunnel, coming across a crevice. With her solution found, Stephen nods and watches the screen when there is suddenly a horrible screeching noise, as the screen begins to become staticy, and quite hard to see. Through the snow, Stephen makes out a slender, purple body complete with a pair of fangs. Stephen gulps, and says into the headset, &quot;Bulbasaur, it's all right! Let's do this! Use a Safeguard to protect yourself from any of it's attacks, and then start up a Swords Dance! Then, after it attacks causing the Safeguard to go down, Tackle it for all it's worth!&quot;</span></span></div>

<span style="color: red"><b>COMET’S CORNER</b></span><br />
<span style="color: red"><b>ades: </b>Reading the sign in front of you, you gently stroke Ninetales, giving it whispered words of encouragement while trying to reassure it that all will be fine. Even Water doesn’t need to be told where to go next, he takes one look at the sign before speeding off to the right. A few minutes later you find yourself in civilisation of sorts. There are buildings around now, some industrial, some residential, and right smack in the middle is the Pokémon Centre. Dismounting Water, you take Ninetales gently in your arms before returning your stony friend to his Pokéball and dashing through the front doors of the Centre. You are met by a blast of cool air and excited chatter as you notice a group of school children standing around a nurse who looks up the moment you walk in. Her curious expression at the sight of a stranger in these parts disappears in a split second when she sees Ninetales in your arms and she rushes toward you through the crowd of children gathered around her. <br />
<br />
“Oh my!” she cries, distressed. “That’s Annabelle! Little Katie’s Ninetales! She’s been missing since last night!” Immediately calling for a stretcher the nurse turns back to you. “Where did you find her?”<br />
<br />
Explaining where you had found Ninetales, the nurse nods, obviously not too surprised by your story. By this time the stretcher has arrived and she takes Annabelle from your arms, laying her gently on the stretcher. “Annabelle is very lucky that you happened upon her when you did,” she says, her voice filled with worry. “Even now I can’t be sure she’ll make it after having laid beaten and poisoned for so long, but at least she has a slim chance now, thanks to you.” The nurse then turns and rushes off into the emergency room with Ninetales leaving you alone in the waiting room with several children eyeing you suspiciously. <br />
<br />
Just then the doors to the Pokémon Center slide open and a very distressed little girl of about seven, with tears streaming down her face, comes charging through the doors with another child in tow who had obviously run off to get her the moment you had arrived. She races up to you and begins pounding her little fists against your chest screaming, “WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MY ANNABELLE YOU MONSTER? WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO HER!” but before you have a chance to react to this startling turn of events, a man who must be her father, pulls her away from you.<br />
<br />
He looks to you apologetically. “I’m sorry about that little outburst. We were only informed that Annabelle had been found a few minutes ago,” he says, nodding toward the boy who had entered the Center with Katie, “and when Katie heard Annabelle had been badly hurt she became hysterical. I could barely keep up with her on our way over here.”<br />
<br />
By now Katie has her arms wrapped tightly around her father and is sobbing heavily, her tears making a large, damp patch on his trouser leg. “I want to thank you for bringing Annabelle in here, but I am curious as to where you found her. We’ve been searching all night.”<br />
<br />
After explaining again what had happened, Katie’s father holds out his hand. “I’m John, he says, introducing himself, “And it appears we owe you for finding and saving Annabelle. If there is ever anything we can do for y....” but his words are cut off as the nurse appears from the emergency room. Her expression is glum, and she can barely break a welcoming smile when she sees John and Katie which doesn’t make you feel very hopeful regarding Annabelle’s prognosis.<br />
<br />
The nurse explains that Annabelle has severe internal injuries and that there are large amounts of poison which had spread throughout her entire system. She has done all she can for Annabelle’s physical injuries which will heal given time, and that Annabelle has been treated with a larger than usual dose of anti-venom, but after having suffered through such massive toxic poisoning, there is no guarantee she’ll make it through the night. <br />
<br />
Her words send Katie into a renewed bout of tears, and John’s expression turns dark, his thoughts unreadable. The nurse explains there is nothing that can be done now but to wait and she allows John and Katie a few minutes to visit their injured Pokémon. Several minutes later they return, thanking the nurse before walking up to you. <br />
<br />
“Please let me thank you for what you have done,” John says, his voice thick with restrained emotion. “I can show you around, help you with anything you wish to know about the area, and if you need a bed for the night I can offer your our spare room for the duration of your stay.”<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span>

<br />
John took a long, hard look at the man standing in front of him, noting the slump in his shoulders, the wearied expression on his face and the dark patches under his eyes. It only took a seconds worth of consideration before John replied: <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, but I can't accept your offer for staying. I don't want to trouble you or Katie any further and I really do need to get a move on. I'm a trainer you see, and we're not comfortable unless we're out catching Pokémon.&quot;<br />
<br />
He said this with a little grin, but the stark reality of the present situation tempered his humour. John leant down and came face to face with Katie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really hope Annabelle gets better soon. Tell her to get well soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning to the father again, he shook his hand and started to turn, when an idea popped into John's head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then again, there<i> could</i> be something you could help me with. Do you know where all the Pokémon are?&quot;</span></div>

<span style="color: red"><b>Wayne: </b>Deciding to begin a new journey upon the flat plateau of Comet’s Corner which overlooks most of the Cloud Garden, you stand and stare at the skies with Bulbasaur and Venonat by your side. Wondering if the rumours of shooting stars and meteor showers which are supposed to be common in this area, are true, you take in the beauty of the land but soon find yourself itching for adventure and so head off into the distance, wondering what kind of mysteries await you. Several minutes later, a sudden meteor shower captures your attention and you watch, awestruck, as beautiful streaks of light trail though the night sky. One of the streaks looks to be a little too close for comfort and you find yourself worried slightly as it comes closer, streaking in at a fast rate. With the sudden realisation that it is about to hit land you dive for the ground when you feel the earth tremble beneath you. The trembling lasts for what seems an eternity but is only in actual fact a few minutes, before finally abating. Rising to your feet and looking in the direction of the crashed meteor you see a smoke trail rising into the air a few miles from where you are standing. What will you do?</span></span>

<span style="color: Red">Wayne started to worry as the meteor started to get closer. Going down for cover, he felt a little trembling beneath him. Wayne checked for both his pokemon to be ok and then he started to feel horrified and curious at the thought of something of outer space coming so near him and his pokemon. Feeling an urge to go investigate the meteor Wayne reacted to his courageous side and decided to go there. Returning his purple bug pokemon to his pokeball Wayne slowly bent down to take a look at his Bulbasaur. &quot;Bulbasaur, you feel like going to the meteor to explore it?&quot; Bulbasaur looked happily towards his trainer and then started to walk ahead of him. Wayne knew that Bulbasaur was just as curious as him or even more. &quot;Bulbasaur wait up.&quot; Bulbasaur then responded by turning around. &quot;Even though we aren't close to the meteor we have to stay together because who knows what the meteor attracted or if there is something in it. Anyway we'll go in the direction of the smoke. Ok Bulbasaur?&quot; Bulbasaur nodded and then they both set off in the direction of the meteor crash site.</span></span></div>

<span style="color: aqua"><b>WolfinOutlawAsi: </b>Highly amused by Treecko’s antics, your first instinct is to study it and what better way to do so than to capture it? Eyeing it thoughtfully, unable to suppress an amused grin, you turn to Fleece who is slightly intimidated by Treecko’s boldness. Gently encouraging Fleece to engage in battle, your little lamb moves closer to Treecko, waiting for just the right moment to make her first move. Watching Treecko closely, Fleece gains some confidence from your encouragement, feeling she can do this if she sets her mind to it. Without any warning at all, both Pokémon make their moves in the same split second, Fleece releasing a bright Flash of light from her woollen coat just as Treecko swings from the tree branch, somersaulting in midair before landing on the ground in front of the surprised Fleece. Thanks to Treecko’s deft movements, it had managed to evade the full effect of Fleece’s blinding flash but it is a little disoriented, blinking rapidly while trying to focus upon it’s “playmate”. Fleece, seeing her opening, leaps forward, hitting Treecko with Tackle, grounding the little wood gecko who punches forward with it’s fist, Pounding Fleece hard in the chin. Fleece leaps backward, surprised by Treecko’s blind hit while Treecko rises to it’s feet, grinning broadly, obviously enjoying this game despite its slightly impaired vision.

&quot;Come on Fleece you can do it!&quot; I yelled excitedly as Fleece clambered to her feet, after the Treecko's surprise hit. Thankfully not taking too much time being surprised, Fleece got back into battle stance and baahed, determined, at the Treecko. My blood was moving, excited to finally be in a battle. I fingered the pokeball in my hand as I watched my pokemon start to charge for another tackle. I was greatly anticipating the moment of truth, when I would let my pokeball fly and wait with baited breath to see if it would catch this pokemon. But that moment was not to come just yet, and I knew it. &quot;Ok Fleece, <b>Tackle</b> again and then hit it with another <b>flash</b>. If it cant hit you then you cant be hurt!

<br />
<span style="color: limegreen"><b>Quilava: </b>You see a burst of bright light appear on the screen and sigh with relief, knowing Bulbasaur has created her Safeguard just in time to avoid the enemy attack but you are still nervous as you are not exactly sure of what is attacking her. Her opponent hits the dome of energy surrounding her and bounces off it, falling back and you make out the form of a Rattata. Bulbasaur then begins spinning rapidly, making you a little dizzy as the camera spins too fast for you to make anything out, but all of a sudden the camera is flying through the air and smashes into the tunnel wall as Rattata whacks Bulba with a Tackle, which has broken her out of her Swords Dance and sent her reeling. She quickly regains her footing however, but you see another purple streak as Rattata moves in with Quick Attack causing minor damage. Bulba, now very annoyed, leaps forward to attack with a Tackle of her own.<br />
<br />
While it looks like Bulba has finally gotten her bearings and can hold her own against Rattata, Mike is getting nervous. “Shall I pull her out of there?” he asks, a worried frown creasing his brow, “Or would you rather she battle?”<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: limegreen"><b>Archaic: </b>For once Treecko is left speechless as the Pinsir surround you, their expressions less than friendly. It appears he hadn’t expected to come into contact with the Pinsir quite so soon and hides behind you, expecting you to offer him protection. You are undaunted by the stagbeetles however, showing your lack of fear in both your expression and tone of voice which, lucky for you, has prevented an instant slaughter, one in which you would have been their victim.<br />
<br />
The Pinsir talk amongst themselves while Omekekashi watches on, her little eyes clearly showing her eagerness for a bit of action. It doesn’t take long for the Pinsir to reach a decision as they prepare to take you with them, two of them taking position in front of you while two move behind, prodding you to move along. Following the two Pinsir in the lead, you wonder where it is they are taking you and it isn’t long before your question is answered. You hear Treecko whisper something about you being in the heart of Stagbeetle country before you break into a massive forest clearing. The area is dark and dank, all light from above cut off by a thick canopy of leaves, but you can see well enough to know that if you’re not going to be dead in two minutes then you are in for the treat of a lifetime.<br />
<br />
As you are led into the middle of the clearing Pinsir appear everywhere, emerging from the forest to watch the developments. You are brought to a halt, guarded by three of the Pinsir who brought you here while the fourth breaks off from the group and approaches a lone Pinsir who looks to be much older than the rest. For some reason you can sense this one holds a position of authority and as the first Pinsir approaches and bows before it before speaking quietly, your suspicions are confirmed. The elderly Pinsir listens to the young one, it’s eyes never leaving yours as you stand watching the hushed conversation take place. The old Pinsir then nods, waving his hand in a dismissive gesture. The first Pinsir bows again, heading back toward you and taking its position with the other three.<br />
<br />
The elderly Pinsir raises his hand which you presume to be a signal of some sort causing several Pinsir standing on the edge on the clearing to rush off. He then walks up to you, his back straight, his eyes not leaving yours. He stops in front of you examining both you and Omekekashi closely, his gaze barely even registering Treecko’s presence. Looking back to you, he speaks, “You dare to enter Pinsir territory?” he asks, his expression stony. “No man is welcome here but my scouts inform me you are different to others. Tell me what you are doing here and we may spare your life.”<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: limegreen"><b>Solarsaur: </b><i>At the risk of sounding like a total bitch, please do not reply like that again or next time I <b>will</b> skip your post. I’m finding it hard to believe you managed to pass the RP Test at all and I know that if you’d given that kind of reply in the test you would have failed. You’ve given me very little to work with so please put more thought and effort into your replies from now on, that’s all I ask.</i><br />
<br />
Shuckle stares at you curiously before watching Bulbasaur pace around, apparently mad with you for some reason Shuckle can’t quite fathom. Eyeing you both for a short time it soon becomes bored, wandering off slowly into the bushes. By the time you realise Shuckle is gone there is very little to do other than to continue with your adventure and so you set off again with Bulbasaur in tow who is left wondering how a possible battle opportunity slipped away unnoticed. After a half hour of uneventful travel you enter a forest clearing where you are confronted by a most unusual sight. Standing right in the middle appears to be a shrine of some sort while various bug and grass Pokémon stand around it, paying homage. The moment they see you enter the clearing they all scatter, afraid of seeing a human in these part. Moving closer to examine the shrine you see the Pokémon have left small offerings of various fruits, vegetable, berries, acorns and other knickknacks they’ve picked up in the forest, apparently abandoned by other trainers such as yourself who had been passing through. You don’t see anything of great value but an inscription carved in the statue catches your attention:<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center"><i>Deep within the serpent’s lair great treasure you will find<br />
Let caution guide you or beware for illusions often blind,<br />
Allow greed to overwhelm your soul and suffer for all time<br />
The insanity of those before who know not peace of mind.</i>&#8203;</div><br />
Frowning as you read over the cryptic inscription you wonder what it could mean when you hear a voice behind you. “I.. I wou.. wouldn’t go there if I were you.”<br />
<br />
Spinning around you see a man in his twenties skulking by the treeline. He has long filthy brown dreadlocks into which leaves, grass and God only knows what else are now entwined. His clothes are ragged and filthy and while you can see that he must have once been a handsome young lad, there is very little light left in his pale blue eyes. There appears only madness now, a deep sense of paranoia. “Eeeevil things I tell you!” he yells with an insane look in his eyes. “Don’t go there!” He appears to be attempting to swat imaginary insects off himself while he curses at his invisible attackers and you watch him closely, not exactly sure how to react.....<br />
<br />
Watcha gonna do?</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: mediumorchid"><b>MYSTERY ISLAND</b></span><br />
<span style="color: mediumorchid"><b>Arn: </b>Surprisingly enough, the stark realisation of the fact that you are now living in an era that existed 100 years before you were even born is of little importance to you as you have more urgent matters on your mind. Despite the fact that you didn’t get any of the action you had been hoping for, your instinct to protect this girl from being hurt kicks in. Wasting no time you order Chowder to cast a double Reflect in front of the girl and the young man she has leapt out to protect and as the crowd cries out when the other gun totin’ cowboy fires his pistol a faint golden sheen is seen to appear in front of them both and the bullet bounces off, ricocheting off the Reflective Wall and slamming harmlessly into the middle of the dirt street.<br />
<br />
For a few long seconds there is total silence before someone in the crowd screams out, “WITCH!” and before you even realise what is happening the crowd the rest of the crowd has also started crying “WITCH!” and have surged forward and grabbed the girl, dragging her off up the street despite her cries of protest, and into the Sheriff’s Office to have her locked up until she can be dealt with. So surprised by this startling turn of events, you can do nothing but stand still and watch, rooted to the spot as you are shocked by the reaction of these people to something as innocent as a Pokémon’s defensive attack. Finally feeling sensation return you make a step to move after the crowd but feel a restraining hand placed gently on your shoulder. “I wouldn’t do that if I were you.”<br />
<br />
Spinning around you see the Barman who must have followed you outside. “I saw what you did,” he says calmly, “but if these people know it was you responsible for reflecting that bullet then you’ll be burned at the stake right alongside Faith.” Uh-oh, looks like trouble. Whatever shall you do?</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red"><b>COMET’S CORNER</b></span><br />
<span style="color: red"><b>ades: </b>Deciding to forego John’s offer for the moment seeing as he has enough to worry about, you kindly offer Katie your support. The little girl looks up at you through bloodshot eyes but has trouble breaking a smile and instead nods before looking to the floor, her expression as miserable as ever. Taking your leave you suddenly remember it would be helpful to know where to find Pokémon around here and ask John where to look. He smiles and walks toward the door, “Follow me,” he says, leading you outside.<br />
<br />
“There isn’t much to find around here I’m afraid,” he says, walking slowly so you may talk properly. “If you wander the plains you will find scattered Ground and Rock type Pokémon, even the odd Fighting type, and on occasion you may cross paths with Fairies such as Clefairy or Jigglypuff, and even a few scavengers like Rattata, but there are rumors of colonies of rare types living somewhere out there though we haven’t found any yet.” He stops speaking for a moment, looking worried about something. “I wouldn’t suggest travelling the plains alone however. There is a rogue band of trainers on the loose causing destruction wherever they go. They’ve attacked our settlement twice and I’m positive it was them responsible for the vicious attack upon Annabelle, as a warning to me.”<br />
<br />
You hear Katie draw in her breath at the mention of Annabelle and she begins sobbing again, rushing back to the Pokémon Centre to be with her beloved Ninetales, John watching his daughter as she disappears inside. “Annabelle belonged to my wife, Julia” he says softly, “and was given to Katie on her 5th birthday. One week before Julia died. Annabelle is Katie’s last living link to her mother so you can understand why she’s taking this so badly....”<br />
<br />
Returning his full attention to you, John continues, “If you plan on travelling the plains, please be very careful. You’ll need some strong Pokémon by your side in case you run into trouble and at least one Pokémon built for speed if you need to outrun danger.” John appears to think about something for a moment before adding, “We do breed and raise our own Pokémon here on the settlement however, and they are sometimes given out as prizes in the Battle Dome to some of the younger ones who are beginning their training but haven’t left home yet. We cover most types and it will give you a chance to level up your current Pokémon while you battle.”<br />
<br />
What would you like to do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: red"><b>Wayne: </b>Doing what any normal person would do when seeing a meteor crash land near them, you immediately set off to investigate. Bulbasaur is just as excited as you, if not more so, and eagerly leads the way. Luckily you don’t come across anything dangerous upon your journey, although when you reach the site you notice many curious Pokémon standing around the rim of the crater who had also come to investigate, but when they see you approaching they soon scatter, not used to seeing a human in these parts. Now that you are near, you can see the meteor doesn’t look like a meteor at all. It isn’t made of rock like most meteors, or ice like a comet, it appears to be smooth and you can see a metallic sheen reflecting off its side from the small flames and glowing embers scattered on the ground around it.<br />
<br />
More curious than ever you make your way down the side of the crater being careful not to burn yourself on the heated ground and when you approach the “meteor” you see it is more like a small space pod from a science fiction movie. Realising that if this is a pod then there must be something inside you look at it for a while wondering whether or not it will be safe to open it. After all, who knows what could be inside? It is while you are standing there musing over your options that you hear a small clanging sound coming from inside. <i>Ting... ting... ting... Thwack! Ting... ting... ting... Thwack!</i><br />
<br />
Bulbasaur looks up at you with a raised eyebrow, even more curious than before and urges you to open the pod to see what is inside. You hesitate for a moment, wondering what could be making that noise, <i>Ting... ting... ting... Thwack! Ting... ting... ting... Thwack!</i> but your curiosity soon overpowers your sense of logic as well and you reach for what looks to be a release mechanism for a door on the outside of the pod. Suddenly you hear a loud hiss as the door opens and you look inside to see something rather amazing. Staring at the tiny Pokémon who looks up at you with a big grin when it realises it now has an audience for it’s musical rendition of who knows what tune it is playing, it happily bashes a little more vigorously with the spoon in its hand upon un upturned bowl, <i>Ting... ting... ting...</i> then on a wooden box, <i>Thwack!</i> <br />
<br />
It repeats its little tune, <i>Ting... ting... ting... Thwack! Ting... ting... ting... Thwack! Ting... ting... ting... Thwack!</i> before looking up at you with adorable little eyes and happily crying, “Togepi!”<br />
<br />
Whatever shall you do?</span><br />
<br />

<span style="color: aqua"><b>Loki: </b>Hearing the little girls’ cries practically rips your heart out but you know that if you interfere you will have no hope of ever finding Gyarados or any of the other Pokémon stolen from trainers visiting the river. You watch silently, awaiting your chance to follow, and the moment the Tentacruel disappear beyond the waterfall you move after them.<br />
<br />
Milotic glides swiftly forward, not wanting to lose sight of the jellyfish Pokémon. The journey through the churning water at the foot of the waterfall is anything but pleasant, as you find yourselves being tossed around, the water crashing down on top of you and spinning you around for what feels like an eternity. Mike grabs hold of you so tightly that you feel your ribs my be crushed, but just when you think you’ll never escape the powerful churning mass of water, Milotic breaks free and you find yourselves on the other side.<br />
<br />
Looking around you find yourself in an underwater tunnel. There isn’t a lot of marine life along here, but about twenty metres ahead you can see a light. You notice a large shadow rising to the surface of the water and stay back, close to the wall, recognising it as belonging to the two Tentacruel who still have Blastoise wrapped up tightly in their grasp. You can’t see much as the Pokémon reach the surface but you see a fair bit of splashing before the Tentacruel part and submerge again, returning the way they had come.<br />
<br />
Hiding in the tall reeds along the bottom of the tunnel you, Mike and Milotic all stay as still and quiet as possible, watching as the Tentacruel approach and then pass right over top of you before disappearing through the churning water at the base of the waterfall, most likely to go and lurk in search of their next target. Sighing with relief, happy to have not been discovered, Milotic heads up the tunnel and slowly rises to the surface of the water and into the light.<br />
<br />
What confronts you is amazing to say the least. A large underground cavern, obviously a natural formation, has been converted into a base of some sort. There are cages and tanks all around the place, some empty, some containing various water Pokémon, and you see three men hauling the unconscious Blastoise across the room before dumping it unceremoniously into one of the larger cages. Locking it securely they walk off into another tunnel on the opposite side of the cavern to where you are hiding and as they do you hear one of them say, “This one will be worth a pretty penny, it’s got a lot of fight in it.” The other two laugh like a couple of drunk baboons which you hear echoing around the cavernous room before they disappear into the tunnel.<br />
<br />
Taking a careful look around the room you can see that it’s empty, at least of people, and your eyes fall upon a long rod hooked up to a battery of some kind. It’s sitting right next to the water and you realise they must have used it to zap Blastoise so it couldn’t fight them. You can’t help but wonder what is going on here and how they have managed to make a base in here but you brush those thoughts to the back of your mind for the time being since your first priority is to find Gyarados. What will you do now?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: aqua"><b>WolfinOutlawAsi: </b>You urge Fleece on as she regains her feet, glaring at Treecko and crying out with a determined, “Baaaaah!”, sure to let Treecko know she has no intention of losing this battle. Treecko grins broadly, happy to know its new friend is enjoying their game and when Fleece charges forward to Tackle, Treecko lifts its tail to Absorb damage from the attack but with it’s vision still slightly impaired it has misjudged Fleece’s position and Fleece rams right into Treecko’s stomach causing the cheeky gecko to expel a huff of air from its lungs as it lands flat on its back, winded from the attack. This doesn’t put Treecko off however, it seems even more delighted than ever to see its playmate so into the spirit of the game and even though it’s still down, it whips its tail around to whack Fleece right across the face with Pound. Baahing indignantly Fleece releases a bright Flash, this time making sure Treecko gets an eyeful as it hops to its feet. Treecko rubs its eyes frantically, unable to see anything but a dazzling display of dots before its eyes. With her opponent temporarily blinded, it appears Fleece most definitely has the upper hand now. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: burlywood"><b>DELIBIRD RIDGE</b></span><br />
<span style="color: burlywood"><b>Radical Edward: </b>Deciding that enough is enough, you end your battle with Tauros, doing everything you can for the injured beast before climbing aboard Atlas who heads off into the distance. You think back to the battle, thinking it was just a little too easy, and wonder if perhaps Tauros had already been weakened somehow. It’s not normal for a Pokémon like that to go down so quickly, but you soon let thoughts of the bull leave your mind as more important matters drift back into your consciousness. The pillar is looming before you, so close that you can make out the enormous Aerodactyl head at the top. The image of the bird has been expertly crafted, carved straight into the rock, and you think back to what the mysterious man had told you about the tribespeople who had defeated it. They had supposedly been expert craftsmen, capable of making just about anything, and as you stare at the carving in all of its ferocious glory, you don’t doubt this fact for a moment as the image of the creature exudes such an aura of terror that you feel your spine tingling with nerves. It’s no wonder few people have ever travelled here.<br />
<br />
The rest of the day passes uneventfully, and as dusk approaches you once again see the familiar smoke trail rising into the air. You approach slowly this time, knowing who you will find and when you approach the campfire and greet the man boiling his tea over the flames you take your usual seat. You once again share a meal and warm yourself by the fire before falling into a restless sleep, the voice of the man echoing through your mind, <i>“Not everything is as it appears. Trust your instincts and let your heart guide the way....”</i><br />
<br />
In your dreams you see people, people who look like they don’t live in these times. They are clad in ancient Bedouin clothing and they live in caves. You can sense these people are anxious, constantly looking to the skies with fear in their eyes. The children are not playing, they are instead loading food onto a makeshift cart while the women prepare what little food they have left. The men sit around sharpening spears and other weapons. There is no laughter, not a sign of happiness, and the atmosphere is one of pure misery. <br />
<br />
You are standing amongst the people but they cannot see you, but out of nowhere a little boy appears. He stands in front of you and smiles as though it’s perfectly normal to see someone dressed as yourself standing in their midst. You are surprised by this but then smile at the boy who points to the sky over your shoulder. Turning your head you see a great shadow approaching, directly in line with the sun. You cannot make it out but you know what it is. The next minute you hear screaming as people run for cover. Men and women run around lifting the youngest children into their arms before dashing off and disappearing into their caves. Not everyone makes it though and you hear a terrifying screech as the bird descends from the sky, wreaking havoc to everything in it’s wake. You hear the screams of people now and see the bird take off into the sky again, the body of a young boy clutched in it’s talons. <br />
<br />
Suddenly you sit bolt upright, sweating and panting heavily as though waking from a nightmare. The air is cool on your face and it takes a moment for you to realise where you are. It is morning again. The campfire has burned out and the old man is gone, leaving you alone in the fresh morning air with the fragmented memories of your dream haunting you. You try to piece them together but there are things you cannot remember which is more frustrating than ever since you can now remember some small details but you cannot waste time pondering too heavily on these thoughts so you head out once more on the final leg of your journey to the mammoth pillar.<br />
<br />
After another days’ hike you finally reach your destination. It is dusk again and you are tired, cold and hungry but there is no campfire awaiting you on this night. Instead you stand before the base of the obelisk type rock, reading an inscription carved into a stone wall blocking what was once the entrance to a cave or tunnel of some sort leading inside.<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center"><i>The spirits of men, women and children lie<br />
Within the chamber where they did die,<br />
Their restless souls searching for peace<br />
Trapped forever with the eternal beast,<br />
To enter you must show that you do care<br />
The vision of future in your ethereal stare,<br />
This inner sight will show you the way<br />
Into the dark from the light of day.</i>&#8203;</div><br />
What will you do?</span></span></div>

<span style="color: limegreen"><b>ABL: </b>Dark Espeon watches your every movement closely, studying your every reaction, the tone of your voice, <i><b>everything</b></i>. When Dreamer reluctantly returns to your side, affectionately rubbing against your leg, Dark Espeon’s eyes narrow suspiciously as it stares deeply into yours. Something is definitely up with this psychic kitty and your mind is spinning with questions.<br />
<br />
When you ask if it is an Espeon, gently pleading for it to trust you, a sudden look of understanding crosses the feline’s eyes, but in that same moment, as it watches your gentleness, you could swear you see a look of regret, and could it be <i><b>yearning</b></i>, possibly even <i><b>envy</b></i>, flicker in its eyes, but the look vanishes as quickly as it had appeared.<br />
<br />
Dark Espeon takes a step closer to you, its eyes trained on yours. You find yourself unable to break your gaze with it as an almost hypnotic feeling flows through you. You’re barely even aware of Dreamer, Scamp and Karma’s attempts to draw your attention away from Dark Espeon, and the next minute you feel yourself falling as though in slow motion. Your surroundings seem to spin before blurring into a large whirlwind of darkness as you fall slowly toward the ink black pool and then <i><b>through</b></i> it. You feel no panic as you feel yourself falling for you can sense you are safe, at least for now. Upon your descent your hear voices, some familiar, some not. You see faces, some also familiar while others aren’t. You see yourself but you look <i><b>different</b></i>, and you can’t believe you are responsible for the images you are seeing. This has to be a dream...<br />
<br />
Sometime later you feel yourself coming round. You recognise your surroundings, this is the Cloud Forest, but it’s dark. Dark as a moonless night, the sounds of birdsong replaced by the terrifying screeches of creatures of the night while far off in the distance you hear the eerie howl of a Mightyena as it’s cry echoes through the woods. Your Pokémon are by your side, relieved to see you are awake, and then you see it. Dark Espeon sitting calmly by the side of the clearing, it’s ruby eyes all that are visible of the sleek black beauty as they stare at you in the darkness. Suddenly you hear a girls’ shrill and angry voice echoing through the night, “Shadow, get back here RIGHT NOW or it’s the dungeons for you!”<br />
<br />
And as you sit there on the forest floor, nervous shivers wracking your spine, Dark Espeon slinks off into the darkness, leaving you lost and alone in a new and seemingly terrifying place....</span></span>

<br />
Tenderly stroking Dreamer's fine, silky fur, ABL smiles as the lavender cat brushes against her legs with a faint purr. &quot;My pretty girl,&quot; the trainer murmurs somewhat absentmindedly, her thoughts still revolving around her Pokémon's almost-identical twin. Caught in the strange creature's piercing gaze, ABL finds herself unable to take her eyes away from Dark Espeon's until the Pokémon seems satisfied.<br />
<br />
Trying to find answers to the questions building in her mind, the trainer attempts to get some information from Dark Espeon. Met with only a brief mournful look, the girl feels the ache of empathy and suddenly regrets her queries, left to imagine what could possibly have caused the flash of sorrow in the feline's otherwise calm features. &quot;Dark Espeon,&quot; she begins with a slight quiver in her voice, kneeling down to be closer to the Pokémon, slowly reaching out with one hand.<br />
<br />
Again enchanted by Dark Espeon's brilliant crimson eyes, the girl continues helplessly staring at the jet black feline. Gradually feeling more and more disconnected from the reality around her, ABL is aware of the fact that she is being drawn in towards Dark Espeon's world... yet she feels curiously unafraid. Very much disoriented with all that is going around her, she in conscious of her rational mind trying to make some sense of this. However, another part of her dismisses the futile attempts at logic and simply relaxes, being taken to another time, another place. A flurry of emotions stirred within her at the familiar sights and sounds, the girl struggles to cope with each one, finding it all happening too quickly for her to react to properly. Tangled in thoughts and memories, the young trainer is soon overwhelmed and consumed in the darkness.<br />
<br />
Her eyelashes fluttering, ABL stirs and blinks several times, waiting for her vision to become less blurred. Wincing, the trainer rubs her forehead and groans, having fallen victim to a pounding headache. Patting the grass beside her, she feels the damp caress of the moisture that will later become the morning dew. Realising where she is, ABL slowly pulls herself up into a sitting position, still feeling dizzy. A feeling of panic takes hold of the meek girl as she looks around frantically, wondering if she has been left alone in this eerie place. Nudged by an instantly recognisable wet nose, the still of the night is temporarily broken by a soft cry of joy and relief as the trainer flings her arms around her faithful Arcanine. Delighted to find both her Espeon and Chikorita at her side as well, ABL wraps both of them up in loving hugs before returning them to the safety of their Pokéballs.<br />
<br />
Satisfied that Scamp and Dreamer are protected from any terrors the night may hold, ABL lets out a shocked gasp after glimpsing the shimmer of moonlight reflected in haunting ruby eyes. Stunned at the realisation that Dark Espeon was not merely a character in a frightening dream, the trainer's mind barely has time to register this fact before a voice tears at the night's silence. Hearing the cold demand and noticing the effect it has on Dark Espeon, the girl's fear again turns to pain, believing that this cruel voice must be the cause of the dark feline's suffering. Feeling utterly powerless as the Pokémon crawls back into a world of misery, ABL shakes her head, whispering &quot;Dark Espeon, don't go,&quot; her voice fading into the cold night air.<br />
<br />
Blinking away tears, ABL looks up at her Arcanine pleadingly, desperate to do something for the Pokémon she misunderstood. &quot;Karma, we have to find them, we <i>have</i> to.&quot; The powerful canine's expression is much more stoic, yet equally grave as her ears twitch in silent response. Staying close to her fiery guardian, the young girl follows Dark Espeon's trail as best she can, relying on the Arcanine's keen senses to help them find their way.</span></div>

<span style="color: mediumorchid"><b>Arn: </b>Surprisingly enough, the stark realisation of the fact that you are now living in an era that existed 100 years before you were even born is of little importance to you as you have more urgent matters on your mind. Despite the fact that you didn’t get any of the action you had been hoping for, your instinct to protect this girl from being hurt kicks in. Wasting no time you order Chowder to cast a double Reflect in front of the girl and the young man she has leapt out to protect and as the crowd cries out when the other gun totin’ cowboy fires his pistol a faint golden sheen is seen to appear in front of them both and the bullet bounces off, ricocheting off the Reflective Wall and slamming harmlessly into the middle of the dirt street.<br />
<br />
For a few long seconds there is total silence before someone in the crowd screams out, “WITCH!” and before you even realise what is happening the crowd the rest of the crowd has also started crying “WITCH!” and have surged forward and grabbed the girl, dragging her off up the street despite her cries of protest, and into the Sheriff’s Office to have her locked up until she can be dealt with. So surprised by this startling turn of events, you can do nothing but stand still and watch, rooted to the spot as you are shocked by the reaction of these people to something as innocent as a Pokémon’s defensive attack. Finally feeling sensation return you make a step to move after the crowd but feel a restraining hand placed gently on your shoulder. “I wouldn’t do that if I were you.”<br />
<br />
Spinning around you see the Barman who must have followed you outside. “I saw what you did,” he says calmly, “but if these people know it was you responsible for reflecting that bullet then you’ll be burned at the stake right alongside Faith.” Uh-oh, looks like trouble. Whatever shall you do?</span><br />

</blockquote><span style="color: mediumorchid">Pleased that Chowder was able to pull of a Quick reflect to Protect the Girl and Cowboy he sighed, turning around to snake back into the room before he heard the screams of people all around him, turning back around he watched as the towns people looked at the two, the girl stood terrified as they started moving towards her chants of Witch, witch, Witch coming from their mouths.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...shit, Chowder I think we made a biiiig booboo here, and I think we should just do something about..&quot;<br />
<br />
Before he could finish he he felt a hand on his shoulder as the girl starts getting taken away, turning around he looks up and toweringover him is the bartender of the bar he was in, as he listens to what the bartender says he gulps hevily thinking of how being burnt at the stake would feel, The girl, Faith he said also subcoming to the same fate soon after she gets locked up not knowing what to do he steps back a bit before speaking with the bartender,<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you know? Anything that can help me get her out there and alive i'll do whatever is needed, I made a mistake and it needs correcting.&quot;</span></div>

Shuckle stares at you curiously before watching Bulbasaur pace around, apparently mad with you for some reason Shuckle can’t quite fathom. Eyeing you both for a short time it soon becomes bored, wandering off slowly into the bushes. By the time you realise Shuckle is gone there is very little to do other than to continue with your adventure and so you set off again with Bulbasaur in tow who is left wondering how a possible battle opportunity slipped away unnoticed. After a half hour of uneventful travel you enter a forest clearing where you are confronted by a most unusual sight. Standing right in the middle appears to be a shrine of some sort while various bug and grass Pokémon stand around it, paying homage. The moment they see you enter the clearing they all scatter, afraid of seeing a human in these part. Moving closer to examine the shrine you see the Pokémon have left small offerings of various fruits, vegetable, berries, acorns and other knickknacks they’ve picked up in the forest, apparently abandoned by other trainers such as yourself who had been passing through. You don’t see anything of great value but an inscription carved in the statue catches your attention:<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center"><i>Deep within the serpent’s lair great treasure you will find<br />
Let caution guide you or beware for illusions often blind,<br />
Allow greed to overwhelm your soul and suffer for all time<br />
The insanity of those before who know not peace of mind.</i>&#8203;</div> <br />
Frowning as you read over the cryptic inscription you wonder what it could mean when you hear a voice behind you. “I.. I wou.. wouldn’t go there if I were you.”<br />
<br />
Spinning around you see a man in his twenties skulking by the treeline. He has long filthy brown dreadlocks into which leaves, grass and God only knows what else are now entwined. His clothes are ragged and filthy and while you can see that he must have once been a handsome young lad, there is very little light left in his pale blue eyes. There appears only madness now, a deep sense of paranoia. “Eeeevil things I tell you!” he yells with an insane look in his eyes. “Don’t go there!” He appears to be attempting to swat imaginary insects off himself while he curses at his invisible attackers and you watch him closely, not exactly sure how to react.....<br />

<br />
Adam: So...You are?<br />
<br />
Adam studders for a moment. He thinks about the inscription and what it could mean.<br />
<br />
Adam: Deep within the serpents lair...that means there must be a snake Pokemon's lair nearby. I can think of Ekans, Arbok, and Seviper right now, but there may be more. Bulbasaur, do you have any idea?<br />
<br />
Bulbasaur: Bulba?<br />
<br />
Adam: Then the next part says...Let caution guide you or beware for illusions often blind...could that mean that the treasure within the lair is an illusion?<br />
<br />
He thinks about the first two lines carefully then decides to go on the the next line.<br />
<br />
Adam: Allow greed to overwhelm your soul and suffer for all time...could that mean the treasure is an illusion if you let greed take over you? And then if you share the treasure, the treasure will not be an illusion?<br />
<br />
Adam paces around forgetting about the man standing by him swating insects. As he continues to pace, he realizes that the man may be somewhat of a hint to the inscription.<br />
<br />
Adam: Now the last line...The insanity of those who know not peace of mind...I guess that goes along with greed overcoming your soul. Umm sir...why is it that you don't want me to go in there? Did you go in and greed overwhelmed you? If so, tell me what's in there please. I would really like to know. <br />
<br />
Adam soon recalls Bulbasaur and looks closely at the inscription waiting for the man to answer.<br />
<br />
Adam: <i>Perhaps...the man is the serpent. That could be true, but I don't really think it would be true. He's trying to stop me from going in there, does that mean he is the serpent and he does not want me snooping around.</i><br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: limegreen"><b>Archaic: </b>For once Treecko is left speechless as the Pinsir surround you, their expressions less than friendly. It appears he hadn’t expected to come into contact with the Pinsir quite so soon and hides behind you, expecting you to offer him protection. You are undaunted by the stagbeetles however, showing your lack of fear in both your expression and tone of voice which, lucky for you, has prevented an instant slaughter, one in which you would have been their victim.<br />
<br />
The Pinsir talk amongst themselves while Omekekashi watches on, her little eyes clearly showing her eagerness for a bit of action. It doesn’t take long for the Pinsir to reach a decision as they prepare to take you with them, two of them taking position in front of you while two move behind, prodding you to move along. Following the two Pinsir in the lead, you wonder where it is they are taking you and it isn’t long before your question is answered. You hear Treecko whisper something about you being in the heart of Stagbeetle country before you break into a massive forest clearing. The area is dark and dank, all light from above cut off by a thick canopy of leaves, but you can see well enough to know that if you’re not going to be dead in two minutes then you are in for the treat of a lifetime.<br />
<br />
As you are led into the middle of the clearing Pinsir appear everywhere, emerging from the forest to watch the developments. You are brought to a halt, guarded by three of the Pinsir who brought you here while the fourth breaks off from the group and approaches a lone Pinsir who looks to be much older than the rest. For some reason you can sense this one holds a position of authority and as the first Pinsir approaches and bows before it before speaking quietly, your suspicions are confirmed. The elderly Pinsir listens to the young one, it’s eyes never leaving yours as you stand watching the hushed conversation take place. The old Pinsir then nods, waving his hand in a dismissive gesture. The first Pinsir bows again, heading back toward you and taking its position with the other three.<br />
<br />
The elderly Pinsir raises his hand which you presume to be a signal of some sort causing several Pinsir standing on the edge on the clearing to rush off. He then walks up to you, his back straight, his eyes not leaving yours. He stops in front of you examining both you and Omekekashi closely, his gaze barely even registering Treecko’s presence. Looking back to you, he speaks, “You dare to enter Pinsir territory?” he asks, his expression stony. “No man is welcome here but my scouts inform me you are different to others. Tell me what you are doing here and we may spare your life.”<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: limegreen">Mamoru inclines his head in response. &quot;But of course, honoured elder. Truth be told, I have come here less for my own purposes, and more for my dear Omekekashi's sake.&quot; He tilts his head to look down at her, placing his hand on the back of her head, away from any still fresh blood. &quot;She has become rather lonely of late I'm afraid, and I had hoped to find her a suitable mate from amongst your number.&quot; He smiles softly. &quot;Certainly, I hadn't imagined I might be quite so fortunate to encounter a group of Pinser so large. The stories told about the Pinser in this forest do not do you justice. I would be surprised indeed if we could not find at least one amongst your number whom might take Omekekashi's fancy.&quot;</span></div>

Her opponent hits the dome of energy surrounding her and bounces off it, falling back and you make out the form of a Rattata. Bulbasaur then begins spinning rapidly, making you a little dizzy as the camera spins too fast for you to make anything out, but all of a sudden the camera is flying through the air and smashes into the tunnel wall as Rattata whacks Bulba with a Tackle, which has broken her out of her Swords Dance and sent her reeling. She quickly regains her footing however, but you see another purple streak as Rattata moves in with Quick Attack causing minor damage. Bulba, now very annoyed, leaps forward to attack with a Tackle of her own.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px">While it looks like Bulba has finally gotten her bearings and can hold her own against Rattata, Mike is getting nervous. “Shall I pull her out of there?” he asks, a worried frown creasing his brow, “Or would you rather she battle?”</span><br />

</blockquote><span style="color: lime">Watching the screen intently, Stephen watches as a pure white shield forms around Bulbasaur and the camera, protecting it from the attacks of the wild Pokemon inside the tunnel. Stephen watches as the white suddenly all concentrates to one small area, as the opponent Pokemon bounce off of the energy shield.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: lime">The limp form of the opponent Pokemon quickly bounces off, and falls to the ground, a few feet in front of Bulbasaur. Using the light from the flashlight, it is quite easy to see the small form of a mouselike Pokemon spread along the floor, slowly getting back up, its white teeth bared, and shining off of the light from the flashlight. <i>A Rattata.</i></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: lime">Stephen watches as the camera begins to spin, around and around and around, as Bulbasaur begins to perform a Swords Dance attack. However, Stephen still watches the screen, as he makes out a small flash of purple. Suddenly, the small video screen goes blank.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: lime">Stephen's stomach churns. <i>What happened!?!</i> <i> Is Bulbasaur all right!?!</i> And a few other questions race through Stephen's mind. However, the screen goes blurry for a moment, before the picture slowly grows clearer. After a few seconds, the camera is back on line, with the light of the flashlight showing an upside down Bulbasaur and Rattata, battling. Stephen gasps as Rattata slams into Bulbasaur with a Quick Attack, but nods as Bulbasaur gets its retaliation.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: lime">Mike then turns to Stephen, and asks if he should pull Bulbasaur from the tunnel. Stephen begins to think out loud. &quot;Well, I believe that we should continue on. Bulbasaur needs some experience, plus, Rattata will still be in there even if we pull Bulbasaur out, and we really need to help the Nidoran and Nidoqueen.&quot; Stephen then begins to speak into the headset, hoping that it is still functional. &quot;Excellent, Bulbasaur! Now, use a quick Growl, and then Tackle it again!&quot;</span></div>

<span style="color: red"><b>Wayne: </b>Doing what any normal person would do when seeing a meteor crash land near them, you immediately set off to investigate. Bulbasaur is just as excited as you, if not more so, and eagerly leads the way. Luckily you don’t come across anything dangerous upon your journey, although when you reach the site you notice many curious Pokémon standing around the rim of the crater who had also come to investigate, but when they see you approaching they soon scatter, not used to seeing a human in these parts. Now that you are near, you can see the meteor doesn’t look like a meteor at all. It isn’t made of rock like most meteors, or ice like a comet, it appears to be smooth and you can see a metallic sheen reflecting off its side from the small flames and glowing embers scattered on the ground around it.<br />
<br />
More curious than ever you make your way down the side of the crater being careful not to burn yourself on the heated ground and when you approach the “meteor” you see it is more like a small space pod from a science fiction movie. Realizing that if this is a pod then there must be something inside you look at it for a while wondering whether or not it will be safe to open it. After all, who knows what could be inside? It is while you are standing there musing over your options that you hear a small clanging sound coming from inside. <i>Ting... ting... ting... Thwack! Ting... ting... ting... Thwack!</i><br />
<br />
Bulbasaur looks up at you with a raised eyebrow, even more curious than before and urges you to open the pod to see what is inside. You hesitate for a moment, wondering what could be making that noise, <i>Ting... ting... ting... Thwack! Ting... ting... ting... Thwack!</i> but your curiosity soon overpowers your sense of logic as well and you reach for what looks to be a release mechanism for a door on the outside of the pod. Suddenly you hear a loud hiss as the door opens and you look inside to see something rather amazing. Staring at the tiny Pokémon who looks up at you with a big grin when it realises it now has an audience for it’s musical rendition of who knows what tune it is playing, it happily bashes a little more vigorously with the spoon in its hand upon un upturned bowl, <i>Ting... ting... ting...</i> then on a wooden box, <i>Thwack!</i> <br />
<br />
It repeats its little tune, <i>Ting... ting... ting... Thwack! Ting... ting... ting... Thwack! Ting... ting... ting... Thwack!</i> before looking up at you with adorable little eyes and happily crying, “Togepi!”<br />
<br />
Whatever shall you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: red">Wayne curiously looked at space pod and then scared to think whether to open and find out what is inside or not. While thinking Wayne suddenly heard noises coming from inside it, <i>Ting... ting... ting... Thwack! Ting... ting... ting... Thwack!</i>. Both trainer and pokemon then looked at each other questioning the pod. Like always, Wayne curiosity took over him and his pokemon. Wayne then pressed what looked like the opening button for the pod. Slightly scared by the hissing noise that the door made, Wayne soon looked at the pokemon inside it. Looking at the tiny pokemon Wayne then sighed in relief that it wasn't something dangerous inside it.<br />
<br />
Wayne saw the little egg creature perform on the bowl and box and soon after finishing playing on it's instruments, Wayne looked at it's eyes. Feeling excited to look at such an adorable pokemon Wayne and Bulbasaur soon started to talk to the egg pokemon. &quot;Hello Togepi, my name is Wayne and this is one of my friends, Bulbasaur.&quot; Wayne then started to wonder where this Togepi came from or where it's going. &quot;We are here to explore and find interesting things and look at the comets that are suppose to appear here. How about you Togepi, What are you doing here?&quot; Soon after asking the Togepi that question Wayne soon realized that he probably wouldn't be able to understand the Togepi’s answer even if he asked it. &quot;Anyway would you like to play with my Bulbasaur Togepi? Or maybe you can play a little more music, I really enjoyed your little tune there it‘s really good.&quot; </span></span></div>

<span style="color: aqua"><b>Loki: </b>Hearing the little girls’ cries practically rips your heart out but you know that if you interfere you will have no hope of ever finding Gyarados or any of the other Pokémon stolen from trainers visiting the river. You watch silently, awaiting your chance to follow, and the moment the Tentacruel disappear beyond the waterfall you move after them.<br />
<br />
Milotic glides swiftly forward, not wanting to lose sight of the jellyfish Pokémon. The journey through the churning water at the foot of the waterfall is anything but pleasant, as you find yourselves being tossed around, the water crashing down on top of you and spinning you around for what feels like an eternity. Mike grabs hold of you so tightly that you feel your ribs my be crushed, but just when you think you’ll never escape the powerful churning mass of water, Milotic breaks free and you find yourselves on the other side.<br />
<br />
Looking around you find yourself in an underwater tunnel. There isn’t a lot of marine life along here, but about twenty metres ahead you can see a light. You notice a large shadow rising to the surface of the water and stay back, close to the wall, recognising it as belonging to the two Tentacruel who still have Blastoise wrapped up tightly in their grasp. You can’t see much as the Pokémon reach the surface but you see a fair bit of splashing before the Tentacruel part and submerge again, returning the way they had come.<br />
<br />
Hiding in the tall reeds along the bottom of the tunnel you, Mike and Milotic all stay as still and quiet as possible, watching as the Tentacruel approach and then pass right over top of you before disappearing through the churning water at the base of the waterfall, most likely to go and lurk in search of their next target. Sighing with relief, happy to have not been discovered, Milotic heads up the tunnel and slowly rises to the surface of the water and into the light.<br />
<br />
What confronts you is amazing to say the least. A large underground cavern, obviously a natural formation, has been converted into a base of some sort. There are cages and tanks all around the place, some empty, some containing various water Pokémon, and you see three men hauling the unconscious Blastoise across the room before dumping it unceremoniously into one of the larger cages. Locking it securely they walk off into another tunnel on the opposite side of the cavern to where you are hiding and as they do you hear one of them say, “This one will be worth a pretty penny, it’s got a lot of fight in it.” The other two laugh like a couple of drunk baboons which you hear echoing around the cavernous room before they disappear into the tunnel.<br />
<br />
Taking a careful look around the room you can see that it’s empty, at least of people, and your eyes fall upon a long rod hooked up to a battery of some kind. It’s sitting right next to the water and you realise they must have used it to zap Blastoise so it couldn’t fight them. You can’t help but wonder what is going on here and how they have managed to make a base in here but you brush those thoughts to the back of your mind for the time being since your first priority is to find Gyarados. What will you do now?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: aqua">Seeing the Tentacruel leave puts a moment of relief back into Loki's system. He and Mike head forward to continue the search for their friends and any others who were taken away.<br />
<br />
Milotic slowly surfaces revealing a large underwater tunnel. He quickly notices the cages and containers, most likely to hold the capture Pokemon. He sees some men dragging off the Blastoise from before. They lock it in a cage and walk away.<br />
<br />
Loki steps out of the water and spots the stun rod. &quot;Bastards. Can't even knock a Pokemon out without cheating.&quot; <br />
<br />
Loki helps Mike out of the water and returns Milotic to it's Pokeball.<br />
<br />
&quot;They seem to be black market poachers. We need to release all the captured Pokemon and stop them. Stay close to me Mike and try not to make any loud noises.&quot;<br />
<br />
Loki swiftly and silently makes his way deeper into the tunnel. Knowing the cages will be locked, he looks for some way to open the cages before he attempts to take on the poachers.</span></div>

<span style="color: red"><b>COMET’S CORNER</b></span><br />
<span style="color: red"><b>ades: </b>Deciding to forego John’s offer for the moment seeing as he has enough to worry about, you kindly offer Katie your support. The little girl looks up at you through bloodshot eyes but has trouble breaking a smile and instead nods before looking to the floor, her expression as miserable as ever. Taking your leave you suddenly remember it would be helpful to know where to find Pokémon around here and ask John where to look. He smiles and walks toward the door, “Follow me,” he says, leading you outside.<br />
<br />
“There isn’t much to find around here I’m afraid,” he says, walking slowly so you may talk properly. “If you wander the plains you will find scattered Ground and Rock type Pokémon, even the odd Fighting type, and on occasion you may cross paths with Fairies such as Clefairy or Jigglypuff, and even a few scavengers like Rattata, but there are rumors of colonies of rare types living somewhere out there though we haven’t found any yet.” He stops speaking for a moment, looking worried about something. “I wouldn’t suggest travelling the plains alone however. There is a rogue band of trainers on the loose causing destruction wherever they go. They’ve attacked our settlement twice and I’m positive it was them responsible for the vicious attack upon Annabelle, as a warning to me.”<br />
<br />
You hear Katie draw in her breath at the mention of Annabelle and she begins sobbing again, rushing back to the Pokémon Centre to be with her beloved Ninetales, John watching his daughter as she disappears inside. “Annabelle belonged to my wife, Julia” he says softly, “and was given to Katie on her 5th birthday. One week before Julia died. Annabelle is Katie’s last living link to her mother so you can understand why she’s taking this so badly....”<br />
<br />
Returning his full attention to you, John continues, “If you plan on travelling the plains, please be very careful. You’ll need some strong Pokémon by your side in case you run into trouble and at least one Pokémon built for speed if you need to outrun danger.” John appears to think about something for a moment before adding, “We do breed and raise our own Pokémon here on the settlement however, and they are sometimes given out as prizes in the Battle Dome to some of the younger ones who are beginning their training but haven’t left home yet. We cover most types and it will give you a chance to level up your current Pokémon while you battle.”<br />
<br />
What would you like to do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: Red">&quot;...so you can understand why she's taking this so badly.&quot; The father said softly, his eyes not leaving the door as it closed behind his daughter. <br />
<br />
John understood. He understood too well how it felt to lose a person close to you, and a familiar cold lump settled down into his stomach as he thought back to that terrible day...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Then the father was talking again and John was yanked back to the present and now, where bands of rogue trainers roamed the lands and a competition lay in wait for a champion. <br />
<br />
&quot;Those rogue trainers sound disgusting. Attacking innocent people and pokemon...I'd like to have a go at them. In the mean time though... how, uh, do you get to this Battle Dome?&quot;<br />
<br />
The father started explaining and walking, but John's eyes lingered over that closed door for a moment longer.</span></div>

<span style="color: burlywood"><b>DELIBIRD RIDGE</b></span><br />
<span style="color: burlywood"><b>Radical Edward: </b>Deciding that enough is enough, you end your battle with Tauros, doing everything you can for the injured beast before climbing aboard Atlas who heads off into the distance. You think back to the battle, thinking it was just a little too easy, and wonder if perhaps Tauros had already been weakened somehow. It’s not normal for a Pokémon like that to go down so quickly, but you soon let thoughts of the bull leave your mind as more important matters drift back into your consciousness. The pillar is looming before you, so close that you can make out the enormous Aerodactyl head at the top. The image of the bird has been expertly crafted, carved straight into the rock, and you think back to what the mysterious man had told you about the tribespeople who had defeated it. They had supposedly been expert craftsmen, capable of making just about anything, and as you stare at the carving in all of its ferocious glory, you don’t doubt this fact for a moment as the image of the creature exudes such an aura of terror that you feel your spine tingling with nerves. It’s no wonder few people have ever travelled here.<br />
<br />
The rest of the day passes uneventfully, and as dusk approaches you once again see the familiar smoke trail rising into the air. You approach slowly this time, knowing who you will find and when you approach the campfire and greet the man boiling his tea over the flames you take your usual seat. You once again share a meal and warm yourself by the fire before falling into a restless sleep, the voice of the man echoing through your mind, <i>“Not everything is as it appears. Trust your instincts and let your heart guide the way....”</i><br />
<br />
In your dreams you see people, people who look like they don’t live in these times. They are clad in ancient Bedouin clothing and they live in caves. You can sense these people are anxious, constantly looking to the skies with fear in their eyes. The children are not playing, they are instead loading food onto a makeshift cart while the women prepare what little food they have left. The men sit around sharpening spears and other weapons. There is no laughter, not a sign of happiness, and the atmosphere is one of pure misery. <br />
<br />
You are standing amongst the people but they cannot see you, but out of nowhere a little boy appears. He stands in front of you and smiles as though it’s perfectly normal to see someone dressed as yourself standing in their midst. You are surprised by this but then smile at the boy who points to the sky over your shoulder. Turning your head you see a great shadow approaching, directly in line with the sun. You cannot make it out but you know what it is. The next minute you hear screaming as people run for cover. Men and women run around lifting the youngest children into their arms before dashing off and disappearing into their caves. Not everyone makes it though and you hear a terrifying screech as the bird descends from the sky, wreaking havoc to everything in it’s wake. You hear the screams of people now and see the bird take off into the sky again, the body of a young boy clutched in it’s talons. <br />
<br />
Suddenly you sit bolt upright, sweating and panting heavily as though waking from a nightmare. The air is cool on your face and it takes a moment for you to realise where you are. It is morning again. The campfire has burned out and the old man is gone, leaving you alone in the fresh morning air with the fragmented memories of your dream haunting you. You try to piece them together but there are things you cannot remember which is more frustrating than ever since you can now remember some small details but you cannot waste time pondering too heavily on these thoughts so you head out once more on the final leg of your journey to the mammoth pillar.<br />
<br />
After another days’ hike you finally reach your destination. It is dusk again and you are tired, cold and hungry but there is no campfire awaiting you on this night. Instead you stand before the base of the obelisk type rock, reading an inscription carved into a stone wall blocking what was once the entrance to a cave or tunnel of some sort leading inside.<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center"><i>The spirits of men, women and children lie<br />
Within the chamber where they did die,<br />
Their restless souls searching for peace<br />
Trapped forever with the eternal beast,<br />
To enter you must show that you do care<br />
The vision of future in your ethereal stare,<br />
This inner sight will show you the way<br />
Into the dark from the light of day.</i>&#8203;</div><br />

You can’t explain why you feel this connection with it but you know that you need to follow it. With all of your Pokémon bar Karma returned safely to their Pokéballs, you do the only thing you feel you can, you attempt to track Dark Espeon down. Karma heads off into the forest, her keen sense of smell picking up on Dark Espeon’s scent immediately. Walking beside your faithful companion, your mind wanders back to the voice you had heard earlier, <i>“Shadow, get back here RIGHT NOW or it’s the dungeons for you!”</i> You can tell the voice belongs to a girl not much older than yourself but it was so full of coldness, a cruel and bitter, terrifying quality had pierced your heart upon hearing it and you know with utmost certainty that you’re going to have to be very careful about approaching this girl should you happen to meet with her.<br />
<br />
Several minutes later you enter an area of the forest that isn’t quite as dark as it was where you had arrived. There is moonlight breaking through the tree branches overhead, lighting your path, if only a little, yet the light is welcome after the morbid, pitch black surroundings in which you had arrived. Karma suddenly stops walking, her head cocked to the side as though listening to something. Nudging you gently while a low warning rumbles in her throat, it’s apparent that she doesn’t want you to take another step forward at this point in time. Stopping beside her you listen intently, trying to hear whatever it is she had picked up on. At first you hear nothing, but you soon hear the sound of movement and the same voice you had heard minutes before. Karma lays her belly flat on the ground as the voice approaches and you quickly drop to the forest floor beside her, listening as the footsteps approach.<br />
<br />
“I hope haven’t been up to anything <i>dangerous</i> on these nightly strolls of yours Shadow,” the girl says, a distinct threatening tone in her voice. “You know the penalty for disloyalty and I would <i>hate</i> to have to see you suffer the consequences of any indiscretions.”<br />
<br />
At this point the girl walks past you, stopping for a moment to look down at her feet. You can see she is holding a satchel of some sort and you could swear you see something inside of it moving. You cannot see her face however as she is standing on the opposite side of a row of trees while you are laying flat to the ground on the other side. All you can see is her black boots and what appears to be a long black dress or robe fluttering gently around her ankles in the cool night breeze, but it is not her clothing that interests you, it is the small black figure of Dark Espeon who is sitting on the ground looking up at her with those large ruby eyes. Dark Espeon shakes it’s gives a slight, regal shake of it’s head in response to the girls’ question, staring confidently back into her eyes. There is a moment’s pause in which you can feel the tension in the air before the girl speaks again. “Very well then,” she replies. “Let us not waste any more time. We have preparations to see to.”<br />
<br />
She then turns and continues walking while Dark Espeon takes it’s time to follow. It looks directly into your eyes, through the bushes separating the two of you, staring deeply into your eyes for several long seconds before turning and walking off into the night after it’s mistress.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: limegreen"><b>Quilava: </b>Aware of the fact that Bulbasaur is holding her own you’re not prepared to pull her out of there just yet. Besides, there’s a bigger picture to take into consideration and pulling her out now could be disastrous. Explaining your reasons for leaving her in the tunnel you take the microphone from Mike, giving Bulba her next orders.<br />
<br />
Hearing a lot of static on the line you’re not quite sure if she has heard you, but the next minute you hear the low rumble of a Growl coming through the mic and know that everything is ok for the moment. You then see Rattata dart forward and Tackle Bulba who stumbles backward, dangerously close to the gaping role in the floor. Mike immediately prepares himself to tighten her safety chord but he knows she needs some slack in order to battle properly so he doesn’t pull on it just yet. <br />
<br />
Recovering quickly from the attack, Bulba Tackles Rattata and both Pokémon begin rolling in a tangled heap on the floor. You can’t see much from the camera but a moment later you hear a terrified shriek which sounds rather rattish and you see the camera on Bulba’s head as it falls down through the floor, the opening of the hole/shaft becoming smaller as she freefalls into its depths <i>with</i> Rattata. Mike immediately tightens her safety chord and the camera comes to an abrupt halt. Releasing a long, slow, whistle of pent up breath, you watch as Mike slowly brings her back to the top of the hole and once she is on solid ground again you both look at each other, knowing that Bulba had just unwittingly given new definition to the term KO. <b>Level up for Bulbasaur.</b><br />
<br />
Allowing Bulba a few minutes to rest after the battle, she eventually crosses the ledge again, returning to the far side of the gaping hole in the floor before continuing on through the tunnel. For the next 20 minutes all goes well. There are no signs of trouble and you slowly begin to relax again. “She should be getting close to the blockage now,” Mike says with an air of hope in his voice, and a few moments later that is exactly where Bulbasaur ends up. Staring through the camera you can barely believe your eyes when you see a massive black and white image on the screen. Sitting right up against the blocked wall of rubble is a very large, very heavy, very injured Snorlax who had somehow managed to stay alive, trapped in here for the past 5 years.....<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: limegreen"><b>Archaic: </b>The elderly Pinsir’s eyes fall upon Omekekashi as you speak, a thoughtful expression crossing his face. “This is not possible,” he replies calmly, “However, you have come into our midst in peace and been forthright regarding your intentions for seeking us out. For this your lives will be spared and furthermore you are invited to join us for tonight’s festivities.” Looking down at Omekekashi again, he continues, “I am interested in seeing how your companion performs in our annual tribal rites tonight. Please make yourself at home until the festivities begin and ensure you’re well rested for the celebrations.” Gesturing toward one of the Pinsir who had brought you here, the one who appears to be the leader of the guards, the King Pinsir nods. “Maebureshi will see to your needs during your stay. If there is anything you need to make your stay more comfortable let him know and he will see to it. Farewell until tonight.” King Pinsir then turns and disappears into the forest with the rest of the Pinsir who had brought you here while you are left alone in the clearing with Omekeashi, Treecko and Maebureshi.<br />
<br />
Finally alone, Treecko begins spluttering something incomprehensible, looking paler than normal. “ANNUAL TRIBAL RITES!” he eventually exclaims, nearly passing out with hysteria. He then claps his hands over his mouth, looking fearfully toward Maebureshi as though afraid the Pinsir will rip out his innards. Maebureshi looks calmly down at him and you could swear you see a hint of amusement in his eyes, but at the moment you’re more interested in why Treecko is so afraid of this ritual. “Do you know what that is?!” he whispers between his fingers. “It’s a slaughter! The strongest Pinsir warriors battle to the death until only one is left standing! The champion is then the next in line to the Pinsir throne should the King pass away before the next Tribal Rites Festival. We have to get out of here!” <br />
<br />
What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: limegreen"><b>Solarsaur: </b><i>Thank you.</i><br />
<br />
Trying your best to ignore the crazy man swatting at imaginary insects you turn your attention to the riddle, working through each line as you attempt to translate its meaning. It soon becomes apparent that this filthy, dreadlocked and most definitely insane young man standing at the edge of the clearing could very well be a key to solving the riddle so you finally turn to him, asking if he can give you any clues as to what the inscription may mean. In response to your questions the man appears to become even more agitated and paranoid. <br />
<br />
“Evil things lurk in the serpents lair I tell you!” he yells, flailing his arms around wildly as though trying to fend off a swarm of wild Beedrill. “They’re everywhere! In every shadow, every crevice, every wall, under the floors, on the ceilings, they’re all around you! You can’t escape them! Horrible, vile eeeevil things!” He suddenly drops to his knees, wildly clawing at his clothing as though trying to brush off an army of bugs. Suddenly he looks up at you, the insane look in his eyes gone before pleading, “Please help me! The treasure is the potion and can cure this madness. Please help me!” before a terrified look crosses his face and he passes out, collapsing at your feet.<br />
<br />
Completely bewildered you just stand there looking at him for a few moments before you notice something that had fallen out of his shirt pocket. Picking up the piece of paper you unfold it and quickly scan it’s contents. One thing that is certain is that it’s a map strewn with scribbled riddles and clues, obviously handwritten by this poor sod but whether it was before or after he lost his grip on sanity is anyone’s guess . The second thing that is certain is that if X marks the spot, then you’ve just discovered the whereabouts of the Serpent’s Lair. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: mediumorchid"><b>MYSTERY ISLAND</b></span><br />
<span style="color: mediumorchid"><b>Arn: </b>The man smiles knowingly, a hint of regret in his eyes. “You had no way of knowing Slowpokes attack could have caused that kind of reaction. These people believe all forms of psychic energy are a result of witchcraft and even went so far as to burn down an entire forest a few miles away because there were colonies of Exeggcute and Ralts residing there. They believed the forest to be cursed and would rather see it burned to the ground than to know creatures with “unnatural” abilities can exist peacefully alongside them in day to day life. Taking another look at you, he smiles. “Let’s get out of here and I’ll explain in more detail.”<br />
<br />
Pulling a young man out of the crowd, the bartender says something to him and then turns back to you. “Luke will tend to the Bar for the rest of the day while we go back to my ranch and discuss what to do about Faith in a little more detail.” Looking across the street at the angry mob he adds, “And in private.”<br />
<br />
A short while later you arrive at a ranch a couple of miles east of the town and look around in awe. You see a corral with several Ponyta and Rapidash, another with a single Tauros, and yet another separated from the Tauros with roughly a dozen Miltank grazing lazily on the fresh grass. You notice there are several barns spread over the ranch which is in itself several acres of prime farmland, along with three greenhouses close to the main homestead.<br />
<br />
“It’s something isn’t it?” The bartender asks proudly after seeing the awe in your expression. “It cost me an arm and a leg along with several dozen head of cattle and agreements with shops in several towns for milk and grain to pay for the glass to build those greenhouses but it was worth it all in the long-run. They’ve proved to be very profitable.”<br />
<br />
Walking toward the main house the man begins speaking again. “I’ve just realised I haven’t formally introduced myself. My name is Gary and I’m not originally from these parts.” Looking you over he nods his head as though confirming his own suspicions. “Judging from your clothing I’d say I’m from the same time and place you are. I arrived here 9 years ago. I was a 15 year old trainer and flew to a mysterious island surrounded by clouds just visible from the Cloud Garden’s Sky Gate. I landed on the outskirts of an old ghost town which I began to explore but I saw and heard some rather bizarre things. After a couple of hours the place was making me so nervous that I thought it was time to head off but as I was walking out of town I felt dizzy and collapsed. When I woke up I was here.”<br />
<br />
An elderly farmer found me and took me home with him where he and his wife cared for me and made me promise not to talk of the place I came from lest I the townspeople think I’m crazy and drive me away. I tried many times to find a way home but never could and eventually stayed on here with the couple who told villagers I was their grandson, recently orphaned and now come to live with them. They were a wonderful old pair and treated me like their own. They left all of this,” he says, gesturing toward the massive amount of land the ranch covered, “to me when they passed away.”<br />
<br />
Realising you weren’t here to hear his life story, Gary continues. “Pokémon are not respected by people who live here, they are used as slaves for their own selfish purposes and psychic Pokémon are hunted down and killed. It’s fear that drives these people to do such a thing because they are afraid the Pokémon will outnumber and kill them with their special ‘magical’ abilities. That’s why Faith was labelled a witch when you had Slowpoke protect her from the bullet, for only psychic or magical powers could do something like that and as a result she will be burned at the stake unless we can do something to break her out of that prison tonight. I have Pokémon we can use to help with the escape and I have supplies. I also have a place to hide her when the townsfolk find her missing and begin their search but I cannot go with you because I have too much at stake. If I am seen, everything I have worked hard to build here for the past 9 years will be lost.”<br />
<br />
Understanding Gary’s situation you nod, realising it would be suicide for him to be seen helping a ‘witch’ break free from prison but you can’t help but wonder why he is putting himself at risk by helping you to plan the escape but before you can think much more on the matter he continues speaking. “You must be very careful though, for if anyone witnesses you attempting to help Faith escape you will be put to death with her.”</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red"><b>COMET’S CORNER</b></span><br />
<span style="color: red"><b>ades: </b>Understanding perfectly what Katie is going through, you feel your heart reaching out to the girl but you know there is nothing you can do for her so you instead concentrate upon your next goal. Battling and capturing Pokémon. The Battledome prizes seem worth hanging around for as you listen to John explain how Pokémon are specially bred and raised here in the Beta Settlement for the younger trainers and think this could be a perfect opportunity for you to pick yourself up a new team member - if you can win.<br />
<br />
He leads you to one of the largest buildings in the settlement, a sprawling structure spanning over several acres of land which houses several arenas for various types of battles. Smiling, John bids you farewell. “I need to get back to work now but everything you need to know is posted on the information board over there. The different battle arenas and competitions along with the prizes offered and where you need to go to sign up for the tournament you are entering. I wish you the best of luck,” he says, before heading back out the main door.<br />
<br />
Looking around you realise why you have hardly seen many people about outdoors because it appears most of them are in here. People are wandering around everywhere, some standing around chatting in excited groups, others swapping battle tactics, some sitting or standing alone while nervously awaiting their next battles, but what interests you are what kinds of battles there are available. Walking over to the noticeboard John had pointed out, you skin over the rules before taking a look at the arenas and prizes in the beginners section.<br />

What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: red"><b>Wayne: </b>Excited to not only have a friendly audience to play for, but also one who is enjoying it’s performance, Togepi releases a small squeal of delight and hands you a spare spoon. Pointing at its upturned bowl and box Togepi plays it’s little tune again, <i>Ting... ting... ting... Thwack! Ting... ting... ting... Thwack!</i> then looks at you with a big happy smile and waits for you to follow suit. Smiling, you happily humor the little egg Pokémon, making little tunes with it for the next several minutes while Bulbasaur extends his vines, joining in the music making by tapping his vines against the bowl and box.<br />
<br />
Eventually Togepi stops playing it’s music and opens a little cabinet door next to it, removing a few little seeds and nibbling on them before handing a few to you and to Bulbasaur. Whoever had put Togepi into this capsule had obviously taken great care to ensure it had enough provisions to survive it’s journey, but looking through what is left of it’s food stores you can see that it wouldn’t have lasted much longer had the capsule continued travelling through space. You look at Togepi, wondering what to do while it happily totters about collecting a few odds and ends, toys etc, to show you. You know you can’t leave it here, but if you take it with you, what if whoever had put it in here comes looking for it? On the other hand, what if nobody ever comes looking for it? The pod <i>had</i> crash landed after all, Togepi may never be found since it hadn’t reached whatever destination it was being sent to.<br />
<br />
With all of these thoughts drifting through your mind, Togepi hands you yet another object, only this one catches your attention as it is made of a strange lightweight yet durable material you had never seen before. It is cylindrical in shape and appears to have a cap on one end. “Togepi!” the little egg Pokémon exclaims happily, pointing at the end of the cylinder. Examining it closer you find that the cap on one end of the cylinder can be removed and so you warily take it off before upending the cylinder. Out of it falls a rolled up piece of parchment which you open to reveal a strange document of some kind. It contains images, symbols and writings you cannot understand but somehow you know this scroll is a very important key to the Togepi mystery. You wonder if you may be able to find someone who can translate the scroll for you as you look into Togepi’s hopeful little eyes. It is looking at you with such trust that it makes your heart flutter....<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span><br />

<span style="color: aqua"><b>Loki: </b>Making your way into the room after the coast is clear you and Mike split up, looking for a key or something that will open the cages so you can release the Pokémon trapped inside. Some of them watch you suspiciously but due to the fact that you’re hiding from their enemies it soon becomes apparent that you are there to help them and for the first time since being captured, some of them appear hopeful. Mike soon finds a clipboard and calls you over.<br />
<br />
“Look at this,” he says, gesturing toward what appears to be a Pokémon inventory. Scanning back to the dates listed the week before Mike notices “Feraligatr” and quickly scans the remainder of the list. “It gives their height and weight and says they’ve been shipped out but it doesn’t say where!” he exclaims, exasperated. “How am I supposed to find him if I don’t know where to look?”<br />
<br />
Taking the list off him you scan over the pages yourself and notice this list only seems to contain Pokémon brought in along with their general details such as the date they were captured, their species, approximate age, gender, height, weight and general prognosis of their overall health along with the date they were shipped out. You notice a few Pokémon who appear to have been ill were crossed off the list with a red marker and you find yourself not wanting to know what happened to those ones.<br />
<br />
While you look over the list Mike continues to search for a key, eventually locating one and opening the cages of some of the larger Pokémon. Some make an immediate dash for the water to escape this place before than can be captured again while others roam around helping him to remove some of the smaller Pokémon such as Goldeen, Magikarp, Luvdisc and other water Pokémon who are unable to breathe out of the water. A few moments later he calls you, “Is this your Gyarados?” he asks, gesturing to one of the larger tanks in a far corner of the room. <br />
<br />
Racing over you find that it is indeed your Gyarados but he’s very much unconscious, most likely still stunned from the electric rod the thieves had used to subdue him. Furious at what these people have been doing down here you wonder just how many more Pokémon have been stolen that are lost to their trainers forever, and wonder if there is any way you can find out where they’re being shipped out to. You have little time to ponder on the matter however for at that very moment two of the men you had seen earlier return to the room to find most of the Pokémon gone and you and Mike in plain site. “What do you think you’re doing?!?!” one of them yells before they both reach for Pokéballs, the first trainer releasing a Nidorino, and the second a Weepinbell. <br />
<br />
Your reaction?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: aqua"><b>WolfinOutlawAsi: </b>You urge Fleece on as she regains her feet, glaring at Treecko and crying out with a determined, “Baaaaah!”, sure to let Treecko know she has no intention of losing this battle. Treecko grins broadly, happy to know its new friend is enjoying their game and when Fleece charges forward to Tackle, Treecko lifts its tail to Absorb damage from the attack but with it’s vision still slightly impaired it has misjudged Fleece’s position and Fleece rams right into Treecko’s stomach causing the cheeky gecko to expel a huff of air from its lungs as it lands flat on its back, winded from the attack. This doesn’t put Treecko off however, it seems even more delighted than ever to see its playmate so into the spirit of the game and even though it’s still down, it whips its tail around to whack Fleece right across the face with Pound. Baahing indignantly Fleece releases a bright Flash, this time making sure Treecko gets an eyeful as it hops to its feet. Treecko rubs its eyes frantically, unable to see anything but a dazzling display of dots before its eyes. With her opponent temporarily blinded, it appears Fleece most definitely has the upper hand now. What will you do?</span><br />

Correctly assuming that you will need the aide of your Pokémon, or at least one of them, to get past this door and what you suspect is the first of many obstacles in your path you release Vasuki, Silver and Bast for moral support if nothing else.

<br />
Recovering quickly from the attack, Bulba Tackles Rattata and both Pokémon begin rolling in a tangled heap on the floor. You can’t see much from the camera but a moment later you hear a terrified shriek which sounds rather rattish and you see the camera on Bulba’s head as it falls down through the floor, the opening of the hole/shaft becoming smaller as she freefalls into its depths <i>with</i> Rattata. Mike immediately tightens her safety chord and the camera comes to an abrupt halt. Releasing a long, slow, whistle of pent up breath, you watch as Mike slowly brings her back to the top of the hole and once she is on solid ground again you both look at each other, knowing that Bulba had just unwittingly given new definition to the term KO. <b>Level up for Bulbasaur.</b><br />
<br />
Allowing Bulba a few minutes to rest after the battle, she eventually crosses the ledge again, returning to the far side of the gaping hole in the floor before continuing on through the tunnel. For the next 20 minutes all goes well. There are no signs of trouble and you slowly begin to relax again. “She should be getting close to the blockage now,” Mike says with an air of hope in his voice, and a few moments later that is exactly where Bulbasaur ends up. Staring through the camera you can barely believe your eyes when you see a massive black and white image on the screen. Sitting right up against the blocked wall of rubble is a very large, very heavy, very injured Snorlax who had somehow managed to stay alive, trapped in here for the past 5 years.....<br />
<br />

</blockquote>Geh. &gt;&gt; I've been writing too many updates lately-I almost replied to this like writing an update. &gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Speaking of which...*cough<a href="http://www.upnetwork.net/vb/showpost.php?p=184717&amp;postcount=126" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.upnetwork.net%2Fvb%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D184717%26postcount%3D126&amp;hash=38e702846c392601a768dee3989d3452" rel="nofollow noopener">hinthint</a>cough*<br />
<br />
Anyway...<br />
<br />
<span style="color: lime">Watching the battle unfold, Stephen winces as Bulbasaur takes a hit from Rattata's Tackle, however, it was slightly lessened from the effects of growl. Stephen then gasps in fear as Bulbasaur does the same, and the two Pokemon go tossing around, with both falling into the pit.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: lime">Stephen's heart almost stops, but quickly realizes that Mike is pulling Bulbasaur from the pit. Stephen sighs in relief as Bulbasaur reaches the surface, relatively unharmed.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: lime">It continueing on, Stephen gasps in amazement when he sees what is the blockade. <i>A Snorlax.</i> Stephen wonders exactly how it survived for so long there, but shrugged that thought off quickly. &quot;ok...&quot; Stephen says, &quot;Now what?&quot; A few thoughts begin to form in Stephen's mind. &quot;Well, I could pull Bulbasaur out, give her a potion, and send her back in, but there are so many things that could go wrong...Such as Snorlax going on a rampage and causing the tunnel to fall in.&quot; Stephen sighs. &quot;I could also attempt to capture the Snorlax, but it would be cruel to continue to hurt it when it is already at such a weakened state.&quot;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: lime">Stephen sighs and speaks into the microphone. &quot;Bulbasaur, ask the Snorlax if it would consider coming with us. Tell it we would give it a good home, and all the food it could eat. However, if it refuses, be ready for any of its attacks. If it accepts, I'll have Mike pull you out on the rope, give you a Pokeball, and have you capture the Snorlax.</span> &gt;I hope I can do this...&lt; <span style="color: lime">However, if not, well, we'll have to think of something else.&quot;</span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: limegreen"><b>Archaic: </b>The elderly Pinsir’s eyes fall upon Omekekashi as you speak, a thoughtful expression crossing his face. “This is not possible,” he replies calmly, “However, you have come into our midst in peace and been forthright regarding your intentions for seeking us out. For this your lives will be spared and furthermore you are invited to join us for tonight’s festivities.” Looking down at Omekekashi again, he continues, “I am interested in seeing how your companion performs in our annual tribal rites tonight. Please make yourself at home until the festivities begin and ensure you’re well rested for the celebrations.” Gesturing toward one of the Pinsir who had brought you here, the one who appears to be the leader of the guards, the King Pinsir nods. “Maebureshi will see to your needs during your stay. If there is anything you need to make your stay more comfortable let him know and he will see to it. Farewell until tonight.” King Pinsir then turns and disappears into the forest with the rest of the Pinsir who had brought you here while you are left alone in the clearing with Omekeashi, Treecko and Maebureshi.<br />
<br />
Finally alone, Treecko begins spluttering something incomprehensible, looking paler than normal. “ANNUAL TRIBAL RITES!” he eventually exclaims, nearly passing out with hysteria. He then claps his hands over his mouth, looking fearfully toward Maebureshi as though afraid the Pinsir will rip out his innards. Maebureshi looks calmly down at him and you could swear you see a hint of amusement in his eyes, but at the moment you’re more interested in why Treecko is so afraid of this ritual. “Do you know what that is?!” he whispers between his fingers. “It’s a slaughter! The strongest Pinsir warriors battle to the death until only one is left standing! The champion is then the next in line to the Pinsir throne should the King pass away before the next Tribal Rites Festival. We have to get out of here!” <br />

</blockquote><span style="color: limegreen">Mamoru solemnly bows his head as he listens to the elders words, being careful to not let his initial disappointment show on his face. Not possible? Bugger that for a lark. He would get his way, one way or another...<br />
<br />
Raising his head once again as the elder finishes, he wonders for a moment what these rites may be, before getting the answer forced upon him by the flustered Treecko. Now this is more like it....<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly Treecko&quot;, he replies, purposefully speaking at a normal volume, &quot;you've seen us battle, do you really think that myself or Omekekashi would be afraid of a little death duel? Being invited into such private rites is a rare honour, and I would not insult either the Pinser, or Omekekashi, by attempting to withdraw her from them now.&quot;<br />
<br />
He turns around to face his companion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn't you agree, Omekeka...&quot;<br />
<br />
He pauses, and smirks slightly. No point finishing his sentance if the target isn't even listening. <i>Well, at least we now know of one Pinser who satisfies her requirements in the looks department</i>, he thinks to himself. <i>Maebureshi, 'Harbringer of Death'...an omen of sorts, perhaps? An appropriate name for the mate of the 'Honoured Consort of Death', Omekekashi, to be sure...</i><br />
<br />
Turning back to Treeko, leaving Omekekashi to her silent appraisal of their watcher, he continues.<br />
<br />
&quot;In any case, I fail to see what you're worrying about. It's not like you're planning to enter the rites, are you? No, you'll be staying with me for a while longer I think. Try to enjoy yourself. Doubtless, you'll never see this kind of sight again in your life. Make the most of it. If you're lucky, you might just learn something, watching these brave warriors, and loose that annoying cowardly streak of yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maebureshi, might there be somewhere that we could rest and have some nourishment before the festivities? I'd hate for Omekekashi to be at a disadvantage because she wasn't given the opportunity to properly prepare for what's to come. I have some questions regarding what's to come that I'd like to ask you too, if that would be alright.&quot;</span></div>

ades: Understanding perfectly what Katie is going through, you feel your heart reaching out to the girl but you know there is nothing you can do for her so you instead concentrate upon your next goal. Battling and capturing Pokémon. The Battledome prizes seem worth hanging around for as you listen to John explain how Pokémon are specially bred and raised here in the Beta Settlement for the younger trainers and think this could be a perfect opportunity for you to pick yourself up a new team member - if you can win.<br />
<br />
He leads you to one of the largest buildings in the settlement, a sprawling structure spanning over several acres of land which houses several arenas for various types of battles. Smiling, John bids you farewell. “I need to get back to work now but everything you need to know is posted on the information board over there. The different battle arenas and competitions along with the prizes offered and where you need to go to sign up for the tournament you are entering. I wish you the best of luck,” he says, before heading back out the main door.<br />
<br />
Looking around you realise why you have hardly seen many people about outdoors because it appears most of them are in here. People are wandering around everywhere, some standing around chatting in excited groups, others swapping battle tactics, some sitting or standing alone while nervously awaiting their next battles, but what interests you are what kinds of battles there are available. Walking over to the noticeboard John had pointed out, you skin over the rules before taking a look at the arenas and prizes in the beginners section.<br />

John kept his head down as he followed Katie's father. He winced as the wind kicked up the sand and raked across his bare legs. The place seemed nice at first, but John couldn't imagine living here for long. Too hot and too sandy.<br />
<br />
The father said something about watching his step and John soon regretted not listening. There was an abrupt change from dirt to steps and John tripped and slammed into the ground. John yelped in pain and slowly got up, dusting himself...before he noticed where he was.<br />
<br />
The room was <i>huge</i>. The walls must have stretched on for what seemed like forever because all he could see was a crowd of bustling trainers and Pokemon. And the noise! It was a constant <i>roar</i> of laughter, shouting and chattering. John stood agape.<br />
<br />
The father was explaining how the competition worked and where to go and John thanked him politely, but his attention was definitely wandering. He had never seen anything like this. It must have been a few minutes before John snapped out of his mesmerisation, and the father was long gone by then. He walked over to the noticeboard that the father had shown and examined it closely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok. Ok...the Ice Arena is out. The thin ice would collapse under Water's weight. The Water Arena sounds just as risky. It's going to have to be an arena where Onix holds the advantage. Hm...maybe the Rock Arena? Water would definitely be in his element there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking in a deep breath, John calmed his nervousness and concentrated on the upcoming challenge. It would be his biggest since he started the journey. He couldn't wait.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rock Arena is at Stadium 4. Now where would that be?<br />
<br />
John decided to ask one of the trainers for directions. He picked someone out in the crowd and walked over...<br />

<span style="color: red"><b>Wayne: </b>Excited to not only have a friendly audience to play for, but also one who is enjoying it’s performance, Togepi releases a small squeal of delight and hands you a spare spoon. Pointing at its upturned bowl and box Togepi plays it’s little tune again, <i>Ting... ting... ting... Thwack! Ting... ting... ting... Thwack!</i> then looks at you with a big happy smile and waits for you to follow suit. Smiling, you happily humor the little egg Pokémon, making little tunes with it for the next several minutes while Bulbasaur extends his vines, joining in the music making by tapping his vines against the bowl and box.<br />
<br />
Eventually Togepi stops playing it’s music and opens a little cabinet door next to it, removing a few little seeds and nibbling on them before handing a few to you and to Bulbasaur. Whoever had put Togepi into this capsule had obviously taken great care to ensure it had enough provisions to survive it’s journey, but looking through what is left of it’s food stores you can see that it wouldn’t have lasted much longer had the capsule continued travelling through space. You look at Togepi, wondering what to do while it happily totters about collecting a few odds and ends, toys etc, to show you. You know you can’t leave it here, but if you take it with you, what if whoever had put it in here comes looking for it? On the other hand, what if nobody ever comes looking for it? The pod <i>had</i> crash landed after all, Togepi may never be found since it hadn’t reached whatever destination it was being sent to.<br />

With all of these thoughts drifting through your mind, Togepi hands you yet another object, only this one catches your attention as it is made of a strange lightweight yet durable material you had never seen before. It is cylindrical in shape and appears to have a cap on one end. “Togepi!” the little egg Pokémon exclaims happily, pointing at the end of the cylinder. Examining it closer you find that the cap on one end of the cylinder can be removed and so you warily take it off before upending the cylinder. Out of it falls a rolled up piece of parchment which you open to reveal a strange document of some kind. It contains images, symbols and writings you cannot understand but somehow you know this scroll is a very important key to the Togepi mystery. You wonder if you may be able to find someone who can translate the scroll for you as you look into Togepi’s hopeful little eyes. It is looking at you with such trust that it makes your heart flutter....<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: red">Wayne looked at what little food the cute little spike ball pokemon had left to eat and then frowned and got depressed at the thought of leaving it alone if he were to continue without it. Looking at Bulbasaurs face he knew that his grass pokemon felt the same way. After a few moments of looking at it collect its things he then started to think as the Togepi started to show him its things. <i>&quot;What if the Togepi is actually lost and needs to get somewhere? Well I know one thing for sure, I can't leave a pokemon unprotected. Maybe I could ask it if it has to go somewhere or something....</i> Wayne then felt Togepi give him another item, only this one seemed different from all the other he was given before.<br />
<br />
Looking at the cylinder shaped item that the Togepi had given him, Wayne curiously analyzed the object. Examining it for a few moments Wayne then heard the Togepi and saw it point to the other side of the cylinder. Feeling his curiosity take over his body for a moment he then opened the side of it that could open. Wayne then felt something fall down and then he looked down and then bent down to pick up what had fallen, a parchment piece of paper. Looking at what seemed a completely different language to him Wayne then felt that this was going to be essential if he wanted to know more about the Togepi or what it is doing here. Looking at the normal type pokemon, Wayne felt like the little creature took over his heart as he saw its little eyes. Thinking of what to do first, the hypnotized trainer then took a step forward to ask the Togepi something. <br />
<br />
&quot;Togepi do you want to come with Bulbasaur and I to explore the Comet's Corner and maybe you might find whatever you came for? We are also going to try and find someone that can translate the parchment of paper from the cylinder for us so that we can see what this paper is about because I don't have the slightest clue what it means. If you want to come with us I can carry you if you want.&quot; Wayne then happily extended his arm awaiting for the response from the Togepi.</span></span></div>

<span style="color: aqua"><b>Loki: </b>Making your way into the room after the coast is clear you and Mike split up, looking for a key or something that will open the cages so you can release the Pokémon trapped inside. Some of them watch you suspiciously but due to the fact that you’re hiding from their enemies it soon becomes apparent that you are there to help them and for the first time since being captured, some of them appear hopeful. Mike soon finds a clipboard and calls you over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at this,&quot; he says, gesturing toward what appears to be a Pokémon inventory. Scanning back to the dates listed the week before Mike notices &quot;Feraligatr&quot; and quickly scans the remainder of the list. &quot;It gives their height and weight and says they’ve been shipped out but it doesn’t say where!&quot; he exclaims, exasperated. &quot;How am I supposed to find him if I don’t know where to look?&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking the list off him you scan over the pages yourself and notice this list only seems to contain Pokémon brought in along with their general details such as the date they were captured, their species, approximate age, gender, height, weight and general prognosis of their overall health along with the date they were shipped out. You notice a few Pokémon who appear to have been ill were crossed off the list with a red marker and you find yourself not wanting to know what happened to those ones.<br />
<br />
While you look over the list Mike continues to search for a key, eventually locating one and opening the cages of some of the larger Pokémon. Some make an immediate dash for the water to escape this place before than can be captured again while others roam around helping him to remove some of the smaller Pokémon such as Goldeen, Magikarp, Luvdisc and other water Pokémon who are unable to breathe out of the water. A few moments later he calls you, &quot;Is this your Gyarados?&quot; he asks, gesturing to one of the larger tanks in a far corner of the room. <br />
<br />
Racing over you find that it is indeed your Gyarados but he’s very much unconscious, most likely still stunned from the electric rod the thieves had used to subdue him. Furious at what these people have been doing down here you wonder just how many more Pokémon have been stolen that are lost to their trainers forever, and wonder if there is any way you can find out where they’re being shipped out to. You have little time to ponder on the matter however for at that very moment two of the men you had seen earlier return to the room to find most of the Pokémon gone and you and Mike in plain site. &quot;What do you think you’re doing?!?!&quot; one of them yells before they both reach for Pokéballs, the first trainer releasing a Nidorino, and the second a Weepinbell. <br />
<br />
Your reaction?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: aqua">&quot;Hmph.&quot;<br />
<br />
Loki puts his hands into his pockets and says, &quot;You seem to have some balls for guys who couldn't even knock out a Pokemon without using a taser rod.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;People who steal Pokemon are no match for those who have trained and cared for theirs with blood and sweat. I will teach you this lesson today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Loki pulls out his left hand and puts it in front of himself with a Pokeball held between his index and middle finger. &quot;This one Pokemon will defeat you both in no time at all. And if you've got some dirty trick, my right hand will bring judgement upon the both of you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Loki flicks his wrist and throws the Pokeball, unleashing a flash of light that takes form as his mighty Salamence! Upon it's release, it gives out a tremendous roar that shakes the cave. Then it glares down at it's two foes with an intimidating stare that brings fear and their hearts.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel sorry for your Pokemon, for they are in the path of our rage! Only a miracle will save you from our wrath!&quot;<br />
<br />
As Salamence continues to intimidate her foes, Loki softly says to Mike, &quot;I hope you have some Pokemon, because you should get ready for a fight too. We don't know what tricks they might pull and if I will need your help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Salamence! Break their spirits with a <b>Scary Face</b>! Then incinerate them both with a widespread <b>Dragonbreath</b>! If they try to attack you, <b>Protect</b> yourself!&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Loki has kept his right hand in his pocket holding Dunsparce's Pokeball, ready to be released at any moment should they try anything.</span></div>
