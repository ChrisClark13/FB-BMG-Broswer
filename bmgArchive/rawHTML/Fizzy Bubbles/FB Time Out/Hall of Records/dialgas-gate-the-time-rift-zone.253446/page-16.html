<br />
Buzzer seemed taken aback by the offer. The Electivire wasn't entirely sure on what was going on, and seemed to not really be happy by your offer. She looked at Taitus, and stood firmly by his side. It was obvious enough she had no intentions of accepting your offer. You could tell by her resolve that she was determined to help Taitus in fixing this system. This was her home, her time. She wasn't going to leave that behind. She couldn't. It's a mothers duty to take care of her children, after all. <br />
<br />
The Tyrogue was too weakened at this point to consider your offer. It looked at the Pokeball before passing out. It seemed that the damage it had sustained was a lot worse than initially seemed. Buzzer went to grab her son, and held him within her arms. Getting him properly treated was a more pressing priority right now. <br />
<br />
Taitus at this point was urging you to follow his father, and your little group followed. The tunnel lead directly in front of the Colosseum , and a group of Romman citizens were gathered before the entrance. Remus was standing at the head of the group, commanding their attention. Once he took notice of you and Taitus, he beckoned the both of you over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Romman Citizens, today is a day that I hope will one day be worth experiencing. It is a day where people learn of the tyranny that happens within our beloved walls and homes. Here, two brave warriors risked there lives to expose this tyranny.&quot; He hoisted both your's and Taitus's arms in the air. &quot;Warriors that have exposed the true nature of our beloved Colosseum. This Electivire and her son was abused and broken by the system. You want to know what we did to Pokemon that lost fights? We'd execute them, once the public eye was no longer perceiving them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at this Tyrogue. His bones were broken, his muscles sprained in order to push him past his limits. In order of becoming a gladiator that you, the public, would enjoy watching until his demise. He needs urgent medical attention, but he would've not gotten that in the depths. He would've been left to rot. I ask you, my fellow countrymen, if that is just? We would not do this to our own sons and daughters, but we would do them to our life long friends? Our companions and compatriots in arms? Again, I ask if this is just?&quot; <br />
<br />
At this point the crowd was in a fervor. An outrage. They were not aware of the atrocities that were actually occurring in the Colosseum, only the stories of glory and the matches that were thrilling to watch. A few women ran towards Buzzer and her son, and escorted them away. You could tell by their garbs that they were healers, and they went into a nearby hut. Taitus elected to go with them, wanting to make sure that they were okay. <br />
<br />
&quot;My fellow countrymen, I will promise you that with the power I have I will put a stop the this corruption. I will fight as long as I have to. I know that my son will as well. I ask that all of you do as well. I am just one man, and be it so I can not do this alone. So I ask, that you go to your senators. You go to those who represent you, and fight for this change with me!&quot; <br />
<br />
The crowd was cheering along with Remus as this point. You could tell they were also going to fight along side him, his words rallying their hearts to fighting for justice. One of the healers came out of the hut and approached you. She told you to follow her, saying that Tiatus requested you to do so. <br />
<br />
You comply, and rush over to the hut. There you see the Tyrogue fully awake. It seems to be interested in you. Buzzer gently nudged her son, who nimbly walked over to you. He looked up at you with expecting eyes. You could tell he had accepted your offer, now that he was in the state to do so. <br />
<br />
How do you respond?</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: red">Keith Masters was a Poison-type specialist. This was well-established by this point. But that said, he was by no means above deviating from said type specialty. The Meowth, Heatmor, and Ledian he had with him at this moment really drove that point home well, as did Keith offering this Electric-type and Fighting-type to come along with him.<br />
<br />
Alas, the answers he got weren't exactly what he'd hoped for. Buzzer flat-out declined- she wanted to stay, to do her part to improve matters. Keith smiled and nodded as he put away the Poké Ball. &quot;I had a feeling that'd be your answer,&quot; he admitted. &quot;But I wouldn't have felt right to not at least offer.&quot; He then looked at the Tyrogue, only to immediately realize he'd been vastly underestimating the gravity of said Tyrogue's situation- the Scuffle Pokémon passed out on the spot. &quot;Oh, geez,&quot; Keith murmured.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tyrogue's in worse shape den we figured,&quot; Meowth remarked. &quot;We betta get it help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Definitely,&quot; agreed Keith, pocketing the Ultra Ball. At that moment, he and his Pokémon, along with Taitus, followed Remus. Back into the Colosseum they went, and Remus was commanding the attention of the gathered citizens. He talked to them, exposing the truth about what went on behind the scenes, citing Keith and Taitus as the brave warriors who risked their lives to expose the tyranny. At this, Meowth gave his Trainer a small yet proud grin. Stewie nodded approvingly, and Kyle regarded Keith with a look of great respect. He didn't know the full truth of the situation, but what he was hearing being said about Keith, it felt like the aftermath of Mt. Aduro all over again- reaffirming the Heatmor's belief that going with Keith was the right choice to make.<br />
<br />
Remus continued, indicating Buzzer, revealing that Pokémon that lost were executed. He indicated Tyrogue, pointed out his grievous injuries, his present need ofr urgent medical attention, asked the citizens whether this was just. And the people of Romma, it seemed, did not think this was just. They were in outrage- all they'd known was the thrilling Pokémon fights, the stories of glory. Not the horrors that awaited the defeated, nor the abusive training methods.<br />
<br />
It was at this point some women ran towards Buzzer and Tyrogue- healers, if Keith had to guess by how they were dressed- and escorted them away. Taitus went with them to make sure they were OK. Keith nodded his approval, continuing to listen as Remus vowed to the Romman citizens that he would do everything he could to put an end to the corruption, that he would fight it as long as necessary, and expressed confidence that his son would do likewise. And he asked the people to do so as well- he, after all, was only one man, and could not achieve this alone. And the crowd was cheering for Remus. Kyle and Stewie, too, were cheering by this point, and the smile on Keith's face was positively Gengaresque in size.<br />
<br />
And then, one of the healers from before approached Keith, telling him to follow her- she'd come to fetch him at Taitus's request. Keith nodded, curious as to what this was about, and followed. When he got into the hut, he was met with the sight of the Tyrogue, fully awake and looking better than before. And looking, more to the point, interested in Keith. Buzzer nudged her son gently, reminding Keith about how Kyle's old pack nudged their leader towards him back in Mt. Aduro, and thus he knew what this meant. Indeed, the Tyrogue was looking up at Keith expectantly. Smile back in place, Keith knelt down to address the Scuffle Pokémon. &quot;The offer still stands,&quot; he said, taking the same Ultra Ball back out and offering it to Tyrogue. &quot;I think you'll be very happy with us.&quot;</span><br />

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 12px">Lil’Twick:<br />
<span style="color: plum">The sight of a giant avian dragon coated by a tumultuous storm cloud was certainly a spectacle to behold, but the young trainer from Alola stood before it undaunted. He knew that this beast must be stopped alongside its treacherous master, and the Mega Altaria’s newfound Fairy typing would pose a disastrous matchup for Chryss’ Mega Sableye. Brûlée and Honey were still coming off the heels of their previous double battle, so even with their assistance, taking down the dragon might be tough. Leo called for his trusted Togetic who had been watching from the sidelines to intervene as well in hopes of delivering the finishing blow.<br />
<br />
Chryss’ Sableye was breathing heavily from taking the brunt of many of Altaria’s attacks, and greatly appreciated as its fellow ghost type in Brûlée sprinkled some restorative Pollen Puffs on it. Meanwhile, Honey fired off a barrage of Moonblasts at the Altaria, catching its attention. The dragon screeched angrily and countered with a <b>Moonblast</b> of its own, a much bigger and more powerful one at that right back at the honeybee. The Altaria screeched once again and followed up with a deafening, <i>Pixelated</i> <b>Hyper Voice</b> that sent all three of Leo’s Pokemon as well as the Sableye tumbling backwards.<br />
<br />
Brûlée quickly got back up and darted forward at the dragon, and as he approached it, the Altaria seemed to have slowed down, its movements <b>Quashed</b> by Chryss’ Sableye. The Mimikyu struck it with a nasty Shadow Claw, causing the Altaria to shriek angrily once again. Sensing that it was on the ropes, the bird’s shrieks turned into a chilling, yet melodic death knell, its <b>Perish Song</b> placing an expiration date on the battle.<br />
<br />
There was no choice now but to end this battle as soon as possible. Leo channeled all of his willpower into his Z-Ring, causing it to radiate a pink glow. He then executed the choreography to perfection as he synced up with his partner Togetic. All of the energy generated by Leo’s Z-Ring channeled into Custard’s matching Z-Crystal, and the cherub surged with fairy type energy. Custard soared through the air towards the considerably larger opponent as he prepared to unleash a soul-crushing Twinkle Tackle. Even more energy flowed into the Togetic as he got an extra boost from Chryss’ Sableye, who cheered him on with a <b>Helping Hand</b>. Not to be outdone, the Altaria launched towards the oncoming Togetic with an explosion of energy building up inside of it, bracing itself for a <b>Giga Impact</b> of epic proportions as the normal type energy within it distorted and <i>Pixelated</i>. The atmosphere surrounding the battlefield exploded in lights and colors as the Togetic and Altaria rammed into each other with immense devastation of mystical fairy energy, causing everyone spectating the battle to literally see stars for a few moments.<br />
<br />
As the dust settled, Leo rubbed his eyes to eagerly witness the result of the impact. Brûlée and Honey appeared exhausted, but were conscious as they slowly returned to Leo’s side. Chryss’ Sableye seemed to be doing fine as well, though its crystalline shield had disappeared. Leo then spotted Custard, who wasn’t moving at first, but slowly got back up to his feet and then flapped his tired wings back to his partner’s side. Lastly, the Altaria lay motionless on the ground, reverted to its natural form. The criminal leader was speechless, staring off into the distance with a piercing gaze. Resigned to his loss, he hung his head in defeat and recalled Altaria back to its Pokeball. <b>Brûlée and Honey have each gained 1 level! Custard has gained 4 levels!</b><br />
<br />
However, the leader was not yet ready to be apprehended quietly, and like his grunts he quickly held out a smoke bomb and prepared to throw it. “Not so fast!” Chryss called out, and as the bomb exploded beneath his feet, she launched a shuriken at the man. When the smoke cleared, the man was gone, but an assortment of items from his bag had been spilled onto the ground. Chryss had already returned her Sableye and was ready to run. “Thank you for all your help,” she said, turning to Leo. “Help yourself to his loot. Without your help, we might not have ever been able to track him down. And now, thanks to you stalling him, we’ve got a track on all of his and his organization’s whereabouts. I apologize for being brisk, but I must pursue him. Don’t worry if you aren’t able to catch up; he is nothing more than a cornered rat now. I will alert the scouts and finish him off. Once again, thank you.”<br />
<br />
With that, Chryss quickly disappeared leaving only an afterimage that rapidly faded as well. Leo might have attempted to follow the fading trail as quickly as he could, but it would be hard with his exhausted Pokemon needing a moment to catch their breaths. First things first, he stepped over to the pile of items dropped from the leader’s person and picked them up. There was one Smoke Ball, as well as $500 worth of gold coins, and an assortment of ninja technique training scrolls. Upon a closer look, they seemed to be ancient predecessors to TM Thief, TM Misty Terrain, and TR Hyper Voice. As Leo pocketed the items and turned back to face his Pokemon, he was ready to make a decision about his next action. However, before any of them could move any further, the sky above them began to rumble and crack. A vortex in time opened up as the singularity began to draw to a close, and Leo knew instinctively that if they didn’t pass through it now, they might never be able to return to their own timeline.</span></span><br />
<br />
This concludes your storyline in Dialga’s Gate. I apologize if the ending was a little rushed, but I hope you enjoyed it!</div>

<span style="font-size: 12px">Lil’Twick:<br />
<span style="color: plum">The sight of a giant avian dragon coated by a tumultuous storm cloud was certainly a spectacle to behold, but the young trainer from Alola stood before it undaunted. He knew that this beast must be stopped alongside its treacherous master, and the Mega Altaria’s newfound Fairy typing would pose a disastrous matchup for Chryss’ Mega Sableye. Brûlée and Honey were still coming off the heels of their previous double battle, so even with their assistance, taking down the dragon might be tough. Leo called for his trusted Togetic who had been watching from the sidelines to intervene as well in hopes of delivering the finishing blow.<br />
<br />
Chryss’ Sableye was breathing heavily from taking the brunt of many of Altaria’s attacks, and greatly appreciated as its fellow ghost type in Brûlée sprinkled some restorative Pollen Puffs on it. Meanwhile, Honey fired off a barrage of Moonblasts at the Altaria, catching its attention. The dragon screeched angrily and countered with a <b>Moonblast</b> of its own, a much bigger and more powerful one at that right back at the honeybee. The Altaria screeched once again and followed up with a deafening, <i>Pixelated</i> <b>Hyper Voice</b> that sent all three of Leo’s Pokemon as well as the Sableye tumbling backwards.<br />
<br />
Brûlée quickly got back up and darted forward at the dragon, and as he approached it, the Altaria seemed to have slowed down, its movements <b>Quashed</b> by Chryss’ Sableye. The Mimikyu struck it with a nasty Shadow Claw, causing the Altaria to shriek angrily once again. Sensing that it was on the ropes, the bird’s shrieks turned into a chilling, yet melodic death knell, its <b>Perish Song</b> placing an expiration date on the battle.<br />
<br />
There was no choice now but to end this battle as soon as possible. Leo channeled all of his willpower into his Z-Ring, causing it to radiate a pink glow. He then executed the choreography to perfection as he synced up with his partner Togetic. All of the energy generated by Leo’s Z-Ring channeled into Custard’s matching Z-Crystal, and the cherub surged with fairy type energy. Custard soared through the air towards the considerably larger opponent as he prepared to unleash a soul-crushing Twinkle Tackle. Even more energy flowed into the Togetic as he got an extra boost from Chryss’ Sableye, who cheered him on with a <b>Helping Hand</b>. Not to be outdone, the Altaria launched towards the oncoming Togetic with an explosion of energy building up inside of it, bracing itself for a <b>Giga Impact</b> of epic proportions as the normal type energy within it distorted and <i>Pixelated</i>. The atmosphere surrounding the battlefield exploded in lights and colors as the Togetic and Altaria rammed into each other with immense devastation of mystical fairy energy, causing everyone spectating the battle to literally see stars for a few moments.<br />
<br />
As the dust settled, Leo rubbed his eyes to eagerly witness the result of the impact. Brûlée and Honey appeared exhausted, but were conscious as they slowly returned to Leo’s side. Chryss’ Sableye seemed to be doing fine as well, though its crystalline shield had disappeared. Leo then spotted Custard, who wasn’t moving at first, but slowly got back up to his feet and then flapped his tired wings back to his partner’s side. Lastly, the Altaria lay motionless on the ground, reverted to its natural form. The criminal leader was speechless, staring off into the distance with a piercing gaze. Resigned to his loss, he hung his head in defeat and recalled Altaria back to its Pokeball. <b>Brûlée and Honey have each gained 1 level! Custard has gained 4 levels!</b><br />
<br />
However, the leader was not yet ready to be apprehended quietly, and like his grunts he quickly held out a smoke bomb and prepared to throw it. “Not so fast!” Chryss called out, and as the bomb exploded beneath his feet, she launched a shuriken at the man. When the smoke cleared, the man was gone, but an assortment of items from his bag had been spilled onto the ground. Chryss had already returned her Sableye and was ready to run. “Thank you for all your help,” she said, turning to Leo. “Help yourself to his loot. Without your help, we might not have ever been able to track him down. And now, thanks to you stalling him, we’ve got a track on all of his and his organization’s whereabouts. I apologize for being brisk, but I must pursue him. Don’t worry if you aren’t able to catch up; he is nothing more than a cornered rat now. I will alert the scouts and finish him off. Once again, thank you.”<br />
<br />
With that, Chryss quickly disappeared leaving only an afterimage that rapidly faded as well. Leo might have attempted to follow the fading trail as quickly as he could, but it would be hard with his exhausted Pokemon needing a moment to catch their breaths. First things first, he stepped over to the pile of items dropped from the leader’s person and picked them up. There was one Smoke Ball, as well as $500 worth of gold coins, and an assortment of ninja technique training scrolls. Upon a closer look, they seemed to be ancient predecessors to TM Thief, TM Misty Terrain, and TR Hyper Voice. As Leo pocketed the items and turned back to face his Pokemon, he was ready to make a decision about his next action. However, before any of them could move any further, the sky above them began to rumble and crack. A vortex in time opened up as the singularity began to draw to a close, and Leo knew instinctively that if they didn’t pass through it now, they might never be able to return to their own timeline.</span></span><br />
<br />
This concludes your storyline in Dialga’s Gate. I apologize if the ending was a little rushed, but I hope you enjoyed it!

</blockquote>Claiming all of this, and thank you for finishing my adventure Gary! I had a lot of fun, thank you!<br />
<br />
<span style="color: plum"><br />
Leo watched with cold determination as the events of the battle unfolded before him. The Mega Altaria was a formidable foe, and certainly proved it with the Moonblast twice the size of Honey's. The Ribombee was still recovering from the last fight, and it was showing. Even with the damage given, it didn't look like it'd be enough to finish off the Mega Altaria. <br />
<br />
Brulee was also not doing so hot. The Mimikyu was still sagging, not able to replenish his disguise in time. Though, he was able to help out, healing the Sableye with a Pollen Puff. It was enough, despite the Pixelate Boosted Hyper Voice. The force of the sound waves caused all of the combatants to be knocked back. This was looking to be a dire situation indeed. <br />
<br />
Yet, a ray of hope shined as the Mega Sableye Quashed the Mega Altaria, causing it to be slowed down for the rest of the turn. It was now the perfect target, and it was time for it to see stars. With a Helping Hand boost, Custard unleashed his Twinkle Tackle, covering himself in fairy magic and stars to crash into the Mega Altaria. The fluffy cloud bird at a similar idea, and started barreling towards the Togetic with a Giga Impact. The two collided, and the entire battlefield was illuminated by the energy.<br />
<br />
But, there could be only one. Both were on the ground, but Custard managed to pick himself back up. With head held high, the Togetic turned to Leo and gave a weak smile before rushing back. He always was able to bounce back quickly, despite the amount of strain on his body. Leo gave his partner Pokemon a hug, and seemed to have returned to his usual, cheery self. <br />
<br />
The boss of the thieves looked defeated, returning his Altaria before disappearing in a cloud of smoke. Chryss thanked him, and said she would pursue the mark. She also let him know that he could help himself to the leader's bag. Gingerly making his over, Leo rummaged through the bag. He found a Smoke Ball, effectively $500 in modern currency, and some secret training scrolls. Reading through them, he could gleam that they taught the moves Thief, Misty Terrain, and Hyper Voice. He had a few ideas on who to give what. <br />
<br />
With that out of the way, he figured he should probably head back to the shogun and report what happened. Well, he would've if not for a giant time rift opening above it. It seems Dialga's Gate was starting to become more and more unstable. If he wanted to, he could stay and live in this singularity, but he couldn't. He had his Pokemon he needed to return to. Besides, this wasn't the first adventure going off to a different world, and it probably wouldn't be the last. Nodding towards his team, he returned them to their balls and made the jump. It was time to jump back to the future. He had only hoped that what he did here furthered thing along to what he knew in the present. <br />
<br />
&quot;Farewell,&quot; he stated with a melancholic smile. He ripped one of his old skull bandannas from his bag, and tossed it back into the garden. A mark he was there. One day, he hoped, whoever found it would be someone who'd be just like him.</span></div>

Missingno. Master-<br />
<br />
Tyrogue gladly takes your offer now, and bumps his fist into the Ultra Ball. With a one, a two, and a three the ball beeps. <br />
<br />
<b>Congratulations, you have caught a Lv. 14 Tyrogue with TM Thunder Punch!</b><br />
<br />
Once he was captured, he lets himself out of the ball. It was obvious he was still recovering from his injuries, but it looked like he wanted to give his mother one last goodbye. He gingerly made his way over to Buzzer, and gave her a hug. At this point, you'd notice he actually had a unique birthmark on his back. Two black stripes, similar to Buzzer's. With all of the commotion, it was a bit hard to see. <br />
<br />
At this point, you'd hear the crowd start to phase out. Soon after, you saw Remus enter the building, noticing that your Tyrogue and Buzzer both seemed to be in better shape. He nodded towards the healers in thanks before looking at both you and his son.<br />
<br />
&quot;Taitus, I'm proud of you for what you did today. You risked your life on the line, and I've seen you grow into the fine young man you are now. No longer are you the scared boy who'd hang from my legs,&quot; he said with a hearty laugh. He then made his way towards you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, a gift of appreciation,&quot; he stated, handing you a few items. You see a Romman tablet, which on closer inspection seemed to be reminiscent of TM Stone Edge. There was also some Charcoal, coins totally $500, and three Rare Candies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please use those candies on your Heatmor, he definitely deserves it after that hard fought battle. Son, I think it's time to head out. I know Buzzer needs a few more days, and I'm sure the healers would let you visit her when you can,&quot; the man told his son before exiting out of the building.<br />
<br />
At this point, Taitus looked at you and rummaged through his pockets. It wasn't much, but he produced a small, white scarf. It seemed a little worn, but you could tell this gift was more of a sentimental value than anything else. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please, give this to Tyrogue. It was a gift from my mother, and I feel he should have it now. Thank you Keith, for everything you've done for me for your time here. I don't know where you'll go next, but I hope you know you're always welcome back,&quot; he said with a soft smile before running out of the building.<br />
<br />
It seems your time here was starting to come to the end. A trip of see the Colosseum ended up turning into a whirlwind adventure to expose the corruption hidden beneath the surface. Everyone played their parts well, and it was ultimately your teamwork that brought out this conclusion. It might not happen over night, but you could tell that everything was going to work out in the end. It might even be worth it to find this in a history book once you got back. <br />
<br />
At this point, you felt you could probably visit some place else. That was when the rift opened in front of you. It was flickering, sputtering, and seemed to almost glitch out. Dialga's Gate was closing, and if you didn't want to be left behind in this past singularity, you had to hurry. You could feel a presence... watching you as your surroundings seemed to fade. It was starting to become to dangerous here. But, if anything, your memories will still last. Don't forget, this actually happened. If if your time here was transient, you forged a life long bond. Maybe, one day, in another place, another time. You could meet again. </span><br />
<br />
And that concludes your adventure in Dialga's Gate. You can claim the birthmark and the scarf in the Boutique. I hope you enjoyed your adventure, and I was happy to conclude it!</div>

<span style="color: springgreen"><br />
Raves- After a few minutes of yelling between the three boys, the group comes and grabs you for dinner. The hallways of the temple are made of simple stone, which is in stark contrast to its shining exterior. It was homey and a little quaint, despite its size. Enough that the students here could live there days studying in peace.<br />
<br />
You then arrived in the mess room, and it was just a long, wooden table with smoothed out wood benches. It seems it was already filled with the staff of the temple, with the man you met at the entrance at the head of the table. You take a seat in the middle of the squabbling boys, with Iskander to your left and the boy who was sleeping in the tree to your right. Sophia was directly across from you, and gave you a small smile as everyone prepared to eat their meal. The meal itself was plain, cut up berries, oats, and a slice of bread. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, no meat today?&quot; Iskander cries out before getting punched in the arm by a boy you don't recognize. <br />
<br />
The rest of those gathered at the table pays him no head, and people start eating their food. You get a little lost, as various conversations could be heard from the table. It seems most people were talking about their days, about any knowledge they discovered or other menial things. Nothing that really sounded like it was going to be helpful fighting the Dewpiders that were invading the town down the road. <br />
<br />
Though, what was weird, was that the conversations just kept going and going and going. It felt like you were stuck there, as whenever you even attempted to get up, one of the adults gave you this sort of death glare. After what felt like an eternity, people finally stopped talking and went on their way to their rooms. You were lead to your room by Sophia, a small room with a simple bed, and were told to rest well. Tired out from the meal, you just pass out.<br />
<br />
You awake as you feel someone shove you. As the world starts to register, you see the head priest looking over you. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, its time for your test,&quot; he said as he left the room. <br />
<br />
It wasn't hard to see where he went, as there was a large, internal courtyard in the temple. A small crowd was gathered there as the man waited for you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, here are the rules. It will be a two on two match. First person to knock out their foes' Pokemon wins,&quot; he states as he points hi hand forwards. The Taillow from yesterday and a Noctowl fly down on the skies, ready for battle.<br />
<br />
What do you do? </span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: springgreen">The quick argument between the boys went by without much trouble and as Rory was led through the halls of the temple, he could see they were quite plain, and rather comforting compared to the extravagant exterior, likely designed that way for the students to respect their humble positions. Finding the way to the mess hall as it were, the room was a simple carved table with benches, and as he took his place beside Iskander and the sleepy boy, the hungry teen then found that the meal was as frugal as the internal positions: some sliced berries, oats and a slice of bread. No meat, as the loudmouth beside him drecried before being promptly slugged, but it was simple, and that suited him fine. Often out in the wilderness he'd have this sort of fare, and he knew not to take for granted any major feasts or anything. Enough to fill one's belly, and no more.<br />
<br />
What did somewhat leave him a little confused were the numerous conversations, conversations which kept him rooted. A couple of times he tried to rise from the seat, only for one of the adults to give him a glare, as though asking him politely to remain until the discussion was done. He silently relented, and tried to listen to some of the discussions, though to not much avail, with nothing that could feasibly aid in the troubles with Araqne. After a while though, the talking ceased, and the table was vacated, with Sophia leading him to his room for the stay at the temple, a simple bed, and as soon as she left the room advising him to rest, he promptly nodded off, exhaustion catching up to him. It had been a long day.<br />
<br />
He was woken with a bit of a shove, and came to with the head priest of the temple looming over him, declaring his test was to begin. Giving his head a little shake to waken himself, he tailed the priest to a large courtyard on the interior of the temple, with a crowd before him. The test was simple enough: a double battle, two versus two, with his opponents the Taillow from before and to no surprise, a large imposing Noctowl. Two Normal/Flying types, possibly problematic, but nothing he couldn't handle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, lemme think...Statis and Ocellus, you two are up,&quot; he called as two balls were released, the Elgyem and Masquerain hovering before their opponents. &quot;We've got some work ahead of us. Statis, start with a <b>growl</b> to loosen their resolve, then shoot the Taillow with <b>psybeam</b> and <b>imprison</b> their skills. Ocellus, <b>lunge</b> at the Taillow, then <b>quiver dance</b> to bolster your speed and then hit Noctowl with an <b>air cutter</b>.&quot;</span></div>

The head teacher makes no headway for you, seeing your stratagem and and quickly adapts to the situation. With a quick motion of his wrist, his mask seems to flicker as the two birds quickly looked towards their master.<br />
<br />
&quot;Plato, set up a <b>Light Screen</b> as the Masquerain dances. See its elegant movements students, but do not be deceived by its intimidating wings. Its faux eyes might pierce its prey, by for a scholar we must not waver. Then, Plato my dear friend, I want you to <b>Protect</b> yourself when that Air Cutter is fired,&quot; he states to the Noctowl as he begins his side of the match. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jason, show them the way to victory! I want you to show them the pyre of the sun with a <b>Heat Wave</b>! Then, while Plato is protected, shout out a <b>Boomburst</b>! Cover your ears boys, you don't want to listen to this.&quot; he then orders his Taillow.<br />
<br />
The two birds seem to be in sync, despite the <i>Unnerving</i> nature of Ocellus. The Taillow starts to whip up the heat in the air as Stasis <b>growls</b> at the two birds, trying to lower their spirits. Ocellus starts to dance around, setting up a<b> Quiver Dance</b> that would boost is special abilities as well as its speed. With the special nature of his foes, Plato erects a wall of light that covers both him and Jason. Looks like these birds aren't going to go easy on you. <br />
<br />
Then, the next set of orders are carried out. Jason finishes whipping up heated air and sends out a massive <b>Heat Wave</b>, searing Ocellus for a super effective hit while Stasis takes a good amount of damage. The Elgyem decides to <b>Imprison</b> her foes, preventing them from using any moves that she knows. At this time, Plato sets up a <b>protect</b>ive barrier, waiting to take the brunt of two attacks. And its right on queue too, as the Masquerain sends razor sharp <b>air</b> blades to try and <b>cut</b> the Noctowl. At the same time, the Taillow lets out a powerful screech, the <b>Boomburst</b> ringing through the arena and hitting both Stasis and Ocellus hard. But, this has given Stasis a good amount of time to analyze her foes due to her <i>Analytic</i>al nature, firing a will timed <b>Psybeam</b> that snipes down Jason and sends him towards the ground, despite the Light Screen.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have much potential young one, let's see how you handle this. Plato, give the Masquerain your own <b>Air Slash</b>, then show the Elgyem a <b>Shadow Ball</b>! Jason, I want you to whip up and trap that Masquerain in a <b>Hurricane</b>, before giving that Elgyem a <b>Facade</b>!&quot; The Head Priest orders. At this point, you notice the little talisman on Jason's ankle, the same thing that guided you yesterday, give off a shining light. The Taillow erupts into flame, being burned by the talisman. Though, it looks like it has enough <i>Guts</i> to power through.<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: springgreen">The battle was set, and as his picks readied themselves, the head priest was ready to counter, playing defensively with the Noctowl seemingly named Plato, while the Taillow would go offensive. As the psychic pokemon emitted a growl and Ocellus began to build up speed and special power, the shimmering screen over the birds would ensure some resilience against their assault. The nimble Taillow then blew forth a scorching heat wave over the pair, and as the Masquerain tried to hinder any known moves, the Noctowl nullified her follow up air cutter, to Rory's concern. The sheer force of the followup Boomburst didn't help much, though Statis fortunately had plenty of time to analyse her avian opposition and gave it a solid shot with Psybeam.<br />
<br />
<i>Geez, this is already a tough fight...</i>he thought to himself, and as the priest's next orders came in, he knew he was in a spot of bothe. The birds were ordered to utilise an Air Slash and Hurricane to assault the bug type, then to launch a Shadow Ball and Facade at Statis, and as Rory paused to question the normal type move, the fears were confirmed as the trinket around the ankle of the avian flared up, burning Jason and initiating its Guts ability, which would amplify its physical strength and offset that growl from before. He didn't panic, however, and his brain was working overtime to figure out the best survival strategy here. <i>Ocellus is faster, but needs to get out of the way or she's down. Statis won't like those hits either...unless...</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Ocellus! <b>Quick Attack</b> out of the way and dive down, use your speed to get away from that windstorm. Statis, while they're focused on her, give the Taillow a <b>zen headbutt</b> to get a solid hit in, then try and shift it off course with <b>confusion</b> when it comes at you with Facade, before <b>recover</b>ing any damage you've taken. Ocellus, once you're out of the way, send the Noctowl into a spin with a <b>whirlwind</b> and disorient it enough to throw the Shadow Ball off-course, then <b>air cutter</b> the Taillow while they're focusing on Statis!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was risky, but a quick opponent required a quicker mind.</span></div>

<span style="color: springgreen">The second acts unfolds as Plato's Air Cutter cuts into Ocellus, causing a nasty amount of damage as the super effective hit takes place. But, that was fine, sometimes a little pain was necessary in order to avoid an even larger onslaught. Ocellus does just that, as she gracefully dives out and through the Hurricane with Quick Attack. She was able to avoid the brunt of it, and didn't get confused to boot. While Jason is recovering from the massive windstorm he had whipped up, Stasis goes in for a Zen Headbutt, landing a solid hit on the small bird. <br />
<br />
That doesn't last, as the Taillow immediately dives in towards Stasis, who is in much closer range now due to the Zen Headbutt. She tries to use confusion to get him off course, but the lack of space between them causes it to be for not as the Taillow lands in a devastating hit. At this point, Plato had already fully charged up a Shadow Ball. Ocellus tries to whip up a Whirlwind to counteract and disorient the owl Pokemon, but the slower start to the move allows Plato to fire it off towards Stasis. The winds to shift its course a little bit, causing the attack only graze the Elgyem. With a heavy amount of damage taken, the little alien goes ahead and Recovers her health. While doing so, Ocellus fires off an Air Cutter which hits Jason for a good amount of damage.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see, to have such good reflexes despite your age. Very well, I declare this battle be over!&quot; The Head Priest suddenly declares. &quot;Congratulations. I was looking to test your wisdom and mental alacrity, and you dismantled my trap quicker than anyone else here has. I think you are worthy for seeing the fountain now.&quot; <br />
<br />
With that, he beckons you towards the back towards the temple. This was a little confusing, to say the least, but at least you could tell <b>Ocellus and Stasis have gained 1 level for their efforts.</b> But, at last, you finally are close to what you came here for. The city didn't have much time left after all. And if Araqne took over the city fully... That would be bad. <br />

But, that was fine, sometimes a little pain was necessary in order to avoid an even larger onslaught. Ocellus does just that, as she gracefully dives out and through the Hurricane with Quick Attack. She was able to avoid the brunt of it, and didn't get confused to boot. While Jason is recovering from the massive windstorm he had whipped up, Stasis goes in for a Zen Headbutt, landing a solid hit on the small bird. <br />
<br />
That doesn't last, as the Taillow immediately dives in towards Stasis, who is in much closer range now due to the Zen Headbutt. She tries to use confusion to get him off course, but the lack of space between them causes it to be for not as the Taillow lands in a devastating hit. At this point, Plato had already fully charged up a Shadow Ball. Ocellus tries to whip up a Whirlwind to counteract and disorient the owl Pokemon, but the slower start to the move allows Plato to fire it off towards Stasis. The winds to shift its course a little bit, causing the attack only graze the Elgyem. With a heavy amount of damage taken, the little alien goes ahead and Recovers her health. While doing so, Ocellus fires off an Air Cutter which hits Jason for a good amount of damage.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see, to have such good reflexes despite your age. Very well, I declare this battle be over!&quot; The Head Priest suddenly declares. &quot;Congratulations. I was looking to test your wisdom and mental alacrity, and you dismantled my trap quicker than anyone else here has. I think you are worthy for seeing the fountain now.&quot; <br />
<br />
With that, he beckons you towards the back towards the temple. This was a little confusing, to say the least, but at least you could tell <b>Ocellus and Stasis have gained 1 level for their efforts.</b> But, at last, you finally are close to what you came here for. The city didn't have much time left after all. And if Araqne took over the city fully... That would be bad. <br />
<br />
What do you do?</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: springgreen">Ocellus was indeed swift, but the Noctowl's Air Slash was quicker, and Rory winced as the bug type took a solid strike, yet this was the opening she needed, performing a quick dive down and evading much of the windstorm the gutsy Taillow whipped up, and that moment was what the Elgyem required to land a strong headbutt on the small bird. This however put her squarely in range of the Taillow, who quickly turned on her, and despite her best efforts she was hammered by the amplified Facade, leaving the psychic pokemon winded. Worse still, Plato's Shadow Ball was on course, fully charged and devastation was imminent, and as the bug type whipped up a whirlwind there was some glimmer of hope for Rory as the dark orb was moved off trajectory a little, Statis avoiding most of the attack. Battered but not out, the alien proceeded to recuperate, channeling energy into undoing some of her injuries while her ally buffeted the Taillow with blades of wind.<br />
<br />
At this point though, the head priest called an end to the battle, praising his reflexes despite his age, and the celerity of his dismantling of the priest's trap with his birds. Furthermore, the man deemed him worthy to see the fountain, and with that the teen bashfully scratched at his head. &quot;Th-thanks, sir...&quot; he stammered, before turning his attention to his two combatants, who seemed to have learned from the battle. &quot;Good work girls, both of you return for some rest, you might be needed sooner rather than later,&quot; he finished, recalling the two grateful pokemon.<br />
<br />
Beckoned to the rear of the temple, he trailed after the priest, reminding himself that the fountain of Artema was the objective, and that not only were the fates of the city priestesses at risk, but the city itself could potentially be troubled if Araqne rose to strength. With a nod and eyes with resolve, he readied himself for what would be required of him.</span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: springgreen">Rory's travels through the back of the temple took him to a cave, covered in what seemed like a red-hued form of Luminous Moss, certainly unusual. <i>Wow,</i> he thought to himself, <i>this must be a strain of moss that likely went extinct sometime after the fall of ancient Greca.</i> The priest was silent and serious, and why not? This would be a holy place for him, and as he neared the inner sanctum he could feel himself standing straighter than usual. The sight of the Fount of Artema itself certainly made things much clearer.<br />
<br />
Solid marble, an image of the goddess Herself pouring water from an urn into the pool, a Noctowl on her shoulder, and the avian motif made perfect sense. In contrast to the city statue which demonstrated her mighty side, this one showed the goddess's nurturing side, and he could feel an aura of divinity emanating from the statue. The priest took to a knee and prayed to the statue, and as he spoke, the statue merely stood there, as statues were wont to do. On finishing, though, Rory was awed as the statue began to glow, the Noctowl's eyes turning blue as a pouch of some form floated into his hands. A silver bag, with a blue powder within, he recognised it vaguely as Quick Powder, which was suited to a pokemon like Ditto.<br />
<br />
And as he wondered what use it could have, a voice in his head spoke to him, apparently emanating from the statue, Artema Herself addressing him, and what truly left him stunned was the fact she knew - and confirmed - he had came from another time. Instructed to toss the powder upon Araqne, the blessed powder would banish her and return her to her prison. As she ended the conversation the statue's glow fell silent, and the youth gave a nod as he held the pouch close. The priest then offered a faster way back to the city through one of the Ponyta carts, mentioning Iskander being one of the best.<br />
<br />
&quot;Th-that'll work. I dunno how much time I've got, and I don't think Artema will take kindly if the priestesses are sacrificed,&quot; he said, before giving the priest a bow. &quot;Thank you for the hospitality, I'll repay your charity by stopping Araqne's invasion.&quot;</span></div>

A few minutes after leaving the cave you were on the back of one of the carts. Iskander seemed... off... and didn't really seem to want to interact with you. Despite his hotheadedness he had a soft side. Perhaps he had taken a liking to you, and wished that you would say. Everyone else simple gave their goodbyes and moved on. So why did he feel so different?<br />
<br />
The entire ride towards the city was silent. You see the farms you passed through, and it seemed like business was as usual. It was certainly a beautiful day outside. Birds were chirping, the kids were playing. It would be a shame if the Goddess brought down her wrath here. That people would end up in a lot worse situation than it already was. It was certainly an issue that needed to be fixed fast.<br />
<br />
Luckily, it was only about an hour to get there by cart. Considering divine punishment wasn't raining down yet, it seemed you were able to get there in time. Iskander just looked at you atop the Ponyta, and you saw a flash. A brilliant king guiding his people towards the unknown. TO reach the sea on the fire side of the world. You shake your head, and the redhead just blushes as he looks away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fight well, my friend,&quot; he said solemnly, eyes downcast. He hoisted his reigns and left. <br />
<br />
With that behind you, you enter the city gates. The infestation had gotten worse at this point. Dewpider were everywhere. Rubble lined the streets, it was obvious the city was getting destroyed. Screams of children could be heard as the water spiders invaded homes and caused general mischief. This was her brood, but where was the mother?<br />
<br />
It wasn't hard to find her... There she sat, atop the statue of Artema, shooting webbing at anyone who dared get close. The few senators there had the priestesses lined up in rope. It was obvious the sacrifices was about to happen. You needed to stop this, now. <br />
<br />

<br />
Tyrogue gladly takes your offer now, and bumps his fist into the Ultra Ball. With a one, a two, and a three the ball beeps. <br />
<br />
<b>Congratulations, you have caught a Lv. 14 Tyrogue with TM Thunder Punch!</b><br />
<br />
Once he was captured, he lets himself out of the ball. It was obvious he was still recovering from his injuries, but it looked like he wanted to give his mother one last goodbye. He gingerly made his way over to Buzzer, and gave her a hug. At this point, you'd notice he actually had a unique birthmark on his back. Two black stripes, similar to Buzzer's. With all of the commotion, it was a bit hard to see. <br />
<br />
At this point, you'd hear the crowd start to phase out. Soon after, you saw Remus enter the building, noticing that your Tyrogue and Buzzer both seemed to be in better shape. He nodded towards the healers in thanks before looking at both you and his son.<br />
<br />
&quot;Taitus, I'm proud of you for what you did today. You risked your life on the line, and I've seen you grow into the fine young man you are now. No longer are you the scared boy who'd hang from my legs,&quot; he said with a hearty laugh. He then made his way towards you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, a gift of appreciation,&quot; he stated, handing you a few items. You see a Romman tablet, which on closer inspection seemed to be reminiscent of TM Stone Edge. There was also some Charcoal, coins totally $500, and three Rare Candies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please use those candies on your Heatmor, he definitely deserves it after that hard fought battle. Son, I think it's time to head out. I know Buzzer needs a few more days, and I'm sure the healers would let you visit her when you can,&quot; the man told his son before exiting out of the building.<br />
<br />
At this point, Taitus looked at you and rummaged through his pockets. It wasn't much, but he produced a small, white scarf. It seemed a little worn, but you could tell this gift was more of a sentimental value than anything else. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please, give this to Tyrogue. It was a gift from my mother, and I feel he should have it now. Thank you Keith, for everything you've done for me for your time here. I don't know where you'll go next, but I hope you know you're always welcome back,&quot; he said with a soft smile before running out of the building.<br />
<br />
It seems your time here was starting to come to the end. A trip of see the Colosseum ended up turning into a whirlwind adventure to expose the corruption hidden beneath the surface. Everyone played their parts well, and it was ultimately your teamwork that brought out this conclusion. It might not happen over night, but you could tell that everything was going to work out in the end. It might even be worth it to find this in a history book once you got back. <br />
<br />
At this point, you felt you could probably visit some place else. That was when the rift opened in front of you. It was flickering, sputtering, and seemed to almost glitch out. Dialga's Gate was closing, and if you didn't want to be left behind in this past singularity, you had to hurry. You could feel a presence... watching you as your surroundings seemed to fade. It was starting to become to dangerous here. But, if anything, your memories will still last. Don't forget, this actually happened. If if your time here was transient, you forged a life long bond. Maybe, one day, in another place, another time. You could meet again. </span><br />
<br />
And that concludes your adventure in Dialga's Gate. You can claim the birthmark and the scarf in the Boutique. I hope you enjoyed your adventure, and I was happy to conclude it!

</blockquote><span style="color: Red">If there had been any doubts about Tyrogue's intentions, they were swiftly stamped out by the way the FIghting-type tapped his fist to the Ultra Ball. The sphere scarcely shook before clicking shut. Keith grinned as he stood back up. &quot;All right!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;I just caught... a Tyrogue!&quot; he declared, holding up the Ultra Ball.<br />
<br />
&quot;Meowth, dat's right!&quot; Meowth chimed in.<br />
<br />
At that moment, however, the Ultra Ball burst back open, and Keith's new Tyrogue sent himself back out. And Keith knew why, too. He smiled understandingly as Tyrogue went up to Buzzer for one last farewell- he wouldn't interrupt this for anything.<br />
<br />
Remus then entered the hut, expressing pride in his son. Keith smiled- not only had he helped to expose the heinous corruption what went on behind the scenes, but he also helped to bring a father and son closer together. A day's work well done, in his opinion. And a day's work that did not go unrewarded, either, for Remus handed Keith several items in appreciation- a Romman tablet that seemed as though it would suffice to impart the move Stone Edge, a piece of Charcoal, a nice pile of somewhat valuable-looking coins, and three Rare Candies, which he was asked to feed to his Heatmor specifically. Keith turned to Kyle, who had already been eyeing the Rare Candies hungrily. &quot;Oh, go ahead,&quot; Keith laughed, handing them over. &quot;Remus is right, you've earned them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heat mor!&quot; Kyle replied, nodding his thanks to Remus before consuming the candies.<br />
<br />
While Kyle chowed down, Taitus gave something to Keith as well- a white scarf, somewhat worn. It was more sentimental value than anything, and Taitus requested that Keith give it to Tyrogue. At this, Keith turned to his newest Pokémon, and noticed as he did so that Tyrogue seemed to have an unusual birthmark- a pair of black stripes on his back, not unlike what one might see on an Electivire's back. He'd give it to Tyrogue, sure, but not just yet. He had all the time in the world to do that, but this goodbye could only last so long. He turned back to Taitus as he contiued speaking. Keith smiled in response. &quot;I don't know if the opportunity to return here will ever present itself, but if it does, I would love to come back,&quot; Keith stated. <br />
<br />
Once Taitus had left, however, the very rift that had brought him here opened back up once again. &quot;See, Meowth?&quot; smirked Keith. &quot;Told you we wouldn't be trapped here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, betta save yer braggin' fer afta we get home- dat rift don't look like it's gonna stay open much longa,&quot; Meowth pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, shit, good point,&quot; Keith nodded. &quot;Kyle, Stewie, Tyrogue, come on!&quot; he urged his Pokémon, ushering them all into the portal before diving through it himself, Meowth clinging to him as though for dear life, leaving nothing left but, very likely, an immensely confused Electivire.<br />
<br />
~~~~~<br />
<br />
Keith opened his eyes- they were back at the outskirts of New Fizz City, where they'd first entered the rift to begin with.<br />
<br />
&quot;...are we back yet?&quot; Meowth squeaked, eyes still crammed shut, paws still clinging to Keith's arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we're back, yeah, and what did I say about the claws?&quot; Keith grimaced.<br />
<br />
&quot;...eheheh, sorry,&quot; Meowth said sheepishly, letting go of Keith's arm and landing nimbly on the ground. &quot;Time travel makes me-owth nervous.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith chuckled at this. &quot;Yeah, I can see-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith wheeled around at this, smiling at the sight approaching him. &quot;Willa,&quot; he grinned. &quot;My Arceus, are you a sight for sore eyes. What brings you out here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I was thinking about it, and I decided I'd like to see this alleged rift in time for myself,&quot; stated the Kalosian Ace Trainer. &quot;So where is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya just missed it,&quot; Meowth spoke up. &quot;Seems ta have closed up tight just afta spittin' us back here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Willa raised an eyebrow. &quot;Sounds a bit convenient,&quot; she remarked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Too true, it does, but Meowth ain't lying,&quot; Keith stated. &quot;Not only did we actually go back in time, I even caught a new Pokémon. Tyrogue, come over here,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
The Fighting-type nimbly walked over to his new Trainer, looking up curiously at Willa. &quot;Rrrogue?&quot; he murmured questioningly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, very nice indeed,&quot; Willa murmured, betraying a small smile at the sight of the Tyrogue. &quot;He'll be most welcome at home, I would think. In fact,&quot; she added, producing an Ultra Ball of her own, &quot;I think I'd like to introduce him to a fellow Fighting-type.&quot; With that, she tossed the Ultra Ball. Keith had been expecting Pancham or Hakamo-o, and therefore found himself suitably surprised when a formidable

</div>
appeared before them instead!<br />
<br />
&quot;...Whoa!&quot; Keith exclaimed, producing his Pokédex for the first time that day.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kommo-o, the Scaly Pokémon. A Dragon and Fighting-type, and the evolved form of Hakamo-o,&quot; droned the device. &quot;Kommo-o jingles its tail scales to threaten enemies, causing weak opponents to crack and flee in a panic. Only opponents who stand strong in response to this are worth Kommo-o's time to battle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So Hakamo-o evolved?&quot; Keith murmured wonderingly. &quot;That's so cool, when'd that happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
Willa tllted her head slightly. &quot;...last week,&quot; she said. &quot;When... when we were training, after watching that documentary on ancient Romma. You... don't remember?&quot; she asked, sounding hurt.<br />
<br />
Alarm bells started going off in Keith's head. Dear Arceus, no. Had he really screwed up that badly? Wait- ancient Romma documentary? Keith exchanged looks with Meowth. &quot;Did... did we really change the timeline that much?&quot; Keith murmured.<br />
<br />
Before Meowth could answer, however, Willa's offended accusation had given way to diabolical chuckling. &quot;The look on your face,&quot; she giggled, hurt expression now all smiles. &quot;He evolved on the way here- a Team Turnback grunt thought he could ambush me and catch me off guard. He thought quite wrong.<br />
<br />
The funny thing about the phrase &quot;That's not funny!&quot; is that it tends to lose most of its intended gravitas when choked out between fits of laughter, a fact Keith was demonstrating here and now, so relieved was he that he hadn't actually had such a glaring lapse of memory that he could only laugh at the situation.<br />
<br />
Willa raised an eyebrow, still grinning. &quot;And yet, you laugh,&quot; she said smoothly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh... Whoo... OK, maybe a little funny,&quot; Keith conceded with a chuckle. &quot;Romman documentary, though? I don't think I mentioned anything about-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn't have to,&quot; Willa smirked. &quot;I realized earlier that this time rift had to be the real deal after all- there was such a documentary on a little while ago, and it made mention of a very interesting-sounding man, a foreigner with a powerful Heatmor who helped expose the brutal practices that went on behind the scenes at the Colosseum. Am I gonna have to start calling you Warrior Masters now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith grinned back. &quot;Only if you want to,&quot; he replied. At this, he and Willa shared a quick kiss, before turning to their respective Fighting-types. &quot;Wow,&quot; he remarked. &quot;Look at Tyrogue- he's in awe of Kommo-o.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed,&quot; Willa agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tyrooooogue,&quot; Tyrogue was murmuring wonderingly as Kommo-o demonstrated a Dragon Dance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kommo, Kommo-o!&quot; Kommo-o was saying, gesturing to Willa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tyrogue?!&quot; Tyrogue replied, turning to look at Willa. Then back at Kommo-o. Then back at Willa again. He jumped up and down, and started running all around Willa. &quot;Tyrogue! Tyrogue! Tyrogue!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... Tyrogue?&quot; said Keith.<br />
<br />
&quot;See, Kommo-o's just told Tyrogue dat it's because o' Willa he's gotten so big and strong.&quot; purred Meowth. &quot;And Tyrogue seems ta be a total Kommo-o fanboy at dis point, so he's sayin' he wants Willa to help him get dat big and strong, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; murmured Willa, before looking over to Keith. &quot;I won't take him from you if you don't wish it,&quot; she said plainly. &quot;I would be happy to assist with his training if that would be preferable.&quot;<br />
<br />
But Keith shook his head, smiling. &quot;Tyrogue seems way more eager to go with you than he seemed with me,&quot; he said, offering Willa Tyrogue's Ultra Ball. &quot;I'll be the one to happily assist with his training. Just... give him this, though,&quot; he added, producing the scarf he got from Taitus. &quot;Guy who gave me that requested it go to Tyrogue, I wanna respect that.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;A valid request,&quot; agreed Willa, accepting the scarf. She knelt down, helping Tyrogue put the scarf on, and Tyrogue seemed quite happy to wear it. &quot;There you are, little one,&quot; smiled Willa. &quot;So, you want to go with me, then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tyrogue! Tyrogue!&quot; nodded Tyrogue. He then turned, giving Keith an apologetic look, but Keith smiled understandingly- he wasn't about to stand in the way if this was what Tyrogue desired.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alrighty, den,&quot; Meowth piped up. &quot;I'm fer goin' back home and gettin' sometin' ta eat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Meowth's got the right idea,&quot; Keith nodded, his stomach most helpfully choosing that moment to growl. &quot;I'm so hungry I could eat a Mudsdale.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then by all means, let's get moving,&quot; stated Willa, leading the way, her Kommo-o and Tyrogue following close behind. Keith and Meowth exchanged looks before following as well, along with Kyle and Stewie. It had been a truly remarkable experience that none involved would soon forget. Especially seeing as, as Willa revealed when they returned to the Poisonous Palace, she had recorded the Romman documentary so that Keith could watch it himself.</span><br />

<b>Raves-</b><br />
<br />
A few minutes after leaving the cave you were on the back of one of the carts. Iskander seemed... off... and didn't really seem to want to interact with you. Despite his hotheadedness he had a soft side. Perhaps he had taken a liking to you, and wished that you would say. Everyone else simple gave their goodbyes and moved on. So why did he feel so different?<br />
<br />
The entire ride towards the city was silent. You see the farms you passed through, and it seemed like business was as usual. It was certainly a beautiful day outside. Birds were chirping, the kids were playing. It would be a shame if the Goddess brought down her wrath here. That people would end up in a lot worse situation than it already was. It was certainly an issue that needed to be fixed fast.<br />
<br />
Luckily, it was only about an hour to get there by cart. Considering divine punishment wasn't raining down yet, it seemed you were able to get there in time. Iskander just looked at you atop the Ponyta, and you saw a flash. A brilliant king guiding his people towards the unknown. TO reach the sea on the fire side of the world. You shake your head, and the redhead just blushes as he looks away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fight well, my friend,&quot; he said solemnly, eyes downcast. He hoisted his reigns and left. <br />
<br />
With that behind you, you enter the city gates. The infestation had gotten worse at this point. Dewpider were everywhere. Rubble lined the streets, it was obvious the city was getting destroyed. Screams of children could be heard as the water spiders invaded homes and caused general mischief. This was her brood, but where was the mother?<br />
<br />
It wasn't hard to find her... There she sat, atop the statue of Artema, shooting webbing at anyone who dared get close. The few senators there had the priestesses lined up in rope. It was obvious the sacrifices was about to happen. You needed to stop this, now. <br />
<br />
What do you do?</span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: springgreen">The ride back to the city was...quiet. While he knew that Iskander was rather hotheaded, perhaps it was the seriousness of the situation that managed to keep the boy silent, and unwilling to interact, despite the rest of the temple residents giving him well wishes. The fact he felt different was a little unnerving to Rory, yet the ride through the outskirts was relatively calm. It was a nice day, the farmers were busy farming carefree, the local children at play, and birds singing, tranquility at its purest. A strong sign that he still had time, for surely Artema's wrath would be causing chaos here. The ride eventually ended after an hour or so, and as he climbed off the cart, he wondered just how he was going to quell Araqne. Obviously there was the powder that required tossing onto her, but he had no clue where to begin looking, but a glance back at the youth caused a flash, a premonition perhaps, of a wise ruler and his people, crossing a great sea to lands unknown. He gave his head a shake, he had to focus on the task at hand, as Iskander gave a solemn statement, to fight well before turning and leaving.<br />
<br />
As he entered the gates of the city, Rory could see possibly why Iskander was different. Dewpider were <i>everywhere.</i> The streets were trashed, stalls busted up, and the bugs were clearly out to cause mayhem if the cries of the youth were anything to go by. It tugged at his heart to see pokemon that were normally relatively docile in nature descend into marauders, but knew this was unnatural, they were not themselves with Araqne free to wreak havoc upon Artema, but it wouldn't be very long at alol before the teen found the physical embodiment of the goddess.<br />
<br />
Sitting astride the main statue, a gargantuan Araquanid stood, spraying webbing at anything who came close, while right there, the priestesses in ropes were lined up, and it was clear what the intention of sacrifice was: likely to be fed to the giant bug. He knew he had to act fast, but in a way that would not jeopardize any of the innocents or cause further damage to the city. He reached for his pokeballs, and plucked a trio of them from his belt, releasing the contents. Xigua was out first, the Wimpod pretty much itching to be free once more, and he felt it was time for his starter to strike out. Also on the field was what he hoped would be the major saving grace, Lesath the Drapion. Finally, Ocellus returned to the fray, the Masquerain staring down the giant bug.<br />
<br />
&quot;We gotta stop this madness. Lesath, you focus on getting the big spider's attention. Announce yourself with a <b>roar</b>, and get its attention with a <b>taunt</b> to try and get them to stop spraying that web everywhere, then pepper her with a <b>pin missile</b>. Xig, defend the priestesses with a <b>wide guard</b> and focus on cutting them loose with your <b>metal claw</b>. if anyone tries to stop you, chuck some <b>sand</b> in their direction as a defensive <b>attack</b>. Ocellus, try and calm the swarming bugs down with a <b>sweet scent</b> and push any who come at you back with a <b>gust</b> of wind, then keep us safe with a <b>mist</b> to try and obscure their vision a little!&quot;<br />
<br />
The three pokemon nodded before preparing themselves as Rory made for the senators, yelling. &quot;Stop! I've been called by Artema to stop Araqne's reign of terror, nobody has to die!&quot;</span></div>

The senators look a little confused as they see you arrive in the square, with one of them holding out their hand to quell the executioner, who's knife was already poised to strike down the first maiden. Araqne takes note of you and screeches. It seems that she was able to sense Atrema's power emanating from you, and is already set to attack you. With quick thinking, you release Xigua, Lesath, and once again Ocellus. The trio of bugs heed your command, and begin to execute their orders to quell the giant water spider. <br />
<br />
Lesath reaches her arms back and let's out a might <b>roar</b>, causing Araqne to lose balance and fall off Artema's statue into the plaza below. The Drapion then bellows out <b>taunti</b>ng words at the Araquanid. She does not take kindly to the provocation, and<b> lunge</b>s at Lesath, piercing the Drapion with her long, spindly arms. Lesath retaliates by aiming her arms at Araqne, shooting out a multitude of <b>pin missiles</b> to cause the giant spider to fall back. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Xigua quickly creates a <b>Wide Guard</b> around the priestesses to prevent them from being harmed by Araqne. He then quickly goes and cuts the ropes binding them with <b>Metal Claw</b>. One of the senators tries to interfere, and the Wimpod uses a <b>sand attack</b> to make them back off. It seems at this point the senators are starting to murmur amongst themselves, discussing the words you had previously told them. <br />
<br />
As for Ocellus, she flies up high into the air and starts to twirl around, sending out waves of her<b> sweet scent</b>. The Dewpider in the surrounding area stop what their doing, and seem enthralled by the aroma. Araqne, taking notice her controlled children are no longer behaving, looks up and sees the source in Ocellus. The water spider starts to form a large amount of her water into her mouth, the <i>Water Bubble</i> drastically improving the attack's power. She then fires off a incredibly powerful <b>Hydro Pump</b> at Ocellus, sending the Masquerain far into the city. <br />
<br />
At this point the senator's have finished their discussion, and one of them speaks out to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you say you have the blessing of Artema, use it! Only her power can quell that beast!&quot; He shouts at you as the rest of the senators try to usher the crown out of the square. It looks like the best course of action here is to try and get close and throw the powder at Araqne. <br />

</blockquote><span style="color: springgreen">Rory's arrival to the scene was just in the nick of time as one of the senators held off the headsman, knife raised to slay the first offering, but Araqne was the definitive threat here, giving a furious screech, as if the goddess could sense Artema's blessing around the teen. Very quickly, the Drapion let loose a tremedous bellow, enough to startle the spider to fall off the statue, saving it from potential desecration or further damage and onto the plaza below, before provoking the insect with a taunt. This ended up getting the poison pokemon struck with a forceful Lunge, but the scorpion wasn't to be quelled so easily, firing back with a squall of needles that forced the goddess back. Xigua's own tactics worked well, freeing the priestesses and giving the senators cause to reconsider their plan with a clawful of sand, and Rory was keeping a close eye on the situation.<br />
<br />
Ocellus was successful in keeping the Dewpider distracted, her pheromones leaving the bugs taken and somewhat breaking the hold Araqne had over them. This did not go unnoticed, and with a snarl of sorts the Araquanid launched forth an incredible torrent of water at great velocity at Ocellus, launching the bug type well out of the plaza to Rory's shock. <i>What power!</i><br />
<br />
By this time, the senate had came to a quick conclusion and urged him to use Artema's blessing to quell the furious goddess while they began to evacuate the area. He took out the pouch of powder, and stared at the raging water spider. While he was certain Ocellus would quickly recuperate and return to the field, he knew if that sort of assault landed on him, he'd be finished. He'd have to get the spider subjugated somewhat so he could get a clear shot, and not put himself at unnecessary risk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lesath! Hold up a sec and let Xig give you a hand there! I gotta get a good shot with this, and need you two to get the big girl pinned down as well as you can! Xig, blast her with a <b>mud shot</b> to sully that water bubble and cut her vision down, then keep her distracted with a <b>struggle bug</b>! Lesath, use your own <b>infestation</b> to keep her corraled, then chomp at her with a <b>thunder fang</b> and get a pin on her by trying to shove her over with a <b>rock slide</b>!&quot;<br />
<br />
Commands given, the two arthropods hustled to do their bit while Rory waited for his chance to get closer to Araqne, keeping a tight hold on the pouch Artema entrusted to him and waiting for an opening to throw some of the powder within over the giant spider.</span></div>

With their orders given, Lesath and Xigua start to go all out on Araqne. Wimpod went out and fired off a powerful mud shot from his mouth, teporarily blind the Araquanid and causing her scream. She tried firring out a bubble beam in retaliation, but to no avail as she completely missed her mark.

At this point in time, you hear Ocellus call out, the Masquerain finding her way back to you. She does, however, seem to have a friend with her. One lone Dewpider eagerly waits underneath the Masquerain, seemingly enthralled still by the Sweet Scent. Since it seemed harmless enough, there was no point in really trying to deal with it. <br />
<br />
This is then when your Pokemon go into round two, and being to shut Araqne down. Xigua lets out a cry as tiny, itty bitty bugs start to gather around him. HE sends out the infestation to infest Araqne, the giant water spider now having to deal with both a swarm and paralysis. TO add insult to injury, Lesath digs her claws into the ground and pulls up. This causes a pillar of rocks to slide right into the Araquanid, trapping her underneath the rocks. It was obvious enough at this point that you could safely throw the powder.

</blockquote><span style="color: springgreen">The fight was serious now as the two arthropods stood forth against the enormous insect, and the smaller bug's shot aimed true, and as Araqne screamed in rage, the retaliatory Bubble Beam completely whiffed, to the Wimpod's relief, and this left her wide open to the drapion's assault. Better yet, the Thunder Fang left the goddess with telltale sparks dancing across her form, which should surely hinder her movement, and Rory felt more confident that he could end this reign of terror. At this point a haphazard buzz nearby gave him the confirmation that Ocellus would be fine, despite taking a fearsome strike, and as the Masquerain returned to him, he noticed a single Dewpider beneath her, the bug type surprisingly docile now and not in any way a threat.<br />
<br />
Things just got worse for Araqne though as the two battling pokemon proceeded to further lock her mobility down, with the spider now contending with her own damaging swarm, before the poison type's Rock Slide fell onto her, trapping her underneath rubble. Paralysed, trapped and worn down, Araqne was practically helpless, and at this point despite her rage it was only somewhat fitting that her suffering be put to an end once more. Rory of course knew her plight, and while he did feel somewhat sorry for her, such was the way of ancient Grecan deities and their fickle natures. He still had a very brief pause as he took this cue to approach her, the pouch of dust in hand ready, and was thinking of something to say. Eventually, it came to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the name of Artema, your reign of terror is over! I banish you once more!&quot; he called out with some gusto as the teen opened the pouch and hurled the contents towards the stricken Araquanid, as he continued. &quot;To infest this city with your brood and to control them against their will to destroy is unforgivable, and you will be punished for your treachery!&quot;<br />
<br />
He knew bug pokemon by their nature were skittish and timid, and tended to keep out of harm's way for the most part, and that without Araqne, the rampaging Dewpider would hopefully calm down and flee the city. He just hoped this powder would work and that Artema's power within was enough to banish Araqne.</span></div>

Now was the time. Time to carry out divine punishment. There was no hesitation, nothing to get in the way. It was time to banish Araqne, and send her back to the watery hell she's spent her days. Ever since her curse, she was condemned to become a being vengeful. It was the best thing to do, after all. You didn't know what would happen if you tried to assist the beast, but you didn't really have a choice in this matter, did you? <br />
<br />
Taking the bag of blessed Quick Powder, you tossed the contents inside at the Araquanid. A loud, guttural screech pierced the air, no it pierced the very heavens. Everyone in Greca could hear Araqne's scream. Her plea. But no one would answer it. They couldn't. It would go against the will of the gods to do so. For a second, you could see the Araquanid's face distort back into a human's. A girl with bright blonde hair stared at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please... Save me...&quot; She cried out between bated breaths. Tears welled in her eyes before bursting from her face. She was a mess, and she didn't truly understand what exactly was happening to her. An innocent monster. <br />
<br />
But this image would not last much longer, as the girl started to dissolve into bubbles. The rocks then collapsed, no longer being supported by the body of Araqne. There was another side to this story. Perhaps, if you went to confront the beast first, you'd have been able to save her. But no, her curse will live on forever in infamy. She will be the monster of vanity cursed by the goddess Artema. <br />
<br />
As soon as she faded, the air in the city drastically changed. You heard the sound of a thousand skittering feet, and could see the horde of Dewpider at the corner of your eye. The group was fleeing, probably going back to their homes. They were no longer under Araqne's thrall. There was no need to punish them, they were only mindless puppets in this whole ordeal. <br />
<br />
But, there was one left. The one that followed Ocellus. It seemed to have no clue what was actually happening, but seeing the Masquerain quelled it. It looked at you, and made the connection that Ocellus belonged to you, and made its way up towards you. It started waving its arms around, seeming to want to come along with you. <br />

</blockquote><span style="color: springgreen">He had inwardly wished it wouldn't have to have come to this, but with what immediate threat to the city and innocents, and the internal dread of what would happen if he crossed Artema at the last minute, he lobbed the powder over the Araquanid, and instantly a piercing shriek spiked into the heavens, one that he felt could be heard throughout the region. The spider screamed, its face distorting briefly into its original form, a pretty blonde girl, eyes strewn with tears, ultimately innocent save for her beauty that offended Artema. He remained stoic in the face of her pleas, before watching her begin to melt and evaporate into bubbles, returning to the prison from whence she came, the rocks around her collapsing as her form gave way.<br />
<br />
Could he have saved her and bargained with Artema? Perhaps, but the ire of a goddess was one to fear, and while he wasn't the proudest of what he did, he had acted solely on his willingness to save the priestesses of the temple. He was then greeted to the sound and sight of the atmosphere immediately changing, as countless feet began to skitter and flit around, the Dewpider free of Araqne's command. All returning home, no longer troubling the citizens or city, in their simplest life. All but one, the single arachnid that had followed Ocellus. Lesath and Xigua returned to his side, a little scuffed but otherwise fine in health, and the group looked at the bug, which seemed calm at the sight of the Masquerain. The bubble headed pokemon looked at him, and realised that the hovering pokemon was his, before wiggling its spindly little legs around. He couldn't tell whether it was grateful for breaking the spell over it, or was under an entirely different spell thanks to Ocellus, but he could see in the little creature's eyes that it wanted to join him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feeling better, little one?
