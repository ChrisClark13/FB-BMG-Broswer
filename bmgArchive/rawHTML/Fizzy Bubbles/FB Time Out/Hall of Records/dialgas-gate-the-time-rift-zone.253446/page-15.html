<span style="color: deepskyblue"><b>Enigmatic Professor</b>: The Absol looked directly into your eyes for a moment, the illustrious darkness comforting in a strange, ephemeral way. After this brief pause though, the Disaster Pokemon leaps from the bluff, indicating for you to follow once more. Moving through the snowy woods silently, creeping forwards with a ghostly determination, it strikes you as somewhat odd that this Pokemon would be willing to assault the encampment with you. Still, were it leading you into a trap, it surely would have been sprung by now - it was a far sight less dangerous for the bandits to have some prior warning as opposed to you showing up to attack them at their most vulnerable. <br />
<br />
Finally, you draw closer to the camp, close enough to hear the sounds of the men. They were laughing boisterously, celebrating their sizeable haul. More importantly, you catch a piece of dialogue from the largest of the man, who stood just next to a fearsome looking Sceptile. <br />
<br />
&quot;Still unsure how we managed to pull of kidnapping the Jarl's weedling grandson. 't'll no doubt fetch a handsome ransom.&quot;<br />
<br />
The convenient morsel of information resolved the uncertainty you felt from the Jarl. While Scandia warriors prided battlefield acumen above all else in their ruling member, having lost flesh and blood to common bandits would inevitably be a political disaster for the current Jarl. Having an outsider handle the business without much fuss was a shrewd move. <br />
<br />
However, to that end you had to succeed in defeating these bandits. Luckily for you, you were downwind from the camp, and Absol seemed awfully focused on the boy in the cage, leaving you to deal with the Sceptile.</span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: deepskyblue"><br />
<br />
.After hearing the snippet of information that the Jarls Grandson was the one in the cage quelled Drakes's thoughts about the mission. The Jarl might be many things but family matters weren't something he could step into and change without changing or possibly altering the future. Time was starting to be a hated thing for Drake along with things messing with Space considering his past. <br />
<br />
Drake shook his head and then started to hatch a plan for taking the Jarl's grandson back. He noticed that the Absol seemed focused on this kid, and Drake couldn't be sure if this was a tame or wild Absol because both have been noted to follow and partner up with those that are a pivotal point in some upcoming disaster. Well at least back in his homeworld this held true, but here could be different. <br />
His enemy to take on was seemingly just the big man and what he assumed was his sceptile. If he were to pitch just Wolfe into this match he would probably be able to make this a clean sweep and takedown before everyone could scatter and escape. True it was that his main objective or focus was to bring this kid back safe and sound but he also wanted to make sure these bandits were captured and brought in. He had Wolfe mentally relay the message to Lelo and Fenrir that they were to assist the Absol with freeing the child, but once the child was out of the cage they were to Aid him and Wolfe in taking down the rest of the bandits.<br />
<br />
This was probably Drake's best chance to strike, so with that he had Wolfe and his partners charge forward, Wolfe <i>Howling</i> to distract the bandit's attention away from the cage and on himself and his trainer<br />

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: red"><b>Missingno. Master</b>: Buzzer seems unsure at first, but the Electivire had learned to put her trust in Keith despite the short time she had known him. Gritting her teeth, braced for the worst but throwing caution to the wind, the Electivire lunges as a seething flame licks up the length of her forearm. As the attack strikes hard against Kyle, the fire is consumed instantly, with only a few embers flickering peacefully to the grass below. Remus watches unperturbed, a steeliness to his gaze. Aquila shares the nonchalance of his trainer, hunkering down and grunting as the muscles beneath his metallic armour bulge rhythmically, the Curse bolstering the already dangerous behemoth. While the danger this posed was clear, you had prepared for this eventuality. Kyle grins as he bellows a small ember, the size belying the potent heat radiating outwards. As it bursts over Aquila's carapace, a nasty crimson marking singes to the chest of the Aggron. <br />
<br />
Roaring in disdain, Aquila hammers a foot into the ground, once again tearing forth large clumps of debris. A waved arm later and this is compacted into jagged daggers, each one aimed perilously at Kyle. Fortunately, the sluggishness with which Aquila moves leaves Kyle an opportunity, and the Hearmor seizes it. Moving rapidly, Kyle manages to create a number of afterimages, improving his evasion drastically with his Double Team. This plan works comfortably, the pelted Stone Edge crashing through a duplicate and pelting the earth, deep gouges resulting from the impact. Determined to add insult to injury, Kyle rounds on Aquila. Tongue lashing, the Heatmor unleashes a raging conflagration upon his foe, the Flamethrower burning white hot courtesy of Kyle's Flash Fire boost. The stream crashes into Aquila, the Aggron shrinking under the pressure of the attack. <br />
<br />
However, it would take much more than that to fell such a beast. Luckily, for now, the momentum lay with you.[/red]<br />
<br />
===<br />
<br />
<span style="color: plum"><b>meetan</b>: As you might have expected, your words are little consolation to Buzzwole. The burly Bug type hammers the ground with his fists, each impact leaving a small crater. After a few moments of this, he gradually calms down somewhat, but the atmosphere is still one of intense gloominess. Even the merry Junpei wears a stark frown on his face, his shoulders deflated and hunched. However, Kaito seems ... thoughtful. Brow knitted, the young man stands with his arms crossed, his expression comical were it not for the seriousness of the situation. Finally, his eyes widen, the exaggerated shift in his body language nothing short of a caricatured light bulb moment. <br />
<br />
&quot;So I can't be entirely sure - I am far from an expert - but the guy mentioned coordinates, right? You can't just guess those, there has to be some sort of method or calculation. I know for sure it takes a skilled man to create a map, for example.&quot;<br />
<br />
You stare at the painter, barely managing to stop yourself from wondering aloud where he was going with this. Kaito pick up on this, holding a hand up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bear with me. So they need to generate coordinates somehow, and they've been using these ... machine things, right? So isn't it possible that they have something here to transmit those coordinates back to where- whenever they came from?&quot; <br />
<br />
The change in Buzzwole is immediate. Rushing forwards, the titan claps a hand to the back of Kaito, exaggeratedly pointing to him in an over the top showering of praise. Despite this potential revelation, there was an obvious problem - where would this assumed machine be? <br />
<br />
That was when it caught your eye. A small strip of black fabric lay near the holes created by Buzzwole. It was too modern to originate from time period - it had to belong to the businessman.</span><br />
<br />
===<br />
<br />
<span style="color: deepskyblue"><b>Enigmatic Professor</b>: With your plan relayed, your group steps from your cover. Wolfe took immediate charge, the Arcanine inhaling sharply to issue a rousing Howl. The two underlings immediately scatter, one tripping in the snow and landing flat on his face in the process. However, he quickly scrambles to his feet, rushing after his partner beyond the treeline. Given their disposition, it's unlikely that they would become much of a problem later on - men like them needed a rallying point, and that current leader was quick to leap into action. His eyes scanning your group, the man grins as he points towards Absol. <br />
<br />
&quot;That's our most pressing concern, Leif, Leaf Blade the Absol.&quot;<br />
<br />
A menacing smirk on his face, the Sceptile charges towards Absol, the Dark- type halting for a moment. Wolfe shifts instantly, moving with a speed belying his sizeable frame. Grimacing, Sceptile rakes a glowing leaves along the left flank of Wolfe - and while the Arcanine growls discontent, it is clear the blow did little to shake him. Meanwhile, Absol's horn glows with an intense white loght. Howling, he unleashes a raging, blustering wind, manipulating the turbulence proficiently. Hardened blades of air slice against the bars of the cage, deep gouges weakening the integrity. Seeing their opportunity, Lelo and Fenrir rush forwards, each impacting the bars harshly. They rattle from their holdings, and Absol rushes to stand in the gap created, hunkering his body and nodding to you. The boy would be protected - your attention could be focused entirely on the battle at hand. Fortunate, as the remaining bandit was eager to command the momentum.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leif, hit that Arcanine with a Dual Chop, then create some distance by sweeping them away with a Rock Slide!&quot;</span></span></div>

<span style="color: red"><b>Mana Opal</b>: Honedge seems distracted by your grandstanding at first, but then a new expression worked it's way back across it's singular eye. Fury. Blind, uncontrollable rage. You had dared to imply that this battle was nothing more than a simple dance, and while obviously something of a misunderstanding, the nonchalance and surety with which you spoke struck all the wrong chords. Cassandra, wise to your ploy, simply chuckled to herself, gingerly stretching out a faint tendril of energy. This gradually snakes it way towards Honedge, gently wrapping around the blade of the Ghost type without ever piquing it's interest. Her trap prepared, Cassandra sits back casually, inviting Honedge to do it's worst. <br />
<br />
And it obliges. <br />
<br />
The pommel of the sword glistens with a hardy silver coating, Honedge taking a moment to adjust it's trajectory before hurtling towards Cassandra. Her defences intentionally laid low, the Sandygast grimaces as the Iron Head finds purchase, knocking the last dregs of her resistance from her - but as it does, the tendril wreathing Honedge explodes violently. Sundered by the abrupt retaliation, Honedge falls to the ground in defeat, and here you take your opportunity. Hurling the Heal Ball, you watch with baited breath as the orb splits along it's seam, engulfing the defeated in a vibrant crimson light. One, twice, three times the ball shakes, before finally going silent with a dull click. <br />
<br />
<b>Congratulations! You have caught a Level 20 Honedge which knows the move Iron Head and Flash Cannon!</b><br />
<br />
With the spectacle having come to a close, the surrounding guards break out into applause. Clearly you had impressed them, and within a few moments one strides forwards. This one wore somewhat more impressive armour, likely ceremonial. Either way, it singled him out as more important than his peers, possibly the commander of the troops stationed at the village. With a grin on his face, he addresses you, his voice as every bit rugged as his looks. <br />
<br />
&quot;That was a well fought battle. Not one that relied on brute strength alone, but tactical might. Where do you hail from, traveller?&quot;</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0)">Truth be told, there was a lot less intensity with this capture than any other one Amicae had performed until now. The Heal Ball's shaking seemed to be more ceremonial than anything else considering how weak the honedge had been rendered, so there was no point in trying to predict an escape with it. But that didn't mean the moment felt terrible, however. Her foe was put in that state because she had complete control of the match, and while a huge part of that was because of the enchanted blade's apparently Hasty Nature, it wouldn't have been possible if she had been a less experienced Trainer. It was hard not to feel proud of her progress when comparing this moment to when she had captured Cassandra.<br />
<br />
And for as weak as the ball's shaking was, the 'Click!' was as powerful a sound as ever. <br />
<br />
Of course, Ami wasn't the only one who played a major role in this successful mission. &quot;Thanks for helping out,&quot; she whispered as she returned the sandygast to the safety of her Nest Ball. One of the guards approached her as she retrieved and stowed away the Ghost-carrying miniaturized spheres, bearing both praises and the inevitable question. The traveler decided to focus on the former. &quot;I certainly could have brute forced my way to victory, but I don't think your architects would be very happy with me if I had. This place is already in a bad enough state from the incident the things currently are. Speaking of which...&quot; With a flash, a swoobat materialized on her arm. &quot;Nadie, can you please go around and gather up the swords lying on the ground? It wouldn't be very pleasant if someone hurt themselves on one of them.&quot; The Courting Pokemon nodded and immediately took off to carry out the task. &quot;That should help dealing with the aftermath of this incident a little easier, I think.&quot;<br />
<br />

*Gotcha! Honedge was caught!*<br />
<br />
*Oh, dear. Cassandra's Clarity dropped from 30 to 25...*)</span></div>

<span style="color: red"><b>Missingno. Master</b>: Buzzer seems unsure at first, but the Electivire had learned to put her trust in Keith despite the short time she had known him. Gritting her teeth, braced for the worst but throwing caution to the wind, the Electivire lunges as a seething flame licks up the length of her forearm. As the attack strikes hard against Kyle, the fire is consumed instantly, with only a few embers flickering peacefully to the grass below. Remus watches unperturbed, a steeliness to his gaze. Aquila shares the nonchalance of his trainer, hunkering down and grunting as the muscles beneath his metallic armour bulge rhythmically, the Curse bolstering the already dangerous behemoth. While the danger this posed was clear, you had prepared for this eventuality. Kyle grins as he bellows a small ember, the size belying the potent heat radiating outwards. As it bursts over Aquila's carapace, a nasty crimson marking singes to the chest of the Aggron. <br />
<br />
Roaring in disdain, Aquila hammers a foot into the ground, once again tearing forth large clumps of debris. A waved arm later and this is compacted into jagged daggers, each one aimed perilously at Kyle. Fortunately, the sluggishness with which Aquila moves leaves Kyle an opportunity, and the Hearmor seizes it. Moving rapidly, Kyle manages to create a number of afterimages, improving his evasion drastically with his Double Team. This plan works comfortably, the pelted Stone Edge crashing through a duplicate and pelting the earth, deep gouges resulting from the impact. Determined to add insult to injury, Kyle rounds on Aquila. Tongue lashing, the Heatmor unleashes a raging conflagration upon his foe, the Flamethrower burning white hot courtesy of Kyle's Flash Fire boost. The stream crashes into Aquila, the Aggron shrinking under the pressure of the attack. <br />
<br />
However, it would take much more than that to fell such a beast. Luckily, for now, the momentum lay with you.</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: red">Keith's momentary confusion at Stewie suddenly calling out to Buzzer was quelled as soon as he realized what his Ledian had thought of- having Buzzer activate Kyle's Flash Fire! &quot;Nice idea, Stewie,&quot; Keith grinned, sharing a fistbump with the Ledian.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heatmor,&quot; Kyle said gratefully to Buzzer before getting the fight underway. The Will-O-Wisp landed- while Aquila had beefed himself up with Curse, his physical Attack power was now quite noticeably compromised. And even so, with how sluggishly he let loose the Stone Edge, Kyle had ample time to set up the Double Team that ultimately spared him from what would have ben a super effective blow. And then came the Flamethrower- pure damage, super effective, further fueled by Flash Fire, as well as coming from a Fire-type. Naturally, the Mega Aggron didn't fall to this alone, nor did Keith expect it to be that easy. No, the battle was just beginning, and Keith, as he so often did, was thinking, and thinking fast. The advantage was theirs for the moment, so naturally, it only made sense that they capitalize on it.<br />
<br />
And Keith knew just what to do in order to achieve this. &quot;Kyle! <b>Fire Spin</b>!&quot; he commanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heeeeaat mooooor!&quot; Kyle exclaimed in response, preparing to trap Aquila in a swirling vortex of flame. But Keith wasn't done there- following this, he would command Kyle to set up <b>Sunny Day</b>, and then to follow it up with another <b>Flamethrower</b>. With everything the last one had going for it plus the further benefit of strong sunlight, Aquila was not gonna like this one!</span></div>

<b>Lit</b>:The Shogun accedes to your demands, waving to a pair of younger attendants who were stood at the far end of the audience chamber. They walked over, bowing low before turning towards you and indicating for you to follow. You move into another room adjacent to the one you were just in, but before anything can be said the merchant girl sighs loudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man you do not do things by halves do you? I guess this is going to be useful for me too, but still dude.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her attitude having changed somewhat, she explains her name was Chrys, and that she came to this time period in order to try find Mega Stones that still possessed the power of the ancients that had been forgotten to the annals of time. She had been trying slowly but surely to win the graces of the Shogunate - a trader needed connections above all, after all - which helped to explain a lot of her deference. With that thorny matter explained if not resolved, you listen closely to the briefing given by the attendants. While nervously inexperienced, they are able communicators and clearly illustrate to you not only the strength in numbers of the thieves, but the location of their current hideout. If nothing else, the Shogun did not lack for an intelligence agency. Crucially, you are informed that they follow orders from one man in particular, and that taking him out would spell doom for their organisation as a whole.<br />
<br />
<br />
With your goal focused in your mind, you head towards the Cherry-Blossom Garden as indicated. Guided by the merchant girl, it doesn't take long before you hear the bawdy rumblings of the bandits den, and from an outcropping vantage, you are gifted a clear view of the task at hand. Along with the leader, there were two other men, neither of whom looked particularly toughened by their hardships. A grin on her face, the merchant girl releases her Sableye.<br />
<br />
&quot;I reckon I can handle the big guy while you dispatch the pair of goons. Feel up to it?&quot;
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote>&quot;Teamwork makes the dream work,&quot; Leo responded to the girl with a slight chuckle as she made a snide remark towards him. <br />
<br />
With that aside, he took the information from the shogun and headed out towards the Cherry-Blossom garden. The place was beautiful, to say the least. Even at night, he could see the pale pink petals floating in the wind. It seemed weird that anyone would use this place as their base, but that didn't bother him in the slightest. This was more than just petty thievery, people's lives were at stake here! <br />
<br />
His little group were easily able to track down the bandits, and from a vantage point watched as a group of three men discussed their dealings. Chrys stated that she'd handle the big one and grinned as she released her Sableye, then asked if he could handle the other two. <br />
<br />
Recalling the info that they had received earlier, he knew that this wasn't exactly going to be a cake walk, but that didn't seem to bother him. After all, he's probably handled worse. By worse that meant one of Guzma's pride induced temper tantrums, but nothing could really beat that. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you can count on me,&quot; he responded with a smile before thinking about his battle strategy. He could go ahead and nuke them with Custard, but he also had a habit of playing with his food when he wasn't forced to be completely serious. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, let's go. Brûlée, Honey, it's showtime!&quot; he stated as he sent out his Mimikyu and Cutiefly from their respective Poke Balls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brûlée, start off with a Wood Hammer, then Honey fire off your Moonblast! I'll trust you giving that a Copycat Brûlée, then I want you to finish off with a Bug Buzz Honey,&quot; he ordered. He looked at Custard with a small smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay back buddy, I'll tag you in when it's time.&quot;</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: red"><b>Mana Opal</b>: As Nadie flutters from your arm, using her telekinetic powers to gingerly gather the scattered swords to place them back in their cart, the guard frowns. For a moment, it seems like he is going to further press the issue of your origins, but soon his steel vanishes, replaced once more with the former warmth. Offering you a hand to shake, he introduces himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Legate Tiberius. I say Legate ... but the title only comes from my being the highest ranking officer currently stationed here.&quot;<br />
<br />
It is clear that this slight on his rank wounds him - whether this was irritation or insecurity was not as obvious. All the same, his cheery disposition is resurgent. For a military man, his easygoing charm was surprisingly disarming. <br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, your assistance is greatly appreciated. You may be mysterious, but you're clearly not a threat. Please feel welcome to enjoy the festival. Given that public show, chances are you'll be treated as something of a guest of honour.&quot;<br />
<br />
A knowing smile crosses his face as he nods towards a nearby group of villagers, each of them sharing hushed words with one another - but their body language was that of admiration and intrigue, rather than pointed suspicion. Sticking around for a while might be enjoyable, all things considered. <br />
<br />
As you go about watching the festivities, you find yourself dragged along by excited youngsters, Hours seem to pass as you lose yourself in the frivolity, night slowly but surely setting in. A huge bonfire it lit in the centre of the village, food and drink enjoyed by all. Eventually, celebrations begin to die down - and then without warning, a loud crack rings through your head. A rift opens before you, dragging you in before you can react, and everything goes black. <br />
<br />
You are shortly deposited at the entrance to the Gate. Hurriedly checking your belongings, you find the ball containing Honedge. It hadn't been a dream. Then a voice can be heard. The sound is otherworldly, approximating human speech close enough for you to understand, but alien enough that it sends shivers down your spine. <br />
<br />
&quot;The Gate is collapsing and time is correcting itself.&quot;<br />
<br />
===<br />
<br />
<b>Missingno. Master</b>: On hearing your orders, Remus wears a confident grin. Something must be amiss - you were sure that you had him backed into a corner. Surely you hadn't miscalculated?<br />
<br />
Then he speaks. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aqua Tail to dispel that Double Team... then Metal Burst after the Flamethrower.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aquila roared with delight, knowing that his pain would soon be dealt back twofold. Roaring into action, the Aggron lurches forwards, tail awash with a bubbling watery cloak. Crouching low, the behemoth brings the appendage sailing in an arc, smashing through the afterimages fashioned by Kyle. Within moments they are all gone, the torrential force sending Kyle skittering to the side. Catching himself, the Heatmor hisses his disdain, promising recompense. His claws ignite with a dark crimson glow, and with a wave of his arm Kyle summons a raging inferno, the bellowing twister engulfing Aquila - and, for a brief second, causing the beast to show concern. <br />
<br />
Seeking to reinforce this change in fortune, Kyle creates a small flickering sphere of energy, thrusting the construct towards the sky to unleash a razor thin beam. Initially, it seems this has achieved nothing - but then the temperature rises. Slowly, the sun gradually intensifies, and Aquila looks more worried now than ever before. Unfortunately, a few calm words from Remus seem to still the concerns of the beast. Kyle is not impressed with this. Tail thrashing, the Heatmor spews forth yet another white hot Flamethrower. Aquila buckles, for a moment seeming like he had been felled. <br />
<br />
Then his carapace begins to tremble. The dull noise is barely audible at first, but then it ratchets up to a deafening crescendo, egged on by the guttural laughter of Aquila. Finally Kyle is struck, the Heatmor sent hurtling backwards from the sudden impact to crash into the cave wall behind you. You immediately turn, dreading the worst - but Kyle shakily staggers back to his feet, beaten but not quite out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Head Smash. If they insist on continuing, rattle them with an Earthquake.&quot;</span></div>

<span style="color: red"><b>Missingno. Master</b>: On hearing your orders, Remus wears a confident grin. Something must be amiss - you were sure that you had him backed into a corner. Surely you hadn't miscalculated?<br />
<br />
Then he speaks. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aqua Tail to dispel that Double Team... then Metal Burst after the Flamethrower.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aquila roared with delight, knowing that his pain would soon be dealt back twofold. Roaring into action, the Aggron lurches forwards, tail awash with a bubbling watery cloak. Crouching low, the behemoth brings the appendage sailing in an arc, smashing through the afterimages fashioned by Kyle. Within moments they are all gone, the torrential force sending Kyle skittering to the side. Catching himself, the Heatmor hisses his disdain, promising recompense. His claws ignite with a dark crimson glow, and with a wave of his arm Kyle summons a raging inferno, the bellowing twister engulfing Aquila - and, for a brief second, causing the beast to show concern. <br />
<br />
Seeking to reinforce this change in fortune, Kyle creates a small flickering sphere of energy, thrusting the construct towards the sky to unleash a razor thin beam. Initially, it seems this has achieved nothing - but then the temperature rises. Slowly, the sun gradually intensifies, and Aquila looks more worried now than ever before. Unfortunately, a few calm words from Remus seem to still the concerns of the beast. Kyle is not impressed with this. Tail thrashing, the Heatmor spews forth yet another white hot Flamethrower. Aquila buckles, for a moment seeming like he had been felled. <br />
<br />
Then his carapace begins to tremble. The dull noise is barely audible at first, but then it ratchets up to a deafening crescendo, egged on by the guttural laughter of Aquila. Finally Kyle is struck, the Heatmor sent hurtling backwards from the sudden impact to crash into the cave wall behind you. You immediately turn, dreading the worst - but Kyle shakily staggers back to his feet, beaten but not quite out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Head Smash. If they insist on continuing, rattle them with an Earthquake.&quot;</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: red">Remus wore a confident grin as Keith gave his orders. Keith wasn't sure what to make of this- surely they had him backed into a corner by now, how was Aquila gonna come back from this? Alas, Keith very quickly learned <i>exactly</i> how; Metal Burst. Oh, good lord, Keith knew of that move. Counter and Mirror Coat all rolled up into one convenient package. Of course, convenience was in the eye of the beholder- certainly, for Remus, this was very convenient, whereas for Keith, not so much.<br />
<br />
Aquila had lashed out with Aqua Tail by now, dispelling the Double Team copies while landing a super effective hit on Kyle. And then, all Keith could do was watch Kyle launch Flamethrower and pray to Arceus for a critical hit... and alas, no such luck. For a moment, it looked as though the Mega Aggron had been felled, but Aquila had been able to hang in there, and now came the brutal retaliation of Metal Burst. The Heatmor was sent flying, slamming into the cave wall behind them. Keith wheeled around at this- part of him was genuinely concerned that Kyle was knocked out, but the rest of him had more faith than that. This was, after all, the same Heatmor who had held his own against the gigantic tyrannical Heatran of Mt. Aduro, and that was before all the training he'd done with Keith. And now? Now Kyle was easily one of Keith's strongest Pokémon, and Keith knew it good and well. He grinned confidently as Kyle got back on his feet. Hit hard, but not out of this by any stretch of the imagination.<br />
<br />
No, Kyle had no intention of going down so easily. He'd heard enough of what Keith said through the Level Ball to piece together the general gist of why they were fighting here.. For one moment, Remus and his Aggron looked no different from that damned Heatran; Buzzer and her son, no different from his old pack, from that ragtag pack of Heatmor united together by being the last of their kind on all of Aduro Island, united together in the hopes of survival. It was then that Kyle was reminded of those he couldn't save, those that even Keith couldn't save... it had been years ago, but the tragic losses still haunted the deepest reaches of his mind, still surfacing every so often... he had to keep fighting. He could not lose. Buzzer and Tyrogue were counting on him just as his old pack had done, and he could not, and would not, let them down.<br />
<br />
Remus gave Aquila more orders- Head Smash, followed by Earthquake. Keith's mind raced at Ninjask speeds- Aquila would have to charge in to land that Head Smash, but surely the Curse would slow down the delivery of said attack. They had time to strike first, surely, but they still had to be quick about it, and they had to be smart about it. If they could get around these attacks, find an opening, surely it would only take one good hit to fell the Mega Aggron once and for all, considering all the damage it had taken by now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle! <b>Earth Power</b>!&quot; Keith commanded. The Heatmor knew immediately what Keith was getting at with this- trying to meet that Head Smash head-on was basically suicide, but a super effective eruption of power from underneath- that would surely throw the Steel-type off-course. Even if it wouldn't knock it out, it would certainly interfere with the attack's intended path, or at least give the Heatmor a bigger window of opportunity with which to dodge it. &quot;Then use <b>Protect</b> to block Earthquake, and finish it with <b>Fire Blast</b>!&quot; Keith continued.</span></div>

Armed with information from the shogun and accompanied by Chrys as his guide, the pair head out to the Cherry-Blossom Garden to hunt down and eradicate the crime syndicate. Three thieves appeared before them soon after their arrival; two grunts as well as the head honcho in charge. Prepared to take on the leader by herself, Chrys asked for Leo to handle the pair of grunts which he eagerly obliged. Staring down her opponent, Chrys sent out her Sableye, who wiggled his clawed fingers and flashed a pointed smile.<br />
<br />
Leo sent out his own Pokemon, featuring Brûlée the Mimikyu and Honey the Cutiefly, and called out orders for them to strike. The Mimikyu lunged forward with a ghostly appendage glowing a vibrant green and slammed it down at one of the grunt’s feet, causing him to flip backwards to dodge it with ninja-like reflexes. Honey fired off a Moonblast at the other grunt, who cartwheeled out of the way, and the two of them began to curse obscenities, from what Leo could gather.<br />
<br />
Brûlée suddenly flipped backwards to his original location, Copycatting the grunt to the best of his ability while Honey screeched a Bug Buzz to shut the pair up from their squabbling. The grunts looked at each other and then back towards Leo, brandishing Pokeballs between their fingers and flicking them forward like shuriken. In twin bursts of light, a pair of dragon newts stood before the fairies, presenting their claws and fangs for combat.

Leo’s attention was suddenly grabbed by a large cloud that loomed overhead where Chryss and the leader were. A head with avian features mounted upon a long neck craned out of the clouds and screeched. A ball of draconic energy formed in its mouth before shooting down at the Sableye below with a devastating pulse. The ghostly imp was barely able to roll out of the way before hurling a Shadow Ball back up at the flying beast. Leo couldn’t spectate for long however, as the Gabite and Charmeleon began to move; the former suddenly <b>dove into the earth</b> while the latter spewed forth a <b>Smokescreen</b> that blanketed the garden.</span></span></div>

</blockquote>&quot;Damn,&quot; Leo muttered to himself as he saw the two grunts react to his Pokemon and sent out Pokemon in response,<br />
<br />
&quot;Gabite and a Charmeleon...&quot; He thought to himself, trying to figure out the best way to fight them off. He wasn't worried about the Gabite, even if it was digging around. Charmeleon resisted fairy moves and could deal super effective damage against Honey. If he could disable it and take down the Gabite... Yes that could work. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright boys, I know what to do! Honey, I want you to clear away the Smokescreen with a <b>Silver Wind</b>! If we can get some boosts too than that would be appreciate it. Then stay airborne as you sprinkle a <b>Stun Spore</b> over the Charmeleon,&quot; he ordered his Cutiefly. He could feel Honey was more in tuned with him as he gave his orders. Could it be close to evolving? Nah, didn't seem like it.<br />
<br />
Looking at his other Alolan Native, he thought on what Mimikyu could do. He then punched his left hand with the pommel of his right, knowing exactly how to stall out the Gabite.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brûlée, I want you to set up a <b>Double Team</b> before the Smokescreen is dispelled. Make sure you an keep the Gabite entertained with your trickery and Disguise. Once it pops out, make sure you and your clones attack it with your signature <b>Shadow Claw!</b>&quot; He ordered, having a cheeky smile on his face. Subterfuge was the name of the game for Team Skull after all. <br />
<br />
Though, he did wonder what the Pokemon that Chrys was fighting was. It looked like an Altaria, a little bit, but he couldn't exactly place it. Though, watching her battle wouldn't be good until after he took care of these grunts. But, if he needed to, he knew a Twinkle Tackle would do the trick!</span></div>

<span style="color: plum">Taking in his two opponents, Leo began to think carefully about how to take them down. With a sound plan in mind, he called it out to Honey and Brûlée, hoping they’d be able to pull it off. Honey buzzed forward, flapping its wings rapidly to produce a Silver Wind in an attempt to blow away some of the Smokescreen. Parts of the dark haze cleared up, but others just remained a muddled greyish fog with the insect powder mixed in. As Honey continued to fill the air with a pollen of sorts, this time mixing in a paralyzing toxin into the dust, the bright flame of the Charmeleon became visible. The flame grew brighter and brighter through the smoke until Leo quickly realized that the light he was looking at wasn’t coming from the lizard’s tail. The Charmeleon was literally burning the powders away with a <b>Flamethrower</b>. Having successfully burned away the dangerous pollen, the Charmeleon leapt forward with surprising agility and grazed the Cutiefly in the side with a <b>Fiery Fang</b>.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Brûlée waited patiently while his opponent burrowed under the earth by setting up an assortment of afterimage clones. As planned, when the land shark burst from the ground and went right through one of the clones with teeth bared, the Mimikyu was ready, scratching it with Shadowy Claws, taking a small amount of recoil damage from its <i>Rough Skin</i>. The Gabite hissed angrily and sliced through the air like a bullet and smacked the real Brûlée in the head with an <b>Aerial Ace</b>. Or what it thought was the head. The top half of the Mimikyu’s body drooped to the side as the <i>Disguise</i> was broken. With all of the action going on over at his side of the battlefield, Leo needed to remain focused as these opponents weren’t going to go down without a fight. However, he could hear some hissing and screeches as well as a gust of wind at his back as the battle between Chryss and the leader was picking up.</span></span></div>

<span style="color: plum">Taking in his two opponents, Leo began to think carefully about how to take them down. With a sound plan in mind, he called it out to Honey and Brûlée, hoping they’d be able to pull it off. Honey buzzed forward, flapping its wings rapidly to produce a Silver Wind in an attempt to blow away some of the Smokescreen. Parts of the dark haze cleared up, but others just remained a muddled greyish fog with the insect powder mixed in. As Honey continued to fill the air with a pollen of sorts, this time mixing in a paralyzing toxin into the dust, the bright flame of the Charmeleon became visible. The flame grew brighter and brighter through the smoke until Leo quickly realized that the light he was looking at wasn’t coming from the lizard’s tail.

</blockquote>Well, this wasn't going as he expected. For some thieves they were certainly a lot stronger than he thought they would be. Think Leo, think. He knew that he'd need to switch targets at this rate. Charmeleon was just going to target Honey, and with Gabite's Rough Skin it can easily whittle away at Brûlée. <br />
<br />
&quot;Brûlée, I want you to start attacking the Charmeleon. Hit it hard with a <b>Shadow Claw</b> then keep up your assault with a <b>Shadow Sneak</b>! We need to keep it on the defensive,&quot; Leo ordered. He was getting a little desperate at this point, as he wasn't use to being on the back pedal in battles. He usually used words and trickery to get the upper hand, but these grunts weren't going to fall for that. <br />
<br />
He then had to think of a plan for the Gabite. Honey could definitely deal with it, but it would have to avoid Charmeleon to do so. If only he had a good answer to keep Honey up and running. All he had were some basic potions, and the fire moves would do too much damage to realistically justifying using them. Hopefully a solution presented itself shortly, after all sometimes relying on blind luck was crucial.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Honey, I want you to blast that Gabite with a <b>Dazzling Gleam</b>! Then channel the energies of the moon and let out a devastating <b>Moonblast</b>! Show the dragon the power of a fairy,&quot; he shouted, hoping that his words would resonate with the Cutiefly. This was far from over.</span></div>

<span style="color: plum">Leo quickly identified the current battle partners as unfavorable matchups for his Pokemon, so he quickly thought to adjust his strategy and create an opportunity for Honey and Brûlée to switch into something they could put to their advantage. He called out his new plan to his Pokemon, to which they immediately acknowledged and moved to put into action.<br />
<br />
Brûlée the Mimikyu was staring down the Gabite, who met eyes with the poltergeist with a bloodthirsty gaze. The Mimikyu then abruptly turned from his foe and lunged at the Charmeleon with Shadowy Claws bared. Gabite was none too pleased to have its foe turn his back on it, so the land shark hissed and pressed its claws to the ground, summoning a <b>Tomb</b> of <b>Sand</b> to try and block him from leaving. The sands swirled up like a miniature cyclone, surrounding the Mimikyu and trapping him inside. To Gabite’s frustration, the sands dissipated with the wind, having only torn an afterimage of Brûlée to shreds. Furious, Gabite dashed after Brûlée with blinding speed only to be knocked backwards with a blinding Dazzling Gleam from Honey.<br />
<br />
Angered in its own right that the Cutiefly would abandon it in the heat of battle as well, the Charmeleon charged forward with a <b>Fiery Fist</b> only to be blind sighted by Brûlée’s Shadow Claw. The Charmeleon turned to follow up its attack on the Mimikyu, but the ghost has seemed to disappear into the Shadows before Sneaking up behind the fire lizard and disrupting it. Charmeleon let out a furious hiss, turning up the intensity of a <b>Heat Wave</b> that scorched the battlefield and made both Brûlée and Honey quite uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
Gabite turned its focus to the Cutiefly as it got back to its feet and lunged forward while coating its <b>Head</b> in <b>Iron</b>. Honey unleashed a powerful Moonblast that struck the Gabite point-blank, but the shark steeled itself and fought through the beam to connect with its target. Honey and Gabite had both taken quite a bit of damage this turn, while the Charmeleon seemed to continue to increase its intensity.<br />
<br />
Taking a moment to glance over and check on Chryss and her Sableye, the opponent’s Altaria cawed loudly and reared up to unleash a powerful Dragon Pulse. Right before the beam was about to connect with the imp, Chryss called out to it, holding her arm up in the air. A bangle around her wrist began to glow simultaneously with the Sableye as it held its arms open. A small crystal formed in the air, growing larger and larger until it was bigger than the Sableye in size. The Sableye supported the crystal like a giant shield to take the full brunt of the Altaria’s attack.</span></span></div>

<span style="color: plum"><br />
Leo was happy that switching the match ups seemed to be going better, though Honey was starting to trail behind. Gabite knowing Iron Head was certainly left field, but he had to get through this. There had to be something that he could do. He then saw a blinding light at the corner of his eye, and looked towards Chryss once more. <br />
<br />
He was struck in awe when the Sableye Mega Evolved. That was certainly never something he saw in Alola, and it seemed so interesting. Trainers and their Pokemon coming together and using their bond to go beyond their limits. It was... awesome. He wished he had the ability to do that with any of his Pokemon. <br />
<br />
Then he got an idea. Honey seemed close to evolving during this fight. If he could give one more push then just maybe... <br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, I believe in you!&quot; He shouted towards the Cutiefly. The Bee Fly Pokemon looked at him in response, eyes shimmering with glee.<br />
<br />
The entire area then started to turn dark ass a blinding white light started to envelop the Cutiefly. His from started to change, his body straightening out and becoming more bipedal. His legs shifted, the front ones moving more into arms while all of the limbs extending. A proper head started to take shape, and his wings doubled in size. The light flashed and was released in a burst. He was a Cutiefly no more, and now stood as a powerful Ribombee! <br />
<br />
Leo just stood in shock at the evolution. The only other Pokemon he's had that has evolved was Custard, and that was so long ago he couldn't even really remember how that went. But this was not the time to celebrate. Honey evolved due to his bond with the Pokemon, and proving that it could be stronger. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Honey, let's show then our stuff! Give that Gabite a Pollen Puff! Show it your power!&quot; Leo ordered, then looked towards Brûlée. <br />
<br />
&quot;Brûlée, I want you to Mimic that Pollen Puff! Then use the mimicked Pollen Puff on Honey. A beautifully offensive and defensive move to show how powerful Ribombee's bond can be!&quot; he told his Mimikyu, no longer able to hold back his excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then Honey, let's finish that Gabite. Show it the power and light that Lunala graces all of us Alolans. Moonblast!&quot;</span></div>

<span style="color: plum">Inspired by watching Chryss bond with her Sableye and grow to a more powerful form, Leo called out to Honey, who had taken quite a beating so far, in order to instill his faith in him. The Cutiefly began to glow and suddenly changed form into that of a Ribombee. With some newfound strength at their disposal, Leo called out new orders for his Pokemon to combat the angry lizards.<br />
<br />
Honey stared down the Gabite and unleashed a Puff of Pollen at it while Brûlée watched and studied Honey’s actions in order to try and Mimic it. Gabite did not seem too pleased by this display, ramming into Honey with yet another <b>Iron Head</b> before being put down for good by another one of Honey’s Moonblasts. Ready to test out his memorization ability, Brûlée fired off his own Pollen Puff at his ally, the spores giving off a regenerative effect instead of damage this time. Honey was feeling much better now than he was moments before, but the same could not be applied to Brûlée.<br />
<br />
Incensed that it would be ignored in combat not once but twice, the flame on Charmeleon’s tail grew brighter. The fire lizard spun around and whacked the Mimikyu hard with an <b>Iron Tail</b> before following it up with a nasty <b>Flamethrower</b> at point blank range. The Charmeleon was now outnumbered two to one, but Brûlée was now looking much worse for wear.<br />
<br />
Leo hardly had time to keep tabs on the other fight between Mega Sableye and the Altaria, but the action sounded fierce. Another vicious <b>Dragon Pulse</b> cascaded off of Sableye’s crystal shield. The avian dragon then soared higher into the air, glowing brighter and brighter as it charged up a <b>Sky Attack</b>.</span></span></div>

<b>Missingno. Master</b>-<br />
<br />
Remus was unfazed by your orders, and stood firm. Was he confident that the Head Smash was going to end this match? It was unnerving, especially with his gaze delving into you. Picking you apart piece by piece. This was a man who feared nothing, and would fight until the bitter end. Yet, there seemed to be something to him. The way he was looking at you, there was a reason. But, what reason could that be? You couldn't discern why. <br />
<br />
But, the battle had to continue, and the orders were executed. Aquila started to charge up, kicking his leg to gain traction before barreling straight towards Kyle. The Heatmor's reaction was as quick as your thinking, and an Earth Power erupted from the ground at the charging Aggron. It was certainly damaging, but the inertia was too much to stop at this rate. It didn't help that it looked like Aquila Filtered out the blow. <br />
<br />
A large crack could be heard as the steel behemoth smashed into the Heatmor. The fiery anteater was sent flying and crashed into the ground. And then stayed on the ground. Was it truly over? It couldn't be over now, could it? Kyle stayed in the spot for a few more seconds, but he managed to muster up his strength. The Pokemon slowly made his ascent back to a standing position. He still had fight left, and this battle wasn't over yet. <br />
<br />
Aquila then stomped onto the ground, causing the entire area to shake violently. But that didn't deter Kyle one bit, and the Heatmor set up a protective barrier in the nick of time. There was a hard set determination here now, and no one was going to prevent Kyle from winning this for you. The Pokemon channeled his inner fire, and let out all he had in the form of a Fire Blast. The five pointed inferno wreathed the Aggron in its devastating flames, and even with Filter, it was enough. The Mega Pokemon slumped over, felled by that burst of strength. <br />
<br />
&quot;You've passed, boy,&quot; you heard Remus say as he recalled his partner Pokemon. <br />
<br />
&quot;Both of you have,&quot; he looks towards his son. Taitus looked up, a little confused by his father's shift in demeanor. <br />
<br />
&quot;You see, the way the Colosseum is ran is something that needs changed, but this city wasn't built in a day. I wasn't sure exactly what you were doing with my son, but this battle shows me your character, foreigner. I wanted to make sure my son could learn how to harden his resolve. I think you've taught him that lesson well,&quot; he states before turning his back to the both of you. <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, I can't permit this little charade to continue. Both of you walk with me. I will present you as warriors, fighting for the good of Romma. Also, that Tyrogue needs care, does it not?&quot; <br />
<br />
Taitus shoots you a nervous look, and Buzzer doesn't seem exactly happy with the idea as well. The situation seemed melancholic, but there was hope here. Of course, what your little did next was your decision. <br />
<br />
What do you do?</span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: Red">Keith kept his face impassive as he looked at Remus, who likewise was proving very hard to read. There was something to the look Keith was getting- a reason of some sort for why he was fighting, but what was that reason? Keith couldn't figure it out, and now was not the time to dwell on it anyway. Kyle was unleashing Earth Power, and while his aim was true, the Aggron was coming in with far too much force to be thrown off course. And Aquila's Ability surely didn't help matters, either- Keith knew that Mega Aggron were able to sort of Filter out the worst of super effective moves used against them. He held his breath as Kyle was slammed with the Head Smash. The Heatmor was knocked clean to the ground, where he lay unmoving for several tense seconds. Keith shifted his gaze to Kyle. A part of him was worried, but the rest of him, the part that knew this Heatmor and knew him well, was far more confident.<br />
<br />
And sure enough, Kyle slowly but surely got back up. Keith smiled proudly at this. Even back in Mt. Aduro, before Kyle had ever started training with Keith and getting even stronger, even back then he had been a virtually unstoppable force of pure determination when fighting for what was right. This here was a Heatmor who stood up to the gigantic tyrannical Heatran that terrorized Mt. Aduro and lived to tell the tale. To be stopped here and now was unthinkable.<br />
<br />
As if to drive that point home, once Kyle's Protect shielded him from the Earthquake, he then let loose a sizzling Fire Blast, further fueled by Flash Fire and the scorching sunlight above. Aquila was hit directly, wrapped in the relentless flames... and slumped over, unconscious! Keith exhaled as Remus withdrew his Aggron, but still stayed alert, not knowing how Remus would react here...<br />
<br />
&quot;You've passed, boy. Both of you have.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith blinked in surprise, exchanging looks with Meowth, who by the look on his face likewise hadn't expected this response.<br />
<br />
Remus went on to explain- he was in agreement that things needed to change with how the colosseum was run, but stated that Romma wasn't built in a day. While initially unsure what Keith was doing with Taitus, the battle that had just concluded went to prove Keith's character to Remus, and confirmed that Keith had succeeded in teaching Taitus to harden his resolve. Then, however, he turned around, and stated that this charade couldn't continue. He told them to walk with him, that he would present them as warriors, fighting for the good of Romma, before adding that the Tyrogue needed care. Keith glanced at Buzzer's son- was Remus suggesting what Keith thought he was?<br />
<br />
Neither Taitus nor Buzzer looked completely certain about this, which Keith was quick to pick up on. &quot;At least he seems to agree with us, that things have got to change,&quot; Keith said to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd call dat a step forward,&quot; Meowth agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed,&quot; Keith nodded, though now he was looking at Buzzer and her Tyrogue son. &quot;...Buzzer, Tyrogue,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;Things might start changing around here, but... probably not quick enough to guarantee your safety,&quot; he sighed. &quot;I wish that weren't the case, but I think we gotta take what we can get. That said... I'm not from around here, and I get the feeling I won't be around here for much longer, whether I like it or not. So I'll get right to the point- why don't the both of you come with me?&quot; he offered, producing a pair of Poké Balls- the one he offered Buzzer was the normal red and white variety, while Tyrogue was being offered an Ultra Ball. &quot;Where I'm from, Buzzer, your son would be able to grow up in a way better environment, away from how things are around here, and you'd get to stay with him as well, get to see him grow up. What do you say?&quot; he asked them both.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heat, Heatmor,&quot; Kyle added, nodding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Led ledi, Ledian!&quot; put in Stewie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dey're both right- you'd be happy wit dis guy,&quot; Meowth purred.</span><br />

<span style="color: plum">Inspired by watching Chryss bond with her Sableye and grow to a more powerful form, Leo called out to Honey, who had taken quite a beating so far, in order to instill his faith in him. The Cutiefly began to glow and suddenly changed form into that of a Ribombee. With some newfound strength at their disposal, Leo called out new orders for his Pokemon to combat the angry lizards.<br />
<br />
Honey stared down the Gabite and unleashed a Puff of Pollen at it while Brûlée watched and studied Honey’s actions in order to try and Mimic it. Gabite did not seem too pleased by this display, ramming into Honey with yet another <b>Iron Head</b> before being put down for good by another one of Honey’s Moonblasts. Ready to test out his memorization ability, Brûlée fired off his own Pollen Puff at his ally, the spores giving off a regenerative effect instead of damage this time. Honey was feeling much better now than he was moments before, but the same could not be applied to Brûlée.<br />
<br />
Incensed that it would be ignored in combat not once but twice, the flame on Charmeleon’s tail grew brighter. The fire lizard spun around and whacked the Mimikyu hard with an <b>Iron Tail</b> before following it up with a nasty <b>Flamethrower</b> at point blank range. The Charmeleon was now outnumbered two to one, but Brûlée was now looking much worse for wear.<br />
<br />
Leo hardly had time to keep tabs on the other fight between Mega Sableye and the Altaria, but the action sounded fierce. Another vicious <b>Dragon Pulse</b> cascaded off of Sableye’s crystal shield. The avian dragon then soared higher into the air, glowing brighter and brighter as it charged up a <b>Sky Attack</b>.</span></span>

<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: plum"><br />
Leo was ecstatic when the Gabite fell. His tactics were definitely working, and all he had left was the Charmeleon. He knew to not celebrate just yet, as he could tell Brûlée was doing worse for wear. Not to mention Honey was still at a disadvantage in all of this. Though, if he could just have them keep each other alive, then that would certainly work out. <br />
<br />
He quickly glanced over to the fight between the Altaria and the Sableye. Seems things were pretty evenly matched there. Of course, one side could easily blow out at any moment. It was a high risk game that would be devastating for the losing side. He needed to finish this quickly so he could help finish the Altaria off. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, lets finish this once and for all! Honey, give Brulee a <b>Pollen Puff.</b> We need to keep him healthy! Then I want you to help out with damaging the Charmeleon. Go for a <b>Moonblast</b>!&quot; He ordered to the Ribombee before looking at his Mimikyu.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brûlée, keep up the offensive assault! <b>Shadow Claw</b> into <b>Slash</b>! Aim for the same spot so we can try and cripple the Charmeleon.&quot;<br />
<br />
With both of his orders out of the way, Leo could only wait and hope. He had a sneaking feeling that time was not on his side. He fidgeted with his Fairium-Z in his pocket. This was a last resort effort for sure, but something that would definitely end that Altaria if push come to shove. It would be over.</span></div>

Brûlée was still feeling the heat from the direct damage he took the previous round, so his newly evolve Ribombee partner looked to alleviate his wounds by reciprocating the restorative effects of Pollen Puff.

Despite the damage being resisted, the cumulative damage was enough to finish the lizard off, causing it to collapse on the ground. <b>Honey and Brûlée each receive 2 levels!</b><br />
<br />
Leo could almost breathe a sigh of relief, but he wasn’t out of the woods just yet. The grunts had been dealt with as they collected their unconscious Pokemon and dispersed after they each chucked a smoke bomb on the ground. Leo was finally able to divert his full attention to Chryss’ battle against the leader, and not a moment too soon. The shimmering Altaria descended from the sky above at breakneck speed, bringing down a powerful <b>Sky Attack</b> onto the much slower Mega Sableye’s crystalline shield. Sableye had begun to glow as well, with a <b>Metallic</b> sheen, and a <b>Burst</b> of energy absorbed into its crystal released back out onto its opponent.<br />
<br />
The criminal leader was clearly not pleased with the recent turn of events noticing that his minions had left him all alone. He suddenly held out a pendant and shouted towards his avian dragon, causing it to glow once again. The pendant shined in unison, and the clouds surrounding the Altaria’s wings grew larger and denser, as if a storm was billowing up behind it. Once the glowing finally subsided, a powerful Mega Altaria hovered in the air above them. The bird’s angry clucks resembled the crack of thunder as it prepared to unleash hell onto the foes below.</span></span></div>

<span style="color: plum"><br />
A battle of Megas... A trainer's bond pushing their Pokemon beyond limitations. It was a beautiful, horrifying thing. Leo had read some reports from the Malie Library that mega evolution warped the cognition of the affected Pokemon. Garchomp's limbs melting down, Gengar becoming a murderous monster, and Scizor at a constant risk for breaking down and dying. Of course, it isn't a completely negative thing, but nonetheless it is incredibly dangerous. But, there was a beauty to it. A transient state that showed the power of bonds. <br />
<br />
&quot;I... I think that we should help out,&quot; Leo mutters to his team. This was certainly here fight, but... This needed to end. A cold chill was starting to creep its way up his back. Something inherently... <i>wrong</i>... was going to happen if he didn't intervene at this point. That's what his gut was telling him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, I want you to fire off two <b>Moonblasts</b> at the Mega Altaria! Brulee, give the Mega Sableye a <b>Pollen Puff</b>! He's our friend so make sure it heals him. Then try and use your long reach to give that Altaria your <b>Shadow Claw</b>!&quot; He ordered. Even if Mega Altaria shed its flying prowess to became part fairy, it was still a dragon! <br />
<br />
He looked to Custard, who was patiently watching from the sidelines. The Togetic's eyes shone with glee, realizing what as about to happen. It certainly has been a long time since they last did this, and the Togetic flew around Leo with happy cheers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let me show you... the power of our Z-Move!&quot; Leo yelled as he took his Fairium-Z and turned the crystal on his Z-Ring. <br />
<br />
&quot;By the light of the Alolan Moon, and the Miniors that light our sky. May the evil dragon fall before the might of the fey... Know the power of the stars! TWINKLE TACKLE!&quot; the boy roared, his words reverberating from his soul. He then made a heart with his hands, cupping it over one of his eyes as he winked. He then did the signature pose of the move, channeling the Z-power into Custard's Play Rough. With a high five, Custard was fully powered up and ready to go. <br />
<br />
&quot;End them.&quot; His demeanor was suddenly cold. If someone looked at him, they wouldn't see the baker boy. They would see the Team Skull Grunt. No, grunt wasn't the right word here. He seemed well above the usual grunt here. He was someone that embodied the very concept of Team Skull. A group dedicated to causing mischief and mayhem. A group dedicated to proving they were better than anyone else. A group that would've one day dismantled Alolan society. That was the man that was now standing there, with eyes shining with contempt.</span></div>

<b>Missingno. Master-</b><br />
<br />
Buzzer seemed taken aback by the offer. The Electivire wasn't entirely sure on what was going on, and seemed to not really be happy by your offer. She looked at Taitus, and stood firmly by his side. It was obvious enough she had no intentions of accepting your offer. You could tell by her resolve that she was determined to help Taitus in fixing this system. This was her home, her time. She wasn't going to leave that behind. She couldn't. It's a mothers duty to take care of her children, after all. <br />
<br />
The Tyrogue was too weakened at this point to consider your offer. It looked at the Pokeball before passing out. It seemed that the damage it had sustained was a lot worse than initially seemed. Buzzer went to grab her son, and held him within her arms. Getting him properly treated was a more pressing priority right now. <br />
<br />
Taitus at this point was urging you to follow his father, and your little group followed. The tunnel lead directly in front of the Colosseum , and a group of Romman citizens were gathered before the entrance. Remus was standing at the head of the group, commanding their attention. Once he took notice of you and Taitus, he beckoned the both of you over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Romman Citizens, today is a day that I hope will one day be worth experiencing. It is a day where people learn of the tyranny that happens within our beloved walls and homes. Here, two brave warriors risked there lives to expose this tyranny.&quot; He hoisted both your's and Taitus's arms in the air. &quot;Warriors that have exposed the true nature of our beloved Colosseum. This Electivire and her son was abused and broken by the system. You want to know what we did to Pokemon that lost fights? We'd execute them, once the public eye was no longer perceiving them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at this Tyrogue. His bones were broken, his muscles sprained in order to push him past his limits. In order of becoming a gladiator that you, the public, would enjoy watching until his demise. He needs urgent medical attention, but he would've not gotten that in the depths. He would've been left to rot. I ask you, my fellow countrymen, if that is just? We would not do this to our own sons and daughters, but we would do them to our life long friends? Our companions and compatriots in arms? Again, I ask if this is just?&quot; <br />
<br />
At this point the crowd was in a fervor. An outrage. They were not aware of the atrocities that were actually occurring in the Colosseum, only the stories of glory and the matches that were thrilling to watch. A few women ran towards Buzzer and her son, and escorted them away. You could tell by their garbs that they were healers, and they went into a nearby hut. Taitus elected to go with them, wanting to make sure that they were okay. <br />
<br />
&quot;My fellow countrymen, I will promise you that with the power I have I will put a stop the this corruption. I will fight as long as I have to. I know that my son will as well. I ask that all of you do as well. I am just one man, and be it so I can not do this alone. So I ask, that you go to your senators. You go to those who represent you, and fight for this change with me!&quot; <br />
<br />
The crowd was cheering along with Remus as this point. You could tell they were also going to fight along side him, his words rallying their hearts to fighting for justice. One of the healers came out of the hut and approached you. She told you to follow her, saying that Tiatus requested you to do so. <br />
<br />
You comply, and rush over to the hut. There you see the Tyrogue fully awake. It seems to be interested in you. Buzzer gently nudged her son, who nimbly walked over to you. He looked up at you with expecting eyes. You could tell he had accepted your offer, now that he was in the state to do so. <br />
<br />
How do you respond?</span></div>
