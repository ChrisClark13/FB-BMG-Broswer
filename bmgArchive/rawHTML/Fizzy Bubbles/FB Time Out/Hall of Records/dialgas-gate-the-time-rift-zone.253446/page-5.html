Pretty quickly you come to the decision to assist the penguin pokemon. The natural order of predator and prey is one thing, but this outnumbering situation would only leave the Empoleon line decimated and the Sharpedo largely unsatisfied, as there would be nowhere near enough to go around. You go for your belt and unleash your Lapras unto the water. The mere presence of the new pokemon already draws the attention of several of the Sharpedo. You call out as Balerion drops you onto Argo's shell and Argo immediately breathes out a frosty breath just to the side of the penguin pokemon. The Male Empoleon who's claws were previously glowing green initially moves against the new intruder but seems to realize Argo is assisting them rather than attacking them. He gives a sqwuak to the younger pokemon and the three small ones make for the newly forming ice platform. A few of the Sharpedo are glanced by the attack and don't seem to be super hurt by it but the large platform is successfully created. You tell your jet-black Charizard to give provide cover with air slash. He does his best, now freed from your weight and begins flapping his wings sharply to provide cover to the retreating young pokemon. Slashes of air cut through the sky and blast several more Sharpedo away. In the meantime the two Empoleon resume fighting of the sharpedo, now less immediately worried about the safety of their young they are able to fight more freely, but also more recklessly it seems as the sharpedo seem to be landing more blows as well. Speaking of which your footing is somewhat shaken as a couple of the shark pokemon take bites into your largely immobile Lapras. A few also take leaps at the flying charizard but the only one to land a blow is one smart enough to use an Aqua Jet to increase its leaping speed. As you plan your next move you recall that you aren't there alone and glance up to see the rest of the scouting party. They seem to be heading down to assist you since you did not return to them and the giant ice platform probably clued them in as a signal that something is going down. <br />
<br />
You've cleared out a few sharpedo and made a platform of ice to provide you with some versatility to your environment. And while you have backup coming soon, the amount of sharpedo doesn't seem to be noticeably decreased. What will you do now?</span></div>

You find yourself somewhere that you don't recognize. The architecture around you is marble, and the olive trees are in bloom. In front of you is a particularly stunning building, with a high ceiling and tall columns. Between you and it is a pristine reflecting pool, inside of which lily pads have begun to grow. Deciding it would be best to find another human being, you and Xigua make your way towards the opulent building, passing the pool on your way. Bubbles rise up from the bottom, attracting your attention; as you pause to see what it is, an arthropod rises to the surface, two of its thin, jointed legs clutching an air bubble trapping its head. It looks at you a moment, and then disappears under the water again; its body is wiry and lacking in substance, but you can just barely see it flit across the pool floor.<br />
<br />
Just then, your attention is pulled away from the creature in the pond, by the sound of human voices. Two gentlemen, wearing what can only be described as 'period' clothing, descend the steps of the large building, talking loudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is the fault of the priestesses,&quot; one of them accuses. He has a dense, flaxen-colored beard. His companion is graying, beard a shortly-cropped salt-and-pepper mix.<br />
<br />
&quot;The priestesses have done their best,&quot; rebuts the graying man as they pass by you. He pauses to fix you with a strange look, but then pulls his attention away, returning to his conversation. &quot;You shouldn't take it out on them...&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, you've found people, but they seem pre-occupied with something. Maybe you shouldn't interrupt them? You could check out that thing in the pool. Then again, you probably shouldn't be wandering around this place. It might be best to bite the bullet and ask these people what's going on, and how to get out of here. What was that they were talking about, though? Priestesses? If they're reenactors, they're definitely taking their roles seriously.<br />
<br />
<b>What will you do?</b><br />

</blockquote><span style="color: springgreen">The change in scenery was a bit of a surprise for Rory, yet upon having another look around, things seemed a little more than extravagant for a reenactment. For one, those olive trees were in bloom, and that pool was glistening. So glistening in fact, he could see his reflection in it from a distance. The waters rippled, startling the teen lightly, before something approached from beneath the waters. The source of the disturbance was an unusual insect, wiry limbs supporting an orb of what seemed like air - no, water.<br />
<br />
&quot;A dewpider?&quot; he drolled, scratching his head. &quot;Last I checked, New Fizz didn't have any habitats suitable for many bugs around it, much less pond dwellers due to pollutants...&quot; he continued, as Xigua watched the fellow water type dip below the surface and skitter away. A couple of voices then echoed, as the bug and boy whirled to face the source of noise. Two men, actors perhaps? But those were some really good period outfits they wore, and those beards...did they mention priestesses?<br />
<br />
Rory racked his brains, deeply puzzled. &quot;Xig...if this were a reenactment, then the water in that pond would still have some small traces of pollution, like little bits of mud, but that's clear as day. Those robes, too, look too good to be the work of hobbyists.&quot; The Wimpod chirruped in response. &quot;It might be rude to interrupt them if they're rehearsing, but I think we should head inside the temple and look around. Let's be respectful though: no scavenging, no peeking under robes, and treat this place like a proper grecan reenactment, with old grecan greetings and no mentions of New Fizz until we find someone who's in charge here.&quot; Rory looked back at the pond before heading for the temple. <i>That dewpider must be a trained pokemon,</i> he mused.</span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: #4da6ff">While they had succeeded in creating a platform for the younger penguins, Jayson and Argo now found themselves at the mercy of the giant school of Sharpedo. Thankfully it looked like assistance was on its way, with the other scouts diving down from above to provide them with aid. Jayson knew Argo would be a sitting duck while he was on the Lapras's back. Urging the Lapras towards the sheet of ice, Jayson leapt off his shell and onto the ice. Thankfully it proved strong enough to hold his weight and he was careful not to knock any of the Piplup off. &quot;Argo give me a bit more ice to work with, another <b>Freeze Dry</b>, should do it.&quot; Jayson grabbed a familiar Pokeball off his belt and prepared to welcome Ymir back out into the frigid climate. The Amaura would set up an <b>Aurora Veil </b>to help strengthen the team before doing his best to dispatch the Sharpedo with <b>Discharges</b>, being sure to keep clear of the Empoleon. Assisting the Steel type Pokemon would be Argo's job, he would alternate between <b>Thunderbolt and Freeze Dry</b>, hopefully before long the predators would realize this wasn't a meal worth fighting for. <br />
<br />
&quot;Balerion&quot;, Jayson called out to the Charizard, &quot;work with the other scouts to keep pushing the Sharpedo back. Keep targeting them with <b>Air Slashes and Dragon Pulses, </b>I'm certain they'll give up once they realize they are out gunned.&quot; The issue was that these Sharpedo seemed to be acting up due to the storm, their behaviour wasn't exactly easy to predict so there was every chance they'd have to beat down every last one of them. </span></div>

With the smaller penguin pokemon relatively safe in the center of your newly formed ice island, you hop onto the island yourself to give your Lapras more freedom to battle. Deciding that your two pokemon would be in need of some additional support you reach for your belt and call on your plus sized Amaura once again. The ice platform is shaken a lot by the fossil pokemon's weight and for a moment you think you might begin sinking, but you ask Argo to bolster it with an additional Freeze Dry providing the island plenty of support to hold up you and your dinosaur as Ymir's Snow Warning ability begins to bring down hailstones from the completely overcast sky. With the hail firmly in place, Ymir starts off with an Aurora Veil offering protection to your pokemon and the young penguins in the form of a slight aura of aurora borealis at this time of year, at this time of day, in this part of the country, localized entirely around these pokemon. Unfortunately, it doesn't quite extend to the Empoleons themselves. With defenses somewhat taken care of Ymir goes on the offensive launching discharges into the sharpedo, knocking several of them out. Argo also begins to contribute his super effective moves but his are less effective due to his lower level. You call out to your charizard and have him start strafing with more air slashes and dragon pulses and between the three pokemon you are starting to see the population drop. However just as you begin to hope that the Sharpedo would be scared off tragedy strikes. The male empoleon who had been slashing away with more and more fury at the sharpedo is suddenly and quickly dragged under the water, and soon after red begins to pool up toward the surface. The Prinplup grimaces and pulls the two Piplup closer from their place on the ice as the female empoleon lets out a mournful cry before attacking the Sharpedos with renewed vigor and powerful water attacks. As you prepare for your next orders you hear Gendra's Talonflame's cry as the scouts grow even closer but they are unable to contribute to the fight just yet. With the sharpedo starting to weaken and a terrible loss on your side, what will you do next?</span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: #4da6ff">Jayson grimaced as the Papapoleon was dragged beneath the surface, a slick of red blood rising in his place. Despite their best efforts, they hadn't managed to save him, but Jayson knew if they hadn't come to the assistance of the penguins then they would have all likely met the same fate as the male Empoleon. Argo was struggling to hold his own, despite his age the Lapras hadn't had the most battle experience, having grown up in a lake with little competition. Balerion continued to pepper the Sharpedo from above and they slowly began to shrink the sharks ranks, but the task wasn't done yet. Looking to Ymir, Jayson could see the pain and anger on the Amaura's face. It seemed the loss of the Empoleon and the now fatherless Piplups hit a sore spot, the Amaura had been abandoned by its mother after all. The Ice type turned its head towards the full moon, its light trickled down through the clouds, bathing their surroundings. Letting out a spine tingling cry, the Amaura suddenly lights up and begins to grow, Ymir was evolving. The already large Amaura undergoes a massive growth spurt. Jayson backpedals towards the Piplup and Prinplup to give the Ice type room, luckily they'd made the sheet of ice larger. Flowing sails grow down the Pokemon's neck, as the light fades, Ymir swings his whip-like tail around with a crack! <br />
</span><br />
<b><span style="color: #4da6ff">Ymir evolved into an Aurorus!<br />
</span></b><br />
<span style="color: #4da6ff">The ice beneath Jayson's feet began to move, the Aurorus's extra weight was moving the ice! &quot;Quick Ymir, strengthen the ice with a <b>Freeze Dry </b>of your own! Then keep smashing those Sharpedo with <b>Discharges.</b>&quot; Ymir had his orders, hopefully the ice could hold him for long enough to clear out the Sharpedo. &quot;Argo freeze the Sharpedo around you with a <b>Freeze Dry</b>, then do your best to help clear out the rest with <b>Thunderbolt. </b>Balerion, keep doing what you're doing, we will have these sharks cleared out soon!&quot;</span></div>

You take the slightest of moments to respect the fallen father Empoleon but you quickly resolve to continue your rescue, knowing that this would have been the fate of the rest of the family if it wasn't for your intervention. You begin to give further orders but you find that your newly released Amaura seems to be particularly crestfallen. Knowing Ymir's history with parental figures explains this but doesn't directly explain the fact that the fossil pokemon has begun to glow. Glow and grow in fact. You immediately back towards the young penguin pokemon to give Ymir space as his evolution finishes and you admire your new Aurorus under the full moon's light peaking just through the overcast sky. You are filled with a bit of pride but it is quickly replaced by stomach dropping feeling as the ice begins to crack somewhat under the new weight. With a quick call, you have the newly evolved pokemon fortify the platform even more with another Freeze dry. His sails then crackle with more electricity as he begins discharging more of the attack into the Sharpedo swarm dropping them at an even faster pace. You then deliver orders to Argo but the Sharpedo have caught on that he is a big and bulky and hasn't been able to dodge many of the attacks and with more vigor deliver many more bites and the battle-young Lapras, unfortunately, succumbs to the numbers and faints even with the aurora veil defensive boost, but not before getting out one last freeze dry to fell the ones that would KO it as well. In the meantime, your Charizard has maintained the advantage by keeping an aerial distance and bombing from the high vantage point with his dragon and flying attacks but the Sharpedo, while their numbers continue to shrink, the ones that remain are fighting smarter and are using Aqua Jet to leap out towards the Charizard and are starting to land blows, but nothing Balerion is unable to handle. For now. Gendra and the rest of the scouts are now in range and, while maybe not knowing any specific motivations, understand that the Sharpedo need to be dealt with. A plethora of air cutters, air slashes, and other flying moves begin to pepper the Sharpedo as well. However, there are still plenty left to swarm the remaining Empoleparent who with a worried look at something underwater stops attacking and takes a more defensive stance. Beginning to take blows rather than dish them out the Female Empoleon starts to glow with more and more white energy with every strike. You start to wonder what could have the wild pokemon so worried but before you can think about it too hard something bursts from the middle of the triply reinforced ice with an energy cap you identify as a Skull Bash. Acting on pure instinct you leap forward to grab onto your Aurorus to keep from falling into the Sharpedo infested water. The ice platform seems to remain stable enough to hold you and your pokemon but it seems to have split in two, separating you from the three young Penguin pokemon. But you aren't worried about that because you are facing down the perpetrator of the skull bash. Another Sharpedo, but one different from the rest of the pod you have been pretty handily dealing with. At first glance, the biggest differences are the enlarged right fin, lower jaw and the swollen looking right part of its face, but with a perceptive glance, you see that the sharpedo's right eye has a shard of some kind of glass or gem looking object embedded into where its right eye should be. It lets out a roar of what seems to be anger and pain as it stares you and your fossil pokemon down. Gendra and the empoleon seem to have the rest of the pod occupied, it's up to you to take this Alpha down. What will you do now?</span></div>

But you aren't worried about that because you are facing down the perpetrator of the skull bash. Another Sharpedo, but one different from the rest of the pod you have been pretty handily dealing with. At first glance, the biggest differences are the enlarged right fin, lower jaw and the swollen looking right part of its face, but with a perceptive glance, you see that the sharpedo's right eye has a shard of some kind of glass or gem looking object embedded into where its right eye should be. It lets out a roar of what seems to be anger and pain as it stares you and your fossil pokemon down. Gendra and the empoleon seem to have the rest of the pod occupied, it's up to you to take this Alpha down. What will you do now?</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: #4da6ff">Jayson swore as Argo was overwhelmed by the Sharpedo. The Lapras had done its part to help save the penguins, but Jayson regretted not putting more effort into the transport Pokemon's training. Thankfully with his new strength, Ymir was dispatching the Sharpedo at an even faster rate, while Balerion now had the assistance of the other scouts. Just when Jayson thought they were in the clear, something crashes through the ice sheet, a strange looking Sharpedo like nothing he had ever seen before. It seemed to be disfigured, its right fin and the right part of its face were enlarged, perhaps somehow related to the shard stuck in the monster's eye. Upon sighting the shard, Jayson's first thought was of Mega Evolution. He'd seen Pokemon Mega Evolve without a trainer before, like the Glalie and Abomasnow in the Cloud Garden. If this was Mega Evolution then it was clearly incomplete, perhaps the mega stone had been shattered? Another possibility was that a Z Crystal had become lodged in the Sharpedo's eye and the innate power of the crystal caused the Sharpedo's body to warp and become disfigured. Either way, it was a safe bet that dislodging the shard would likely be their best chance of stopping it. If Ymir could subdue the Sharpedo for long enough, Jayson might just be able to rip it free. <br />
<br />
Jayson recalled Argo into his Pokeball while he quickly planned out a course of action. Balerion would continue to fight with the scouts, while him and Ymir had to focus on the Alpha Sharpedo. &quot;Ymir lock it up with a <b>Thunder Wave</b>, then while it struggles with the paralysis, try to trap it in ice with a <b>Freeze Dry</b>. Jayson stood at the ready, if an opportunity to close in and jump onto the Sharpedo presented itself, he would be ready to take the leap. </span></div>

You examine your new foe, coming up with several theories that could provide an explanation while having your Charizard assist with the smaller threats along with the scouts. While Jayson had not met a Mega Sharpedo before, he recalled the wild mega pokemon during what was known as the Snowdown event, and could possibly chalk this up to an incomplete version of that, with the shard in its eye being a shard of sharpedonite jammed in somehow. The other possibility was a Z-crystal, with the elemental energies of that being what caused the Sharpedo to swell. Either way, you know without a doubt that getting rid of it would be your best shot at winning this fight. However, in the short time you've spent planning the Sharpedo has sent a Hydro pump towards Ymir, and without any real place to dodge to, the rock type is unfortunately forced to take the attack head-on. Ymir shakes it off like a champ but definitely won't be able to take much more of those heavy hits as he is already panting. You have him start off with Thunder wave which strikes the Alpha, causing its already odd and lopsided movements to lock up on occasion. Its eyes then lock onto you personally causing a tingle to go down your spine as it temporarily breaks through the paralysis to launch itself at you with its mouth agape. You assume you are done for but just as fast the attack is blocked by a large glowing form. The female Empoleon took the Crunch attack for you and then knocks the Sharpedo back into the water where Ymir is able to lock it in place with a thin layer of ice with his Freeze dry attack. The Empoleon seems to ready something but before it can you recognize your chance. You leap off of your ice platform onto the partially frozen Sharpedo, landing right near the target eye. However, it seems the Empoleon was not accounting for this and makes distressed noises, you glance back and both Ymir and the Empoleon seem to want you to get out of the way as the Empoleon seems to be at the verge of unleashing whatever attack it has been preparing. You quickly grab at the gem in the eye where it seems to be tightly wedged yet gives the tiniest bit but no where near quickly enough. You seem to have a choice, continue to pull at the shard and risk getting blasted, or leap back to safety. What will you choose?</span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: #4da6ff">It appeared that their was a bond forming between Jayson and the remaining Empoleon, as the steel penguin leaps to his aid, tanking a powerful Crunch from the Alpha Sharpedo. The combination of the paralysis and ice then managed to hold the beast in place long enough for Jayson to make his move. Standing on the Sharpedo's right fin, Jayson tried his best to claw the shard from its eye but it was proving a harder task than he anticipated. Perhaps the swelling had lodged it in there, but Jayson was persistent. Even the sight of the Empoleon charging its next attack wasn't enough to take him off his task, he'd risk the hit if it meant saving them all. It wasn't the first time he'd put his life on the line and it likely wouldn't be the last. Valka called his reckless, but he liked to think it was at least part bravery. He had to get this shard out quickly, but it was proving hard to get free. Jayson retrieved the dagger from his belt. He figured the Sharpedo was already in pain and it likely wouldn't get its eyesight back even if he managed to remove the shard. Jayson prepared to stick the sharpened blade in behind the shard and pry it free. <br />
<br />
Jayson hoped that Ymir or Balerion would be quick to his aid if he was knocked into the water. Not only would being knocked into the water put him at great risk of a Sharpedo attack, the ice cold water would likely kill him if he was in it for too long. There was no time to think of his demise though, he had to concentrate on prying this shard out of the Sharpedo's eye. </span></div>

Heather- It's an honor on any day to meet the Champion of the Sinnoh region, an even greater one to be given an assignment by her. And such an important one at that! To investigate the Ancient Library of Alexia would be a great privilege and experience but to get assigned to do it and possibly get a reward at the end would definitely be appealing. With a few stern yet good-hearted warnings and a way to get home, you set off for the rift in time, just outside New Fizz City. As you come on the distortion in time you make sure all the pokemon you are responsible for are secure and step through. While an odd sensation, it feels mostly like you are falling for a really long time, but at the same time you land instantly (though somewhere along the way you think you spot a blue box in the timestream with you but not long enough to be sure it wasn't your mind playing tricks).<br />
<br />
<br />
With a rough landing in a faceful of sand, you know even before you raise your head that you have either arrived in Egya or you are waking up from an extremely vivid dream on the Bubbling Beach. You look around and with no water to be found you are firmly decided on the former. You also take note of the other obvious surroundings. Of which there are very few. In most directions you look, you see the expansive desert and rolling hills of sand. But directly behind where you landed is a fairly large city, and it seems to be bustling with people. You can tell there are plenty of people because you luckily seem to have landed close enough to the city, or at least within walking distance. The rift seems to have taken your wishes at least somewhat into account and not dropped you into the middle of the desert. After taking in the city you decide to ask someone to direct you to the Library. Although you get a couple of odd looks at your modern clothes, it seems a stroke of luck you speak the same language at least. An obviously eccentric older man with a long white beard that almost reaches his knees and an oddly wild look in his eyes goes: &quot;Yesh? The Library?&quot; He licks several times as he thinks, although you might wonder what is so long to think about given it's the most prominent place in the city. &quot;Keep heading deeper into the cshenter of the cshity yesh? It'sh the one with the the Pyroar shtatues outshide it.&quot; He nods and without waiting for a response moves on from the conversation and strikes one up with a merchant who just rolls his eyes.<br />
<br />
<br />
You make your way deeper into the city and you fairly easily find the building in question, the general flow of the crowds leading you just as much as the old man's directions. As he had said there were two stone statues of the fire Pokemon outside it, a Female on the left and Male on the right. It seems easy enough to head into, with many folks coming in and out, holding different kinds of scrolls and writings. Some even look to be wearing more modern outfits, the tourists Cynthia mentioned most likely. You are ready to step in when you see through the entrance, almost straight back into the library, what seems to be some kind of struggle. Most everyone is too busy with their own duties or interests to take notice but you definitely see papyrus and other things flying in the air.<br />
<br />
<br />
What will you do?

Mint slowly pulled herself up from the gritty sands of the Egyan desert and dusted herself off. For some reason, that brief glimpse of some sort of blue phone box from her fall stuck in her head more than it ought to have, for something that might not have even been real. <br />
<br />
<br />
Enough of that, she reasoned to herself. This was a strange and new place, there were things Mint needed to do before pondering such possibly imagined things. First, surroundings. In front, lots of sand. Not a promising start. To the left, more sand. Brilliant. To the right, even more sand. Mint sighed, and braced herself to turn around. Behind her...a city! Mint hoped to Arceus above that this city was in fact the one with the Library she had been tasked to locate and visit, but to answer that question, she had to actually get there. By walking through the quite intense heat. Another sigh.<br />
<br />
<br />
Digging Celeste’s Poke Ball back out of her bag, Mint released the rather irate Chatot, who immediately resumed its usual perch with a light peck at Mint’s ear to express its irritation.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Settle down, there, we got here together in one piece, that’s what matters.” Mint said to her companion, as another such companion decided to wiggle free from Mint’s bag.<br />
<br />
<br />
“So, we’re finally here? That rift felt like we were falling for agezzzz!” Sprocket piped up, flitting about as if making up for lost time.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Yes, Sprocket, we’re here. Stay close now, we’re getting a move on.” Mint said sternly. Sprocket knew better than to joke about now-Mint had spent the week between taking this assignment and today worrying over how to best keep all her Pokémon safe, him included, and while the Rotom Dex did love a good practical joke, a prank in a setting like this could hardly be called practical.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mint was ill at ease approaching the city. Not for sensing any imminent danger or seeing any bad omen, but from all the looks she got from the local people as she passed by them. True, they could just think her clothing as a whole odd enough to merit the staring (not to mention Sprocket being about as anachronistic as her PokeGear), but this outfit in particular...Mint couldn’t help but wonder if any of them had managed to clock her for how honestly ill suited her body was for it at this time, as she’d just started transitioning recently, just about anyone with eyes would be able to tell the outfit just didn’t fit quite right. She tried to shake away the thought, there was no way people of the past would have a concept of...no, no matter how much she tried, the thought would not leave her head. Best to just let it stew in the back of her head, Mint supposed, and deal with it when she wasn’t on a mission in a foreign land and time. She had known what she was getting into with this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Having gone a ways into the city but not having found any sort of library-like establishment, Mint decided to swallow her nerves and ask someone for directions. Flagging down a passerby, she at least discovered that there was thankfully no language barrier to be had here. Nor was there a barrier for the eccentric old man who cut in just then to actually point her in the direction of her destination, noting the Pyroar statues that apparently stood outside the place. With a quickly stammered thank you, Mint rushed off to find her target once more.<br />
<br />
<br />
Coming to the grand entrance of the Library, Mint was taken aback at the Pyroar statues-they were enormous, one had to wonder how such things were made in the distant past. Perhaps she might take a moment to get that answered at some point. That said, even at this immense size, the female Pyroar still seemed far more majestic to Mint than the male-something about the way the latter’s mane looked always came off as more goofy to her than regal or commanding.<br />
<br />
<br />
Looking around, locals and time traveling tourists alike bustled about the place, carrying all manner of scrolls in and out of the massive entryway. Well, it at least seemed as though she would be able to peruse the texts here with little issue, which was nice. However, she wouldn’t have the time right away, as she noticed a flying flurry of papyrus sheets and other things straight back into the building. Sprocket, for his part, seized the momentary pause to get a couple pictures of the Great Library’s grand entryway.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Sprocket, Celeste, both of you behave. With my luck, all that papyrus is valuable reading material.” Mint grumbled, as she made her way back to see what was up.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Understood!” replied both Chatot and Rotom Dex, the latter diligently following behind.</span></div>

You glance back at the Empoleon from your precarious position on the Sharpedo, marveling at the beginnings of a bond between you and the steel type but a rumble from the fish you are on quickly stops more thoughts from forming. Despite knowing an attack from the Empoleon mom is imminent you remain determined to get this shard from this shark's eye. When initial tugs fail you pull a dagger from your belt intent on using it to free the shard. Knowing this would likely hurt the Sharpedo only holds you back the slightest of moments before justifying that the Sharpedo is already in pain from it. You jam the knife in and the sharpedo cries out in pain but with a quick movement, you use the leverage provided by the knife to pop the shard out... where it goes flying and splashes into the water. It is quiet for a moment as all eyes seem to watch the shard quickly sink out of sight before all hell breaks loose. The sharpedo begins to splash and break free of the ice and paralysis once more, causing you to hold on for dear life. Ymir seems unsure what to do but what is more disconcerting is the look of worry on the Empoleon's face before it is illuminated by the white energy that has been building. A white beam that would do a certain anime proud is launched toward you and the Sharpedo, quickly filling your vision with nothing but white. As your vision is overloaded you hear the concerned cries of the young pokemon as they seem to fade as if leaving quickly before landing in the salty water. You just barely make out the shadow of something knocking a smaller form off the ice into the water before you black out from pain. You aren't out for long though as you come to when the familiar claws and body heat of Balerion lift you from the water onto the Argo-made iceberg. You sit up as your head clears and notice several things. Firstly, the waters are relatively calm, the sharpedo swarm seems to have dissipated. Secondly, you see your fellow scouts hovering just ahead. Gendra calls to you, &quot;Good work Jayson. I kinda pieced together what went down and why you engaged. Can't fault ya for wanting to protect those cute bird pokemon from that many Sharpedos.&quot; She says. &quot;I dunno how well they faired though. After you took the blast the shockwave sent the smaller 'berg towards the mainland way fast. I hope the little ones are ok. And after that, the sharpedo took the fight with the mama underwater where we can't follow. But we cleared up the rest of the smaller ones.&quot; She explains. &quot;But that was a helluva stunt you pulled. I don't know how many warriors from the boat could have tanked a Bide built up from that many blows like you did.&quot; She adds clearly impressed. &quot;When you are rested up we have about an hour left till we can safely spot the storm.&quot;<br />

Shrugging off the glances and after getting directions you enter the Library, taking in the majesty of the building itself as wel as the statues, in way better condition than they could possibly be in any museum. You bring your Chatot back out along with your Rotomdex to keep you company in the strange land as you explore the building. Taking notice of some kind of disturbance you decide to go investigate where most of the other denizens would ignore it. As you get close you hear a voice before you actually see what is going one. It sounds like a young man, who is getting increasingly frustrated by something with lots of &quot;Oh come on!&quot;s and plenty of &quot;Get back here!&quot;s. You squeeze around a pair of Golett transporting a comically large bag of scrolls to find a young Egyian teen, no older than 16. He is panting and holding one of his fingers which, while not bleeding, has very obvious bite marks. He seems to be trying to corner a pokemon which is running around and tearing into different scrolls and chewing on them with apparent glee. A quick glance at it and Sprocket easily identifies it as a Trapinch. It looks over to you which seems to gain the young boy's attention which the Trapinch quickly abuses to run off to another section of the library. &quot;No wai- auugh.&quot; The young man groans before turning to face you completely. &quot;Almost had him that time.&quot; He seems to recognize you and then notice your Chatot contentedly perched on your shoulder. &quot;Oh! Hello ma'am. Pardon my behavior I have been trying to catch that papyrus glutton for a week now.&quot; He scratches his head. &quot;You are one of those outsiders that use the little balls to tame the Pokemon yes? Perhaps you could help? I have none of my own and driving that one out has proven difficult. He isn't a nuisance enough for any of the adults to take notice as he only eats the blank ones but I am tired of his presence.&quot; The boy looks somewhat embarrassed that he wasn't able to take care of it himself. Will you help the lad?</span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: #4da6ff">Jayson instantly regretted his actions as he came to. He'd managed to get the shard free, getting a clear glimpse of it before it sunk to the bottom of the ice cold sea, it was clearly some Sharpedonite. The Sharpedo had flipped out when the shard was removed, Jayson did his best to hold on but the Mamapoleon's Bide beam sent him tumbling into the water. Balerion had thankfully retrieved him quickly, he was cold but he'd warm up soon thanks to the fire type. According to Gendra, they'd lost the mother Empoleon and the young Piplup were last seen skidding across the sea on a chunk of ice, back towards the mainland. Jayson cursed under his breath, he would have liked to adopt one of the now orphaned penguins. He'd blown his chance at that though and it seemed all he had come out of the encounter with was an evolution, some battle experience and some soaked clothes. He recalled Ymir into his Pokeball, the Aurorus had done his part to perfection, Jayson was incredibly proud of the Aurorus's efforts. Jayson scrambled out of Balerion's claws and onto the shiny Charizard's back. Gendra explained that they still had time to check the storm out, which pleased Jayson. Sure his head was still ringing like a bell, but the whole reason he came out here was that he wanted to know what was causing the storm. <br />
<br />
'I'm fine Gendra, we can't afford to waste more time&quot;, Jayson spoke confidently but he knew he'd likely collapse by the time they got back to the ship. &quot;Lead the way.&quot;</span></div>

You choose to ignore both the cute little arachnid as well as the men and their ominous conversation, more concerned with figuring out why you're suddenly in a hyper-realistic recreation of ancient Greca. Passing the reflecting pool, you make your way up the many steps to the temple landing, which srawled to either side of you, the roof above you held up by numerous, massive marble columns. The heavy, wooden double-doors to the temple are open, and you can both glimpse and hear people moving about inside. Entering the holy structure, you find the interior lit by many torches. The air is acrid with the smell of burning materials; not only the torches, but also incense, as well as a lingering smell of something familiar yet nor immediately recognizable. The floor is a colorful mosaic of many different types of marble, as are much of the walls. Offerings abound; things like vases, food, coinage, weapons, and jewelry litter the floor around an altar near the back of the building, the surplus spilling over to gather along the edges of the walls. A priest stands by the altar, while a woman on her knees sets a lacquerware bowl of berries on the ground while saying a prayer. She makes a gesture with her hands before standing, and ask she makes her way out of the temple past you, she fixes you with a weird look. You <i>do</i> sort of stand out...<br />
<br />
Approaching the altar -- and the only other human now left in the building -- it suddenly dawns on you what the colorful, backsplash of the altar is: the marble tiles are arranged in such a way that they form the image of a bright blue, bird-like creature with a long and flowing tail. On the altar slab there is an effigy of a woman carved from marble as well, her hair tied up in a ponytail that mirrors the tail of the bird portrayed behind her. Under one sandalled foot, she appears to be crushing something relatively large and arthropodic in nature, but you can't quite get a good look at it, because before the statue, also on the altar slab, is a large hunk of something blackened. Suddenly, you know what the unplaceable smell is -- charred meat. It seems a sacrifice took place here, recently.<br />
<br />
As you stand there in front of the altar, surrounded by peoples' offerings, the priest looks at you a little expectantly, though he doesn't speak. Perhaps he is expecting you to do what everyone else who comes to a temple does: pray, and leave a offering. Then again, you're not a part of this, and you don't even know who this temple is honoring. Plus, you're on a mission to find out where you are and what's going on.<br />

Shrugging off the glances and after getting directions you enter the Library, taking in the majesty of the building itself as wel as the statues, in way better condition than they could possibly be in any museum. You bring your Chatot back out along with your Rotomdex to keep you company in the strange land as you explore the building. Taking notice of some kind of disturbance you decide to go investigate where most of the other denizens would ignore it. As you get close you hear a voice before you actually see what is going one. It sounds like a young man, who is getting increasingly frustrated by something with lots of &quot;Oh come on!&quot;s and plenty of &quot;Get back here!&quot;s. You squeeze around a pair of Golett transporting a comically large bag of scrolls to find a young Egyian teen, no older than 16. He is panting and holding one of his fingers which, while not bleeding, has very obvious bite marks. He seems to be trying to corner a pokemon which is running around and tearing into different scrolls and chewing on them with apparent glee. A quick glance at it and Sprocket easily identifies it as a Trapinch. It looks over to you which seems to gain the young boy's attention which the Trapinch quickly abuses to run off to another section of the library. &quot;No wai- auugh.&quot; The young man groans before turning to face you completely. &quot;Almost had him that time.&quot; He seems to recognize you and then notice your Chatot contentedly perched on your shoulder. &quot;Oh! Hello ma'am. Pardon my behavior I have been trying to catch that papyrus glutton for a week now.&quot; He scratches his head. &quot;You are one of those outsiders that use the little balls to tame the Pokemon yes? Perhaps you could help? I have none of my own and driving that one out has proven difficult. He isn't a nuisance enough for any of the adults to take notice as he only eats the blank ones but I am tired of his presence.&quot; The boy looks somewhat embarrassed that he wasn't able to take care of it himself. Will you help the lad?

Moving into the Library, Mint clearly hears the voice of a young boy in the back, clearly chasing some object of frustration given the sharp tone behind his words of choice. Squeezing herself between two Golett carrying bags of scrolls at least 5 times their size, Mint followed the sounds to see the young man, clearly a local by his attire, having just cornered some manner of Pokémon that had some scrolls in its sharp, jagged mouth, to Mint’s horror. Mint felt like it was familiar, but wasn’t sure of what exactly it was.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Sprocket, can I get an I.D. on that Pokémon?” Mint asked.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Sure thing!” Sprocket chirped, before scanning the creature from his current post. “Trapinch, the Ant Pit Pokémon. It buildzzzz nests that double as trapzzzz, lying in wait for its prey to get caught. When night fallzzzz, it digzzzz itself a spot beneath the sand to sleep.” he reported moments later. Unfortunately, this exchange caught the attention of both the Pokémon and the Egyan boy, and the momentary distraction was enough for the Trapinch to escape with the, mercifully blank as she now saw, sheets of papyrus still in its mouth. The young man groaned in frustration, turning to Mint. He seemed angry for but a moment before recognizing Mint’s attire (and companions, to boot).<br />
<br />
<br />
“You are one of those outsiders that use the little balls to tame the Pokemon yes? Perhaps you could help? I have none of my own and driving that one out has proven difficult. He isn't a nuisance enough for any of the adults to take notice as he only eats the blank ones but I am tired of his presence.” he said, to which Mint responded with an immediate nod and a small smile of relief.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Indeed I am. Where I come from, they call us Trainers. I was sent here to research the Library’s contents, specifically legends about the formation of the world and other topics concerning legendary Pokémon. As such, I will gladly help you take care of that papyrus-eater before he eats any of the more important scrolls!” she added, before bringing out one of her Poké Balls to release its inhabitant, her trusty Hitmontop.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Top?” Pastinha muttered, looking around at the strange surroundings. <br />
<br />
<br />
“No time, buddy. We have a Trapinch to track down, are you up for it?” Mint asked.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Top, Top!” Pastinha replied, saluting. <br />
<br />
<br />
“Alright, uh...You’ll have to tell me your name, but even though I saw where this thing ran off, you know this place more than I do. Could you help me navigate around so I can corner it?” Mint asked the boy beside her.</span></div>

You choose to ignore both the cute little arachnid as well as the men and their ominous conversation, more concerned with figuring out why you're suddenly in a hyper-realistic recreation of ancient Greca. Passing the reflecting pool, you make your way up the many steps to the temple landing, which srawled to either side of you, the roof above you held up by numerous, massive marble columns. The heavy, wooden double-doors to the temple are open, and you can both glimpse and hear people moving about inside. Entering the holy structure, you find the interior lit by many torches. The air is acrid with the smell of burning materials; not only the torches, but also incense, as well as a lingering smell of something familiar yet nor immediately recognizable. The floor is a colorful mosaic of many different types of marble, as are much of the walls. Offerings abound; things like vases, food, coinage, weapons, and jewelry litter the floor around an altar near the back of the building, the surplus spilling over to gather along the edges of the walls. A priest stands by the altar, while a woman on her knees sets a lacquerware bowl of berries on the ground while saying a prayer. She makes a gesture with her hands before standing, and ask she makes her way out of the temple past you, she fixes you with a weird look. You <i>do</i> sort of stand out...<br />
<br />
Approaching the altar -- and the only other human now left in the building -- it suddenly dawns on you what the colorful, backsplash of the altar is: the marble tiles are arranged in such a way that they form the image of a bright blue, bird-like creature with a long and flowing tail. On the altar slab there is an effigy of a woman carved from marble as well, her hair tied up in a ponytail that mirrors the tail of the bird portrayed behind her. Under one sandalled foot, she appears to be crushing something relatively large and arthropodic in nature, but you can't quite get a good look at it, because before the statue, also on the altar slab, is a large hunk of something blackened. Suddenly, you know what the unplaceable smell is -- charred meat. It seems a sacrifice took place here, recently.<br />
<br />
As you stand there in front of the altar, surrounded by peoples' offerings, the priest looks at you a little expectantly, though he doesn't speak. Perhaps he is expecting you to do what everyone else who comes to a temple does: pray, and leave a offering. Then again, you're not a part of this, and you don't even know who this temple is honoring. Plus, you're on a mission to find out where you are and what's going on.<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: springgreen">Passing by the reflecting pool and the Dewpider within, Rory and Xigua made their way to the temple, and reminded the teen of why he wasn't the biggest fan of stairs. By the time he had scaled the steps he had to pause for a moment to let the aches out of his limbs, giving his legs a weary shake, before gazing upon the temple entrance in greater detail. Massive marble columns holding up an impressive roof, and two hefty wooden doors opened into the foyer, lit by many torches and hustle and bustle. He tugged at his shirt as the Wimpod poked at his leg, which was trembling. &quot;Xig, I don't think we're in Kanto...or New Fizz, for that matter...&quot; he murmured as he slowly entered the temple. The stench of burning prominently featured, not just from the torches and incense, but something else...<br />
<br />
The main feature with the temple was doubtlessly the altar, surrounded by all sorts of things. Food, vases, currency of some sort, jewellery...weaponry. He had to double check. Yes, those were <i>swords</i>...the priest standing by the altar, likely to make sure none of the other 'actors' pinched anything, the woman praying as she laid a bowl of fruit at the altar. Making a gesture - which seemed a little familiar to Rory - she left the temple, but not before fixing the lad, with his lack of period clothing, an unusual gaze that left him feeling nervous. Looking up at the marbled mosaic, he scrutinised it for just a moment before catching on, the depicted figure somewhat avian in nature with a long, flowing tail. The marble effigy on the altar seemed to be a woman based on the birdlike being, pushing down with one foot on some sort of arthropodic entity, though what it was he couldn't quite tell due to the...oh.<br />
<br />
His stomach didn't turn at the charred meat. As someone who enjoyed the great outdoors, he had frequently had his pokemon assist in hunting wild game, and he knew what it meant to make sacrifices. Xigua peered up at the statue of the woman with some confusion, then gave a low squeak. It gave him the creeps, kinda. The priest looked at Rory expectantly, as the teen rubbed his head sheepishly. He did notice, but was a little distracted by the sights. Turning his head down to the Wimpod, he looked at the charred meat and the statue before shifting his weight to reach his bag. &quot;Xig, you think we should give them something?&quot; he addressed the bug type, who responded with a small nod, as much of a nod as the isopod could muster at least. Ruffling around, he eventually withdrew two objects from the satchel: a <a href="http://forums.upnetwork.net/showpost.php?p=778129&amp;postcount=5" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.upnetwork.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D778129%26postcount%3D5&amp;hash=a3c147ecb425c971e0c912322e8200eb" rel="nofollow noopener">chilly rock</a> that seemed to keep things cool around it, to go with the blue bird in the mosaic, and a <a href="http://forums.upnetwork.net/showpost.php?p=396859&amp;postcount=12" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.upnetwork.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D396859%26postcount%3D12&amp;hash=8855d965fb559f1a108091c6dbf16b0b" rel="nofollow noopener">single blooming flower</a> that remained in perpetual bloom, seated within a small pot, that represented growth and fertility. He carefully laid them onto the altar, staring at the statue as he did so, before pausing, scratching his head, and turning to the priest nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ehehe...I'm a bit lost here and don't really know the customs, but where are we and who's that girl?&quot; he asked, gesturing to the statue as Xigua skittered around his legs, equally curious.</span></div>

Somewhat downtrodden that you came out of this slight detour without the prize of the shard from the Sharpedo or a young Piplup to join your party, you are reinvigorated, however slightly considering your pounding head and tiredness, by the fact you will still have time to finish your scouting mission. You climb back onto your shiny Charizard and take back off towards the west. Fairly soon after the overcast night sky gets darker as the clouds get thicker and blacker. The slightly misty air turns into a drizzle, and then into a fairly heavy rain. Balerion is not exactly happy about the weather but it does not hamper him much as a fully grown pokemon. Your vision isn't the best in all this darkness but Gendra soon shouts out, &quot;There it is!&quot; The girl affixes some goggles over her eyes, which you didn't think had been invented yet but here she was with a pair. And sure enough, even with your vision impaired, you can see a pillar of jet black clouds reaching from the sky into the ocean. You can also tell that the water around it is churning similarly to the sharpedo swarm with what must be over a thousand pokemon given the area and how far back you are. A few of the other scouts are obviously nervous but Gendra calls out reassure everyone. &quot;Ok you lot! It looks like there's a line of Pelipper or something hovering about a third of the way up!&quot; She yells over the rain and sure enough, you can see several yellow blue shapes flying around the cloud vortex. &quot;If we stay above them we should be able to cut through the clouds and see our beastie!&quot; The group all agrees and you maintain your height as you close in on the vortex. As you get close you can see that it is nearly a quarter-mile wide and the wind and rain is incredibly heavy that even Gendra's Talonflame is having trouble maintaining altitude. But you cut into the vortex as a group and surprisingly the storm lightens up. &quot;This is the eye of the storm and our beast is right below. Let's take a look.&quot; Gendra orders and you all head down. Gendra gasps as she spots it first with her goggles and experienced eyesight, but you see it soon after and sit there in awe.<br />
<br />
You have an above average in size Gyarados, but Jormungand would look like a garden snake next to this beast. You see an absolutely massive pokemon, a Gyarados that is easily twice the size of a wailord. You can tell this because there is a wailord swimming right there next to it. And even odder with a closer look it looks off, Jormungand is long and windy and serpent-like but this gyarados is more of a straight line, with a bulky upper half and two long fins, along with red markings on its sides and black scales along its bottom. This Gyarados is fully and completely Mega-Evolved. Luckily it seems that both pokemon seem to be asleep, or at the very least resting. However, you can tell even as you hover in place that it is still heading at a decent pace towards the east. And you can imagine the pace would pick up considerably once it wakes up. Gendra for the first time since meeting her seems less jovial and she signals to immediately retreat. You cut back out of the vortex and quickly make your way back towards the boat. The flight is quick and surprisingly quiet. You find your way back to the boat which is much closer than when you land. The rest of the scouts land beside you and Gendra walks over to you. &quot;I'm gonna tell Owen what we saw. You get some rest. Oh but take this.&quot; She hands what looks to be a crudely made pokeball made from a brown apricorn and some kind of brown feathers from a pokemon affixed to the top. &quot;With this, I count you as one of the scouts. I don't know if after this we'll see each other again but if you need anything and you're in the area I'll do what I can.&quot; She nods and reaffixes her goggles to the top of her head before heading off to give her report. It doesn't seem like anyone is picky about assigned beds so you quickly find a place and immediately crash.<br />
<br />

You wake up to the sound of a thunder crash and heading back above deck you find the two pokemon you left, Sigurd and Thor, both looking satisfied, but also standing in the rain next to Owen, Seebor, and Gendra. Owen looks you over. &quot;Hope you are rested. We've nearly caught up to to the gyarados. We're about an hour out, it made a lot of progress during the day while we rested.&quot; He explains. &quot;From what Gendra told me I'm inclined to go with the plan your Gallade thought up. He suggested we sail around and hit it from the south. We can't take it down here on the open ocean but, if we can drive it north to miss the port we can wait till it makes landfall and fight it on actual ground. The problem is getting through the mob of riled up pokemon and getting it to head northeast rather than east.&quot; He says. &quot;If you have any insight it'd be more than welcome.&quot; <b>How will you reply?</b></span><br />

&quot;Oh thank you thank you!&quot; The teenager replies. &quot;R-right name. My name is Masud. And I will definitely escort you. That's technically part of my job anyway to help the foreigners get to where they need to go in the library.&quot; He says as you begin to head after the small ground pokemon. &quot;As for legendary pokemon, we have some scriptures about them but I don't know if we have much about what you are looking for. The 'trainers' I have talked to are always looking to see if they kind find <i>where</i> the legendary pokemon are. But we only really have the stories and legends about them.&quot; He gives a shrug and a look that seems to hope you aren't disappointed. You decide to call on your hitmontop to provide an extra pair of eyes in your search for the Trapinch. As you make your way through the library Masud seems to be admiring your Hitmontop. &quot;Wow, you sure have quite a few different pokemon. Most of the tamers around here are only able to train one kind like mareep or ponyta.&quot; He comments as Pastinha lets out an interrupting &quot;Top!&quot; and points over to the left. The Trapinch kind of snickers and runs between the legs of a burlier looking adult man in modern attire. &quot;What the-&quot; He lets out and turns to face your group that was chasing the little guy. &quot;Sorry buds, can't let you through this way. I was hired to keep people out while some repairs are going on.&quot; Masud looks down dejectedly. &quot;Dang it. We almost had him.&quot; The man looks him over and looks up at your fairly impressive hitmontop. &quot;Alright, I'll tell you what. I know what its like to pine after a wild pokemon. I remember being a young trainer. If you and your hitmontop put up a good fight I'll... be busy tying my shoes while you guys go looking for it.&quot; He says and sends out a battle prepped Anorith. <b>Will you accept the challenge?</b></span></div>

Somewhat downtrodden that you came out of this slight detour without the prize of the shard from the Sharpedo or a young Piplup to join your party, you are reinvigorated, however slightly considering your pounding head and tiredness, by the fact you will still have time to finish your scouting mission. You climb back onto your shiny Charizard and take back off towards the west. Fairly soon after the overcast night sky gets darker as the clouds get thicker and blacker. The slightly misty air turns into a drizzle, and then into a fairly heavy rain. Balerion is not exactly happy about the weather but it does not hamper him much as a fully grown pokemon. Your vision isn't the best in all this darkness but Gendra soon shouts out, &quot;There it is!&quot; The girl affixes some goggles over her eyes, which you didn't think had been invented yet but here she was with a pair. And sure enough, even with your vision impaired, you can see a pillar of jet black clouds reaching from the sky into the ocean. You can also tell that the water around it is churning similarly to the sharpedo swarm with what must be over a thousand pokemon given the area and how far back you are. A few of the other scouts are obviously nervous but Gendra calls out reassure everyone. &quot;Ok you lot! It looks like there's a line of Pelipper or something hovering about a third of the way up!&quot; She yells over the rain and sure enough, you can see several yellow blue shapes flying around the cloud vortex. &quot;If we stay above them we should be able to cut through the clouds and see our beastie!&quot; The group all agrees and you maintain your height as you close in on the vortex. As you get close you can see that it is nearly a quarter-mile wide and the wind and rain is incredibly heavy that even Gendra's Talonflame is having trouble maintaining altitude. But you cut into the vortex as a group and surprisingly the storm lightens up. &quot;This is the eye of the storm and our beast is right below. Let's take a look.&quot; Gendra orders and you all head down. Gendra gasps as she spots it first with her goggles and experienced eyesight, but you see it soon after and sit there in awe.<br />
<br />
You have an above average in size Gyarados, but Jormungand would look like a garden snake next to this beast. You see an absolutely massive pokemon, a Gyarados that is easily twice the size of a wailord. You can tell this because there is a wailord swimming right there next to it. And even odder with a closer look it looks off, Jormungand is long and windy and serpent-like but this gyarados is more of a straight line, with a bulky upper half and two long fins, along with red markings on its sides and black scales along its bottom. This Gyarados is fully and completely Mega-Evolved. Luckily it seems that both pokemon seem to be asleep, or at the very least resting. However, you can tell even as you hover in place that it is still heading at a decent pace towards the east. And you can imagine the pace would pick up considerably once it wakes up. Gendra for the first time since meeting her seems less jovial and she signals to immediately retreat. You cut back out of the vortex and quickly make your way back towards the boat. The flight is quick and surprisingly quiet. You find your way back to the boat which is much closer than when you land. The rest of the scouts land beside you and Gendra walks over to you. &quot;I'm gonna tell Owen what we saw. You get some rest. Oh but take this.&quot; She hands what looks to be a crudely made pokeball made from a brown apricorn and some kind of brown feathers from a pokemon affixed to the top. &quot;With this, I count you as one of the scouts. I don't know if after this we'll see each other again but if you need anything and you're in the area I'll do what I can.&quot; She nods and reaffixes her goggles to the top of her head before heading off to give her report. It doesn't seem like anyone is picky about assigned beds so you quickly find a place and immediately crash.<br />
<br />

You wake up to the sound of a thunder crash and heading back above deck you find the two pokemon you left, Sigurd and Thor, both looking satisfied, but also standing in the rain next to Owen, Seebor, and Gendra. Owen looks you over. &quot;Hope you are rested. We've nearly caught up to to the gyarados. We're about an hour out, it made a lot of progress during the day while we rested.&quot; He explains. &quot;From what Gendra told me I'm inclined to go with the plan your Gallade thought up. He suggested we sail around and hit it from the south. We can't take it down here on the open ocean but, if we can drive it north to miss the port we can wait till it makes landfall and fight it on actual ground. The problem is getting through the mob of riled up pokemon and getting it to head northeast rather than east.&quot; He says. &quot;If you have any insight it'd be more than welcome.&quot; <b>How will you reply?</b></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: #4da6ff">Jayson marvelled at the sight of the storm but the cause of it was something he had no words for. He'd never seen a Pokemon that big, Jormungand was giant among Gyarados but this was something else. To add to their issues, the Gyarados was one of those strange, natural Mega Evolutions, an unrelenting force of nature. They returned to the Skall with their minds desperately trying to think of a way to overcome the tremendous odds. Gendra rewarded him for his efforts as they touched down on the longboat, while she went off to report their discovery, he collapsed into the first bed he saw. <br />
<br />
A night's rest was all Jayson needed, he felt surprisingly refreshed considering what he had endured on yesterday's scouting mission. Woken by the sound of thunder, Jayson rushed up deck to meet with Owen, Seebor and Gendra. Sigurd and Thor were also with them, he hadn't gotten a chance to see them when he got back last night. Owen speaks of a plan Sigurd had came up with, Jayson had to admit it was clever, but he had issues with it. &quot;I agree that our best bet is to force the Gyarados towards the land north of the port. The issue is though that I doubt we will be able to force it that way. If the horde of Pokemon surrounding the storm are anything like the Sharpedo we encountered, we'd stand little chance in a front on assault. Not to mention I doubt we will be able to force the Gyarados back so easily. What I think we can do however, is lure the Gyarados to shore. If it is as ferocious as I think, we should be able to easily provoke it.&quot; Jayson knew the plan he was coming up with was risky, but in his mind it was a far better bet than trying to force the Gyarados back. &quot;We come in from the north east, approaching with the bow facing towards land. We secure any powerful Water Pokemon we have to the front of the boat, we'll need the extra speed or else we'll be over run. We then strike the storm with as much electricity as we can, hopefully that should be enough to get the Gyarados' attention. Once it comes at us we make for land as fast as we can. From the safety of the ship we will do our best to thin the numbers of the swarming wild Pokemon, by staying on the move we should be able to avoid being overwhelmed. Gendra and any others capable of flying will pepper the swarm from above and do their best to keep the Gyarados interested in us.&quot; Jayson gasped for breath, he felt like he'd been talking for hours. &quot;If we are going to go with my plan, then I'm going to need to know what Pokemon we have at our disposal, so that they can be positioned where they are going to be the most useful.&quot; </span></div>

<span style="color: plum"><span style="font-size: 12px"><br />
“We often see the creature scurry under that tree. We think it has some kind of burrow, but no one has had the time to go and thoroughly investigate.” He glanced towards the shrine building. “The priest tried and was attacked by that stupid Kitsune, it took moons for his wounds to properly heal.” He seemed to be lost in thought as he listened to you speak of maybe having to use violence. <br />
<br />
“Considering what it did to that poor man, it would be a blessing from the gods if it was taken care of.” His female companion glanced at you, tilting her head thoughtfully. <br />
<br />
“Maybe you’re what the gods have sent us to answer out prayers. We’ve been praying for something to deal with the trickster Kitsune… and we were starting to give up hope.” A smile formed on her face as she looked at your Shelmet and Meiko, “But the gods are good and just… and it seems like you’re our answer!” She clasped her hands together and frantically bowed. Her male companion began to speak up again. <br />
<br />
“If you somehow stopped the Kitsune… regardless of your means. I’m sure the priest would reward your efforts.” He glanced at his female companion, “We’d love to help… but we’re not exactly trainers.”<br />
<br />
With your new information, you’re able to attack the creature’s home directly. It seemed as though it had been a problem for a while. <i><b>What do you do?</b></i></span></span>

<span style="color: plum">Hemlock listened intently – age had taught him that skill, even if it had brought him no extra patience. If the couple’s word was to be believed, the Zorua was indeed violent, having assaulted the temple’s priest one day. Hemlock frowned – he’d hoped they could avoid confrontation and just reason with the critter, but if it was aggressive, well…<br />
<br />
“I’ll find a way to solve this. By force if necessary.”<br />
<br />
Meiko shook her head, not too keen on the idea, but Kurokaze thought differently. Even trapped to his accursed shell, he had a warrior’s heart beating beneath all that angst, and each battle under his belt brought him closer to freedom!<br />
<br />
<i>Poor thing... I should take the time to tell him how Shelmet evolve one day. But not today.</i><br />
<br />
The elder looked to the distance, to the lone cherry tree up ahead, withered and decaying. Not unlike him…<br />
<br />
<i>The gods granted you a mercy they deny me. You passed away on your feet, while I can neither die nor barely stand. Still, no tree ever offended a god that I’m aware; I’ll take the blame I deserve.</i><br />
<br />
Bowing respectfully as his joints cracked from the motion, Hemlock took his leave and walked towards the ancient, dead tree. Meiko followed, but the pair had to slow their pace to allow Kurokaze to follow, which only further aggravated the over-encumbered Shelmet.<br />
<br />
“Much like Zorua keeps invading human territory, we’re about to invade its own. It’s entitled to fight back, and we should be ready for it Meiko,” he emphasized, well aware of his Furret’s dislike for unnecessary confrontation. “Hopefully we won’t have to. We might be able to shoo it away, or even reason with it. Everyone in that temple hates the fox so much I doubt anyone took the time to actually try out a conversation.”<br />
<br />
He mentally chastised himself for his own hypocrisy. He too wasted no time threatening the kitsune disguised as a human robber – why should other people be any different? But now that he knew the truth, he couldn’t help but feel a smidgen of curiosity about the Zorua’s behaviour. If hunger was the only thing motivating its actions, then it should be relatively easy to solve – but if there was more to this than met the eye, it was worth looking into with care.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: cyan"><i>I wouldn’t get too attached to the fox if I were you.</i></span></span><br />
<span style="color: plum"><br />
Kami’s taunting advice echoed in his head, and sent a chill down the elder’s spine. But deep down, Hemlock also knew how this story was going to end.</span></div>

Owen regards your suggestions thoughtfully. &quot;Hmm, yes you're probably right. A head-on assault like we were initially planning would take a lot more of us out then would be ideal for facing down the beast itself.&quot; You take note of the confidence of this statement, it isn't suicide like you'd assume considering the numbers you thought, just inefficient. You take a moment to wonder how strong these warriors might actually be as Owen continues. &quot;Using the water pokemon should be easily done. Nearly all of us have one and cooperating together our speed should be more than enough to keep us ahead.&quot; He scratches his short red beard. &quot;Seebor, you'll likely want to head that up yeah?&quot; The larger man cracks a grin and nods. &quot;Crog and I will handle it, if you lend us Traign's speed.&quot; Owen returns the nod. &quot;I suppose that makes sense.&quot; He turns to you. &quot;We'd be here till dawn to name off the entire crew and their pokemon, but me, Seebor, and Gendra are the strongest of us and have the most pokemon. Gendra obviously uses her winged pokemon. Seebor fancies himself a dragon tamer, though his closest partner is Crog, the toughest old Feraligatr you'll ever meet. And myself I'm a but more well rounded like yourself. I'll be sending Traign my water pokemon to help pull us but I will be circling to help wherever I'm needed likely. As for the rest of the crew, like I told your Gallade most of them have a Machoke to row and a water pokemon in case the ship goes down. But the rest are kind of diverse, but we'll send any with electric types to antagonize the thing and the rest will take on the swarm.&quot; He takes a breath as well. &quot;We should be getting close enough any moment now. Any last minute details or things you wanna contribute before it's too late?&quot;</span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: #4da6ff">It seemed as though Jayson's plan was going ahead. Owen provided him with some information about the Pokemon at his disposal, Jayson was beginning to think they might just stand a chance. They'd need to be coordinated if they were to stand any chance of making it to land, let alone overcoming the colossal Mega Gyarados. &quot;Sigurd I want you to begin to <b>Calm </b>your <b>Mind</b>, I want you boosted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright listen up then because we are going to split into three contingents. All powerful swimmers will go with Seebor and be tied to the bow of the boat. I'll send my Lapras, Argo and my Decidueye, Atalanta to watch over them. Atalanta will do her best to clear away any wild Pokemon and reattach any lines should they be severed.&quot; Jayson released Atalanta from her Pokeball and handed Argo's Pokeball to Seebor. &quot;Atalanta, do your best to keep the wild Pokemon at bay with <b>Leaf Blade </b>arrows, <b>Spirit Shackles </b>might help stop them in their tracks as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gendra will lead the flying squadron, their job will be to keep the Gyarados interested and perhaps more importantly, thin out the horde of crazed wild Pokemon. Balerion will be joining you, as will Sigurd. Sigurd will relay any important information back to me via our telepathic link, that way we should be able to keep things coordinated.&quot; Jayson released the Charizard from its Pokeball. &quot;Balerion same deal as the Sharpedo, use <b>Air Slashes </b>and <b>Dragon Pulses</b>, keep Sigurd safe. Sigurd make use of <b>Magical Leaf </b>and <b>Thunderbolt </b>to press the type advantage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lastly, I'll remain on the boat with Owen and Thor, we'll do our best to protect the Skall and hit the wild Pokemon. Every Machoke capable will be on the oars.&quot; Now it just came to delivering that initial hit to the Gyarados. &quot;When we get into range, Thor will set up an <b>Electric Terrain</b> on the ship, that should boost our Electric type moves considerably. On Owen's call, every Pokemon capable of using a ranged Electric Attack will launch it at the storm.&quot; From Jayson's own team, Thor would use <b>Shock Wave</b>, <b>Sigurd </b>would add a <b>Thunderbolt </b>before heading off on Balerion and Argo would also add a <b>Thunderbolt. </b>Jayson planned to keep Ymir in reserve, the Aurorus was better kept fresh for when they made it to land. <br />
<br />
This was it, the battle was about to start. </span></div>
