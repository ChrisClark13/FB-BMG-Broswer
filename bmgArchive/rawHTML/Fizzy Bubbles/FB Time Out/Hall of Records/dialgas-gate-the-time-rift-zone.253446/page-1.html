The God of Time rages. Its <i>Roar</i>, furious and all-powerful, has ripped open the fabric of time, creating a rift in Fizzytopia where the chronological flow is unstable… Scientists are almost unanimous in their assessment that traversing this breach is highly dangerous, due to the unpredictability of the results - but as with all things forbidden, curiosity can be overpowering…<br />
<br />
The tear is small, almost imperceptible to the naked eye – merely a single point in the outskirts of New Fizz City where reality waves unnaturally, as if one is seeing the landscape ahead through a glass of water. But for those who know how to find it, walking through that rift is like passing a door to a completely different world. One can never know exactly where – or, more importantly, <i>when</i> – they will find themselves, or if another rift will appear to allow them to return, but adventure unfailingly awaits the intrepid explorers every time! All they have to do is hurry, before Dialga calms down once again and the gate is lost…

<span style="color: DarkOrange"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>An ancient land of sand and heat, home to some of the most incredible monuments in human history. The locals are as warm as the weather, inventive and resourceful, devout worshippers of all manner of Pokémon as godly avatars. Temples and shrines are erected in honour of many of these Pokémon, and gargantuan tombs – known as pyramids – are raised in honour of deceased Kings, seen as incarnations of Arceus itself. The current ruler, Osetep I, has already ordered his servants to begin construction on his own pyramid, despite being a healthy man in his early thirties.<br />
<br />
Although the land is dry and scarce in wildlife, human settlements built by the water are bustling with all manner of activities, and some of the more ancient and imposing constructions house formidable secrets and treasures.

The people are welcoming, and much more simple-minded than the scholars and artists of the capital; their concerns are those of mundane life: prosperous agriculture and pleasing the gods. Humans and Pokémon live alongside one another, in mutual respect and understanding – a close relationship that has been somewhat lost in the bigger cities. Travelers will find no shortage of people to help in Heroth, should they be inclined to do so; alternatively, they can visit the local market, where food and trinkets of all sorts can be haggled for – most of it is junk, but sometimes…</span></span>&#8203;</div><div style="margin-left: 20px">&#8203;</div><div style="margin-left: 20px"><span style="color: DarkOrange"><span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Library of Alexia</u></b>: The capital of Egya is home to all sorts of great thinkers and men of politics. The Library of Alexia is home to the ancient world’s single largest collection of scrolls, both in hieroglyphics and hieratic, on all manner of subjects – including writings about the dead, magical arts and all kinds of other strange topics. Writers, philosophers and politicians from all over Egya gather at the Library to discuss new ideas, seek inspiration and ask for advice on matters of state.</span></span>&#8203;</div><div style="margin-left: 20px">&#8203;</div><div style="margin-left: 20px"><span style="color: DarkOrange"><span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>The Great Lighthouse</u></b>: One of the architectural prides of Alexia and a literal beacon of hope to all sailors traversing the open sea to the north of Egya, or even the land’s only river. The Lighthouse - the single tallest building in all of the land - has been casting its light with fire for centuries, but the scarcity of wood in Egya is a long-standing problem, and the capital’s greatest minds have been dedicating their efforts to finding viable alternatives.

The temple is a large building of white stone, filled with offerings at the feet of a massive statue of Basti, and order is kept by the many priests who constantly strive to keep the goddess pleased - often requesting help from outsiders to do so...</span></span>&#8203;</div><div style="margin-left: 20px">&#8203;</div><div style="margin-left: 20px"><span style="color: DarkOrange"><span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>The Pyramid of Tokeb</u></b>: Egya is home to several impressive tombs, but none as large and architectonically perfect as the Pyramid of Tokeb.

<span style="color: springgreen"><i><span style="font-size: 12px">The land of progress, democracy and idealism, the birthplace of philosophy and cradle of modern civilization.

<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><i>They are also a religious people, much like the Egyans, but unlike them, Grecans seem more motivated by fear of the gods rather than admiration.

<br />
Contrary to Egya, Greca places much more worth in the wonders of life than in the moment of death; also, the people’s focus in on sciences and arts much more than in big architectural achievements. As a result, most buildings in Greca are not particularly awe-inspiring or elaborate, but taking time to talk to the locals can reveal some immensely interesting characters.

It is said that pleasing this deity grants success in all life’s endeavours, which unfortunately lures many charlatans and non-believers looking for an easy solution to life’s problems. The path to the temple has a mysterious rock that has been infused with an electric current.

Romman architecture is remarkable in scope and execution, and the whole capital is tailored to indulge the richest members of society. But particularly impressive is the nation’s military prowess, a flawlessly coordinated war machine where Pokémon are as vital (and well-trained) as human warriors, and the pride of all Romma. Combat is both a means of conquest and of entertainment in the ever-expanding empire, and the wealthiest patrons are known to spend considerable amounts of coin in fighting spectacles… (please reply in red)</i></span></span><br />

Politicians and high-ranking military officers come to discuss secret matters away from prying eyes and ears – despite this being a renowned bathhouse, some of the dirtiest secrets in Romma are laid bare in these meetings. Some people are willing to pay extremely well for even a snippet of these private conversations…</span></span>&#8203;</div><div style="margin-left: 20px">&#8203;</div><div style="margin-left: 20px"><span style="color: Red"><span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Circus Solemnus</u></b>: Another aspect in which Romma loves to display its superiority is through the nation’s unparalleled mastery of horsemanship. Races of all kinds are held in the Circus, both chariot and horseback competitions, and the prizes for the victorious riders are comparable to the richest rewards of the Colosseum. Competitors are encouraged to bring their own Pokémon – thus showcasing not only their riding ability, but their raising talents as well – but the Circus has mounts available for those solely interested in racing.</span></span>&#8203;</div><div style="margin-left: 20px">&#8203;</div><div style="margin-left: 20px"><span style="color: Red"><span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Horti Agraminae</u></b>: The largest public garden in all of Romma, located near the Imperial Palace; one of the palace’s balconies oversees the park, from where Darius Agramas occasionally graces visitors with a smile and hand wave. The garden is impeccably maintained at all times, and has a nice balance of grassy open spaces, dense woodland areas and flowery mazes filled with gorgeous topiaries. All kinds of Pokémon are drawn to this pleasant location, and people are encouraged to interact with them, since safety is ensured by the ever-present park watchers.</span></span>&#8203;</div><div style="margin-left: 20px">&#8203;</div><br />

<span style="color: Plum"><i><span style="font-size: 12px">Perhaps no region is as steeped in tradition as Niha, on the eastern side of the world. Its people follow customs as old as the land itself, every single action seen as a tribute to their mighty gods.</span></i><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><i>Nihans are ritualistic in their everyday life, from the way they dress to the way they eat. They uphold the value of honour above all other qualities, and will go to any lengths necessary to ensure they are remembered only for their honourable actions – the severity of any punishment must always equal, if not surpass, that of the misdeed. As a result, Nihans can come across as distant and excessively formal, but their hearts are in the right place.<br />
<br />
Niha is a land where human constructions are scarce and simple, and most buildings are erected to honour the local deities. The vast majority of the region remains claimed by nature, and Nihans have learned to make the most of the land without upsetting this balance. (please reply in plum)</i></span></span><br />

People from all over the land come to pay their respects and make their requests to the goddess by leaving a small tribute. There are no chairs in the Shrine – both the main building and the small pagoda nearby have only a small number of cushions for kneeling prayers, yet this does not dissuade even the oldest of believers.

When they leave, these monks are then recruited to join the Shogun’s army as holy defenders of Niha. Only those with true potential are accepted inside Hiken Tower, but the doors are always open to outsiders looking to get a small taste of Nihan battle training; it is said most give up after three days.</span></span>&#8203;</div><div style="margin-left: 20px">&#8203;</div><div style="margin-left: 20px"><span style="color: Plum"><span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Cherry-Blossom Garden</u></b>: One of many sprawling fields of cherry trees, it is especially beautiful during blooming season – which can last anywhere from five days to one month in Niha. Locals do not maintain this garden as one would a public park; instead, they let nature run its course, and dare not tamper with the trees in any way, as that would be disrespecting the gods who created such natural perfection. Wild Pokémon abound in the garden, having long understood that human interference is minimal, although people are allowed to cross the fields and linger as long as they please. Deep in the garden rests a large boulder covered in moss... it is said to have an interesting effect on certain species of Pokémon. </span></span>&#8203;</div><div style="margin-left: 20px">&#8203;</div><div style="margin-left: 20px"><span style="color: Plum"><span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Rice Fields</u></b>: Most Nihans make a living in the rice fields by the water, working tirelessly to grow this precious grain that feeds the entire nation. It is a physically demanding job, but many locals work well into their elderly years since this is their only source of income. As a result, injuries are frequent, as are infections transmitted by waterborne insects that dwell in the pools where rice grows. Although a paradise for many different Pokemon species, the rice fields can be dangerous to humans, and while there’s always work to be done for any who want to try, it’s also not rare to find workers in need of medical assistance…</span></span>&#8203;</div><div style="margin-left: 20px">&#8203;</div><div style="margin-left: 20px"><span style="color: Plum"><span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Shiro Castle</u></b>: The black stone palace of Shogun Kenzo Kirihara, Niha’s highest military figure and de facto ruler of the nation. A man in his sixties but with strength and skill rumoured to be unparalleled in all the land, he surrounds himself with the finest warrior monks and Pokémon, making Shiro Castle an impenetrable fortress. It is from this castle that the Shogun dictates the laws of Niha, formulates battle plans against any invading forces – of which there are plenty in the current day – and selects the Hiken Tower graduates that will serve under him. To be granted an audience with Kenzo Kirihara is the absolute highest honour in the eyes of any Nihan.</span></span>&#8203;</div><div style="margin-left: 20px">&#8203;</div><br />

This northern peninsula is home to some of the fiercest, most barbaric fighters in the world, whose strength in combat is only matched by their sailing skills.</span></i><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><i>From a very young age, Scandians are taught to handle three things: an axe, a Pokémon and a boat. Both the axe and the Pokémon stay with them their entire lives; boats are plundered, stolen and swapped as the need arises. They spend most of their lives at sea, sailing to any neighbouring lands yet to be explored, waging war with nations they deem worthy, pillaging and putting to the torch all the others.<br />
<br />
Gods, too, are instruments in their warring ways – all of them said to be favoured by glorious combat and conquest. Scandians honour their deities with blood and victory, or valiant death in the face of a stronger foe. As a result, they fear nothing, living only for the thrill of battle, and that makes them all the more dangerous. (please reply in deepskyblue)</i></span></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<div style="margin-left: 20px"><span style="color: DeepSkyBlue"><span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Borg Keep</u></b>: Home to the Jarl of Scandia, Bernhardt Ivarson, a massive fortress of rock and ice that has never been conquered. Riches plundered from other lands are brought here, where the Jarl keeps the lion’s share and divides the remaining spoils between the warriors who claimed the most lives in the raid. Tasks Bernhardt needs taken care of, either within Scandia borders or across the sea, are issued here by the Jarl himself, who isn’t particular about the people he lets inside the Keep so long as they have any worth to him.</span></span>&#8203;</div><div style="margin-left: 20px">&#8203;</div><div style="margin-left: 20px"><span style="color: DeepSkyBlue"><span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Valheim Port</u></b>: The harbour from which every Scandian Warship departs, this is both the meeting point of great warriors and the prime spot for commerce in the entire land. Merchants carry some very interesting goods, both from the frozen grounds of Scandia and exotic goods pillaged from conquered lands that are “unaccounted for” and thus never make it to Borg Keep. There is good money to be made here, and in order to reach the open seas, one must inevitably pass by Valheim Port if they are to board one of the vessels.</span></span>&#8203;</div><div style="margin-left: 20px">&#8203;</div><div style="margin-left: 20px"><span style="color: DeepSkyBlue"><span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>”The Skall” Longship</u></b>: The oldest ship in the Scandian fleet, and most would agree, the best. The Skall has travelled countless miles and reached a hundred different shores. The man who designed it has long since passed, and no other has been able to build a similarly magnificent warship. When a particularly large, profitable raid is in sight, The Skall is inevitably the ship that will make the journey – it carries only the strongest, most reliable of Bernhardt’s men, and being allowed aboard is a great honour.</span></span>&#8203;</div><div style="margin-left: 20px">&#8203;</div><div style="margin-left: 20px"><span style="color: DeepSkyBlue"><span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Helga’s Tavern</u></b>: It’s not that this is the <i>only</i> tavern in Scandia – it’s that Helga smites the competition with the best mead and the best placement: right in front of Valheim Port. Tired warriors come to regain their strengths, drink a glass or seven, and toast to the success of their latest raid. It’s the number one place to pick up some gossip, pick up a fight or pick up work if one’s looking for a quick buck. Scandian warriors aren’t exactly rich, but they always keep something extra for themselves whenever they pillage another region, and might be willing to part with the loot if they need a favour done.</span></span>&#8203;</div><div style="margin-left: 20px">&#8203;</div><div style="margin-left: 20px"><span style="color: DeepSkyBlue"><span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>The Titan’s Horn</u></b>: Scandia is a region of tall, frozen mountains, and the Horn is the biggest of them all. Overlooking the entire coast, a small lookout has been constructed on the very peak, but it is said no soul has ever made it that high up and survived other than the very man who built the lookout. The weather conditions are unforgiving, subzero temperatures and gale-force winds making it impossible for just about any human to survive without exceptional preparation, and only the hardiest Pokémon can endure this extreme climate. Along the mountain's path rests a jagged stone that seems to have been completely frozen in ice. It seems to draw ice type Pokémon towards it.</span></span>&#8203;</div></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><i>A week earlier...</i><br />
<br />
&quot;So, you came, then. I'll admit, I was wondering if a student such as yourself was really springing for this.&quot; A firm, feminine but gravelly voice addressed Mint. Long blonde hair adorned a figure clad entirely in black. No mistaking it, this was Cynthia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn't miss it for the world. So, what's the deal?&quot; Mint asked, Sprocket actually deciding to behave himself for once and listen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well. Recently, Dialga seems to have become enraged. I'm not sure what exactly the cause is, even in my position. Either way, its rage has led to the opening of time rifts across the planet. They're hard to perceive, but if you enter one...you end up in a different time and maybe even a different place entirely, and there's no telling if you can get out, at least under normal circumstances.&quot; Cynthia replied. &quot;Unless...you have one of <i>these</i>.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cynthia held up what appeared to be an ordinary pendant. Hanging from it, however, was a small, rough stone that shone in various colors, as if it were a prism of some kind. Mint gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that-!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A piece of an Adamant Orb, yes. Shards of entire chunks of Dialga's manifested power. A shard like this, when tasked to do so by it's bearer, will at the least relieve them of any time-distorting effects, effectively returning them to their correct place in time-even from within a rift. Bigger shards have been known to close the rifts entirely, but I'm afraid we have none big enough for that task...and for this particular rift, nor would we want one, as we have discovered much of interest within. That said, anything you wish to take back with you <i>must</i> be on your person when you invoke the shard, and anything left behind is as good as gone forever. Return all of your Pokemon to their Balls before returning, and stow them all in your Bag. Your Rotom Dex should stay there as well when you return.&quot; Cynthia explained, her warning at the end sharp and stern.<br />
<br />
&quot;Understood. So...what am I to do while I am there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;People I have had sent in before have reported a variety of locations. Ever since tourists have been entering, however, there is one more we can confirm people having been transported to that we have not had the chance to study. Those who have been there say the locals call it Egya. It is a hot, deserted land, but there are reports of a massive library someplace within it. Your goal is to seek out this Library, and research what you are able. Do not stay overlong, but...the more you can learn about and bring back for us, the better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds easy enough! Anything else I should know before heading over?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing further has been brought to my attention, but be aware that this land is entirely foreign in nature. Be <i>extremely</i> careful with both your own actions, and those of your Pokemon. Should you be in any danger, do not hesitate to invoke the Shard as soon as you are able. Understood?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfectly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Take the pendant, then. You may go.&quot;<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px">The God of Time rages. Its <i>Roar</i>, furious and all-powerful, has ripped open the fabric of time, creating a rift in Fizzytopia where the chronological flow is unstable… Scientists are almost unanimous in their assessment that traversing this breach is highly dangerous, due to the unpredictability of the results - but as with all things forbidden, curiosity can be overpowering…<br />
<br />
The tear is small, almost imperceptible to the naked eye – merely a single point in the outskirts of New Fizz City where reality waves unnaturally, as if one is seeing the landscape ahead through a glass of water. But for those who know how to find it, walking through that rift is like passing a door to a completely different world. One can never know exactly where – or, more importantly, <i>when</i> – they will find themselves, or if another rift will appear to allow them to return, but adventure unfailingly awaits the intrepid explorers every time! All they have to do is hurry, before Dialga calms down once again and the gate is lost…</span><br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 22px"><b>EGYA</b></span>&#8203;</div><span style="color: darkorange"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>An ancient land of sand and heat, home to some of the most incredible monuments in human history. The locals are as warm as the weather, inventive and resourceful, devout worshippers of all manner of Pokémon as godly avatars. Temples and shrines are erected in honour of many of these Pokémon, and gargantuan tombs – known as pyramids – are raised in honour of deceased Kings, seen as incarnations of Arceus itself. The current ruler, Osetep I, has already ordered his servants to begin construction on his own pyramid, despite being a healthy man in his early thirties.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Although the land is dry and scarce in wildlife, human settlements built by the water are bustling with all manner of activities, and some of the more ancient and imposing constructions house formidable secrets and treasures. Explore at your own risk, remember to stay hydrated at all times and be mindful of curses!</i><br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>Town of Heroth:</u></b> A settlement built on the margin of the land’s only river, relatively small in comparison to the bustling cities of Egya. The people are welcoming, and much more simple-minded than the scholars and artists of the capital; their concerns are those of mundane life: prosperous agriculture and pleasing the gods. Humans and Pokémon live alongside one another, in mutual respect and understanding – a close relationship that has been somewhat lost in the bigger cities. Travelers will find no shortage of people to help in Heroth, should they be inclined to do so; alternatively, they can visit the local market, where food and trinkets of all sorts can be haggled for – most of it is junk, but sometimes…<br />
<br />
<b><u>Library of Alexia</u></b>: The capital of Egya is home to all sorts of great thinkers and men of politics. The Library of Alexia is home to the ancient world’s single largest collection of scrolls, both in hieroglyphics and hieratic, on all manner of subjects – including writings about the dead, magical arts and all kinds of other strange topics. Writers, philosophers and politicians from all over Egya gather at the Library to discuss new ideas, seek inspiration and ask for advice on matters of state.<br />
<br />
<b><u>The Great Lighthouse</u></b>: One of the architectural prides of Alexia and a literal beacon of hope to all sailors traversing the open sea to the north of Egya, or even the land’s only river. The Lighthouse - the single tallest building in all of the land - has been casting its light with fire for centuries, but the scarcity of wood in Egya is a long-standing problem, and the capital’s greatest minds have been dedicating their efforts to finding viable alternatives. Because, no matter what, the light cannot go out, for the sake of every sailor making their way into, or out of, Alexia.<br />
<br />
<b><u>The Temple of Basti</u></b>: A place of worship in the heart of Alexia, built by devoted followers of the Feline Goddess. Basti is said to heal and destroy with equal ease; her saving mercy is the wall between Man and the Afterlife as much as her damning anger is the path towards it; it is for this reason that Cat Pokémon are sacred in Egya. The temple is a large building of white stone, filled with offerings at the feet of a massive statue of Basti, and order is kept by the many priests who constantly strive to keep the goddess pleased - often requesting help from outsiders to do so...<br />
<br />
<b><u>The Pyramid of Tokeb</u></b>: Egya is home to several impressive tombs, but none as large and architectonically perfect as the Pyramid of Tokeb. Built in honour of the eponymous King, its construction dates back over a century, and is said to be filled with both unspeakable treasures and infinite, maze-like tunnels that no man has ever walked out from. As such, there is nobody left alive who knows exactly how to traverse the tomb, or what truly lies inside…<br />
<br />
<b><u>The White Sands</u></b>: If one chooses to ignore the settlements, and steps out into the desert, they will find themselves in the seemingly infinite White Sands – a blanket of eroded stone that burns as fiercely during the day as it freezes mercilessly during the night. It is said that the White Sands, having no life of their own, hungrily claim that of all who traverse them – and who knows what else they might have devoured and kept concealed…</span></span>

Oh well, that could hardly be helped. Mint was here on a mission, anyway. Dressed in a breathable outfit that Mint was scarcely comfortable wearing in public, Mint was ready for the desert heat. In addition to her usual supplies, multiple canteens filled with fresh water and copious amounts of sunscreen were loaded in Mint's pack (and some already applied, to boot), as well as a few spare sets of clothes. Despite it all, her six teammates' Poke Balls and more of those besides were all snugly tucked in the pack. Sprocket, for his part, was simply occupying another, smaller pocket. Celeste kept her usual perch atop Mint's shoulder, but the others were all tucked up in their Balls for the time being.<br />
<br />
The officer that greeted Mint simply nodded to Celeste and waved the Trainer through. Before Mint approached the rippling distortion, though, she turned to Celeste.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should go in your Ball, just to be safe. Wouldn't want to get separated.&quot; Mint said, fishing Celeste's Ball from her pack and returning the Chatot for the time being before she could begin to whine. Tucking the Ball back in its place, Mint took a deep breath and stepped forward.<br />
<br />
The distortion emanated an odd feeling, as if the flow of time within it was tangled into a knot. And yet, it also felt like a scar, a wound sustained by reality itself. Steeling herself, Mint extended a hand to the distortion...and in an instant, the young woman seemed to be gone entirely, spirited away to another place...<br />
<br />
Mint fell for what felt like both a split second and an eternity, and landed facefirst in...sand. Well, better than falling facefirst onto solid rock, at the least. And it did feel very hot all of the sudden...Mint blessed her father's Hoennese heritage, as it would hopefully give her a little endurance to the heat. Arceus knew her Sinnovan side and upbringing wouldn't. Getting herself up, she wiped sand off her face and hands and front in general, and looked around. This was likely Egya, but...where exactly within it? Remembering her task, she set out to find someone who could direct her to the Library that was supposedly here, but with her luck, it would be a long and grueling venture.</span>&#8203;</div></div>

A single settlement of fishermen exists here, and everyone lives blissfully unaware of the political commotion of mainland Greca. Life here is simple and straightforward, sun and sea abound, and the most trouble one might run into is a bad day for fishing or a wild Pokémon causing a bit of ruckus.</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: #00ff80">Gary shielded his eyes from the sunlight as the sun shone brightly overhead. He had just gotten off the ferry that arrived at the Isle of Cabrys’ harbor. Ever since he had planned this trip, Gary had been counting down the days on his calendar. Always one for exploring new places, Gary jumped at the opportunity when he heard about this mysterious rift in dimensions on the outskirts of New Fizz City. Throwing caution into the wind about talks of what is physically possible, Gary’s desire to see an ancient civilization with his own two eyes was too much to pass up.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now that he was finally here, Gary began to look around the port of Cabrys. He had heard this was a big fishing town, and as obsessive over his water Pokemon research that he was, there was no way he could miss the chance to observe some ancient water Pokemon firsthand. He was well aware that by leaving the twins Rina and Rain back in the Cloud Garden might result in some kind of retaliation by the young pranksters when he returned, but that was a risk he was willing to take.<br />
<br />
<br />
As he looked up and down the port, Gary hoped to find something that might catch his eye; maybe some kind of tour guide or local fishermen to clue him in on a good place to explore the local monuments and wildlife. Whatever it may be, Gary was prepared to take on his next adventure with his team of Pokemon.</span></div>

Its people follow customs as old as the land itself, every single action seen as a tribute to their mighty gods.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Nihans are ritualistic in their everyday life, from the way they dress to the way they eat. They uphold the value of honour above all other qualities, and will go to any lengths necessary to ensure they are remembered only for their honourable actions – the severity of any punishment must always equal, if not surpass, that of the misdeed. As a result, Nihans can come across as distant and excessively formal, but their hearts are in the right place.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Niha is a land where human constructions are scarce and simple, and most buildings are erected to honour the local deities. The vast majority of the region remains claimed by nature, and Nihans have learned to make the most of the land without upsetting this balance. (please reply in plum)</i><br />

<b><u>Cherry-Blossom Garden</u></b>: One of many sprawling fields of cherry trees, it is especially beautiful during blooming season – which can last anywhere from five days to one month in Niha. Locals do not maintain this garden as one would a public park; instead, they let nature run its course, and dare not tamper with the trees in any way, as that would be disrespecting the gods who created such natural perfection. Wild Pokémon abound in the garden, having long understood that human interference is minimal, although people are allowed to cross the fields and linger as long as they please.</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: #cc99ff">&quot;I don't like this.&quot; Murmured Isaac. He was staring into a tear, an expansive rip into the fabric of time and space as he knew it. Isaac was not necessarily a religious man, sure he had been raised by a Christian family but thanks to his somewhat recent abhorrent behavior he found it extremely difficult to even get behind the concept of religion. He was sure if his mom knew what he had done in the last few years of his life he'd get some stupidly long lecture about how he was going to burn in hell for the rest of his life. Frankly, the concept seemed ridiculous. He'd burn in hell for smoking weed, he'd burn in hell for being gay, what the hell could he do that this so called god would like? He sighed and shook his head, starring at the rift once again. He knew that this lead... somewhere, some time, it was all a big mystery. If he messed up anything even slightly within this portal he could completely fuck up the present, and he wasn't exactly sure that was a risk he wanted to take. Still, the thought of ending up somewhere fantastic was alluring. Hell, he had been down on ideas lately, maybe entering this stupid rift would give him inspiration for his new album.<br />
<br />
He glanced down at the ground, it was weird not seeing Vinny following him. However, despite knowing very little about the inner workings of this wormhole junk, he knew that it was probably quite easy to get separated if too many people went in at the same time. As such, she was tucked nicely in her Pokeball --- ensuring that she and Isaac's Pokemon would arrive safely with him... rather than separated from him. He glanced backwards once more, somewhat fearfully. He felt like this thing should be far more guarded, if it was really as dangerous and forbidden as some people had made it out to be. He shrugged to himself, tentatively extending his hand. <br />
<br />
It was fast, much faster than he was expecting. His whole body was forcibly sucked into the wormhole, it was like it yearned for him --- it tugged him inside forcibly. The wormhole itself was like nothing he had ever experience, it tugged at him strongly, pulling him apart and putting him back together almost as fast as it could. He felt nothing, yet he felt everything at the same time. He fell for what felt like an eternity, yet it was over in seconds. He fell fast and hard, being spat out finally in a field of pink.<br />
<br />
At first, Isaac thought he was dazed... but what loomed in front of him was nothing short of perfection. Rows upon rows of beautifully ornate cherry blossom trees greeted him, it appeared as though it was nature's own playground. He looked around rapidly, realizing very quickly that he had no idea where he was... nor did he know how he would eventually get back to Fizzytopia. He felt his heartbeat quicken, why hadn't he thought of his sooner? He could actually end up being stuck here for the rest of his life and the thought just occurred to him <i>now</i>? He wanted to scream, but at the same time he found himself enchanted in a way that he had not felt in a long time. It was beautiful here. Maybe he should take a break for once, not think about anything and just hang out here for awhile.<br />
<br />
He sighed calmly, hoping to make himself feel at least somewhat better. He reached into his bag and pulled out a small black luxury ball, producing a small Eevee who's face was dotted in more freckles than you could count on two hands. She immediately looked stunned upon seeing the beautiful blossoms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vee...&quot; She marveled, walking forward slightly to take it all in. Isaac chuckled to himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Ahri, I don't know where we are... nor do I know, uh, when we are. But, isn't it beautiful?&quot; Asked Isaac, which caused the bright eyed young Eevee to nod vigorously. Isaac glanced around once more, it had been a long time since he had been somewhere that he would actually consider as a vacation spot. Perhaps it really was time to take a load off. With Ahri in tow, the two wandered the expansive fields, taking in the breathtaking pink trees.</span></span></div>

This is the ultimate arena, built from the ground-up with a single purpose: glorious combat in its purest form. The strongest combatants from around the world – Pokémon and human alike – long to fight in the Colosseum, hoping to showcase their skills in front of Darius Agramas himself.</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: RED">Ah, New Fizz City. A bustling metropolis, attracting all manner of people for all manner of reasons. It was about damn time Keith Masters's travels took him there...<br />
<br />
...except he wasn't headed there, per se. No, he was headed to an oddly specific point on the outskirts. And, if the sight happening there right now was any indicator, this was very much against the better judgement of a certain Normal-type.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, no, no, no, no, NO!&quot; Meowth was exclaiming, actually trying to hold Keith back as he walked onward. Of course, the most Meowth could do was grab one of Keith's pants legs and try and stop him. The operative word there being &quot;try&quot;, of course- Meowth wasn't making any progress whatsoever here. &quot;Is youse crazy?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith shrugged. &quot;That's entirely possible,&quot; he responded. &quot;There it is, Meowth,&quot; he added, coming to a stop voluntarily. Meowth looked- they were right before a spot where... it almost looked as though they were viewing the landscape beyond through a tall glass of water. Their view was rippling oddly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Dere it is,&quot; Meowth replied shortly. &quot;Alright, we seen it, now let's go home, yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I don't think so,&quot; Keith shook his head. &quot;We're going in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;O' course we's goin' in,&quot; groaned Meowth. &quot;Sure. Why not? It ain't like we's in danger o' gettin' stuck in some random point in time or nuttin'...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, if you don't want to see what happens, I can always return you to your Poké Ball,&quot; Keith offered, unclipping the seldom-seen sphere from his belt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope!&quot; Meowth replied at once, climbing up onto Keith's shoulder. Keith chuckled- he knew Meowth's disdain for his Poké Ball would win out over his fear of this time rift. Saying no more, Keith took a deep breath, took a few steps forward...<br />
<br />
...and the outskirts of New Fizz City were no longer their surroundings. Remarkable feats of architecture were all around them, though one in particular stood out to Keith- a large circular structure. A colosseum. The Colosseum.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, then,&quot; Keith said to Meowth. &quot;Now that looks like a place where a guy can have a good Pokémon battle. Let's check that out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose it'd be too late ta tell youse I still tink dis is a stupid idea?&quot; sighed Meowth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we're here already,&quot; stated Keith. &quot;That ship has sailed, hit an iceberg, sank, and had a movie made about it. We're already here, might as well see what we can see. Let's go, Meowth.&quot; And with that, Keith started off towards the Colosseum. Meowth rolled his eyes, but couldn't help but also give a small smile as well. Keith's thirst for adventure tended to get them into crazy situations, but he had to admit, never anything they couldn't get themselves out of alive and in one piece.<br />
<br />
He only hoped that trend would continue here.</span></div>

Its people follow customs as old as the land itself, every single action seen as a tribute to their mighty gods.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Nihans are ritualistic in their everyday life, from the way they dress to the way they eat. They uphold the value of honour above all other qualities, and will go to any lengths necessary to ensure they are remembered only for their honourable actions – the severity of any punishment must always equal, if not surpass, that of the misdeed. As a result, Nihans can come across as distant and excessively formal, but their hearts are in the right place.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Niha is a land where human constructions are scarce and simple, and most buildings are erected to honour the local deities. The vast majority of the region remains claimed by nature, and Nihans have learned to make the most of the land without upsetting this balance.</i><br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>Megami Shrine:</u></b> Atop a small, isolated hill is a shrine dedicated to Megami, the goddess of many faces, mother to humans and Pokémon according to Nihan belief. People from all over the land come to pay their respects and make their requests to the goddess by leaving a small tribute. There are no chairs in the Shrine – both the main building and the small pagoda nearby have only a small number of cushions for kneeling prayers, yet this does not dissuade even the oldest of believers. Some say that there have been attempts at stealing the faithful’s donations…</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: plum">“A-are you sure about this Glitch?”<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'">“Do not look at me. I only shared with you the recent news and rumors I found online.”</span><br />
<br />
Mélina groaned in indecisiveness. “I know that satisfaction brought back the dead curious Skitty, but I’m not even a cat! I just want to know if that thing’s safe or not.”<br />
<br />
The trainer stood there on the grass, just on the edge of New Fizz City where she mostly stayed through her first Pokémon training year. Nothing seemed to be out of place at first glance, but if you looked closer, an area in the air seemed mysteriously warped, like those water mirages in the desert, but which you can only see up close instead of afar in glaring sun. The only thing glaring now though was the woman’s eyes to her Porygon, tucked away in the coding of the text-to-speech app of her cellphone, as usual.<br />
<br />
“If it wasn’t for the fact that I’m actually seeing a ‘time rift’, I would swore that you would be bullshitting me and that you have surfed way too much on crossover/alternate universe fanfiction websites lately. Or conspiracy theories.”<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'">“Oh come on,”</span> Glitch wished it could emulate its exasperation in the voice, <span style="font-family: 'Courier New'">“you know that I am better than that.”</span><br />
<br />
The trainer sighed, then went back to the main subject. “So you’re saying those things were made by <i>the</i> Dialga, of Sinnoh myths, who’s supposedly enraged at the moment and somehow made “time warps” or whatever they’re calling them, right here?”<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'">“Yup. I have read that you can go in them, likely to be transported in some other time, like the past or future or something. Nothing about people coming back though.” </span>It was able to see through the frontward camera its trainer’s eyebrow lifting in worry. <span style="font-family: 'Courier New'">“Most likely because the news are so fresh off the press. It is only been a couple of days since the first reports, after all.”</span><br />
<br />
Mélina sighed again. “And you want us - me - jump into a random one because…?”<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'">“For science for course! Well, curiosity too, but for science. Also: for excellent blogging.”</span><br />
<br />
The Kalosian slapped loudly her palm against her forehead. “This is ridiculous. You’re ridiculous.”<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'">“No you,”</span> the Virtual Pokémon snapped back. <span style="font-family: 'Courier New'">“Look, you have been sticking around New Fizz for far too long. For someone who want to be a trainer, you have been playing it way too safe. When was the last time you did something endearing?”</span><br />
<br />
“Few months ago,” she didn’t hesitate, “Gaela Town, when that freak snowstorm with that just-as-freak Abomasnow hit.”<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'">“...Touché. But still, my point is, you have not done much adventuring. On your own. An actual adventure to somewhere out of your comfort zone. Those rifts? Perfect for the job. Only way to know what is there is to go for it.”</span><br />
<br />
The trainer grumbled for a moment. “...It’s not going to kill me, wouldn’t it?”<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'">“Depends on the source,” </span>Glitch responded in honesty. <span style="font-family: 'Courier New'">“Scientists seem to take side on them being unstable, therefore at your risks and peril. If you would believe legends and so-called witnesses of that legendary Pokémon, however, noted how the very natural passage of time is its own doing, and was able to transport humans through time successfully and safely. If fact, out of danger's way and into safety.”</span><br />
<br />
Mélina paused for a minute, breathing slowly, before letting out yet another sigh. “I swear to Arceus if I die in there, I’ll come back as a ghost and haunt you.”<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'">“Noted. Now, shall we go?”</span><br />
<br />
She sighed one last time, after checking quickly her belongings. “...Let’s go.”<br />
<br />
<br />
After one big breath, Mélina lept into the warp… and nothing seemed to be strange, which in itself was weird. No infinite falling, or swirly spinning pattern shenanigans… nothing unusual. She simply landed comfortably on her feet. In fact, the landing was quite solid; on firm, rock bricks. She could breathe the slightly incense-smelling air normally, so at least the time portal didn’t miss the mark of the earth’s rotation, either. The people, besides all wearing kimono, looked pretty normal themselves-<br />
<br />
The girl’s line of thought suddenly came to a stop as she realised that although earthly, her surroundings were far from normal. As of matter of fact, instead of being in an ordinary field of grass, it was a nicely paved road and stairs that lead up to the top a hill, which have a huge, ancient-looking structure alongside a pagoda. All the colors, the architecture, the people, the language… with the little culture and history she knew, she could only come to one conclusion: she now stood in Niha, the ancient civilisation which many from the Kanto, Johto, Hoenn and Sinnoh regions descended from.<br />
<br />
“Glitch, I've a feeling we're not in Fizz anymore.”<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'">“No shit Sherlock,”</span> the Porygon let its grave discontent known the only way it knew how. <span style="font-family: 'Courier New'">“There is no signal here. Not even Wi-Fi.”</span><br />
<br />
The Kalosian’s eyes opened wide as another reality dawned on her. “Shoot, shoot, shoot! Be quiet Glitch!” She frantically tried to ran away and hide from anyone she saw, hoping nobody noticed her yet. “I’m dressed from the 21st century, not… whatever century this is! I got technology that doesn’t exist! <i>Your whole species</i> didn’t exist yet! I’m not even of Nian descent!”<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'">“That you know of.”</span><br />
<br />
The trainer angrily shushed it. “P<i>resque sûre je suis 100% Kalosienne.</i> Look, we don’t belong here. We’re more than just <i>gaijin</i> here; who knows how they’ll treat us. We need to get back home, in our time and place. You know how?”<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'">“Do not look at me. We are offline now, so...”</span><br />
<br />
Mélina growled in anger, grinding her teeth to hold herself not to burst into a rage. “Shut up and get back in your Pokéball. You’ll use up whatever battery’s left on my phone, and Arceus knows when we’ll need it.” She sighed, yet again. ”I guess we should just try to get information on a rift back home without being seen… somehow.”</span></div>

<span style="font-size: 12px">The God of Time rages. Its <i>Roar</i>, furious and all-powerful, has ripped open the fabric of time, creating a rift in Fizzytopia where the chronological flow is unstable… Scientists are almost unanimous in their assessment that traversing this breach is highly dangerous, due to the unpredictability of the results - but as with all things forbidden, curiosity can be overpowering…<br />
<br />
The tear is small, almost imperceptible to the naked eye – merely a single point in the outskirts of New Fizz City where reality waves unnaturally, as if one is seeing the landscape ahead through a glass of water. But for those who know how to find it, walking through that rift is like passing a door to a completely different world. One can never know exactly where – or, more importantly, <i>when</i> – they will find themselves, or if another rift will appear to allow them to return, but adventure unfailingly awaits the intrepid explorers every time! All they have to do is hurry, before Dialga calms down once again and the gate is lost…</span><br />

<br />
<i>Contrary to Egya, Greca places much more worth in the wonders of life than in the moment of death; also, the people’s focus in on sciences and arts much more than in big architectural achievements.

</blockquote><span style="color: #00ff80">A grunt is heard as a hand comes over the edge of a stony cliff slick with rain. Pulling himself up onto the cliff we see Big, in a rain cloak that he seems to have acquired from this time, obviously not in his usual attire. After taking a second to catch his breath he reaches down off the cliff to help up the pokemon who insisted on climbing the mountain with him, the Chespin Vegeta. The grass-type scowls, his mood seemingly matching the rain. &quot;This is complete bullshit, I was able to climb up this entire mountain, fought off several things that we won't even get credit for, all in the pouring rain, and I was stopped by a ledge that was inches... Inches! Too tall for me to climb or jump.&quot; Vegeta growls in his own language with Big simply sighing with a slight smile and setting him on the ground. &quot;Whatever you are complaining about it can wait, look, we are here.&quot; He gestures around. &quot;We can't go any higher, so the oracle must be around here somewhere.&quot; Vegeta just rolls his eyes. &quot;Whatever, I don't care about any oracle, I got my training. But that new Witch you caught might. Just recall me so I can get some rest.&quot; Big looks confused but remembers the conversation he had before coming here, and he gets the idea that Vegeta is no longer in the mood to hang out. <br />
<br />
He recalls Vegeta and tosses out the ghost ball containing his newest catch (relatively speaking, considering they were centuries in the past and the catch technically hadn't happened yet), the Sableye known as Mysteria. &quot;Hey Mysteria, we are at the mountain.&quot; The Sableye looks around. &quot;I can easily see that.&quot; She replies giving Big a look that would have been raised eyebrows if she didn't have gems for eyes. &quot;Right... Anyway, they don't seem to be readily available, you think you can use Foresight to try and find where this oracle is supposed to be?&quot; He asks and the Sableye replies with a smirk. &quot;Easily done.&quot; As her eyes glow and she begins to concentrate, Big looks out over the from the top of the mountain and lets his thoughts take over as he takes in what view he can in the rain. <i>I think this might be my last hope. If this Oracle can't find me the fossil pokemon I'm looking for I don't know if it's meant to be. But if it is, I'm sure it's somewhere in this time rift thing, maybe not here in Greca, but somewhere.</i></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: #ff8000"><b>Heather</b>- It's an honor on any day to meet the Champion of the Sinnoh region, an even greater one to be given an assignment by her. And such an important one at that! To investigate the Ancient Library of Alexia would be a great privilege and experience but to get assigned to do it and possibly get a reward at the end would definitely be appealing. With a few stern yet good-hearted warnings and a way to get home, you set off for the rift in time, just outside New Fizz City. As you come on the distortion in time you make sure all the pokemon you are responsible for are secure and step through. While an odd sensation, it feels mostly like you are falling for a really long time, but at the same time you land instantly (though somewhere along the way you think you spot a blue box in the timestream with you but not long enough to be sure it wasn't your mind playing tricks).<br />
<br />
With a rough landing in a faceful of sand, you know even before you raise your head that you have either arrived in Egya or you are waking up from an extremely vivid dream on the Bubbling Beach. You look around and with no water to be found you are firmly decided on the former. You also take note of the other obvious surroundings. Of which there are very few. In most directions you look, you see the expansive desert and rolling hills of sand. But directly behind where you landed is a fairly large city, and it seems to be bustling with people. You can tell there are plenty of people because you luckily seem to have landed close enough to the city, or at least within walking distance. The rift seems to have taken your wishes at least somewhat into account and not dropped you into the middle of the desert. After taking in the city you decide to ask someone to direct you to the Library. Although you get a couple of odd looks at your modern clothes, it seems a stroke of luck you speak the same language at least. An obviously eccentric older man with a long white beard that almost reaches his knees and an oddly wild look in his eyes goes: &quot;Yesh? The Library?&quot; He licks several times as he thinks, although you might wonder what is so long to think about given it's the most prominent place in the city. &quot;Keep heading deeper into the cshenter of the cshity yesh? It'sh the one with the the Pyroar shtatues outshide it.&quot; He nods and without waiting for a response moves on from the conversation and strikes one up with a merchant who just rolls his eyes.<br />
<br />
You make your way deeper into the city and you fairly easily find the building in question, the general flow of the crowds leading you just as much as the old man's directions. As he had said there were two stone statues of the fire Pokemon outside it, a Female on the left and Male on the right. It seems easy enough to head into, with many folks coming in and out, holding different kinds of scrolls and writings. Some even look to be wearing more modern outfits, the tourists Cynthia mentioned most likely. You are ready to step in when you see through the entrance, almost straight back into the library, what seems to be some kind of struggle. Most everyone is too busy with their own duties or interests to take notice but you definitely see papyrus and other things flying in the air.<br />

You wander through the streets of the port city, excited for the next adventure to unfold before your very eyes. After all, you had been planning this trip for weeks, so of course you were excited. The smell of the sea-salty air and the light breeze envelops you, as if a reassurance for what was to happen ahead. After all, the ferry you were on was naught more than a wooden boat. Most of the people here spoke in a language you didn't understand. The way of dress was different than what one would fine in say New Fizz City or the Cloud Garden, with longer robes and more simplistic designs and cloths as the norm. Almost every man had a beard, and everyone had nice, bronzed skin. <br />
<br />
Though, if there was one thing you could understand, was the importance of fishing was to the island's economy. Stalls of freshly caught fish lined the street you were walking down, and you could feel the stench assault your nostrils. It was quite a powerful smell, but one that was common in ports like this. The ruckus of the crowd as they walk through the stalls, haggling prices and buying their meal for the night. It was a bit refreshing, to just see the daily hustle and bustle of people as they go through their lives. While adventures were fun, there were also dangerous. This life... it was more peaceful. The threat of danger wasn't always looming over your head. Yet, this was not why you were here.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a loud voice broke through the crowd. Everyone stopped and looked at the source of the voice, and stayed silent. A messenger, from the looks of it, stood atop a box and was reading off a note. The town crier, you assumed. Yet, you couldn't decipher was he was saying. Yet, it seems that the news he was conveying was what the townsfolk had have heard about a thousands times at this point. When he was done, everyone went back to their daily routines as if nothing ever happened. You look around confused, wondering what was going on. You notice someone walk towards you, a friendly smile and a way of dress similar to yours.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hello! You must be another one of the trainers you have decided to travel through the gate, yes? My name is Timothy, and I'm actually a researcher sent here by the Canalave Library in the Sinnoh Region. I'm one of the few field agents who have traveled to the various regions that have appeared through this gate. Luckily, I'm quite well versed in the Grecian language. I've been here roughly for a month in this timeline now. Time seems to flow differently here than it does in our world. Oh, sorry, am I droning on?&quot; The man introduces himself, and starts to ramble about himself and why he was here. He seemed to be friendly enough, at least. You shake your head, and he sees that as a sign to continue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyways, I've been working with the king of this island. Teaching him and his family our language, etc. I don't know if our actions here will negatively impact history yet, but there seems to be no further anomalies created by us being here. The palace messenger that was just here, you heard his speech I presume? Ah yes, the king is looking for brave souls to brave the Labyrinth below the palace. Slay the monster... They call him Minotaur... Body of a man and supposedly the head of a Tauros. Anyways, yes, the king wants someone to slay this Minotaur. If you're at the very least interested, I can take you to the palace?&quot;<br />
<br />
This was certainly an enticing proposition. What do you do?<br />
<br />
<br />
Big-<br />
<br />
You climb up the mountain with your Chespin in hope of finding the oracle. <br />
You hoped at the very least... that if anyone could point you in the direction of the prize you seek, it would be her. A fossil Pokemon... A Pokemon that lived in the prehistoric past. Even later in the past than where the gate would allow you to go. Even so, it was a dream to obtain one. To obtain a living piece of the past. It would be... incredible at the very least. <br />
<br />
When you finish climbing, you swap out your Chespin for your Sableye. You ask her to use her Foresight to try and discern the location of the Oracle. However, foresight isn't necessarily clairvoyance. Her search turns up for naught. It seems that you'll need to find the location of the oracle on your own. Soon, you resume your scouring of the mountain top for who you seek to converse with.<br />
<br />
Soon, you find a small hut at the mountaintop. It's quaint, but even one not well versed in mystical arts could see the mystical energy flowing from the tiny tent. You look around, and see you're on the peak of the mountain. It felt like a small calm was here, as the torrential rain and tumultuous winds from your climb have ceased. Yes, this was certainly the place. <br />
<br />
&quot;Enter.&quot; You hear a voice boom through your mind. <br />
<br />
You comply with the voice, and enter the small hut. Smoke wafts through the room, and the smell of burning incense hits you like a truck. You see an old woman sitting in the middle of the hut, meditating. She does not acknowledge you, but you feel the urge to sit in front of her. So you do. You could feel a gaze on you, but from what you do not know. Then, once more, the voice fills into your head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me what you desire in detail. I have saw your arrival. I just need your words... Your words to tell you the knowledge you seek.&quot;<br />
<br />
What do you do?</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: plum">Astre-<br />
<br />
This land was foreign to you. Everything about it was different than what you knew. The trees were in full bloom at this point, creating a pink horizon in front of you. It was certainly... breath taking. Everything in the garden felt peaceful, serene, and calming. A place for a broken soul such as yours to stay and heal. If of course, you wanted that healing. TO repent under these cherry blossoms. You could always just wander here with your Eevee in tow, lost in your thoughts. <br />
<br />
Though, if one thing was obvious, it was how free nature was here. The touch of man was barely here, with the only signs people came here were the footprints in the dirt paths. You could see Pokemon pass you by, Butterfrees in the wind and Cherubi running past your feet. This garden was theirs, and always has been for a long time. Mankind only came during this specific time, to see the trees in bloom. <br />
<br />
As you wander through the paths of the garden, you run across a few people. Always in a pair or a group, admiring the blooms in the tree. The huddled together, speaking in hushed tones in a language you didn't quite understand. They wore these beautiful robes... You think they were called Kimonos. Perhaps they were Yukata... You weren't that versed in that traditional Kanjohtian fashion. Though, this place wasn't Kanjohto. You knew that much. Yet, it seemed pretty. It also made you realize you stuck out like a lamppost. <br />
<br />
Though, you then see something you didn't expect to see. At least, you thought you saw something. A flash of blonde hair appeared on your horizon, and soon disappeared back into the trees. You run after it, and see a blonde man wandering through the garden. Was it him? You try to call out but the words drown out before they hit your throat. Could it be him? Here? Now? Before you could react the blonde man sees you and runs off. <br />
<br />
What do you do? Do you chase after him?</span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: #00ff80">There was a lot to take in with all of the sights and sounds in this ancient market square. Unable to understand the language, Gary had to infer from his surroundings what was going on as he saw a messenger approach the crowd of citizens and read off a scroll. Fortunately, Gary was not the only one there from the 21st Century. Dressed in similarly modern clothes, a man easily noticed Gary and came over to introduce himself. His name was Timothy and he was a scholar in linguistics and history from the Sinnoh region’s Canalave Library. Gary smiled and shook Timothy’s hand.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Nice to meet you, Timothy. My name is Gary from Azalea Town in Johto, but I’ve studied water Pokemon in Unova.” Timothy went on to speak about the island’s royal family and a mysterious labyrinth beneath the palace that housed a mythological beast. As Timothy asked if Gary wanted to check it out for himself, Gary weighed his options in his head. On one hand, Gary had been really excited to check out the rich fishing culture around the area in hopes of studying the local wildlife. However, on the other hand, the call of adventure and talk of mythological creatures was hard to pass up.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gary’s inner nerd was screaming out to pass up Timothy’s offer and not lose sight of his mission. As he was about to open his mouth and give an answer however, Gary suddenly felt a surge of energy coming from a certain Safari Ball on his clip of Pokeballs. It was none other than his own Tauros, Asterios, a Pokemon Gary had acquired as a gift not too long ago in Bedlam Ridge. His Safari Ball had been obtained from one of the gangs’ hideouts, and it wasn’t certain how long the Tauros had been locked away in there or who his original trainer was. All Gary knew was that in their first time meeting each other, Asterios had gone a bit wild and charged at him. Since then, Gary had gotten to know that Asterios was a peaceful Tauros at heart, but would tend to snap into a rage when disturbed. Asterios had clearly felt some kind of connection to this place, so Gary decided that it would be best to indulge the mystery and deepen his bonds with his Pokemon. “That sounds interesting,” Gary answered Timothy’s question, “And I think I’ve got a Tauros of my own who’s itching to check it out too.”</span></div>

You climb up the mountain with your Chespin in hope of finding the oracle. <br />
You hoped at the very least... that if anyone could point you in the direction of the prize you seek, it would be her. A fossil Pokemon... A Pokemon that lived in the prehistoric past. Even later in the past than where the gate would allow you to go. Even so, it was a dream to obtain one. To obtain a living piece of the past. It would be... incredible at the very least. <br />
<br />
When you finish climbing, you swap out your Chespin for your Sableye. You ask her to use her Foresight to try and discern the location of the Oracle. However, foresight isn't necessarily clairvoyance. Her search turns up for naught. It seems that you'll need to find the location of the oracle on your own. Soon, you resume your scouring of the mountain top for who you seek to converse with.<br />
<br />
Soon, you find a small hut at the mountaintop. It's quaint, but even one not well versed in mystical arts could see the mystical energy flowing from the tiny tent. You look around, and see you're on the peak of the mountain. It felt like a small calm was here, as the torrential rain and tumultuous winds from your climb have ceased. Yes, this was certainly the place. <br />
<br />
&quot;Enter.&quot; You hear a voice boom through your mind. <br />
<br />
You comply with the voice, and enter the small hut. Smoke wafts through the room, and the smell of burning incense hits you like a truck. You see an old woman sitting in the middle of the hut, meditating. She does not acknowledge you, but you feel the urge to sit in front of her. So you do. You could feel a gaze on you, but from what you do not know. Then, once more, the voice fills into your head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me what you desire in detail. I have saw your arrival. I just need your words... Your words to tell you the knowledge you seek.&quot;<br />
<br />
What do you do?</span>

Holding two purple claws to her temple the glow fades from Mysteria's eyes. &quot;I don't sense anything but that doesn't mean it's not here.&quot; She says shaking her head. Big nods in response. &quot;I guess we better look the old-fashioned way.&quot; He says. The two set off in search of the Oracle and after a short while, they come on a small hut where the rain and wind seemed to have let up somewhat. He takes off his glasses and wipes them off as he heads forward toward the door. He looks down to Mysteria and she simply makes an &quot;after you gesture&quot; with her claws when they both hear the &quot;Enter.&quot; in their heads. Big does so and following his instincts sits politely as he can sits in front of her. Mysteria stands next to him but with her arms behind her is inspecting the cabin with a discerning eye. &quot;Incense, I was always more of a candle and skulls girl myself.&quot; She chuckles to herself when the Oracle, at least Big persumes, speaks to him in his head and asks him what he is searching for. Luckily he has a whole mountain climb to think of what he was going to say once he had made it here. &quot;Oh great Oracle.&quot; He starts off a little clumsily, the formalnass not coming natural to his timeline but recognizing the necessity of it here. &quot;I travel everywhere I can with my pokemon companions to gain strength together and become closer friends with them.&quot; Mysteria's trademark Sableye grin sharpens a little bit at the last remark. &quot;I come today in search of a new companion. I'm sure you can tell, but I'm not exactly from around here.&quot; He doesn't want to bring up the time travel, this oracle may be all knowing but he still isn't sure what the rules for time travel are and if he might affect too much in his time by changing too much. &quot;The companion I search for can't be found very easily where I come from, most of their kind are long dead. I come to you today because you might be the only person who can show me where to find this kind of pokemon. A pokemon with a mighty jaw and destructive power that it may be called king.&quot; He explains and waits for the Oracle's answer.</span></div>

This northern peninsula is home to some of the fiercest, most barbaric fighters in the world, whose strength in combat is only matched by their sailing skills.</i></span><br />
<span style="color: deepskyblue"><span style="font-size: 12px"><br />
<i>From a very young age, Scandians are taught to handle three things: an axe, a Pokémon and a boat. Both the axe and the Pokémon stay with them their entire lives; boats are plundered, stolen and swapped as the need arises. They spend most of their lives at sea, sailing to any neighbouring lands yet to be explored, waging war with nations they deem worthy, pillaging and putting to the torch all the others.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Gods, too, are instruments in their warring ways – all of them said to be favoured by glorious combat and conquest. Scandians honour their deities with blood and victory, or valiant death in the face of a stronger foe. As a result, they fear nothing, living only for the thrill of battle, and that makes them all the more dangerous. (please reply in deepskyblue)</i><br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>Borg Keep</u></b>: Home to the Jarl of Scandia, Bernhardt Ivarson, a massive fortress of rock and ice that has never been conquered. Riches plundered from other lands are brought here, where the Jarl keeps the lion’s share and divides the remaining spoils between the warriors who claimed the most lives in the raid. Tasks Bernhardt needs taken care of, either within Scandia borders or across the sea, are issued here by the Jarl himself, who isn’t particular about the people he lets inside the Keep so long as they have any worth to him.<br />
<br />
<b><u>Valheim Port</u></b>: The harbour from which every Scandian Warship departs, this is both the meeting point of great warriors and the prime spot for commerce in the entire land. Merchants carry some very interesting goods, both from the frozen grounds of Scandia and exotic goods pillaged from conquered lands that are “unaccounted for” and thus never make it to Borg Keep. There is good money to be made here, and in order to reach the open seas, one must inevitably pass by Valheim Port if they are to board one of the vessels.<br />
<br />
<b><u>”The Skall” Longship</u></b>: The oldest ship in the Scandian fleet, and most would agree, the best. The Skall has travelled countless miles and reached a hundred different shores. The man who designed it has long since passed, and no other has been able to build a similarly magnificent warship. When a particularly large, profitable raid is in sight, The Skall is inevitably the ship that will make the journey – it carries only the strongest, most reliable of Bernhardt’s men, and being allowed aboard is a great honour.<br />
<br />
<b><u>Helga’s Tavern</u></b>: It’s not that this is the <i>only</i> tavern in Scandia – it’s that Helga smites the competition with the best mead and the best placement: right in front of Valheim Port. Tired warriors come to regain their strengths, drink a glass or seven, and toast to the success of their latest raid. It’s the number one place to pick up some gossip, pick up a fight or pick up work if one’s looking for a quick buck. Scandian warriors aren’t exactly rich, but they always keep something extra for themselves whenever they pillage another region, and might be willing to part with the loot if they need a favour done.<br />
<br />
<b><u>The Titan’s Horn</u></b>: Scandia is a region of tall, frozen mountains, and the Horn is the biggest of them all. Overlooking the entire coast, a small lookout has been constructed on the very peak, but it is said no soul has ever made it that high up and survived other than the very man who built the lookout. The weather conditions are unforgiving, subzero temperatures and gale-force winds making it impossible for just about any human to survive without exceptional preparation, and only the hardiest Pokémon can endure this extreme climate.</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: deepskyblue">Jayson had heard word of the time rift from a friend and had spent the last few weeks preparing for his journey. The forge and training yard had been bustling with activity, Ajax and Jayson had been working on some new weapons and armour, so that the trainer would be able to defend himself. His new armour was a mix of chainmail and leather armour, providing him with both protection and flexibility. A steel reinforced wooden shield and a pair of axes were fashioned for him as well. Valka had made him a cloak out of fur, she knew he would need the warmth it provided if he wasn't going to return to her as a block of ice. Jayson carefully selected a few of his companions for the journey. Sigurd was a must, the Gallade was his best fighter and most trusted partner, plus his Psychic abilities were always useful. Argo would accompany them as well, Scandians spent plenty of time on the water and Jayson knew he could rely on the Lapras for safe travel in even the roughest seas. Ymir would also have to join him, the Amaura had become a bit attached to Jayson since his mother had abandoned him, plus the terrain and weather would suit the oversized Amaura. Kissing Valka goodbye, Jayson left for New Fizz City, the time rift wouldn't wait forever.<br />
<br />
It been two months since Jayson first ventured through the time rift. He wasn't sure whether time passed the same way here or not, but he was enjoying himself far too much to head back yet. He'd been sailing around the frosty northern region with Argo, Sigurd and Ymir, battling lone vikings and embracing the Scandian culture. He felt at home here, he only wished Valka could be here to enjoy it with him. He'd started to run low on supplies and was growing tired of simple battles, he wanted something bigger, something more intense. Argo swam steadily into <b>Valheim Port</b>, the port was filled with longships, something Jayson had yet to acquire. He knew if he wanted to raid with the Scandian's he would likely need a ship of his own and the only way to get one was to take it off of someone else. Jayson recalled Argo as he pulled into the dock, he looked around with Sigurd by his side.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Where should we start Sigurd? We need to join a raid.&quot; </i>Jayson reached out mentally, communicating with the Gallade via their psychic link.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;We need to draw the right type of attention to ourselves. If we pick a fight with another Scandian we could get ourselves in trouble.&quot; </i>The Gallade was right, if they picked the wrong person, they could end up in over their heads.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;A wild Pokemon then, we battle a wild Pokemon to show our strength and draw the attention of someone who matters.&quot;</i> Jayson retrieved his fishing rod from his bag, as well as his last pickled herring. Feeding the hook through the pickled fish, he cast the line out into the icy water. Sigurd waited patiently beside him, hoping his trainer's plan would work. </span></div>

The winds were howling out, like wolves looking for their next meal. Their fangs sunk into the teen's skin, and their cold embrace gave him no respite. Yet, this was what he wanted. This bitter mountain was what he was looking for. To freeze, perhaps, or perchance to master the rime around him. All he knew, truly, was that he wanted this cold. A song of ice sung by the gale wolves, to lead him through this mountain of giants. He felt something here... In this era of the past. Yet what, exactly, was that he was looking he did not know. <br />
<br />
Austin looked at the white landscape in front of him. It was snow as far as the eye could see. Of course, he couldn't see much due to the raging blizzard, but it was still snow none the less. Wisp was with him, as usual, providing heat and warmth. Though, there was only so much a small candle could do in conditions like this. Then again, he wasn't wearing much to help with the cold either. It didn't both him much. Walking next to him was Kadoc, his Absol. The Pokemon was always silent, cold, and aloof. He did know that the Pokemon had a certain affinity for colder climates, however, and that an Absol's natural instincts may prove useful. After all, death followed him wherever he went. <br />
<br />
&quot;This reminds me... Of that time William and I got snowed in. We were stuck in that shed for about three days... The worst blizzard Virbank had in years. Luckily, we had enough food to last us, but it was still tough. Yet, the snow always has brought me warmth,&quot; the teen muttered to himself before soon touching his lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;I miss that warmth...&quot; He said as he looked out across the mountain. Nothing but snow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say, Kadoc, can you scout out a place for shelter?&quot; Austin asked the Absol, who gave him a nod and rushed ahead.<br />
<br />
Austin then started to rummage through his bag. Finding what he wanted, he drew out a knife. Wooden hilt wrapped in leather, curved blade, and pointed tip. He looked at it, traced his finger across the dull side. It was certainly of fine craftsmanship. Of course, this was standard make and model for that cult. He didn't carry it around much now. No, he only carried it when he knew he would be heading into danger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wisp, Marie, Merlin, Kadoc, Fir, and Titan,&quot; Austin murmured, remembering the six Pokemon he brought with him. His Litwick, Gengar, Ralts, Absol, Snover, and Aron. Wisp, Marie, and Merlin were always with him, and the other three fit the environment. This wasn't like any trip before. He knew that much.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a land of warriors. If I have to kill, so be it. This mountain... Why do I remember this a place like this if I couldn't be alive during this time? Why did my mind flood with memories... Of a snowy mountain... Of my mother... and getting snowed in with Will... when this rift was announced to the public. There's something here... Waiting for me. What it is... I know I'm not going to like it.&quot;</span></div>

This land was foreign to you. Everything about it was different than what you knew. The trees were in full bloom at this point, creating a pink horizon in front of you. It was certainly... breath taking. Everything in the garden felt peaceful, serene, and calming. A place for a broken soul such as yours to stay and heal. If of course, you wanted that healing. TO repent under these cherry blossoms. You could always just wander here with your Eevee in tow, lost in your thoughts. <br />
<br />
Though, if one thing was obvious, it was how free nature was here. The touch of man was barely here, with the only signs people came here were the footprints in the dirt paths. You could see Pokemon pass you by, Butterfrees in the wind and Cherubi running past your feet. This garden was theirs, and always has been for a long time. Mankind only came during this specific time, to see the trees in bloom. <br />
<br />
As you wander through the paths of the garden, you run across a few people. Always in a pair or a group, admiring the blooms in the tree. The huddled together, speaking in hushed tones in a language you didn't quite understand. They wore these beautiful robes... You think they were called Kimonos. Perhaps they were Yukata... You weren't that versed in that traditional Kanjohtian fashion. Though, this place wasn't Kanjohto. You knew that much. Yet, it seemed pretty. It also made you realize you stuck out like a lamppost. <br />
<br />
Though, you then see something you didn't expect to see. At least, you thought you saw something. A flash of blonde hair appeared on your horizon, and soon disappeared back into the trees. You run after it, and see a blonde man wandering through the garden. Was it him? You try to call out but the words drown out before they hit your throat. Could it be him? Here? Now? Before you could react the blonde man sees you and runs off. <br />
<br />
What do you do? Do you chase after him?</span>

That was the only word that could describe Isaac. His mouth felt dry, his hands shook, but there was no feeling anywhere. Not anymore. Kyle had left, it was the end of their time together. He didn't care about Isaac, but to be fair, Isaac didn't blame him. He was a sorry sob of a human, mashed together with the bits he wanted the public to see and torn apart but what he kept within. He swallowed hard, looking towards the figure. He knew in his heart that it wasn't him, yet he felt so drawn to it. He took a few steps forward, as if he was in some sort of trance. Ahri looked at her master with a flash of concern, her mother had been somewhat forward about their trainer's bad habits. She was sympathetic, uncle Vander was not. She followed along, making sure that she was at the ready to protect her master if something bad were to happen to him. <br />
</span></span><br />
<span style="color: plum"><span style="font-size: 12px">Isaac was a man on a mission. There was something so alluring about the sight of that hair, he told himself it couldn't be true... that there was no possible way that Kyle had stumbled into the wormhole and ended up in the same place at the same time as him. But his morbid curiosity needed to be sated. As he approached, he heard Ahri's light footsteps behind him --- followed by a thudding noise as she tripped over something. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ahri!&quot; He called, turning around and kneeling down to pick up the runt Eevee. &quot;Are you okay, sweetheart?&quot; The small Eevee had tripped on a gnarled root, getting somewhat of a face full of dirt. She smiled and nodded, always quick to recover from embarrassing moments. She licked Isaac's face, causing him to laugh. &quot;Okay okay, I'll carry you.&quot; He smiled, holding Ahri like a baby nestled against it's mother's chest. The Eevee rested her face on his shoulder as Isaac sprinted after the figure.<br />
<br />
<i>I'm not letting you get away again.</i> He thought to himself, trying to catch sight of the man in the trees once again. </span></span></div>

<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px">The God of Time rages. Its <i>Roar</i>, furious and all-powerful, has ripped open the fabric of time, creating a rift in Fizzytopia where the chronological flow is unstable… Scientists are almost unanimous in their assessment that traversing this breach is highly dangerous, due to the unpredictability of the results - but as with all things forbidden, curiosity can be overpowering…<br />
<br />
The tear is small, almost imperceptible to the naked eye – merely a single point in the outskirts of New Fizz City where reality waves unnaturally, as if one is seeing the landscape ahead through a glass of water. But for those who know how to find it, walking through that rift is like passing a door to a completely different world. One can never know exactly where – or, more importantly, <i>when</i> – they will find themselves, or if another rift will appear to allow them to return, but adventure unfailingly awaits the intrepid explorers every time! All they have to do is hurry, before Dialga calms down once again and the gate is lost…</span><br />

The natives are intensely curious about anything unknown to them, and are often prone to experimenting new things in all fields of existence, from science to love.</i></span><br />
<span style="color: springgreen"><span style="font-size: 12px"><br />
<i>They are also a religious people, much like the Egyans, but unlike them, Grecans seem more motivated by fear of the gods rather than admiration.

<br />
<i>Contrary to Egya, Greca places much more worth in the wonders of life than in the moment of death; also, the people’s focus in on sciences and arts much more than in big architectural achievements. As a result, most buildings in Greca are not particularly awe-inspiring or elaborate, but taking time to talk to the locals can reveal some immensely interesting characters.

Much like her immortal Pokémon companion, one of her eyes is said to see the past and the other the future – and were it not for the extremely inhospitable conditions of the area, many Grecans would flock to her for advice from the gods…<br />
<br />
<b><u>Temple of Golgades</u></b>: Located in the heart of the mainland, this Temple is a famous place of worship dedicated to Golgades, God of Victory. It is said that pleasing this deity grants success in all life’s endeavours, which unfortunately lures many charlatans and non-believers looking for an easy solution to life’s problems.</span></span>

Bill had heard about the timerift about a week after its inception. Apparently there are a lot of areas throughout time and space that he could travel to straight from New Fizz City. As a Ruin Maniac, that made him giddy with anticipation. All of those potential pre-ruins alongside their possible intended purpose sounded great. However, before he even decided on that, he heard a particularly juicy rumor, one that pertained to his interests. Apparently there is an oracle in one of the more modernish kingdoms, Greca, called the Oracle of Meria. She had the ability to communicate with the gods and can even see the past and future. While Bill knew that there was a possibility of these rumors being false, he also knew much, much better than to just doubt legends like that. She may be able to help him find the Arcane Realm that he's been trying to find so that he can locate his old friends.<br />
<br />
After a couple of weeks, Bill had prepared for a large trek to the top of the mountain. He anticipated the trip might take no more than maybe a full day. So he packed about three days worth of food (including Pokemon food) and water and a bed roll and some blankets. He entered the kingdom of Greca. The area was decorated in beautiful marble and stone. The townsfolk were all bustling back and forth, some philosophers nearby were talking about life and death, while artists were trying to have friendly competitions to see who can express their meaning to any viewer the best. While he might've left New Fizz City, Bill still felt a similar aura about it. Sure, there were more modern things in NFC, but people still had some of the same worries and whatnot. It was comforting to say the least. As he rounded the corner, he found himself at a local temple. He had read about this particular building, it was a place of worship for the god of victory, Golgades. Bill had met with a few gods and goddesses over his journey, so he knew that they at least existed. Perhaps he should stop by here first and pray for his own victory. Sure, Bill wasn't an active worshipper of any one god, but he figured that it while praying might not help, it most definitely wouldn't hurt either. He goes to the entrance of the temple, trying to figure out the proper rituals, even for something as simple as entering could have its own special action that he was unaware of.<br />

Your Tauros, Asterios, pops out of his Pokeball seeming to be incredibly interested in what the man had to say. Perhaps he felt a connection to the story of the Minotaur. It would make sense, considering his namesake. You knew that you couldn't let him down. So, you tossed your inner fish nerd aside, and agree to be taken to the palace. <br />
<br />
The road to the palace was a beautiful one. Large, grassy knolls, fields of violets, and the soft sea breeze all was refreshing compared to the hustle and bustle of the city. It was able to let you think over what was currently happening. After all, all you could see was Asterios by your side and Timothy guiding your way to the palace. It was nice... Though this was probably the last light of day you'll be seeing for a long time. <br />
<br />
Soon you see the palace come into view, and admire the architecture. The entrance looked much like a temple, and you could see the various servants heading in and out of the building. Their close were simple, but had a certain elegance to it. You, of course, stuck out like a sore thumb, but most of the servants simple ignored you. To them, you were probably so me weirdo trying to gain the favor of the king. No real harm done, right? <br />
<br />
Soon, you enter the palace. The walls seemed to be made of gold. Statues of the king, and his family lined main hall. It was a bit surreal considering the realism of the statues... How life like they were. Art like this was only seen in museums in modern times. It made sense, now, seeing them in their prime before the ravages of time. At the end of this hall was the throne room. Timothy stopped you, and went in. Seems you had some time to kill. Do you wait patiently or further explore this beauty of a building?<br />
<br />
<br />
Big- <br />
<br />
You explain your plight to the oracle, who ruminates on your words during her meditation. Minutes seem to pass as she sits there in silence. You feel the smoke in the room start to coil around you in a constricting manner. You swear you hear it hiss too... as it slithered around your body. At this point it felt like you were choking, but no sound came. You could still breath, but it felt you couldn't. As if your very life was being constricted. Then, it stopped. What felt like an eternity in the smoke's grasp... also felt like a few seconds. With that, the oracle spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see... A great desert across the sea. I see the conquest of one of our greatest men... Yes, his captivating speeches and strong kingly build... One who has had many partners, and did not discriminate based on sex... The King of Conquerors... As you may know him. Follow his path across the sea... to that sandy place he loved. There... There you will find what you are looking for,&quot; she spoke out, clapping her hands together through the pauses as if she was going through a ritualistic ceremony. Then she fell silent, and started chanting. Nothing seemed to happen though, and you realize that she must be going back into her meditation.<br />
<br />
With that, it was your turn to take your leave. Across the sea? To a place of sand... It seems that the destination was Egya. But, you'd have to make the journey by foot. After all, the oracle's insights, unless was specified, pertained to the period of time she gave them in. It was already going to be a long journey to get there... And even then was that only the first step. What do you do?<br />
<br />
<span style="color: plum">Astre-</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: springgreen"><span style="color: plum">You would not give up your chase... you wouldn't. No matter the time or place, you just wanted one last word. One last dance. You couldn't give up on him just yet. You wouldn't. The fierce sense of determination in your heart would make sure you'd keep on going. This numbness... it was starting to fade. You'd make him yours again... No matter the cost. To fill this void in your heart, you'd do anything.</span></span><br />

<span style="color: springgreen"><span style="color: plum">So you continued to run through the gardens, chasing after the blonde figure as much as you could. He always was just out of your reach... Outside a clear view of your vision. He was taunting you at this point you could swear it. Was Kyle really this different now? What happened to him... No, you know what happened to him. You happened to him. Was this why you wanted to atone so badly? To return your love back to who he was? </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: springgreen"><span style="color: plum">Finally, you stop to catch your breath. Your body feels exhausted, sore, and on the verge of collapse. The adrenaline was fading, and in it's place was tiredness. Ahri licks your face, making sure that you're okay. Looking around, you see that you're next to a small pond. Magikarp of different sizes and colors can be seen swimming peacefully in the pond. It was calm... Unlike your beating heart. You could hear footsteps behind you, and turn around.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: springgreen"><span style="color: plum">It was him... No... It was someone who looked like Kyle. His hair was dirty blonde... His eyes were icy blue. They were cold, but not Kyle's cool green cold. No, those eyes were frigid daggers tearing through your heart. He looked so familiar... but at the same time he was so foreign to you. You could see a grin on his face as he started to speak.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: springgreen"><span style="color: plum">&quot;To think I'd meet a fellow street rat here. Guess even time can't make you escape your past. But, if we had the choice, we'd use time to change our pasts. Isn't that right, Isaac?&quot; His words tore through you. </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: springgreen"><span style="color: plum">&quot;But I bet you don't remember me... That's fine... If you did you'd have thought I was dead. Heh... Anyways, nice to see you again. In case you don't remember me, the name is Cal,&quot; the man reaches out his hand, blue eyes and cold smile extended towards you.He knew you... and you could feel he knew your past. Yet, who was he?</span></span></div>

After hearing about this rift in time Jayson has decided that he simply must go check it out. After preparing your supplies and deciding which pokemon would accompany you into the past you set out with your trusted Gallade, aquatic transportation Lapras, and location fitting Amaura. You spend several months in the past area known as Scandia pretty carefree. With all of the lone vikings and wild pokemon you are fairly content but a combination of low supplies and a desire for something bigger you make your way back into Valhiem Port. Likely not your first visit you recall your Lapras as you make landfall. The harbor area was bustling as always with merchants yelling at passers-by claiming their fish were the freshest or their coat would keep you the warmest. In search of your big raid, you decide that you need to draw some attention to yourself and show your strength. You first consider picking a fight with a random Scandian but as you walk by a tavern you see a Scandian the size of a Machoke get knocked out of the double doors leading in and falling of the deck into the icy waters below. You decide against picking a fight, at least for now. You find yourself on the right track though and decide to go fishing in hopes of finding a wild pokemon to show off your strength. At first, you don't have much luck, dealing with the average magikarps that simply get thrown back. However about an hour in you get an especially hard tug. With a mighty pull, you reel in your rod and it creaks under the weight of your catch. As you see your catch you see the blue fat blubbery form of a Sealeo looking back at you. It looks more confused than anything else. <b>What will you do?</b><br />

When you hear about the potential to travel into the past, a Ruin Maniac like yourself is absolutely ecstatic. But even before that you hear tell of some of the people returning of an Oracle that's able to help find missing places and things or answer other kinds of questions. Thinking this may be a clue to finding this Arcane Realm you are searching for you decide it might as well be worth checking out, even given the chance it may be a scam or hoax. You gather up supplies and head off toward the kingdom of Greca. You find it bustling, with similar vibes to the large city of New Fizz City, and people coming and going in their daily routines. Taking comfort in the slight familiarity you decide to make one stop before heading to the mountain, the Temple of Golgades, God of Victory. You come upon the white-pillared building with a statue depiction of the Pokemon Victini at the top of the entryway. The building is fairly busy, as this seems to be a popular worshipping destination. It seems many people require victory enough to ask the gods for it. Glancing about you see the general theme of worship: sacrifice. There is a giant brazier in the middle of the room and a queue of people leading up to it. Some farmers drop berries into the flame, a warrior leaves some kind of pelt, a young kid very hesitantly tosses in what seems to be a favorite toy. They then step off to the side and take a few moments to bow towards the Statue in the back of the temple, a depiction of Golgades himself. You notice some people whispering under their breath, probably in prayer before. heading out of the temple. It seems you have an idea of how people typically worship in this temple now. <b>What will you do?</b></span><br /></div>

You explain your plight to the oracle, who ruminates on your words during her meditation. Minutes seem to pass as she sits there in silence. You feel the smoke in the room start to coil around you in a constricting manner. You swear you hear it hiss too... as it slithered around your body. At this point it felt like you were choking, but no sound came. You could still breath, but it felt you couldn't. As if your very life was being constricted. Then, it stopped. What felt like an eternity in the smoke's grasp... also felt like a few seconds. With that, the oracle spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see... A great desert across the sea. I see the conquest of one of our greatest men... Yes, his captivating speeches and strong kingly build... One who has had many partners, and did not discriminate based on sex... The King of Conquerors... As you may know him. Follow his path across the sea... to that sandy place he loved. There... There you will find what you are looking for,&quot; she spoke out, clapping her hands together through the pauses as if she was going through a ritualistic ceremony. Then she fell silent, and started chanting. Nothing seemed to happen though, and you realize that she must be going back into her meditation.<br />
<br />
With that, it was your turn to take your leave. Across the sea? To a place of sand... It seems that the destination was Egya. But, you'd have to make the journey by foot. After all, the oracle's insights, unless was specified, pertained to the period of time she gave them in. It was already going to be a long journey to get there... And even then was that only the first step. What do you do?</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: #00ff80">As Big finishes telling his plight he waits patiently for a response, but when she doesn't reply right away he starts to get a little worried. He is about to speak up when he finally feels the smoke swirling around him and choking him, cutting off his breath. He is scared for a moment when he is released almost immediately. The Oracle than explains her vision. When she finishes Big is left pondering her words as she goes back to her meditation. H stands back up and gives a slight respectful bow. &quot;Thank you for the information.&quot; He goes into his pack and leaves one of his few Casteliacones in his seat as an offering for the oracle in repayment, even though she didn't ask he felt it appropriate. He leaves the cabin with Mysteria in tow. &quot;You know about these magicky type things, do you think she was on the right track?&quot; Big asks the Sableye. She doesn't bother verbally replying and gives a shrug followed by a nod. He nods back. &quot;Alright. Well if I know my history right I think I know where to head. I'm pretty sure the Great King she was talking about was Alex...something.&quot; He shakes his head. &quot;But the deserty place he loved was Egya. He conquered it or something and fell in love with a Pharoah I think.&quot; He says. &quot;I guess its time to head back down.&quot; He recalls Mysteria and begins his trek down the mountain where he would try to find passage to Egya.</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 18px"><span style="color: #ff0000"><u>Missingno. Master</u></span></span>&#8203;</div><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: #ff0000">New Fizz City was just a distant memory at this point. Your surroundings had shifted drastically, more becoming of the past. A relic, something forged in the memory of the people was what stood ahead of you. The mighty Colosseum stood in front of you. It was looming, drawing you into it's walls to test your resolve and skill as a trainer. You were a seasoned trainer for certain, but were your 21st century skills any match for the brute force of trainers in the past? There was only one way to find out. </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: #ff0000">As you set foot in the mighty structure, you were immediately greeted by a guard. A large man, imposing and bulky. His garb was certainly rugged, a chest plate with shorts and a rather fancy helm. He eyes you for a few moments, his spear blocking the entrance. From beyond this man, you can see a raging battle between a Nidorino and a Gengar taking place. The Pokemon look rugged, much larger than the varieties you were used to seeing in your time. It was as if they had been breed to be less... threatening as the years went on. It made sense, considering how much the very idea of raising Pokemon had changed over the years --- you had just never really thought of it.<br />
<br />
The guard continued to stare at you and Meowth, scanning you up and down as you stood, waiting to be permitted entry. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you here to compete or to observe?&quot; He finally asked. You wondered if he was just looking at you to assess your strength with his eyes. <br />
<br />
The man waits patiently for your response, which suits you better? <b><i>What do you do?</i></b></span><br />
</span><br />
<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 18px"><span style="color: plum"><u>OkikuMew</u></span></span>&#8203;</div><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: plum">The feeling of being out of place was never a welcome feeling, and the fact that you had technology from a far off era was most certainly concerning. As you looked around frantically, you made sure that no one was watching you or had seen you suddenly appear. As you returned your technologically advanced Pokemon to it's Pokeball only one thing remained in your mind, that you had to get out of here as fast as you possibly could. </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: plum"><span style="font-size: 12px">As you walked briskly, taking constant glances around you, you ran up the stone stairs towards an elegant shrine. Although the sun was high in the sky, the shrine was very much abandoned at this moment. You could see a few people in the distance, walking away from the shrine. They had presumably prayed to Megami and left their offerings, returning home for a restful night. Taking a few more glances around, you wander towards the side of the shrine --- hoping to stay out of sight until the moon rose so that the cloak of the night would hide you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well well...&quot; You heard what sounded like a man's voice from behind you. You tensed up instantly, realizing that someone had seen you and you were probably about to alter the course of history. You turned slowly, seeing a man that was wearing the traditional Nihan clothing standing behind you. He was middle aged, probably in his early 50s. He had the look of a seasoned trainer, a large scar strewn over his left eye leaving him noticeably blind in that eye. You clutched your shirt, realizing that the man was probably confused on your attire. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're not from around here, are you?&quot; He asked, his good eye looking at you with wonder. Upon closer inspection of the man, he appeared to be some sort of <b><i>Kannushi. </i></b>Responsible for the upkeep of the shrine. He placed his hand on his chin, smiling at you. &quot;It's alright my child, follow me.&quot; The man turned, moving towards the shrine.<br />
<br />
Should you follow him? <b><i>What do you do?</i></b><br />
</span></span><br />
<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 18px"><span style="color: deepskyblue"><u>Lit</u></span></span>&#8203;</div><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: deepskyblue">You felt as though the rift had drawn you in, like that stupid castle. You were drawn here by the memories of your past, they loomed over you like the towering peaks of the mountains. The brisk cold atmosphere reminded you of your own life, cold and unchanging. Your future was a mystery, as was your past --- and the same remained true of this climate. As you shivered, you couldn't help but wonder what awaited you here. You had heard the hushed legends of the small lookout tour atop the peak, that no one had ever made it up alive. You wondered if the bodies of the dead had been preserved by the harsh climate, buried by the snow and used as markers for future travelers. <br />
<br />
As you brushed your fingers over the dull end of your knife, your mind began to wander. This was going to be your most dangerous trip yet, it was possible that this climate would kill you. It was also possible that you could meet ravenous scavengers, ready to kill you and plunder your corpse. But you'd be ready, and you'd kill if you had to. <br />
<br />
As your mind continued to wander, Kadoc returned, his face looked stern and determined. His head gestured towards the way he had come from, presumably a good place for a shelter. With Wisp at your side, you followed Kadoc towards what appeared to be a makeshift lean to. A traveler must have used this while traveling up the mountain, the charred remains of wood from a fire were hard like rocks. Completely frozen. This must have been sitting here for quite some time before you arrived... you wondered how many people had lost their lives here. <br />
<br />
As you nestled into the lean to, wanting to take a quick rest before traveling further to regain your strength and warmth, you hear what sound like footsteps from outside the shelter. Kadoc quickly jumps to attention, barring his teeth in response to the presumed intruder. <br />
