<b>Raves-</b><br />
<br />
The Dewpider was initially a little baffled by your words. What did you mean, that this wasn't its fault? It didn't know exactly what was going on, but could tell that your words were warm. Mulling over the offer, the Dewpider gladly accepted. Taking on of its spindly arms, it taps the Premier Ball, and gladly went in. With a one... a two... and a three. DING!<br />
<br />
<b>Congratulations, you've caught a Level 16 Male Dewpider with EM Sticky Web! </b><br />
<br />
With the spiderling captured, you look towards the rest of your Pokemon. All three of them did a wonderful job, and you could tell that they seemed to have grown stronger from this whole ordeal. Of course, Xigua and Lesath seemed to benefit more than Ocellus, but all's well that ends well, right? <b>Xigua and Lesath have gained 2 Levels! Ocellus has gained 1 Level! </b><br />
<br />
Now wondering what would happen next, and pondering why you were called here, you see one of the priestesses approaching you. Her garb was simplistic, and her hair was long. It lightly swayed as she walked, serving as a distraction from the destruction all around her. <br />
<br />
&quot;We wanted to thank you, for saving us...&quot; she muttered before putting down a wicker basket. She gave you a smile and a bow before leaving. It seems that the contents in here were yours to take.<br />
<br />
Opening the basket, you see quite a few different items. A Bag of Silver Powder. While the Powder was the usual flair, the bag seemed to be handmade, and had one of the blessings of Artema inscribed. Of course, it was in Ancient Grecian, so what it exactly said was hard to discern. Next to it were two scrolls. Unrolling them, you could see that it was techniques that taught two moves. One was for the TM Calm Mind, representing Artema's Wisdom. The next was TM Focus Blast, representing Her Strength. There were also some relics from the temple as well. From a rough guess, it would roughly total to $500 in Modern Currency. You also got a free basket! <br />
<br />
You then could heard an ear-piercing roar, and quickly looked around. Did Araqne manage to come back? No, she was banished. Your Pokemon looked at you a little confused. It seems you were the only one who heard it. Suddenly, a giant rift opened in front of you. It was indescribable. It was something that in itself could very well destroy the fabric of reality. You could tell it was part of Dialga's Gate, but also incredibly corrupted. It looked like this would be a one way trip back, and due to the variance of the portal's size, it was going to close fast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rory!&quot; Where are you!?&quot; You heard a familiar voice yelling. You knew who it was, but you had no time left. It was now or never. You had to leave, or be forced to stay. But there was no choice here. You already knew what you'd to in the very beginning. Safe travels, you'll need it. </span><br />
<br />
And this concludes your adventure in Dialga's Gate, I hope you enjoyed it! Also, please keep your hands, arms, legs, and feet inside the portal at all times. Thank you for flying Dialga's Gate Rayshift, and have a wonderful day. We do hope you enjoyed your adventure, and unfortunately we will never see you again.</div>

<span style="color: red"><span style="color: plum"><b>meetan</b>: As you might have expected, your words are little consolation to Buzzwole. The burly Bug type hammers the ground with his fists, each impact leaving a small crater. After a few moments of this, he gradually calms down somewhat, but the atmosphere is still one of intense gloominess. Even the merry Junpei wears a stark frown on his face, his shoulders deflated and hunched. However, Kaito seems ... thoughtful. Brow knitted, the young man stands with his arms crossed, his expression comical were it not for the seriousness of the situation. Finally, his eyes widen, the exaggerated shift in his body language nothing short of a caricatured light bulb moment. </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: red"><span style="color: plum">&quot;So I can't be entirely sure - I am far from an expert - but the guy mentioned coordinates, right? You can't just guess those, there has to be some sort of method or calculation. I know for sure it takes a skilled man to create a map, for example.&quot;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: red"><span style="color: plum">You stare at the painter, barely managing to stop yourself from wondering aloud where he was going with this. Kaito pick up on this, holding a hand up. </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: red"><span style="color: plum">&quot;Bear with me. So they need to generate coordinates somehow, and they've been using these ... machine things, right? So isn't it possible that they have something here to transmit those coordinates back to where- whenever they came from?&quot; </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: red"><span style="color: plum">The change in Buzzwole is immediate. Rushing forwards, the titan claps a hand to the back of Kaito, exaggeratedly pointing to him in an over the top showering of praise. Despite this potential revelation, there was an obvious problem - where would this assumed machine be? </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: red"><span style="color: plum">That was when it caught your eye. A small strip of black fabric lay near the holes created by Buzzwole. It was too modern to originate from time period - it had to belong to the businessman.</span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: plum">Alice reeled back as the Buzzwole began to take his anger out on the ground. There was more damage to the beautiful garden as the Pokemon slammed craters here and there, and the young woman was visibly shaken by it. She was left feeling sad and useless at the creature's sorrow, and looking to Junpei, she saw that he was suffering from the same feelings. To his credit, he did bounce back with the kind of animation that one would expect from him, and Alice wondered what was coming next.<br />
<br />
She listened with obvious confusion. The coordinates thing was true, but it wasn't like they would know where to find those. It was a start, though, she'd give him that, and for now it would give them some purpose. Before then, Alice had wondered what she possibly could've done next. Even Buzzwole seemed to have brightened up, and before Alice knew it, she was smiling too. She still felt empty on the inside, but light was starting to break through the clouds. &quot;Yeah, and I'm sure there'd be ways to find those. We can figure it out. Pokemon tend to be sensitive to anomalies in their environment, even a poor Magikarp could lend a flipper when it comes to transmissions and their senses and stuff.&quot; She explained, beginning to feel more optimistic as she went on. Part way through her rambles, though, Alice spotted something odd on the ground and moved to pick it up.<br />
<br />
Fabric? Alice frowned at it. &quot;I think that douchebag dropped this.&quot; The trainer remarked casually, but was there anything special about it?</span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: springgreen">Rory's words seemed to befuddle the Dewpider, but eventually the small arachnid accepted the offer, entering the Premier Ball and with only a very brief wobble the orb gave the telltale ding, the teen grinning at the newest member of the squad. Speaking of which, Xigua and Lesath certainly appeared to have grown from the encounter, and as he recalled the Drapion and Masquerain, leaving his support pokemon out as always, he wondered once more why he was brought here, and began to think to himself if it really was Artema's will. Surely the goddess couldn't possibly open a hole in time, could she?<br />
<br />
His train of thought was stopped as one of the priestesses approached, simple garb and lengthy hair swaying against the damaged backdrop, and the intention was clear: the temple priestesses were thanking him for saving not only their lives, but likely that of many others in the city. Taking a look over the contents, he found a handmade pouch of silver powder, with some sort of ancient Grecian inscription, most likely a blessing of the goddess. A couple of scrolls were also contained, which appeared to be technique scrolls, precursor to the mass produced TMs of his time. One of wisdom, one of strength, and numerous relics from the temple, which seemed quite valuable. Plus the woven basket. Very nice to carry a picnic in.<br />
<br />
As he stood there and watched the clergy make their way to the temple once more, likely to begin repairs, he was startled by an incredible roar, one that seemd to ripple through the fabric of time itself. Xigua jumped suddenly too, the Wimpod instantly on edge, and as the two looked around quickly, the bug type looked up at him puzzled. &quot;Y-you didn't hear that, Xig?&quot; he gasped incredulously, but the bug pokemon's curiosity was answered as a massive tear in space opened before him, and the energy emanating from it seemed familiar, akin to what he felt when he entered this time. <i>Is this...a way out?</i> Yet, something was off about it. It seemed...tainted, almost corrupt. The wormhole rippled, almost as if its existence was an affront to the Grecan Gods, and he could tell it was about to collapse. He was wary, yet a voice from beyond called to him. A voice that was somewhat familiar...<br />
<br />
&quot;...is that...that Alex guy? How'd he find us?&quot; the youth mused, but his confusion was swiftly cleared up. If that was him, then the other side would surely be safe. Xigua looked up at him, and the bug trainer knew there was only one option. Bracing himself, he called back through the portal. &quot;Just coming! What's going on!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Stepping forth, Rory left the Grecan city and returned to his own time, where he would discover almost immediately how the veteran had found him.</span><br />
<br />
Collecting the above goodies, and many thanks for the quick conclusion to this fun adventure.</div>

Once you start inspecting the piece of fabric, you notice something... awful about it. There was this horrid, nose wrenching scent emanating from the piece of fabric. It was surprising that you hadn't even noticed it before. But, it was certainly distinct... It was the smell of arsenic. How such a toxic substance was washed into this cloth you had no idea, but this would probably lead to the source of what was happening in the garden. <br />
<br />
You were luckily not the only one who smelled in, and Buzzwole immediately snatched the cloth from your hands. It was, after all, dangerous for you to hold it. Taking a sniff with its giant mosquito nose mouth thing, Buzzwole immediately flexes and starts dashing off deeper into the garden. You hastily follow, as well as the rest of your team. <br />
<br />
After what feels like a kilometre or so, you see Buzzwole, and your destination. The giant red Ultra Beast is hunkered over, seeming to inspect something... And then the stench hits you. It's so bad you instinctively cover your nose. Peering over, you notice some sort of machine. It was obvious that this was from the modern age, and what was causing the issue. <br />
<br />
But eerily enough, there was no one guarding it. The answer soon became obvious, as a giant rift appeared before you. It was the portal of Dialga's Gate. And it was looking increasingly unstable. You had to go, now. <br />
<br />
Buzzwole took notice of this, and smashed the machine into smithereens. It then looked at you and flexed with all of its might. It was a sort of thank you for helping it protect the garden. It was certainly bittersweet, not fully being able to solve this mystery with Buzzwole. but the Ultra Beast understood how fragile time and space was. <br />
<br />
The giant mosquito then handed you something in a weird capsule. Was this from Buzzwole's planet? Inside seemed to be a picture of Buzzwole, carved into a rock. Besides this little trinket, there was were two TMs. One for Bulk Up, and then one for TM Megahorn. There also seemed to be some rare, valuable obsidian from Buzzwole's planet, that was worth about $500. Lastly, there was a Muscle Band, with a little inscription stating: &quot;Train hard, and you could be like me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Buzzwole than gave you a wink before seeming to urge you to go through the portal. It would be fine, it could create a wormhole back to its own plane of existence, but this was your last chance. The portal seemed to be closing with every second, and with your goodbyes said you needed to run. </span><br />
<br />
And that concludes your adventure. I wish I could've given you more, but the gate is closing in two hours. I hope you enjoy this very swift conclusion of your time with Buzzwole.</div>

</blockquote><span style="color: plum">The smell was absolutely horrendous, and that said something, because Alice wasn't that sensitive to most smells. Coffee and red wine scents? Yuck! But she hadn't encountered anything else that had put her off for a long time. She jumped a bit as Buzzwole suddenly snatched the fabric from her, but it was probably better away from her nose all the same. What she hadn't anticipated was the Ultra Beast suddenly jetting off. &quot;Oh, for god's sake. Does nobody communicate anymore?&quot;<br />
<br />
So, off they all went on a merry chase to fetch the intergalactic chad, and eventually, they found him. Alice found the nasty smell first, covering her nose as best she could. Even Jasper looked repulsed. More importantly, though, was that the source of their problems had been found... And yet another one appeared. There was the portal to her time, hailing her with urgency. Alice faltered, heart sinking. She hadn't been in Niha for long at all-- less than a day, less than a day to spend with Kaito and Junpei and Buzzwole... And now it had to end? The crushing of the machine barely phased her through that turmoil, and it took Buzzwole's approach to tear her from her feelings and back into the present moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... Thank you. These are really sweet. Thank you so much.&quot; Alice didn't bother to hide the emotions spilling over in her voice as she looked at the contents of the capsule. Maybe he was a celebrity on his home world given the picture and the Band. She would treasure these things always, and make good use of the more practical gifts in his honour. There wasn't much time left, though, and Alice could barely hug them all goodbye before dashing off to where she and her own Pokemon belonged.<br />
<br />
And not without regret. Alice hoped that she wouldn't forget her story with them, given that they were unlikely to ever meet again.</span></div>

<span style="color: red"><b>Mana Opal</b>: As Nadie flutters from your arm, using her telekinetic powers to gingerly gather the scattered swords to place them back in their cart, the guard frowns. For a moment, it seems like he is going to further press the issue of your origins, but soon his steel vanishes, replaced once more with the former warmth. Offering you a hand to shake, he introduces himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Legate Tiberius. I say Legate ... but the title only comes from my being the highest ranking officer currently stationed here.&quot;<br />
<br />
It is clear that this slight on his rank wounds him - whether this was irritation or insecurity was not as obvious. All the same, his cheery disposition is resurgent. For a military man, his easygoing charm was surprisingly disarming. <br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, your assistance is greatly appreciated. You may be mysterious, but you're clearly not a threat. Please feel welcome to enjoy the festival. Given that public show, chances are you'll be treated as something of a guest of honour.&quot;<br />
<br />
A knowing smile crosses his face as he nods towards a nearby group of villagers, each of them sharing hushed words with one another - but their body language was that of admiration and intrigue, rather than pointed suspicion. Sticking around for a while might be enjoyable, all things considered. <br />
<br />
As you go about watching the festivities, you find yourself dragged along by excited youngsters, Hours seem to pass as you lose yourself in the frivolity, night slowly but surely setting in. A huge bonfire it lit in the centre of the village, food and drink enjoyed by all. Eventually, celebrations begin to die down - and then without warning, a loud crack rings through your head. A rift opens before you, dragging you in before you can react, and everything goes black. <br />
<br />
You are shortly deposited at the entrance to the Gate. Hurriedly checking your belongings, you find the ball containing Honedge. It hadn't been a dream. Then a voice can be heard. The sound is otherworldly, approximating human speech close enough for you to understand, but alien enough that it sends shivers down your spine. <br />
<br />
&quot;The Gate is collapsing and time is correcting itself.&quot;</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0)">The Warrior's Feast was certainly fun, if ultimately little else. It hadn't taken a whole lot of time loosely mingling with the villagers for Amicae to come to the conclusion that despite the Romman origins of her current name, this place- or perhaps just this era of history- was certainly unrelated to her past. It just didn't<i> feel</i> quite correct. Perhaps expecting the nomenclative angle to mean anything was expecting too much, in retrospect- it was given to her by Chroma, who certainly had a habit of pulling from different languages when naming... almost anything, really. <br />
<br />
Of course, figuring that out so soon meant she and her pokemon (that weren't incapacitated or the cause of mass panic just a few hours earlier) could freely enjoy the rest of the evening with the local population. It was certainly true that she could have attempted to try and pass herself off as one of the region's many deities, what with her status as a strange but skilled traveler, unusual scarring, and tools immensely unlike anything these people had ever seen or ever will see, but that was clearly something that was best kept a wistful fantasy. Even if most of the citizenry somehow fell for such a ruse, Tiberius had already expressed his mild suspicion of her, and ticking off the head of the village guard was probably not a remotely wise decision! That didn't mean that she couldn't attempt to be less dramatic with her tricks, however, and so she, Nadie, and Fontaine spent some time performing tricks that weren't possible with this century's technology, but also weren't so terribly outlandish as to put everyone on edge. After all, many of these guys were people who didn't even know the extent of their own country's mechanical prowess, so surely they'd just think she's from a big city or something, right?<br />
<br />
~ ~ ~<br />
<br />
&quot;...The rift really is getting especially unstable now, isn't it?&quot; Chroma pondered aloud, worry obviously dripping from her voice. &quot;I don't think it's remotely safe for us to try and go in after her now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unfortunately not,&quot; the silver-haired figure accompanying her replied. &quot;Chances are high that unless it ejects her back to our time, she's going to have to truly start her life anew. Again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Neither person could help but flinch when the spatiotemporal gap fluctuated again, this time far more violently than its flickering beforehand. &quot;I <i>really</i> don't like this, Silic. It really looks like she waited too long for this excursion...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait. I'm picking up som-&quot; Whatever the young man was trying to say was drowned out as the rift suddenly loosed a deafening roar... before spitting out a tired but panicked-looking figure unceremoniously onto the concrete before the pair. A bizarre voice intoned that 'the Gate has closed', whatever that meant, and then the unstable portal dissipated completely. A moment passed as all three processed what just happened, before Amicae was suddenly smothered in an impromptu and almost surprisingly tear-filled group hug.<br />
<br />
