The priest fixes you with what seems to be the next in a never-ending series of strange looks. After a few seconds, he seems to grow antsy, shuffling in place and knitting his brows as he very clearly becomes lost in thought. “The priestesses will be sacrificed to end this plague,” he mutters wistfully, and you get the distinct feeling that he isn’t talking to you, His expression grows sad at this acknowledgement of the events to come. Suddenly, his posture stiffens.<br />
<br />
“I cannot leave the temple,” he announces, and this time he’s definitely talking to you, his steely blue eyes fixed upon you unwaveringly. Despite his visible determination, he seems hesitant to continue speaking, his mouth hanging open in a single silent syllable as he once again becomes thoughtful. After a beat, he claps his hands together, and his gaze refocuses on you once more. “I cannot leave this temple,” he repeats. “And then senate has made up their minds. The priestesses-... listen. I have served this temple since the cusp of manhood. I know well that the deaths of those girls will not please Artema. She is neither a cruel nor a vengeful goddess, but if we harm the innocent, those which have served her absolutely-... calamity will befall us. She will not abide our sins!”<br />
<br />
He seems borderline frantic, suddenly; a huge departure from his cool, almost frigid demeanor just moments before. The imminent demise of the priestesses seems to truly trouble him, enough so to undermine his facade. Despite this, he is evidently unwilling to leave the temple to protect them -- his devotion to his position and to Artema must be devout indeed. He closes the distance between the two of you, latching onto your arm with a cool hand.<br />
<br />
“You are an outsider,” he observes. “This does not concern you. Yet-... I will take your help, because I cannot let things play out as they are. Listen,” he echoes, sternly, as he fishes something out of his robes with his free hand. It proves to be a scroll, which he holds out just under your nose. “The font of Artema is outside the city. The solution to this problem lies there -- I am certain of it. The senate will not listen, but if you truly desire to help us, then go there. Do what you will with the descendents of Araqne, but you must not bring harm to them. It is not our place to punish those which have already been punished by the gods.”<br />
<br />
The next thing you know, he’s shoved the scroll into your hand, and you’ve been grabbed by the shoulders, and then pushed the entire distance back to the temple entrance. The priest does not seem angry, only desperate and urgent; so much so that Xigua can hardly keep up. He does not cross the threshold as he ejects you back out onto the pronaos.<br />
<br />
By the time you recover your bearings, the heavy doors of the temple have slammed just behind you. Momentarily at a loss, you do the only immediate thing that you <i>can</i> do, which is unroll the scroll that had been forced upon you. You barely have to glance it, before you recognize the pattern of streets and buildings, all neatly labelled in a language that is definitely not your own, but which -- bizarrely -- you can nonetheless read. This is a map, and just like the priest has said, the font lies outside the city, next to what appears to be another temple, and a cave. It looks like a long walk, assuming you’re interpreting proportions correctly. You’re still psyching yourself up for whatever it is that you’ve gotten yourself into, when the door behind you creaks open again. Turning to look, you find that it isn’t the priest, but rather a young boy. He’s dressed similarly to the priest, but less ornately, and his head is shaved.<br />
<br />
“P-pardon me-” he says, almost shly, as he thrusts a single arm out of the door -- it seems he also cannot leave the temple. Clutched in his outstretched hand is the handle of a basket, which is overflowing with goods. “Father Pagonia wishes for me to give this to you. He says you will need all the help that you can get.”<br />
<br />
Patiently, the boy waits for you to take the basket, and then he closes the doors on you as well: politeness, it seems, is not virtue in this sect. Looking at the basket of goods, you recognize some of the items as being among the offerings you had just recently seen. Did the priest pilfer the offerings? That doesn’t seem like a very pious thing to do, but given his clear devotion, he must have felt it was justifiable for the greater good. It seems he must be very desperate for help, indeed.<br />
<br />
Courtesy of the priest and his altar boy, you’ve obtained x02 Berry Juices, x02 Rare Candies, x01 Bug Gem, x05 Ice Berries, and x01 Never-melt Ice. <br />

You’re far away from home -- presumably -- but utterly undaunted. In fact, you don’t seem phased at all to be in the middle of a desert in a time period clearly not your own. The small boat that brought you up the delta of the Dile River has stopped in the small port city of Heroth, and this is where you get off. Clutching the ball at your belt to assure that it is still there, you make a beeline for the distant image of the marketplace, its colorful tents beckoning you like a rainbow after a rainstorm. You receive some odd looks from passerby -- presumably for your manner of dress -- but being by the river the townsfolk have seen their fair share of travellers, and most ultimately write you up as being weird, but only in a foreign sense. If only they knew the truth, they would filled with questions: where are you from? How did you get here? What is a Dialgia? But that’s not important right now. What’s important is your single-minded goal: the marketplace.<br />
<br />
The smell of fresh bread hits you as you grow near. Everything from produce to textiles surround you, and the people mill about en masse. For someone from a small town, the crowd alone might prove overwhelming.<br />
<br />
“You look lost,” someone says, jerking you from your awe. Looking around, it takes a moment for you to locate the source: a little girl, in local dress, is standing at your feet, her hair in several braids. “You’re not from around here, are you?” She surmises, chest puffing out proudly. Reaching into a small bag slung over her shoulder, she produces a handful of small sweets, which she offers to you. “My father owns a tavern at the end of the street,” she informs, as she dumps the candies into your hand. “So I know a foreigner when I see one! If you’re lost, you should come!”<br />
<br />
With that, she runs off, down the street. What an odd exchange. As you watch her harass more people as she makes her way down the street -- all of them dressed oddly, compared to the locals running the stalls -- you realize she’s likely just doing her job, by spreading the word of her father’s business. Were the sweets an incentive to win you over? More odd, however, is what occurs to you next: she was not speaking any language that you knew, and yet you somehow understood her. That’s not normal… right? Maybe you should follow her to her family’s tavern. Or you could keep looking around the market.<br />
<br />
You’ve obtained x03 Rare Candies, courtesy of the little girl.<br />

The king looked pleased that you were willing to do the task given to you. After all, it was what he expected. A king was still a king, no matter what era he hailed from. He was the law of the land, and if you disobeyed his word, well, the prices were high. Regardless, you were confidant enough to know that your Pokemon would be able to handle the challenges the labyrinth would give you. After all, you've had countless adventures with them before, some of them just as or even more dangerous as the task you were given now. <br />
<br />
With a wave, the royal guards came towards you. The motioned you to follow, and you started to walk deeper into the castle. While the entrance and first floor of the castle was beautiful, the deeper floors became more dank and mundane. Then again, it made sense. Guest weren't usually allowed or even thought of going this deep. It was for the servants who worked in the castle, and the even lower floors were for the slaves who tended the fields around the castle. To go from bright sunlight to this everyday... It must be as huge blow to one's psyche.<br />
<br />
Soon enough, you reach the bottom floor, deep underground. You see an ornate gate, decorate in golds and silvers. Bars of some sort of metal was firmly acting as a barrier, and you could see small dents. The Minotaur knows the maze that lies beyond this gate, and surely he'd have been here before. You also notice a woman waiting for you at the gate, with regal clothing and an air of royalty to her. Yet, at the same time, was a look of youth. She couldn't be no more older than 18. You could tell she was struggling trying to say something in your tongue, but she tried her best to convey what she wanted to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here... Help... Him...&quot; She said, handing you spindle of thread before asking her guard to return her to her quarters. <br />
<br />
Help him? Does she mean the Minotaur? You wonder why. It seems that the guards are waiting on you to say you're ready before you enter the maze. You at least have some time to prepare here. After all, you're not coming out until the Minotaur is gone. <br />
<br />
What do you do?</span>

<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: #00ff80">As Gary descended down through lower levels of the castle and into the dungeon depths below, he quickly noticed the shift from the extravagant splendor of art and architecture into cold, lifeless, and bland stone walls. Clearly this wasn’t a place that was used to show off nor was it a destination that people would seek out on a regular basis. It was dark down here, with the only thing to illuminate the way being torchlight.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not everything down here was mundane however. As Gary finally reached a point of no longer needing to traverse downwards, an ornate golden gate appeared before him. This was clearly the entrance to the labyrinth where a young lady in royal garments awaited him. Her English was shoddy at best, but she managed to emit three words that Gary was able to chain together into syntax. “Here… Help… Him…” Gary wondered who it was she was referring to, but he guessed it must have been the Minotaur. As to why she requested this, he would have to find out for himself.<br />
<br />
<br />
The final parting message the girl bequeathed onto Gary was a spindle of thread. He already understood the significance of this item; he knew of the myth from his studies. According to legend, the hero Theseus was given a spool of thread so that he could retrace his steps while he navigated the labyrinth so that he wouldn’t get lost. Well, it was now Gary’s turn to do the same as he took the spindle from the girl and thanked her with a smile and a bow. Even if she couldn’t understand him, he knew the gesture should at least convey his message. As the guards looked at him expectantly, Gary knew it was time to prepare himself for the quest before him.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gary reached down to his belt and pulled out two Luxury Balls. “Come on out, you two,” he said as two quick bursts of light revealed a Phanpy and a Riolu. “I’m sorry that I’m not calling you out at a beach or anything like that, but you guys are perfect for the job at hand.” Trunks the Phanpy and Natsu the Riolu looked around curiously and huddled closely to their trainer’s side. “We’ve got a Minotaur to track down so I need the best of your senses to guide us. Trunks, use your trunk to <b>Sleuth </b>out any <b>Odors</b>, and Natsu I’m counting on your <b>Foresight </b>to sense out any unusual auras. Got it?” The two Pokemon quickly nodded as they got their game faces on and readied themselves to head into the labyrinth. Gary held the spindle of thread in his hand, ready to start unraveling it as they proceeded onwards.</span></div>

You stare down your opponent, the final test in front of you. Sprocket pipes up with a pokedex entry giving you the rundown on the Cofarigus. The ghost type would provide a challenge to your own Psychic typed Gallade but Heimdall has his own tricks that you hope to match it with. Heimdall starts off by clashing his arm blades together in a spinning dance to sharpen them up and increase his offensive powers. The Cofagrigus replies by spewing out a purplish ominous wind of ghostly energies, washing over Heimdall painfully. Recognizing the move you hold your breath for a second but can tell from the movements of the ghost pokemon staying the same that it hasn't received any boost from the ghastly move. You call out to your Gallade and he moves in for his own offense and with blades glowing black he slashes at the Cofagrigus, who similar to a turtle retreats into the coffin to take the blow. You can tell there is a gash where Heimdall hit it as the limbs reappear but not as deep a gash as you would have expected. It seems that the Coffin pokemon has quite the natural defenses that would need to be overcome. But as Heimdall retreats back you notice ethereal mummy wrappings around his arms. They don't seem to hamper his movement at all but you can tell that impacting the Cofagrigus affected something in Heimdall. The ghost pokemon then lets a pulse of dark energy into the ground and it washes once again into the Gallade, not as strong of a hit but nothing to sneeze at either. You and Heimdall wait for that boost to strength that usually accompanies him getting hit by a dark type move but nothing seems to come. The Cofagrigus rears up for more attacks, what will you do?

Mint watched intently as the battle began. While Heimdall used his Swords Dance to boost his offensive capabilities, the guardian Ghost-Type used an Ominous Wind to strike for super effective damage. Ohhhhhh dear, that was not Mint's idea of fun. At the very least, the ghost clearly didn't get the boost that occasionally came with the move, but with the Cofagrigus packing a firm mechanical advantage over Heimdall for sure now, Mint knew she couldn't let this drag on for too long. <br />
<br />
<br />
As Heimdall struck back with Night Slash, ghostly wrappings seemed to surround Heimdall's body, but neither battler was particularly concerned. Both Trainer and, by extension, Pokemon, had known going in that they would have trouble defeating this Pokemon without the help of a contact move, so Mint had planned for Cofagrigus' Mummy Ability right from the start. Predictably, as if to drive the point home, the Cofagrigus used Dark Pulse, as if taunting the pair that Heimdall's Justified Ability had been suppressed when the move did not trigger the Attack boost that most would have expected. Still, neither challenger was concerned, circumventing that very trick had been the point of using Swords Dance first anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, Heimdall, just stay calm and keep it up! Lay up a <b>Future Sight</b> for later and then hit it with another <b>Night Slash!</b> We'll really lower the boom next round, got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>I understand. Now, then!</i> Heimdall responded, readying the first of the two attacks with a golden gleam in his eyes.</span></div>

<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: #ff0000">Darius smirked hearing your response, it was seemingly something he expected as his grin widened. Honesty was valued in Romma, very highly so. Although the prowess of a warrior was of the highest value, bearing the image of a true warrior --- with heart and steady tongue were also of value to the people, especially the emperor who felt as though his warriors were not up to snuff. <br />
<br />
&quot;I knew there was something I liked about you.&quot; He turned to Remus, who had returned to a position by the door, merely waiting idle for Darius' next command. &quot;Remus, take Lord Masters to the barracks.&quot; Darius stroked his chin, a coying smirk playing on his lips as he began to speak once again. &quot;Why not have him start with Tatius? That boy of yours could <i>certainly</i> use the help.&quot; Remus inhaled sharply, a clear indication that the words had stung. Darius' smirk grew seeing Remus squirm under his words, you felt a little uneasy at the display... but you knew better than to upset the Emperor. Remus turned, opening the door to the Emperor's chambers and beginning to exit. You knew better than to dawdle, following behind Remus. <br />
<br />
Sticking close behind him you moved through the winding corridors, passing by a small caged door you noticed that the Colosseum had been emptied. Only the warriors remained, a few standing stoic while a different Captain shouted commands at them. You pondered how many Captains there were, as you had only been faced with Remus at this point. You could hardly make out the voice over the cries of their Pokemon sparing in the arena. You stopped in front of the caged door, watching as a flurry of cries and attacks sprang out of the other Pokemon. Remus seemed aware the you had stopped, placing a hand on your shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aie. That's Sabine.&quot; He spoke with a certain sense of pride in his voice as he gestured to the other captain. &quot;Sabine is a master trainer. Not really the battling type but certainly knows a thing or two about Pokemon.&quot; Remus gave a hollow sigh as he continued to speak. &quot;Sabine, however, has given up on Tatius... Everyone has.&quot; He shook his head with a sense of disdain. &quot;Darius is placing him on your shoulders because he wants you to fail.&quot; Remus patted your shoulder and continued to guide you down to the Barracks. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have faith in you though, lad. If anyone can teach that boy to fight, it's you.&quot; He gave you a soft smile as you entered the Barracks, &quot;That battle you had out there was something else. I think Tatius could benefit from a tutor like you.&quot; He nodded, looking out at a few of the men clad in armor. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tatius!&quot; He called out, causing you to hear a shocked cry as a shorter man approached you from the crowd. Seeing him previously, you knew this was in fact Tatius. Remus looked over him, placing a hand on his shoulder. &quot;Son, Agramas has placed you under the new champion's wing. He's going to teach you some battling tricks...&quot; Tatius' face twisted up into a snarl hearing that he was working with you, especially upon hearing his father give you so much praise. Nonetheless, he moved forward coming to face you.<br />
<br />
&quot;... Nice to meet you.&quot; He breathed out, extending a hand. His eyes were barren, he looked like someone who had been defeated far too many times. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're welcome to use one of the training areas!&quot; Remus called out, &quot;I'm sure Sabine would also allow you some space in the main area if you'd prefer that.&quot;<br />
<br />
The ball is in your court for training Tatius... <b><i>what do you do?</i></b></span></span><br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 18px"><span style="color: plum"><u>Maskerade</u></span></span>&#8203;</div><br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: plum">The Zorua's face twisted up upon seeing the Pokeball. It certainly recognized the device that you had just produced, and it seemed reluctant to enter it. Placing the ball in front of it, you did your best to articulate why the creature needed to be in this Pokeball. It was not something you wanted to subject it to but for it's own safety around the people of Niha it needed to remain inside. The creature's ears drooped, but it seemed to understand. It felt a certain kinship to you, you had fed it and shown it more kindness than it had ever felt in the past. It gave a small nod, touching the button of the Pokeball with it's nose and entering the spherical device. <br />
<br />
A relieved sigh crossed your lips as you picked up the Pokeball and clutched the stunning Heart shaped scale in your hands. Hiding the Pokeball in your robes you began to hobble towards the temple once again, sure that the people would be thrilled to hear that the horrific kitsune that had preyed on their offerings would never bother them again. <br />
<br />
As you approached the temple, you noticed the young couple that had previously scared off the Zorua sticking around. The woman clutched her chest and gave a soft smile seeing you approach. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Thank Megami! You're alright!&quot; The woman cheered happily, looking at your disheveled appearance. If only she truly knew what you had been through, but you bit your tongue. <br />
<br />
&quot;And what of the kitsune?&quot; Asked her male companion, approaching you with a curious glint in his eyes. You explained that the kitsune had been dealt with, flashing the Heart Scale as proof that you had taken some of it's horde after it was dealt with. The man gave a happy sigh, scratching the back of his head and giving a hearty grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, stranger!&quot; His female companion gave a small bow, nodding to you as thanks. &quot;Finally people will be able to pray in peace.&quot; He looked towards the temple. &quot;I'm sure the goddess will be pleased as well.&quot; He suddenly shook his head, realizing that he had trailed off. &quot;Forgive me, I got lost in thoughts of being able to finally have my offerings go to the intended recipient.&quot; He chuckled slightly, looking to his female companion. She suddenly spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;We... don't really have a lot we can give you.&quot; She spoke with a sense of sorrow in her voice, as they certainly appreciated your help with the Kitsune. &quot;B-but!&quot; She suddenly piped up again, glancing at her male companion. &quot;We did find this odd stone after you left to find the Kitsune. I've never seen anything like it.&quot; She reached into her kimono producing a small diamond shaped crystal, black in color. You eyes lit up seeing the crystal, feeling the power of <b><i>darkness</i></b> resonating through it. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'd also like to offer you something... from both of us and on behalf of the goddess.&quot; The man produced three pink balls of rice, some beautifully decorated <b>mochi cakes</b>. &quot;My wife and I always offered our mochi to Megami... but the kitsune would always nab them. I know it's not really enough to thank you for what you've done..&quot; He trailed off, placing them in your hand. As the man continued speaking, his wife turned pointing to a large purple tear that had seemingly popped up out of nowhere near the shrine.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what is that..?&quot; She asked, fearfully. Her husband turned, looking at the tear. <br />
<br />
&quot;What in Megami..?&quot; He asked. Despite their confusion, you knew exactly what this tear was... a way back home. You sighed happily, Megami must have heard your prayer and decided to help you for helping her patrons. <br />

</blockquote><span style="color: red">Perhaps quite ominously, the notion of Keith being possibly not up to the task seemed to be more or less exactly what Darius wanted to hear. He seemed to have been reassured that there was indeed something about Keith he liked. His honesty, perhaps? Keith was not one to mislead others, not unless he had a damn good reason for it.<br />
<br />
Darius addressed Remus next, telling him to have Keith start with Tatius. Tatius... where had Keith heard that name before...? The notion of this Tatius needing the help seemed to hit Remus where it hurt, and it was in that instant it occurred to Keith- Tatius was the Nidorino Trainer who lost to Gallus's Gengar!<br />

As Remus led Keith down, he noticed that the Colosseum had been emptied. Mostly, anyway. He stopped to observe- another captain was in there, shouting commands. Clearly, training was going on in there. Remus, noticing what had caught Keith's attention, identified the captain as Sabine. A master Trainer, more skilled in Pokémon knowledge than in actual battling... and one of many people to have given up on Tatius. Indeed, he was certain that the task of training Tatius had been given to Keith with the express intent that he fail at it. &quot;Does he, now,&quot; Keith remarked. He didn't like the sound of being set up for failure, but at the same time, this only instilled in him a burning desire to not fail. He was stubborn like that, as those who knew him well (or even just qualified as a casual acquaintance of him) would be able to attest to.<br />
<br />
However, Remus had more faith in Keith than that. Having seen the battle Keith waged against Gallus, he was confident that Keith would have what it took. With that, he called Tatius over, explaining that the new Champion would be working with him. And Tatius did <i>not</i> look happy about that. He shook Keith's hand, and Keith could see his eyes. Those were the eyes of a man who's seen far more defeat than he'd ever have wanted to see in his lifetime.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you too, Tatius,&quot; Keith responded as he shook Tatius's hand. &quot;I'm Keith Masters.&quot; He nodded at Remus as the man explained his options for where they could train. &quot;One of the training areas would be perfectly fine, thank you,&quot; Keith replied.<br />
<br />
Once all this was done, once Keith and Tatius were in one of the training areas, the former turned to the latter. &quot;...I'm gonna say one thing right away,&quot; Keith said. &quot;You've lost your share of battles. I'm sure you might be inclined to argue more than your fair share. I'll tell you this- so have I. Every Pokémon Trainer in history has lost at least some battles, and those who claim they haven't are lying. Here's the first thing you should know- losing a battle, that doesn't make you a failure. Losing a battle is something to learn from, something to help you improve. Now, then,&quot; he said. &quot;I saw a little bit of your last battle, but not a lot of it. II want to start things off by getting a better idea of how you battle, so I'd like to see how your Nidorino fares against one of my own warriors,&quot; he stated, producing an Ultra Ball and tossing it into the air. In a flash of light, there appeared Six, Keith's Amoonguss, with cap and shield markings that matched the ball he was contained in. Keith's wording was rather literal- Six, as his markings indicated, was a descendant of the Ultramoonguss, a tribe of warrior Amoonguss long since thought extinct. Six, shy as he usually was, got the feeling that a battle was imminent, and looked ready for it. Keith, seeing this, grinned, then gave a nod to Tatius.</span></div>

Wincing at the super effective damage from the ghost pokemon's type advantaged moves you know you have to wrap this up and deal a lot of damage quickly before you give the guardian of the tomb a chance. Luckily when the mummy wrappings manifested around Heimdall, it didn't slow either of you down a bit. It was in your plans to know this would happen, preemptively increasing your Gallade's attack power to make up for the temporary loss of his ability, even when the cofagrigus taunts you with a move that would have triggered it. But back on the offensive, Heimdall shoots a beam of psychic energy straight at the ghost who braces for impact... which doesn't come. The beam is sucked into a portal just before it hits the cofagrigus, who after realizing that the beam was seemingly a dud, charges up a ball of shadowy energy form between two of his tendril hands and fires it Heimdall, impacting him head-on. Taking a knee from the blow Heimdall winces but quickly gets back to his feet and rushes in. His arm-blades cloaked in the same dark energy he delivers a 3 slash combo into his opponent causing the ghost to wince back from an especially powerful blow. But then both you and Heimdall see a flash in the Cofagrigus' eyes and the Gallade can feel the dark energy fade away. You feel a shiver down your back as Sprocket quietly speaks up confirming your fear. &quot;Disable. Temporarily prevents the last used move from being used again.&quot; With one of your big guns temporarily gone, what will you do?</span></div>

Bringing out two of your trusted companions, you start your trek into the labyrinth. Your Phanpy is quickly able to pick up a strong, musky sent from using his odor sleuth. His trunk shrivels a bit, the scent still incredibly potent despite the faintness of it. Giving a little wave, the little elephant starts to lead the way through the labyrinth. As you follow, you unravel the spindle of thread to leave behind just as the Theseus did in the legend. Behind you was your Riolu, using his foresight to see anything that wouldn't be able to normally be seen.<br />
<br />
For a while, you proceed through the winding paths with little trouble. The only real thing happening was the lowering visibility as headed deeper in. Light did not belong here, only monsters. After all, it was the lair of the Minotaur. You could start smelling the strong, musky scent of the Minotaur yourself, with it seeming to be secreting from the walls. It was certainly a dank smell, though you could smell a faint trace of something else. Trunks also takes notice of that smell, and starts to head towards it. At this point, tracking the Minotaur by its scent alone wouldn't be enough.<br />
<br />
You continue along, staring to see bones in your small field of vision. Trunks was just barely visible in front of you, and Natsu was silent. The only sound heard was the sound of feet heading the cold stone of the labyrinth floor. Time started to not feel like it existed, you couldn't tell if you've been in that place for only a few minutes of a few hours at this point. The silence was certainly unsettling. <br />
<br />
Though, a loud roar broke that silence. It echoed through the labyrinth, and in response a bloodcurdling scream could be heard. Then silence once more. It seems that you weren't the only one in here, and that whoever was fell victim of the monster living within. You start to notice dried blood caked onto the floor and walls. The bones started the become more and more frequent as well. Your Riolu suddenly jumps in front of both you and Trunks to stop you both. Something dangerous was up ahead, and that caused a creeping sense of dread to crawl up your spine. You look forwards and see a fork in the path. At this point Trunks just plops down, exhausted. Seems that the little guy could only track down so much. There were only two options forwards. Straight ahead or right. Judging by the Riolu's actions, both paths have their fair share of risks. <br />
<br />
What do you do? </span></div>

<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: plum">The Zorua's face twisted up upon seeing the Pokeball. It certainly recognized the device that you had just produced, and it seemed reluctant to enter it. Placing the ball in front of it, you did your best to articulate why the creature needed to be in this Pokeball. It was not something you wanted to subject it to but for it's own safety around the people of Niha it needed to remain inside. The creature's ears drooped, but it seemed to understand. It felt a certain kinship to you, you had fed it and shown it more kindness than it had ever felt in the past. It gave a small nod, touching the button of the Pokeball with it's nose and entering the spherical device. <br />
<br />
A relieved sigh crossed your lips as you picked up the Pokeball and clutched the stunning Heart shaped scale in your hands. Hiding the Pokeball in your robes you began to hobble towards the temple once again, sure that the people would be thrilled to hear that the horrific kitsune that had preyed on their offerings would never bother them again. <br />
<br />
As you approached the temple, you noticed the young couple that had previously scared off the Zorua sticking around. The woman clutched her chest and gave a soft smile seeing you approach. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Thank Megami! You're alright!&quot; The woman cheered happily, looking at your disheveled appearance. If only she truly knew what you had been through, but you bit your tongue. <br />
<br />
&quot;And what of the kitsune?&quot; Asked her male companion, approaching you with a curious glint in his eyes. You explained that the kitsune had been dealt with, flashing the Heart Scale as proof that you had taken some of it's horde after it was dealt with. The man gave a happy sigh, scratching the back of his head and giving a hearty grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, stranger!&quot; His female companion gave a small bow, nodding to you as thanks. &quot;Finally people will be able to pray in peace.&quot; He looked towards the temple. &quot;I'm sure the goddess will be pleased as well.&quot; He suddenly shook his head, realizing that he had trailed off. &quot;Forgive me, I got lost in thoughts of being able to finally have my offerings go to the intended recipient.&quot; He chuckled slightly, looking to his female companion. She suddenly spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;We... don't really have a lot we can give you.&quot; She spoke with a sense of sorrow in her voice, as they certainly appreciated your help with the Kitsune. &quot;B-but!&quot; She suddenly piped up again, glancing at her male companion. &quot;We did find this odd stone after you left to find the Kitsune. I've never seen anything like it.&quot; She reached into her kimono producing a small diamond shaped crystal, black in color. You eyes lit up seeing the crystal, feeling the power of <b><i>darkness</i></b> resonating through it. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'd also like to offer you something... from both of us and on behalf of the goddess.&quot; The man produced three pink balls of rice, some beautifully decorated <b>mochi cakes</b>. &quot;My wife and I always offered our mochi to Megami... but the kitsune would always nab them. I know it's not really enough to thank you for what you've done..&quot; He trailed off, placing them in your hand. As the man continued speaking, his wife turned pointing to a large purple tear that had seemingly popped up out of nowhere near the shrine.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what is that..?&quot; She asked, fearfully. Her husband turned, looking at the tear. <br />
<br />
&quot;What in Megami..?&quot; He asked. Despite their confusion, you knew exactly what this tear was... a way back home. You sighed happily, Megami must have heard your prayer and decided to help you for helping her patrons. </span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px">Taitus' fists clenched as he heard you discussing his fair share of lost battles. To you, it came off as a comforting way to encourage him to keep going and face the challenges ahead. But to him it came off as mocking, a scoff that you had thrown his way to undermine him for his mistakes. That's what he was used to, and he was tired of everyone bringing up his failures. He felt appalled that a commoner, someone that his own father had scooped up off the street had been tasked with training him --- a patented Romma warrior. <br />
<br />
Taitus sighed apathetically as you continued your speech. All he had ever wanted was his father to be proud of him, but how was he supposed to do that when his father had never truly taught him the ins and outs of battle? When he would ask for help all he ever heard was &quot;battling is in your blood, Taitus... it comes naturally&quot;... yet no matter what he tried it just would not come naturally to him like his father promised. He felt out of place, unable to truly grasp what his bloodline was supposed to be so &quot;naturally good&quot; at. <br />
<br />
As you withdrew Six his eyes glazed over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not again...&quot; He murmured to himself, anxious at the thought of having his father ostracize him for losing once again. He took a deep breath, fully ready to lose at the drop of a hat. &quot;Go.. Niro.&quot; He tossed a Pokeball weakly, all passion for battle clearly gone from his body. In the flash of light that followed, a large Nidorino was produced. It sniffed it's surroundings before spotting Six, the clear reason for it being sent out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ro...&quot; It groaned out. Keith eyed the large creature, noticing it's battle scarred body. It's right eye was glazed over, a deep scar running down it's face. Not to mention the various creases and grooves on it's torso. It was clearly uneasy about the thought of a battle, especially after already sustaining serious damage earlier in the day. Taitus sighed, calling Niro over to him and scratching the creature's head. <br />
<br />
&quot;D-don't worry, Niro. W-we can do it.&quot; Taitus' voice trembled as he spoke, clearly not believing the words that were coming out of it. Niro nodded, clearly trusting in it's trainer, despite the losses and injuries it had had to suffer through. It approached Six, head held high and it gave a small bow --- a polite gesture towards your opponent. It was clear that Niro had been raised with respect in mind, something Keith had seen little of in Gallus' Pokemon. Niro took a few steps back, waiting for the commands from his master.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-start with a <b>P-peck</b>!&quot; Called out Taitus, still largely trembling at the thought of the battle that was just beginning to get underway.</span></span></div>

</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: RED">It occurred to Keith, going by Taitus's reaction, that his attempt at a pep talk didn't have <i>quite</i> the intended effect. But Keith was undeterred. He'd known from the start that this task would be a difficult one, and he'd accepted it nonetheless. Even knowing that the emperor put him on this in the hopes that he'd fail, that just made Keith all the more determined to succeed. And not just for his own sake, either- He had a feeling that Taitus could be great, if only he had a little more practice and a lot more confidence. Both of which he intended to help him gain here and now.<br />
<br />
As Niro was sent out, the large Nidorino showed clear signs of damage from earlier in the day, and... well, just overall, really. And it didn't seem too fond of the idea of another battle, but Taitus gave it some reassurance, even without really believing said reassurance himself. But the Nidorino had complete trust in Taitus's words, and faced his opponent, head held high, even giving a small bow. Six, in return, bowed back, never one to be rude.<br />
<br />
And the battle began! Taitus commanded Niro to use Peck, a move Keith saw the value of in this matchup right away- Flying, after all, was super effective against Grass. Of course, that being said, Peck was still a pretty weak move, but even still, it was possible that Niro could do some decent damage with it. &quot;Six! <b>Defense Curl</b>!&quot; Keith commanded. &quot;Then strike back with <b>Payback</b>!&quot; He'd see how this went, and his general idea was to give Taitus advice throughout the battle whenever he deemed necessary.<br />

Miles II<br />
Wincing at the super effective damage from the ghost pokemon's type advantaged moves you know you have to wrap this up and deal a lot of damage quickly before you give the guardian of the tomb a chance. Luckily when the mummy wrappings manifested around Heimdall, it didn't slow either of you down a bit. It was in your plans to know this would happen, preemptively increasing your Gallade's attack power to make up for the temporary loss of his ability, even when the cofagrigus taunts you with a move that would have triggered it. But back on the offensive, Heimdall shoots a beam of psychic energy straight at the ghost who braces for impact... which doesn't come. The beam is sucked into a portal just before it hits the cofagrigus, who after realizing that the beam was seemingly a dud, charges up a ball of shadowy energy form between two of his tendril hands and fires it Heimdall, impacting him head-on. Taking a knee from the blow Heimdall winces but quickly gets back to his feet and rushes in. His arm-blades cloaked in the same dark energy he delivers a 3 slash combo into his opponent causing the ghost to wince back from an especially powerful blow. But then both you and Heimdall see a flash in the Cofagrigus' eyes and the Gallade can feel the dark energy fade away. You feel a shiver down your back as Sprocket quietly speaks up confirming your fear. &quot;Disable. Temporarily prevents the last used move from being used again.&quot; With one of your big guns temporarily gone, what will you do?

</blockquote>Mint grimaced as the Cofagrigus continued its assault with a super effective Shadow Ball. At this rate, the thing may well be able to outpace the duo, and that was far from the sort of though that she particularly wanted to entertain.<br />
<br />
Still, with the Future Sight laid out, she'd have all of this round, and then next round the Future Sight would round off as a stinger hit. In any case, she needed a plan so as to maximize Heimdall's damage output, as who knew what other tricks Cofagrigus would try to pull. Just then, the Cofagrigus' eyes flashed, and the dark energies of his Night Slash attack dissipated, barely hanging around long enough for the Gallade's last slash to do meaningful damage.<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks like Cofagrigus used Disable. We can't use Night Slash for a while!&quot; Sprocket confirmed, causing Mint to smirk. Had this thing not figured out that they had yet to be fazed by any of these attempts to limit Heimdall's potential? <br />
<br />
<i>You already have a plan, I see.</i> came Heimdall's calm, steady voice in her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;You bet I do! Bring in a few extra personnel by way of your <b>Double Team</b>, if you would, and follow by using your <b>Psycho Cut</b> on the limbs extending from it all at once if you can, those should be more susceptible to damage from the energy than the actual sarcophagus would be.&quot; Mint instructed, knowing well that her Swords Dance buff was paying off in spades by this point.<br />
<br />
Sure, Cofagrigus could consider wiping all the clones out at once by way of using Ominous Wind, perhaps, but that would result in less damage than another direct Shadow Ball.</span></div>

<span style="color: red"><span style="font-size: 12px">Six was quick to do what you instructed, perhaps also realizing that the move would certainly do some damage if he did not properly raise it's defenses. Six curled it's body, moving it's mushroom cap in order to block the incoming Peck that was coming in it's direction. As Niro charged forward, it rammed it's face into the large Ultra Ball styled cap that rounded out Six's head. The cap was much sturdier than the actual body and thanks to the defense boost, it did manageable damage to the large mushroom. After feeling the impact of the attack, Six quickly let out a blast of energy that knocked Niro off it's feet. Six remained calm, watching it's opponent as it awaited your next directions.<br />
<br />
Niro rose to it's feet again, it clearly had resolve from the numerous times it had been knocked down in the past. It stood back up proudly, there was no anger in it's expression as it looked it Six, simply an expression of determination. Niro was ready for anything, a win or a loss. He looked back at his master, a clear expression of wonder on his face as he awaited the directions that his master would give.

<br />
&quot;Niro! Are you okay?&quot; Taitus asked, clearly concerned as Niro stood back up and faced him. He gave his trainer a curt nod, gesturing back towards Six. &quot;R-right... um...&quot; He paused, clearly weighing the options in his head. He was so used to someone yelling at him when he took too long to give his Pokemon directions. It was refreshing to be faced with Keith, as you just stood there patiently and waited for him. He suddenly looked up, seemingly sure of what he wanted to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Niro! Start with a <b><i>Focus Energy</i></b>... and then follow it up with <b><i>Confusion</i></b>!&quot; Niro slammed his foot down, focusing all his energy into this next attack as he got amped up. He cried out before sending a blast a blast of psychic energy at Six, landing a<i><b> critical hit </b></i>and damaging Six. Six recoiled from the damage, clearly feeling the sting of the psychic. <br />

<span style="color: red"><span style="font-size: 12px">Six was quick to do what you instructed, perhaps also realizing that the move would certainly do some damage if he did not properly raise it's defenses. Six curled it's body, moving it's mushroom cap in order to block the incoming Peck that was coming in it's direction. As Niro charged forward, it rammed it's face into the large Ultra Ball styled cap that rounded out Six's head. The cap was much sturdier than the actual body and thanks to the defense boost, it did manageable damage to the large mushroom. After feeling the impact of the attack, Six quickly let out a blast of energy that knocked Niro off it's feet. Six remained calm, watching it's opponent as it awaited your next directions.<br />
<br />
Niro rose to it's feet again, it clearly had resolve from the numerous times it had been knocked down in the past. It stood back up proudly, there was no anger in it's expression as it looked it Six, simply an expression of determination. Niro was ready for anything, a win or a loss. He looked back at his master, a clear expression of wonder on his face as he awaited the directions that his master would give. He clearly loved his master unconditionally and despite the consistent and constant losses that they had suffered... he still had faith that his master.<br />
<br />
&quot;Niro! Are you okay?&quot; Taitus asked, clearly concerned as Niro stood back up and faced him. He gave his trainer a curt nod, gesturing back towards Six. &quot;R-right... um...&quot; He paused, clearly weighing the options in his head.

</blockquote><span style="color: red">Keith's strategy was sound- boost Six's Defense, better equipping him to take the damage that would power up his counterattack. Moves like Payback tended to fit Keith's battle style of choice pretty nicely- probably the inevitable result of one's grandmother being better known around Lavaridge Town as the crazy Wobbuffet lady. In any case, however, Six took the Peck reasonably well and struck back with Payback, dealing decent damage in return.<br />
<br />
After showing clear and obvious concern for his Nidorino, Taitus thought about his next move, taking the time he needed. Keith waited patiently- down the line, Taitus would need to be quicker, more decisive, when it came to giving orders in battle, but forcing the issue here and now, Keith didn't think that was the way to achieve it. In his personal experience, thinking quicker in battle came naturally over time. And before long, Taitus gave his next set of commands, and quite effective they were, too- Focus Energy followed by Confusion. Keith was somewhat impressed- Confusion wasn't a move often seen on a Nidorino. Many Trainers, in his experience, didn't even know such a move was an option for the male Nidoran evolution family. But clearly, Taitus knew this well. Niro was clearly well-trained, the Confusion dealing super effective damage, and striking a weak spot on top of it, courtesy of the Focus Energy.<br />
<br />
Keith gave Taitus an approving nod, thinking fast. &quot;Come on, Six!&quot; he called out. &quot;Use <b>Growth</b>, then fight back with <b>Giga Drain</b>!&quot; Giga Drain, of course, wasn't optimal for use on a Poison-type, but Keith was counting on the Growth offsetting that somewhat, allowing Six to heal up at least somewhat respectably well while also dealing out some decent damage at the same time.</span></div>

<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px">The God of Time rages. Its <i>Roar</i>, furious and all-powerful, has ripped open the fabric of time, creating a rift in Fizzytopia where the chronological flow is unstable… Scientists are almost unanimous in their assessment that traversing this breach is highly dangerous, due to the unpredictability of the results - but as with all things forbidden, curiosity can be overpowering…<br />
<br />
The tear is small, almost imperceptible to the naked eye – merely a single point in the outskirts of New Fizz City where reality waves unnaturally, as if one is seeing the landscape ahead through a glass of water. But for those who know how to find it, walking through that rift is like passing a door to a completely different world. One can never know exactly where – or, more importantly, <i>when</i> – they will find themselves, or if another rift will appear to allow them to return, but adventure unfailingly awaits the intrepid explorers every time! All they have to do is hurry, before Dialga calms down once again and the gate is lost…</span><br />

This northern peninsula is home to some of the fiercest, most barbaric fighters in the world, whose strength in combat is only matched by their sailing skills.</i></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: deepskyblue"><span style="font-size: 12px"><i>From a very young age, Scandians are taught to handle three things: an axe, a Pokémon and a boat. Both the axe and the Pokémon stay with them their entire lives; boats are plundered, stolen and swapped as the need arises. They spend most of their lives at sea, sailing to any neighbouring lands yet to be explored, waging war with nations they deem worthy, pillaging and putting to the torch all the others.<br />
<br />
Gods, too, are instruments in their warring ways – all of them said to be favoured by glorious combat and conquest. Scandians honour their deities with blood and victory, or valiant death in the face of a stronger foe. As a result, they fear nothing, living only for the thrill of battle, and that makes them all the more dangerous. (please reply in deepskyblue)</i><br />

<br />
<b><u>Borg Keep</u></b>: Home to the Jarl of Scandia, Bernhardt Ivarson, a massive fortress of rock and ice that has never been conquered. Riches plundered from other lands are brought here, where the Jarl keeps the lion’s share and divides the remaining spoils between the warriors who claimed the most lives in the raid. Tasks Bernhardt needs taken care of, either within Scandia borders or across the sea, are issued here by the Jarl himself, who isn’t particular about the people he lets inside the Keep so long as they have any worth to him.</span></span>

Drake came to the edge of New Fizz City, and immediately called out his dog pokemon: Wolfe the Arcanine, Fenrir the Houndour, and Lelo the Poochyena. <br />
Why he did he have only his canine pokemon near the Time Rift?<br />
Simple, He wanted to study the effects of what the time rift had on this current timeline, and how differently it affected whatever time the rift is open to. <br />
Did any of the pokemon retain any changes to themselves by traveling through time? Such as does a pokemon that travels to the past that retains any injuries when it comes back to the future? <br />
Probably so, but Drake wanted to test his theories. <br />
<br />
Which is why he came to the Rift's opening, And he had been hoping to step into the Scandia Rifts opening. All of them could potentially die from hyperthermia if they happened to land in Eyga, But Drake had been carefully mapping out when Scandia was shown in the rift, and today he was lucky ( at least he thought so ) to find the described scenery in the rippling watery like opening on the outskirts of the city.<br />
<br />
Drake took a deep breath and looked at his hounds, all of them turned to look at him and nodded. So one by one each of them took a bold step inside the ripple. <br />
<br />
Instantly everyone knew they were where they had wanted to be. <br />
A cold wind ruffled their fur and Drake's hair tuft that stuck out from his backward facing snapback.<br />
<br />
And they could see the first structure that they had intended to visit in this area. The Borg Keep, the massive fortress of rock and ice. <br />
<br />
While Drake wants to research the effects of the time rift on both sides of the time lines. He still couldn't help himself from wanting to get inside the keep. <br />
Rumor has it that the Keep has lots of treasure in it, plundered from neighboring lands. Drake didn't care if he could keep the stuff or not, but he did want to hold some treasure in his hands and to learn the history behind the objects. Why they were stolen, what use they have etc. etc. <br />
It lured him like a mothim to a flame... But would it prove to be worth it along with the research? <br />

Master</span></u></span><br />&#8203;</div><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: red">You couldn't help but notice that Taitus's Nidorino seemed quite well trained. Not to mention that Taitus himself seemed quite knowledgeable about the Pokemon. Taitus smiled seeing you give him an approving nod, feeling like he was actually accomplishing something for the first time in his life in accordance with his Pokemon. Niro looked bashful seeing you give it's master approving nods, he had known for a while that Taitus was completely capable but he lacked the confidence to truly work well with his Pokemon. Yet here you were, a stranger who was gradually breaking away at the shell around him and building his confidence.<br />
<br />
Niro kept his eyes fixated on Six as he watched the large mushroom, who was already quite large, expand in size. He took a few steps back before being hit by a large intake of energy, sapping away from of his health. Niro gritted his teeth and bore through the pain of feeling his energy be leeched away by the drain. Six meanwhile, felt revitalized from the health he had obtained from Niro. Looking a little more spry than Niro thanks to sapping a moderate amount of health away from the Nidorino.<br />
<br />
&quot;Niro! Are you okay, buddy?&quot; Taitus asked, looking at his purple companion with concern. Niro turned back and nodded, trying to put on a good face for his trainer. Although the attack had been not very effective thanks to his poison typing, it had certainly pushed him below half his health due to the hit he had already suffered. He took a deep breath, glancing back at you and Six, awaiting his trainer's directions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Niro! Start with a <b>Leer</b>, follow it up with a <b>Skull Bash</b>!&quot; Taitus commanded, much more force in his voice as he snapped directions out quickly. Seemingly feeling invested in the battle. Niro did as commanded, giving Six a rather menacing leer before tucking his head in --- boosting his own defenses and preparing to unleash the Skull Bash attack.<br />
<br />
Niro is clearly worse off than Six... but Skull Bash is certainly a concern. <i><b>What do you do</b></i>?</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: deepskyblue">The time rift was certain a mysterious phenomenon. Where it had come from, no one quite knew. Not to mention many people were afraid of entering as no one had quite figured out how to escape the rift when you were inside. Many good scientists had been lost to time, but that didn't deter you. You were curious, wanting to know the effects of the rift. You approached cautiously, your Pokemon at your side as you peered inside the rift. You could see the outline of a body of water, filled with jagged and spiked icicles. <br />
<br />
It was <i>perfect</i>, just what you had been hoping to see.<br />
<br />
You glanced at your Pokemon, each giving you a reassuring nod as they climbed into the rift. Their bodies disappearing gradually as they were sucked into the liquid-like opening that was jutting out from seemingly thin air. You climbed in last, slowly sticking one leg in before you felt the rest of your body get yanked inside, like you were being sucked down some sort of high-powered drain. The wormhole itself was like nothing you had ever experienced, it tugged at you strongly, pulling you apart and putting you back together almost as fast as it could. You felt nothing, yet you felt everything at the same time. You fell for what felt like an eternity, yet it was over in seconds. You fell fast and hard, finally being spat out in a snow filled field. <br />
<br />
Picking yourself up off the ground, you looked around at your new landscape. The portal was gone, but at least all your Pokemon were around you. You could see the cold, blistering winds ruffling their thick fur. It certainly didn't seem to bother them, but you couldn't help but feel the chill that went through your whole body as you stood in the icy field. Luckily for you, there seemed to be a building in the distance. You recognized it quickly as the Borg Keep, home of the Jarl of Scandia. Sure, it had been something you wanted to observe for your research... but you could also feel the overwhelming urge to look at the treasure within. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hold!&quot; A voice called from the distance, causing you to turn quickly. You spotted a carriage being pulled by two Mudsdale and guarded heavily by armored men that walked on either side of it. The guards at the gate had stopped the carriage, seemingly to do some sort of check on it. It was hard to see from your position, so you stepped forward in the deep snow. From your position, you could see as the guards opened the gate, allowing the carriage to proceed. You wondered what sort of goods that the carriage was bringing in. <br />
<br />
As you and your Pokemon were fixated on the carriage, you suddenly felt a sharp blow to your head followed by the startled howls of your Pokemon. The world around you began to darken...<br />
<br />
~~~<br />
<br />
You came to a while later feeling Wolfe's large tongue running up and down your face. You shook your head, still feeling the dull pain from where you were struck. You went to grab your bag and suddenly panicked.<br />
<br />
<i>Everything was <u>gone</u>.</i><br />
<br />
You still had Wolfe, Fenrir, and Lelo... but the rest of your Pokeballs were gone, as were the rest of your belongings. All your Pokeballs, items, and money. Gone. You glanced around hurriedly, seeing the Borg Keep still standing in the distance, now illuminated by torchlight due to the hours that had passed. Your Pokemon's ears drooped, gesturing in the opposite direction, where you could see the footprints of your attacker heading off in the opposite direction. The Pokemon were clearly ashamed, they had been fighting off the Pokemon of your attacker that had come at them and had been too concerned with you, allowing the thief to slip away unscathed. <br />
<br />
You could report the theft to the Jarl and his men... or go after him yourself. <b><i>What do you do</i></b>?</span></span></div>

Master</span></u></span><br />&#8203;</div><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: red">You couldn't help but notice that Taitus's Nidorino seemed quite well trained. Not to mention that Taitus himself seemed quite knowledgeable about the Pokemon. Taitus smiled seeing you give him an approving nod, feeling like he was actually accomplishing something for the first time in his life in accordance with his Pokemon. Niro looked bashful seeing you give it's master approving nods, he had known for a while that Taitus was completely capable but he lacked the confidence to truly work well with his Pokemon. Yet here you were, a stranger who was gradually breaking away at the shell around him and building his confidence.<br />
<br />
Niro kept his eyes fixated on Six as he watched the large mushroom, who was already quite large, expand in size. He took a few steps back before being hit by a large intake of energy, sapping away from of his health. Niro gritted his teeth and bore through the pain of feeling his energy be leeched away by the drain. Six meanwhile, felt revitalized from the health he had obtained from Niro. Looking a little more spry than Niro thanks to sapping a moderate amount of health away from the Nidorino.<br />
<br />
&quot;Niro! Are you okay, buddy?&quot; Taitus asked, looking at his purple companion with concern. Niro turned back and nodded, trying to put on a good face for his trainer. Although the attack had been not very effective thanks to his poison typing, it had certainly pushed him below half his health due to the hit he had already suffered. He took a deep breath, glancing back at you and Six, awaiting his trainer's directions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Niro! Start with a <b>Leer</b>, follow it up with a <b>Skull Bash</b>!&quot; Taitus commanded, much more force in his voice as he snapped directions out quickly. Seemingly feeling invested in the battle. Niro did as commanded, giving Six a rather menacing leer before tucking his head in --- boosting his own defenses and preparing to unleash the Skull Bash attack.<br />
<br />
Niro is clearly worse off than Six... but Skull Bash is certainly a concern. <i><b>What do you do</b></i>?</span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: RED">Keith had been correct in supposing that a battle would help him figure how how much potential as a Trainer Taitus really had- it took little more than some patience and encouragement to instill some confidence in Taitus, and judging by how he was doing, and by how well-trained Niro was, a lack of confidence was clearly his biggest problem, and evidently, much easier to overcome than Keith was able to anticipate. Keith imagined that he couldn't have gotten much in the way of encouragement, no indication of approval, from anyone who tried to teach him anything about battling. Sad, for certain, but he knew he couldn't dwell on this right now- he had a battle to focus on, and he wouldn't be doing Six any favors by spacing out randomly, and so he didn't.<br />
<br />
Taitus gave his next commands, and more forcefully than he'd been doing. Not only that, he also gave said commands rather quickly- he was being more forceful and decisive as the battle went on, quickly threatening to turn the tides of the battle, and that made the fight a very exciting one indeed. The combination of Leer and Skull Bash would almost certainly put the Amoonguss in a tricky situation, but considering his current advantage in terms of hit points, and his considerable natural defenses (for the Leer would only serve to cancel out the effects of Defense Curl, bringing Six back to normal in that regard), Keith had faith that Six could take that powerful hit and then some. The key phrase being, &quot;and then some&quot;, considering the singular command Keith gave Six this time;<br />
<br />
&quot;Six, use <b>Bide</b>!&quot;</span></div>

<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: deepskyblue">The time rift was certain a mysterious phenomenon. Where it had come from, no one quite knew. Not to mention many people were afraid of entering as no one had quite figured out how to escape the rift when you were inside. Many good scientists had been lost to time, but that didn't deter you. You were curious, wanting to know the effects of the rift. You approached cautiously, your Pokemon at your side as you peered inside the rift. You could see the outline of a body of water, filled with jagged and spiked icicles. <br />
<br />
It was <i>perfect</i>, just what you had been hoping to see.<br />
<br />
You glanced at your Pokemon, each giving you a reassuring nod as they climbed into the rift. Their bodies disappearing gradually as they were sucked into the liquid-like opening that was jutting out from seemingly thin air. You climbed in last, slowly sticking one leg in before you felt the rest of your body get yanked inside, like you were being sucked down some sort of high-powered drain.

It certainly didn't seem to bother them, but you couldn't help but feel the chill that went through your whole body as you stood in the icy field. Luckily for you, there seemed to be a building in the distance. You recognized it quickly as the Borg Keep, home of the Jarl of Scandia. Sure, it had been something you wanted to observe for your research... but you could also feel the overwhelming urge to look at the treasure within. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hold!&quot; A voice called from the distance, causing you to turn quickly. You spotted a carriage being pulled by two Mudsdale and guarded heavily by armored men that walked on either side of it. The guards at the gate had stopped the carriage, seemingly to do some sort of check on it. It was hard to see from your position, so you stepped forward in the deep snow.

You came to a while later feeling Wolfe's large tongue running up and down your face. You shook your head, still feeling the dull pain from where you were struck. You went to grab your bag and suddenly panicked.<br />
<br />
<i>Everything was <u>gone</u>.</i><br />

Great, just great. The first step into a different timeline and I have already been robbed. <br />
Drake sighed and patted his starters head, and was sure to pet Lilo and Fenrir. It wasn't their fault and they knew that too, but they couldn't help but feel sorry. <br />
<br />
Drake thought for a moment, Yes he wanted to get his stuff back, all of his warm clothing and equipment were in his pack, as well as his three pokeballs for Wolfe Lilo and Fenrir. He was glad though that he didn't take all of his stuff with him, and that he left most of his items back at his base.<br />
<br />
Now here he was presented with two options. Report the theft to the Jarl, or head after the thief himself.<br />
But there were a few issues and first and up most was that if he went after the perpetrator he could freeze and catch hypothermia, even if he had his fire type's keeping him warm. Well, he could freeze here too sitting in the cold wind and without his warmer clothes so he started to give a few commands to his pokemon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fenrir and Lelo, I could freeze in this cold without the warm clothing that I packed away, which of course got stolen. So I need you to find some pretty good chunks of rock, and Wolfe I will need you to superheat them enough so that I can put them in my clothing to keep myself warm until we can catch the thief. I would like you to use your Flamethrower, and super-concentrate it like how a blow torch would be so we can warm the stones up relatively fast without melting them. &quot;<br />
<br />
Now the second issue was that he had no way of knowing IF it was one of the Jarl's men who stole from him. So for the moment, he had to solve what he can first, then the next issue as it came up.</span></div>

<span style="color: red"><span style="font-size: 12px">Bide? What's Bide? Taitus' mind was suddenly reeling, trying to comprehend exactly what you had just commanded your Amoongus to do. He certainly was not familiar with the move, despite his studies into Pokemon moves. He was almost positive he had seen it in a text about the moves of Nidorino, but he was certain that Niro did not know the move. Being so unfamiliar with an element of Pokemon frustrated him. His brow furrowed and he seemed to lose focus. Luckily for him, Niro was ready to unleash the Skull Bash without being prompted.<br />
<br />
Niro untucked his head, slamming his head into Six with as much force as he could muster. Six closed his eyes, enduring the hit but just barely. Six exhaled deeply, focusing on it's Bide as Niro stood, waiting for his master's orders.<br />

&quot;U-uh.&quot; Taitus was clearly confused, he had been counting on that Skull Bash ending the battle. Yet, here Six stood, eyes fixated on Niro as he continued to Bide his time. He paused, looking at Niro and considering his options. He wasn't sure how close Six was to being knocked out, nor was he sure what would happen when the Bide was unleashed. He could go for an all out assault or simply... wait. He was certainly curious about what Bide actually was, but he was also afraid that making the wrong choice would cause him to lose this battle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Niro start with a Reflect, get ready for whatever is coming at you. Follow it up with a Dig!&quot; Taitus called out. Niro quickly put up a barrier before burrowing underground. Taitus hoped to surpass the Bide --- but little did he know how long it truly took.</span><br />

<span style="color: deepskyblue"><span style="font-size: 12px">With your commands given, your Pokemon scurried off in search of rocks that you could put into your clothes. Lelo and Fenrir returned with decent sized rocks, big enough that you could keep them secure in your clothing but small enough that they wouldn't hinder your movement after you set off in pursuit of the thief. Wolfe got to work swiftly, inhaling deeply before spraying the rocks with a concentrated stream of fire. Trying to warm them. The hotter the rocks got, the more they began to glow a sharp red. Were you <i>really</i> sure you wanted to put those on your body? <br />
<br />
As you eyed the rocks, intent on picking them up (presumably after the red hot glow faded) you heard a faint murmur that grew louder and louder. You looked around, spotting the source of the noise as a guard patrol, making their way back to the Jarl's Keep. One guard couldn't help but notice the glowing hot rocks that you had in front of you. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell are you doing?&quot; One of the guards asks, approaching you and your Pokemon. A sword is fastened firmly to his hip and he carries a large shield emblazoned with the emblem of the Jarl. He eyes you closely, seeing your odd modern clothing and then looking back at the warm rocks. &quot;Are you... trying to warm yourself?&quot; He looks slightly confused, but also empathetic. &quot;Look, sir, if you're down on your luck right now we can get you properly equipped with some attire and a bellyfull of mead and cheese. The Jarl hates seeing his citizens so... impoverished.&quot; He speaks through gritted teeth. Did he think you were homeless? <br />
<br />
&quot;Come now, citizen. I'm sure we have some Borg armor laying around. Keeps that nasty cold right out.&quot; The other guard pipes up, looking at you and your Pokemon. You noticed that Wolfe, Lelo, and Fenrir were all licking their lips. They were probably hungry, you had been out for quite some time. </span></span><br />

<span style="color: red"><span style="font-size: 12px">Bide? What's Bide? Taitus' mind was suddenly reeling, trying to comprehend exactly what you had just commanded your Amoongus to do. He certainly was not familiar with the move, despite his studies into Pokemon moves. He was almost positive he had seen it in a text about the moves of Nidorino, but he was certain that Niro did not know the move. Being so unfamiliar with an element of Pokemon frustrated him. His brow furrowed and he seemed to lose focus. Luckily for him, Niro was ready to unleash the Skull Bash without being prompted.<br />
<br />
Niro untucked his head, slamming his head into Six with as much force as he could muster. Six closed his eyes, enduring the hit but just barely. Six exhaled deeply, focusing on it's Bide as Niro stood, waiting for his master's orders.<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: Red">At Keith's latest command, Taitus seemed to lose his focus. It occurred to Keith that maybe he didn't know what the move Bide was. With this possibility in mind, Keith watched Taitus intently. He hadn't planned to test Taitus like this, but it wasn't as though he could just pass up the opportunity to see how he'd act when faced with an unknown move..<br />
<br />
Niro, of course, let fly the Skull Bash without a problem, and though Six took heavy damage from it, he was still standing. Just as Keith had figured, Six really did have it in him. But Taitus had been banking on the exact opposite- he'd been counting on Skull Bash to be the finishing blow, and this not being the case threw him for a loop. Keith could practically hear Taitus's brain working furiously, trying to figure out the best course of action. And in the end, he just might have come up with that- Nero, on Taitus's orders, set up a Reflect and then dug underground. Keith watched Six intently- generally, after the use of two moves, attacking or otherwise, Bide would be unleashed. Skull Bash, Reflect. One, two. And while a Bide fueled by only one move wasn't as powerful as if Niro had been going for an all out assault, it would still hit hard. Assuming, of course, it actually hit. A user of Bide could only hold out for so long, and if Niro was still underground when Six needed to let it loose, it would all be in vain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amooooong...&quot; groaned Six. He had to unleash Bide, and soon, but could he hold out until Nero reappeared? Either way, they were gonna find out. Very, very soon.<br />

Alice Hope</span></span></u><br />&#8203;</div><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: #cc99ff">Kaito’s expression changed to one of bewilderment seeing you step in front of him. You may have told him you could protect yourself, but he was more than willing to be your knight in shining armor and protect you from this fearsome horned beast… by running as far and as fast as he could. But you weren’t that type of person, especially when another Pokemon was in trouble. With a determined look towards your bovine companion, you began to command it to attack the troublesome beast. The cow gave a confident stride forward, before flinging herself forwards slowly. The heavy Pokemon could certainly pack a punch, especially when slamming herself into her opponent and hitting it off guard.<br />
<br />
As Millie’s body made contact with the pinkened Rhyhorn, it skidded across the grass and dirt of the gardens, kicking up all sorts of plants. The Aipom glanced downwards upon feeling the tree cease it’s movement, spotting Millie standing across from the Rhyhorn, readying another strike. The purple monkey quickly looped it’s armed tail around the tree branch and swung it’s into Kaito’s arms. The Nihan native let out a small squeak of shock before the monkey jumped down and hid behind him, peaking out from behind his legs to watch how Millie would deal with this Rhyhorn. Kaito turned around, looking at the purple monkey.<br />
<br />
“Junpei! How many times do I have to tell you not to bother the grazing Rhyhorns?” Barked Kaito, his hands on his hips as he scolded the monkey. The Aipom shook it’s head in frustration, pointing towards the glazed-over eyes of the Rhyhorn --- trying to explain in any way it could to Kaito that something was very wrong. Kaito turned, noticing that the Rhyhorn seemed to be in some sort of trance as it turned to face Millie. It’s dopey expression remained as it charged forwards<b>, Bulldozing</b> it’s way through Millie. Although the hit didn’t do much to the bulky cow, she began to look mildly fatigued. It was clear that she was now much slower thanks to the hit to the legs.<br />
<br />
The Rhyhorn gave a menacing howl, screaming out at Millie as it Stomped forward driven by anger. It’s <b>Stomping Tantrum</b> made Millie wince as she was pummelled by the feet of her opponent.<br />
<br />
Millie’s surprise hit did a significant amount of damage! But it seems as though the Rhyhorn is still primed to fight. <b><i>What do you do?</i></b></span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: violet">Alice cringed as the Rhyhorn laid into her beloved cow, teeth clenched together. She had at least paid attention to Kaito's scolding of the Aipom, though, and so she figured that the cheeky monkey must have been his. It wasn't a Pokemon that she'd had much interest in owning - actually, the Rhyhorn was a lot more up her street - but the idol had a soft spot for them. They reminded her of a Fizzytopian trainer who was notable in his own right who she'd crossed paths with on plenty of occasions, although thinking about it, there were a few who had the Aipom line now. Anyway...<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, I really wish I taught you a more diverse movepool around now. Or fucking protect. I'm sorry, baby girl.&quot; She said as the Miltank mooed and shook off the strike. The Pokemon had taken far worse, and quite frankly with the mission they were currently on, it was a miracle they hadn't landed in some kind of horrorscape. This was tame, and the Rhyhorn seemed to be taking good damage from their attacks, &quot;Don't let up! Push it back with a Heart Stamp, then roll a Gyro Ball into a Zen Headbutt, just watch for the horn! If you can time it to uppercut Rhyhorn in the chin or belly, we might be able to literally knock it off guard and onto its back!&quot;<br />
<br />
That sounded like a stellar plan to her, if not a little miraculous. Stomping her navy hooves, snorting noisily in her own little show for battle, Millie slowly but hardily made to strike the Rhyhorn square in the face for distance. If it worked out, the second manouver shouldn't be too difficult to pull off. Less speed equalled more power, but it also meant less of a chance of actually hitting the mark. At the least, Junpei was safe, though, and that was what counted, right?</span></span></div>
