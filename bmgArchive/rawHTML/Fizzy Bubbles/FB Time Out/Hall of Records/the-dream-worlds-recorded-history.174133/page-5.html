<span style="color: lightblue"><b><u>Spooky Manor</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Electric Blue Eye</u>: <i>[7:00 am]</i> </b> Reasoning with the Pumpkaboo is your first option. After all, from your own experience, no matter how terrible a nightmare, you always wake up just fine the next morning. But when the vines start to tighten, you begin to wonder, in the back of your mind, if you’re going to wake up at all…<br />
<br />
Pumpkaboo listens to your plea intently. While it’s definitely not oblivious to what you’re saying, it seems your words have the opposite result than you intended – the more you struggle to speak, and the more you squirm to break free, the brighter Pumpkaboo’s inner light glows, as if it’s enjoying your suffering. It turns out you invaded her personal garden, and that is all the reason it needs to dispose of you – the Ghost-Type is a territorial one, proud of the vegetation it single-handedly tends to, and is obviously taking great pleasure in rooting out the unwanted guests. Goes to show that the Dream World can be a dangerous place, and unlike regular dreams, it seems you might end up seriously hurt – or worse – from this nightmare trip!<br />
<br />
However, in its desire to punish your transgression, it seems Pumpkaboo has neglected Aiden. The Chimchar counts to no more than two – the instant it becomes obvious Pumpkaboo is enjoying itself, he lunges forward and rakes apart the vines that bind you with a Scratch! The Ghost-Type squirms and lets out a long moan, as if physically hurt by the attack as well, and before you know it all the vegetation around you starts to vanish into smoke… and then the garden itself! In a matter of seconds, the landscape has changed dramatically – was it all an illusion, or did the dream’s original course change as a result of your partner’s interference? There is no telling the reason, but fact remains that you now find yourself in a small room, with walls lined in purple velvet, and two huge doors on the wall ahead – each door large enough for a Snorlax to pass through, you’d wager. You suddenly feel very small, but something tells you journey is nearing its end… the dream may be over soon. This could well be the last choice on the path ahead.<br />
<br />
Both doors in front of you are tinted purple. They are nearly identical; maybe choosing either one leads to the same result after all? No, there’s something… a slight difference. Not between the doors themselves, but what lies beyond. From beneath the door to your left, a gentle breeze blows at a constant rate, as if the area that lies ahead is for some reason windy. And from beneath the door to your right a subtle but notable heat wave escapes the chamber ahead, as if something burns behind the gate.<br />
<br />
Knowing that you might be close to awakening, choosing one of the two doors might be all that remains.<br />
<br />
The path goes on and so does time. What will you do?</span></span>

<br />
<span style="color: lightblue">With the grip of the vines growing progressively tighter as Ethan squirmed from its hold on him, the young trainer was too late to realize that this Pokemon didn't want to talk it out. Instead, it was enjoying it's catch of the day-<br />
<br />
Ethan could've sworn he had seen a Pokemon like this one in a book before, and if he wasn't mistaken, remembered reading that they guided lost souls to find their way to their resting place...which the trainer was confident isn't what this one seemed to have in mind for him!<br />
<br />
The edges of the trainer's sight were quickly beginning to fade and grow dark but before he completely passed out what he saw in his vision, was a silhouette of his parents standing together- he couldn't hear what they were saying but before he met with their same fate, a single firey light distorted the image, moving this way and that. The fire burned brightly amongst the darkness before a gigantic flash over took him completely!<br />
<br />
&quot;Ouch!&quot; Ethan blurted out as he dropped to the ground, freed. He soon realized that it was thanks to his monkey intervention that he didn't die from near suffocation. <br />
<br />
The pumpkin patches vanished in smoke, leaving him and his partner inside an empty white room before the dream seemed to correct itself and produce color, with two large doors that looked relatively the same and yet, the trainer instinctively knew lead to two different paths.<br />
<br />
The first door, while notably the same as the other had an air of calm to it, a gentle breeze blowing from the bottom of the door. The other door was the exact same as the other one, except this door was blowing hot air from underneath it, possibly an intense fire laying in wait just around the corner.<br />
<br />
<i>Are these doors to heaven and hell?</i> Ethan half mused, unconsciously beginning to walk towards the door he thought symbolized hell, <i>This is were I deserve to go...</i> he told himself when suddenly something stopped him...<br />
<br />
As if being able to read his trainer's mind, Chimchar who had stayed by Ethan's side till now seemed a little shy to approach his trainer. With a tuck of the gentlemen's pajamas pants, Aiden was able to grab his trainer's attention, &quot;Mhmm? Aiden...&quot; Ethan said a little solemnly, stopping before reaching the door's knob.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chim...&quot; the fire monkey said wearily, feeling terrible it had to step in, when the trainer wanted to try befriending the Pokemon that had him on the ropes...<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be ashamed, you did nothing wrong. I was wrong, I thought maybe I could reason with the Pokemon but you knew better...there isn't much to be upset about.&quot; Ethan admitted, &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; the trainer gave a smile, &quot;I'm sorry I was blind to what I thought was a situation I could handle alone. It's thanks to you I'm still here, right? You sure have grown since that day I met you in the egg house.&quot; He said taking a real good look at his chimp, who at this point was giving him a sly smile for the praise, &quot;Hehe, I owe you a lot for what you did. Thanks buddy!&quot; Ethan said patting his shoulder- signaling the chimp to take his rightful place.<br />
<br />
Jumping for joy, the chimp did a quick summersault before climbing up and hugging his trainer’s face.<br />
<br />
All that there was left to do was to choice a door to walk through and this time, he knew deep down inside there was no second chances if he screwed up. Which was perfectly fine, all he wanted to do now was see where else this dream decided to take him...<br />
<br />
He reached for the door blowing hot air but he suddenly heard a cry from his Chimchar that caused the man to turn to him.<br />
<br />
Aiden pointed to the other door, smiling. As if saying that was the door he should take instead. &quot;Alright, by now I should be okay trusting your judgement.&quot; Ethan chuckled.<br />
<br />
<b>Walking up to the door with the gentle breeze blowing underneath</b>, Ethan reached for the knob and began to turn it. Wondering what wonders' things awaited for them there...</span></span><br />

<span style="color: lightblue"><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Gemini Spark</u>: <i>[03:00 am]</i> </b>Torn between the light and the shadows, you choose the latter, drawn in by the strange sounds emanating from the dark path – something about the sound resembling a melody has earned your interest, and telling yourself no harm should befall you in your own dreams, you press onwards. Carla, however, isn’t quite so sure…<br />
<br />
The path is narrow, decidedly colder than before (how is that even possible?) and each of your careful steps echoes audibly across the tunnel. Sneaking in proves nigh-impossible despite the blackness ahead… The melody continues, louder but still impossible to define. The sound is foreign to you, and the closer you get, the less certain you feel about it being a melody at all. Your hands blindly run across the tunnel’s wall; after all, you could see the icicles clearly on the tunnel you didn’t pick, but who’s to say no same structures exist on this path? However, the ice wall feels smooth to the touch. If such obstacles exist, they must be only further ahead.<br />
<br />
Just then, out of nowhere, something clings to your right leg. Something small for sure, but strong enough to hold your limb in place. What’s going on?! The melody ceases, and the second it does, a sharp piercing pain on your shin makes you wince… and soon afterwards, an intense cold unlike anything you’ve felt thus far starts running up your leg and spreads through your entire body, as if the blood on your veins is about to freeze!<br />
<br />
It’s too dark to see who, or what, your assailant is. But one thing’s for sure, you have to do something fast! Will you stay and try to fight the invisible foe off, make a run for it or convince yourself it’s all a dream and pay no mind to what’s happening?<br />
<br />
The path goes on and so does time. What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: #99ccff"><span style="font-size: 9px">As Hyrem went into the pitch-black cave, something about it just seemed right. Maybe it was the music dictating the mood--after all, it was very inviting--but something about this cave where he and Carla couldn't see a thing told him he was on the right path. Carla wasn't as convinced, especially as the pair moved further in; it grew colder, darker, and each step they took echoed throughout the cave. That meant whatever was singing knew something was coming which may have been why, at that moment, it started to get louder. When the two first heard the singing, it seemed very alluring, but now as it continued...it was hard to describe what it really sounded like, but it certainly seemed much less like singing. As Hyrem continued, he stretched his hand out towards the walls of the cave until it found purchase on the ice, and unlike the other cave which seemed to be full of icicles this cave felt much smoother to him. Where would the cave take him, however?<br />
<br />
At that moment, he tries to move his right leg but suddenly finds he can't as it is seized by something and held in place. He could recognize that whatever had grabbed him was small, but it had to be pretty powerful to do something like this. Whatever was singing had now stopped right as he felt something poke into his leg, possibly even puncture it due to the way he felt a particularly extreme cold begin to shoot from his leg throughout the rest of his body. His breathing began to quicken as a natural response from his body in an effort to keep himself from being locked up completely, but he still needed to do something about the attacker, and that would require him to actually see what he was dealing with...<br />
<br />
&quot;C-C-Carla...&quot; he muttered with a shiver in his voice, &quot;c-c-can you...use <b>Flash</b>...so I can s-s-see things here?&quot; Carla mewed in response before making her eyes and the gem on her forehead glow brightly. Once he could see, he looked down to try and identify the force that had seized him so strongly. Dream or no dream, he had seen and heard enough supernatural shenanigans to know not to take any chances by ignoring something like this...</span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>jolteonjak</u>: <i>[01:00 am]</i></b> Despite knowing dreams are fleeting, and that this is a unique opportunity to explore this mysterious land, your sense of duty speaks louder and you decide to help out the poor Shelmet.<br />
<br />
Your efforts combined with Ledian’s allow you to pull out the unusually heavy Shelmet. Perhaps it’s due to its Overcoat adding extra weight to its metal shell that it fell into such a predicament… Either way, lingering isn’t something you can afford to do and the Bug-Type seems to understand. It claps its shell as a way to express its gratitude, but something tells you that sooner or later the same thing’ll happen to it again… Not only that, you have a distinct feeling that the two of you will see one another again fairly soon. But how can you know that?...<br />
<br />
Ledian points to the road ahead and you’re quick to follow. The last thing you want is to wake up before achieving what you set out to do – after all, the Dream World is elusive and you can’t simply return whenever you want. You know you have to make the most of this opportunity, and that involves going deeper into the Pleasant Forest.<br />
<br />
The further in you go, the more intense the aromas become, flowery scents that fill your nostrils and leave behind a soothing sensation. However, as you progress, something <i>else</i> begins to fill the air, a distinctly unpleasant smell that you’re soon able to identify – burning! There’s no doubt about it; the unmistakable odor of ash stands out clearly among th otherwise lovely perfumes of the Pleasant Forest’s depths. You rush to the source – somehow you know exactly where to head, as if your mind conjured the whole thing, the kind of omniscience that can only be attained in dreams. And after a while of dashing, you reach the place in question – the heat surrounding you is noticeable, and the origin is right in front of you: a single oak is ablaze, flames dancing around the large tree from top to bottom in a spectacle of light. For some unexplainable reason, as befitting of dreams, no other tree catches fire, no matter the proximity – the oak burns alone, but brightly, in the middle of the forest.<br />
<br />
Temporarily dazed by the miracle, you take a while to notice something fluttering busily around the fire. When you do realize it, you manage to spot a single

looking very distressed; on closer inspection, it seems her hive has caught fire as well, and there’s nothing the tiny bee can do on its own but watch her home burn to cinders...<br />
<br />
Due to the strange properties of this land, it doesn’t seem like there’s going to be a forest fire any time soon. You could leave the scene behind and press onwards, or take time to help out the poor little Combee, which might take a while.<br />
<br />
The path goes on and so does time. What will you do?</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: lightblue">It felt great to do a good deed. Chad felt wonderful after seeing the liberated Shelmet express its gratitude for his and Ledian’s assistance getting mobile once again. As the pair left the Snail Pokémon to its own devices.<br />
<br />
They continued down the forest path that they started on some time ago. Chad began to smell some pleasant flowery aromas. “Do you smell that, Ledian?” Chad asked sniffing around. Ledian smelled the air as well. He flew up ahead a little more while smelling the floral scents, and suddenly he covered his nose and turned to Chad. “Something wrong bud,” Chad hurried over to Ledian. He could now start to smell it.<br />
<br />
It seemed the pleasant scents they were enjoying began to turn to something burning. At first the smell was weak, mixing somewhat among the other floral scents. As Chad and Ledian pressed on, the burning smell became more pronounced. It began to start masking the pleasant odors from before. <br />
<br />
“We should hurry,” Chad said to Ledian. “There could be Pokémon in danger.” The pair hurried down the path, following the smell. Chad looked up, “It’s weird. Shouldn’t there be smoke in the sky?” Instinctively he wiped sweat off his brow. “It sure is getting warm around here. I wonder if it’s the fire?” Ledian flew ahead when he saw the glow. Chad followed.<br />
<br />
They finally arrived. An oak tree, ablaze, from top to bottom. “Ledi ledi Ledian!” Ledian cried pointing at the tree.<br />
<br />
“Wait,” Chad stopped and surveyed the area. “Just this tree is on fire? There are so many other trees and plants nearby. Why just one tree?” Ledian looked around too and spotted her.<br />
<br />
“Ledi!” he said pointing at a distressed Pokémon.<br />
<br />
“A Combee.” They headed over to her. “Is this your tree?” Chad asked her. She looked over towards her hive, which, also, was on fire. “Your hive? That’s terrible! We have to help you!” Ledian nodded. “Here’s what we’re going to do…” Chad began to formulate a plan.<br />
<br />
Ledian suddenly realized their other mission. He immediately felt awful to remind Chad but still. “Ledian,” he said remorsefully. Chad looked at the Five Star Pokémon. Ledian tapped one of his wrists, where a watch could potentially be.<br />
<br />
“I know, but we can’t leave her like this,” Chad tried to reason with him. He felt terrible at the thought of just walking away. “What should I do?” He quickly turned to Combee again. His eyes began to fill with tears. “He’s right. We have another mission to complete, and this could take a while. We could fail on our goals.”<br />
<br />
Chad wiped his eyes. Ledian hovered by his arms, and he placed a hand on his shoulder. Ledian showed Chad his <b>String Shot</b> aimed at the ground away from the frantic Combee. Chad’s eyes widened. “You’re not completely helpless, Combee,” he called out to the Tiny Bee Pokémon. “Maybe we can’t stay and help, but we can help anyway!”<br />
<br />
“Listen up, you two! Call for help, use <b>Sweet Scent</b>! Maybe some Water and Ground type Pokémon will answer. Ledian, use <b>Tailwind</b> as well, really spread that scent out. Combee, do you know <b>Mud-Slap</b>? Use that to smother the fire. Tell any Pokémon that show up to use any Water attacks they know. Have them use some Ice attacks they have, like Icy Wind. Tell them to use Ground attacks like Mud-Slap or Mud Bomb or Sand Attack. Protect your home. Be the future queen you were meant to be!”<br />
<br />
Chad and Ledian left the scene once they felt Combee understood everything she should do. “I hope that works. Thank you Ledian for giving me hope again. Let’s go on and finish our trip.”<br />

Unfortunately not the life you were looking for as at first glance Goomy appears to be the only Pokemon around. Still the night was young and you had yet to explore and so you swim around in search for life. It doesn't take you too long as you spot a beige and blue creature poking out from within some reeds. Your heart quickens as you recognise the potential creature hiding there. You and Goomy approach carefully not wanting to startle the creature and as you get ever closer you begin to realise that your assumptions were correct. It was a

wiggling back and forth within the reeds. You have to part them to see what it was up to and it suddenly stops moving, as if frozen in time. You could see that it had something in its mouth, something that had gotten stuck between two rocks and it was in the process of trying to remove it. It looked like some kelp, it must be after the food but was struggling to remove it from its hiding place. The Barboach looked up at you fearfully wondering what you were going to do but was brave enough to keep its mouth clamped on its meal. Would you help it out before it lost its nerve and fled?[/size]

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">Slowly advancing upon the slightly-exposed creature, Dave watched carefully, Liessa floating by his side. His hunch had proven correct - a Barboach, the Whiskers Pokémon. A Water/Ground-type, known to evolve into Whiscash. He already had a couple of more earthed water critters in Twoflower and Tide, but he was definitely interested in the little loach. He'd seen some before, of course - but usually the tail end as it slithered down Kara's gullet. Fortunately, the Croconaw was nowhere to be seen in this dream-based realm. As he and his Goomy approached, the fish froze completely, aside from its eyes, which he could see flitting around in a panic. Peering around, he noticed that it had a piece of kelp stuck firmly in its mouth, evidently after an easy meal. The scrap it was clinging onto was thick and juicy, covered in other organisms, obviously making for good eating. But it was stuck, trapped between a couple of rocks. He hadn't managed to scare it enough to flee, but it was clearly sizing up the option of just dropping the food and swimming for it.<br />
<br />
Before it could dwell on it too much longer, he stepped forward. Liessa remained on a nearby rock, looking on as he approached the indecisive fish, hands lowering to the two rocks. Grunting slightly with the effort, feet braced on the floor, he slowly prized the rocks far enough apart for the scrap of food-laden kelp to fall free into Barboach's mouth, after which he let the rocks fall back together with a clunk. &quot;There you are, li'l guy. Just trying to help, hope you enjoy it.&quot; he said softly, offering a warm smile as he stepped back to Liessa's side. The Goomy squidged up his arm to perch on his shoulder, both of them watching the Water-type from a respectable distance to see what it would do. He wasn't sure if the creature would be unnerved by being so close to a human, especially one who could apparently breathe underwater. &quot;I'd love to help you get some food anytime, if you feel like sticking around at all. Got a few friends you'd fit right in with...&quot; he murmured, dangling the temptation of a lasting friendship in front of the fish like a juicy Wurmple on a line, but not wanting to come on too strong and scare the critter away, instead content to just sit back and watch it tuck into its meal.</span><br />

<br />
<b><u>jolteonjak</u>: <i>[02:00 am]</i></b> Moral ambiguity is the perpetual stone in a traveler’s shoe. On one hand, you know dreams are fleeting and time is ever against you on the vague mission you’re on, but which you somehow know you need to fulfil. On the other hand, there is a Pokemon in trouble, and despite this being a land of dreams, witnessing any creature lose their home is a terrible sight to behold.<br />
<br />
<br />
Confronted with this dilemma, you choose the middle ground. You decide you can’t afford to linger, but don’t wish to leave the Combee behind without at least giving it some advice. In desperation, the bee trio doesn’t even attempt to flee at the sight of a human; instead, the Bug-Type listens intently to your instructions, despite giving you a strange look when you ask it about something called “Mud Slap”. Ledian spreads his Sweet Scent around by summoning a Tailwind, and Combee agrees to stay on the lookout for any lured Pokemon she might convince to help her out. Still, she gives you a sad look when you say your goodbyes and resume your journey… you wonder if Combee will be alright in the end. Will you even get a chance to find out?<br />
<br />
<br />
Moving along, deeper down the dirt path that penetrates the Forest of Dreams, it takes a while before anything happens. You half-expected to run into hordes of Pokemon running in the opposite direction, pursuing the Sweet Scent, but for some reason you spot none… then again, the rules of this World are different, and you can’t expect everything to work in the same way as it does back “home”. After a fair bit of wandering along the road, something in the distance catches your eye – movement atop one of the wayside trees…<br />
<br />
<br />
You quicken the pace and reach the tree in question. Looking closely, something is indeed moving on one of the branches… or rather, <i>dangling</i> from it! Helplessly trapped in a spider web, a

struggles futilely to break free. You look around for any predators capable of weaving such a trap, but can’t spot any other Pokemon besides the Weedle – the hunter doesn’t know it caught a prey yet!<br />
<br />
<br />
Weedle is trapped high up in the tree, and it could take a while to set it free if you give it a shot. Then again, this is the natural order of things, and maybe you shouldn’t tamper with the established food chain simply out of sympathy… By saving Weedle’s life you could be compromising someone else’s, as well as the precious time you have to fulfil your mission; that being said, it’s hard to ignore the insect’s predicament…<br />
<br />
<br />
The path goes on and so does time. What will you do?</span><br />

In what strikes you as probably the last choice of your dream, you opt to have Aiden make the final call in a show of respect and absolute trust. The chimp turns his attention to the leftmost door and you follow suite, turning the handle and allowing the breeze to fill the hall.<br />
<br />
<br />
You step out into the windy unknown and are once again confronted with the rationally impossible: up ahead, a wide sprawling grassy field stretches as far as the eye can see, bathed in warm sunlight and with a massive tree rising in the distance, the only distinguishable landmark for miles and miles around.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wind blows your air and causes Aiden’s tail flame to flicker and dance. The breeze carries the scents of flowers and soil, a lovely and immensely contrasting scenario from the grim mansion you just left behind. Speaking of leaving behind… where did the mansion go?! Looking back, there is no trace of the huge building, as if the entire structure vanished into thin air the second you closed the door behind you. The world of dreams is a truly fickle, inexplicable realm…<br />
<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a shadow briefly clouds the sun, only to disappear shortly afterwards. Instinctively you look up, expecting to see a bird of some sort… but what you spot is no bird at all! A round, purple creature floats casually in the air, carried by the currents, seemingly without a care in the world. But then, the

seems to grow dizzy and forces itself to land on the grassy floor a few feet away from you to regain its composure. It looks up into the sky again, looking frustrated… is this a Drifloon with air sickness?<br />
<br />
<br />
You too feel lightheaded once more, and get the distinct feeling your slumber might be coming to an end. Instinct tells you to head for the only tree in your line of sight. You struggle to decide whether to approach the Ghost-Type or make a run for your destination…<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>PikaGod</u>: <i>[12:00 am]</i></b> The Rainbow Bridge spreads before your eyes, Eddie looking just as astounded as you are. But given the nature of the Isle of Dreams, the conclusion is easily reached – there is absolutely nowhere else to go but across this mysterious road. The path is translucent and as such, terribly precarious-looking, but hey, isn’t this all a dream? How bad can it be to give it a shot? Taking a deep breath, you step onto the prismatic arc and find mercifully solid ground. It’s almost like you’re standing on glass, but the bridge holds, so you hurry along to give chase to those visions you just witnessed – can you really run into any of them up ahead?<br />
<br />
After a while, having reached the gorgeous blue sky, you find yourself surrounded by white clouds, only to have them suddenly disperse. In the blink of an eye, the Isle and the bridge are no more; instead, somehow, you’re stranded in a lively forest!<br />
<br />
Tall trees surround you, lush grass grows as far as the eye can see, the chirping of birds and sweet scents fill the air. This is the definition of a wonderful dream, and Eddie seems to love it! A Pleasant Forest waiting to be explored awaits you, and with no leads on where to go next, you set out to discover what your own mind has in store for you.<br />
<br />
Not long after you embark on your exploration, you catch a glimpse of something moving up the trunk of a nearby oak. Turning your head to meet the source of the swift movement, your find a rather cheerful-looking

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 12px">Karmas wasn’t sure where he was going to end up going considering that he was walking onto a rainbow, but he hoped that it wouldn’t end up with a long fall and a sudden splat. Eddie, on the other hand, didn’t seem to have any problems walking along the rainbow, in fact he seemed almost happy to be there.<br />
<br />
“It’s been so long since I’ve been here,” he said, his voice almost a little bit Scottish.<br />
<br />
Karmas raised an eyebrow, sure he’d spoken to his pokemon before in his dreams, but it didn’t meant that he was used to it happening. Plus he didn’t think that he had ever heard one of them talk in an accent before. Eddie didn’t seem to notice, instead looking around with joy and literally skipping around. The pair of them continued on the path until, like in almost the blink of an eye, they were suddenly standing in a forest.<br />
<br />
“That’s always fun,” said Eddie, tail wagging. “You never quite know when the bridge is going to go away. Come on, let’s go!”<br />
<br />
The Herdier ran off, with Karmas having very little choice to follow him considering that there only appeared to be a single path. He followed the eager dog, who was pretty bounding down the path, until Eddie came to an almost screeching stop. <br />
<br />
“Oh, look at that! A Pachirisu,” said Eddie.<br />
<br />
Karmas looked to where the Herdier was pointing with his nose, and sure enough there was a Pachirisu, climbing up a tree trunk. It seemed happy enough munching on a berry, which it then proceeded to drop. Karmas watched as the Pachirisu followed its berry down, searching around for it in the grass.<br />
<br />
“What are we going to do?” asked Eddie, his eyes trained on the electric type.<br />
<br />
Karmas thought about it for about half a minute. He knew his time was limited, but it couldn’t hurt to help the Pachirisu find its berry, could it?<br />
<br />
“I think we should help Pachirisu look for its berry,” said Karmas, looking down at Eddie. “After all, you have a pretty keen nose.”</span></div>

Just before she could do so, however, whatever was holding on to Hyrem began humming again, definitely not a language he could understand, but yet...he could. And he did not like what he was hearing:<br />
</span><br />
<i><span style="color: #ff0000">Eat you, eat you, eat you…</span></i><br />
<span style="color: #99ccff"><br />
Combine those words with the pain and the freezing he was feeling, and Hyrem was in a very real state of panic. &quot;C-Carla, hurry!!&quot; his voiced raised, and the Espeon needed no further urging before her gem began to glow, and due to the way the light bounced around in the cave, amplifying the <b>Flash</b> attack, it was much brighter than Hyrem was used to, and he had to shield his eyes for a moment to adjust them and reveal...a small creature with a cream-colored &quot;parka&quot; with an orange outline covering a black body with beady, blue eyes and teeth that always showed. &quot;Oh, I thought it would be something else!&quot; Hyrem remarked. &quot;But instead you're...&quot; and he let his Pokedex finish identifying the Pokemon:<br />
<br />
<b><i>Snorunt, the Snow Hat Pokemon. Snorunt mainly live in places where snowstorms are regular as they only need to subsist off of eating snow and ice. During the warmer seasons, they become very reclusive and are only found deep inside icy caverns, able to withstand the extremely cold temperatures found there. When spotted late at night in groups of five under large leaves, they are a sign of incoming snowfall as they wait to eat the first few snowflakes that fall towards them. Folklore states that if a Snorunt visits or lives with a family, it is a sign of good luck for generations.</i></b><br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, so you're a Snorunt, huh?&quot; the trainer said, looking at the Snow Hat Pokemon who was currently cowering beneath the light from Carla's Flash and had let go of his leg. The Pokedex may have said that Snorunt liked to eat snow and ice, but apparently this one was hungry, desperate, and <i>Moody</i> enough to try eating meat instead; had Hyrem not acted as quickly as he did...well, he didn't want to think of how successful it potentially could have been in securing him as its meal! Also, considering what Snorunt could evolve into, this made it one of the cutest <i>and</i> creepiest Pokemon he had ever seen, and he thought he had seen the best examples of both!<br />
<br />
Looking ahead, thanks to Carla's light source, the tunnel didn't seem to have anything else in the way. He could've just ran away while the Snorunt was stunned and avoided being a frozen dinner, but he didn't want to leave it alone and let it starve; besides, there was something about this singing, hungry Ice-type that intrigued him, and he hasn't been one to shy away from such dangerous Pokemon often, as evidenced by many of the Pokemon in his care. Standing in front of the light Carla's red gem was giving off, he knelt down to shade the small Pokemon before saying, &quot;It's okay, we're here to help! Instead of eating us, you could come along with us; we might find something else for you to eat...maybe some snow or ice, you like that, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Speonnnn...</i>&quot; the Espeon started to Growl as a warning, but Hyrem put a hand out to stop her. &quot;Hold on, Carla, give it a chance,&quot; he ordered her. Still, Carla did not trust this Snorunt one bit and kept a defensive posture, ready to pounce should she Detect any further hostility coming from the Snow Hat. Even if this was a dream, what if death here meant dying in real life? Using her mind to read the air surrounding this scene, she tried to discover who was right about Snorunt...would it be her, or Hyrem?</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>PikaGod</u>: <i>[01:00 am]</i></b> You could easily have passed the Pachirisu by and left it to its luck, but you decide to stop and help out the poor thing even if it costs you some time. After all, you have the perfect companion by your side to aid in this kind of problems! Eddie quickly goes to work, sniffing around the grassy floor in hopes of picking up the berry’s scent.<br />
<br />
Pachirisu, who’d hidden behind the trunk as you approached, peeks out of its hiding place in disbelief – why would a human go out of his way to help? Carefully, hesitantly, it approaches your Herdier, then starts searching as well once it’s certain the dog won’t turn to bite. After a while, Eddie seems to detect something and rushes into the nearby bushes, vanishing from sight! Pachirisu follows him, and you decide to do the same, curious as to what it is Eddie went off chasing…<br />
<br />
You leave the beaten path behind, venturing deep into the woods, running after your partner and the wild Electric-Type. You catch up to them soon after, and find Eddie barking repeatedly at a creature cornered against a small tree, looking frightened and clutching a Berry in its grasp - it’s a

<br />
Pachirisu immediately recognizes the item as the Berry it dropped, but Nidoran doesn’t look willing to relinquish its find, despite Eddie’s insistence. It soon becomes apparent why – a trio of similar Pokemon, looking much younger and hungry, cower in the distance due to your Herdier’s Intimidating presence… could it be Nidoran’s family?<br />
<br />
A conundrum presents itself – the Berry did belong to Pachirisu in the first place, and Nidoran stole it, but as it turns out it was looking to feed its own family. Maybe you should have a say in the decision – do you want Nidoran to give the Berry back, or will you let it keep the meal?<br />
<br />
The path goes on and so does time. What will you do?<br />

<b><u>Icy Cave</u></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Gemini Spark</u>: <i>[05:00 am]</i> </b> Confronted with the decidedly strange Snorunt, you decide to give the creature a second chance and offer to let it tag along with you, much to Carla’s dismay. She seems dumbfounded that you would offer Snorunt the chance to find some “snow or ice” to eat, when those are literally the <i>only</i> things that surround you since you entered these caves!<br />
<br />
Snorunt eyes you hungrily, once it has adjusted to the Flash’s clarity. It seems to ponder heavily on your proposition, and ultimately decides to hop over to your side and tag along, accepting the offer! Carla refuses to lower her guard, however, making you somewhat apprehensive since you know her special abilities well, but at least for now the Snow Hat doesn’t jump you…<br />
<br />
The three of you proceed along the tunnel, Espeon glaring at Snorunt all the way, who in turn skips and hops <i>very</i> close to you, perhaps a bit too much for someone you just met.<br />
<br />
After a while of walking (with you having to hunch your back to avoid hitting your head on the tunnel’s ceiling), the path culminates in another opening, similar to the one where you met Spheal but smaller in diameter. However, there’s definitely something both strange and decidedly pleasant about this area: it smells… <i>sweet</i>?<br />
<br />
Snorunt senses the odor as well, and soon starts to grow restless next to you… You take a look around the seemingly unremarkable cavern, and soon it all becomes apparent. The source of the pleasant aroma comes from a nearby creature, absent-mindedly licking a stalactite as if it was a popsicle: it’s a

<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red"><i>Eat you, eat you, eat you!</i></span><br />
<br />
<br />
This is an unexpected turn of events, one you may or may not want to have a part in. At the far end of the cave there are two openings, most likely leading to another web of tunnels, should you choose to head there.<br />
<br />

The path goes on and so does time. What will you do?</span></span></div>

You then begin to feel a tug on your arm and grumble against the pull. Opening your eyes you find yourself on an island floating within a sea of clear blue sky. Max was holding on to your sleeve, he must have been the one to wake you. Now that his task was achieved he looks around in wonder and you follow his gaze. Leading out before you was a glorious sight, a rainbow bridge that glistened in the sunlight heading into the clouds. Getting to you feet you remember the dream dust you sprinkled on your heads before you slept, it had somehow brought you to this place. With no-where else to explore you decide to take a leap of faith and cross the bridge.<br />
<br />
It feels as though you are walking a straight path but you could swear you were moving higher and higher with every step. Soon you can no longer see the island of dreams but rather a large looking stately home with a slightly eerie feel to it. Max walks bravely by your side and you try the large doors feeling them open under your touch and swing wide to allow you access. A large foyer opens up before you allowing you several directions in which to travel. Max appears to have chosen for you as he heads off straight ahead behind the curving steps when he hears a noise from behind there. He pokes his head around and jumps back in alarm and you hear a faint giggling. You hope you had not dreamt up some ghoulish creature to play tricks on you. Luckily enough it appears to be a Pokemon from your vision, a small

that pokes its head out and greets you with a cheeky smile. It surely couldn't be here to hurt you could it? Either way there was no telling how long you had in this Dream World and there was plenty more to explore behind closed doors, or was Ralts what you had come here for after all?</span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 10px"> <span style="color: #99ccff">The Mansion loomed in front of Jade and Maxwell. They looked it up and down, the dreamlike qualities becoming more evident as it warped and twisted out of form. &quot;I don't like the feeling of this, Max.&quot; Jade whispered down to the Buizel. He let out a chatter and stepped ahead for both of their sakes. Jade wasn't one to go on her own. They walked in sync up to the mansion's worn wooden doors, staring together. &quot;Again, not feeling great.&quot; Max took the initative again and knocked. The doors swung themselves open, and Jade couldn't tell how much influence Max had on it. He turned to look at her and shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I guess it's my dream. Or ours. I'm blaming you.&quot; Jade said, stepping into the large lobby of the mansion. The central room featured many halls in many directions. The ground paths seemed to stretch on, breaking the rules of perspective that Jade knew. Ahead were a set of stairs, reaching too high for her to truly catch what was happening Max grabbed her hand and pulled forward a bit, motioning her to take the central path, up the steps. &quot;Got a feeling? Well, maybe this dream is yours after all. I'll follow you.&quot; Max tugged her along. Their feet made the floorboards creak. Jade started up the steps at first, but Max chattered and Jade's head spun back around. Max looked under the steps, looked back up with wide eyes, and looked back under. A giggling noise echoed back, and the Ralts from Jade's first thoughts followed Max as he stepped back and dashed back up to Jade on the stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Hello?&quot; Jade said, unsure of how she stood. Max stood at her feet, waiting for a command. Most encounters with Pokemon resulted in combat, as far as he remembered. His muscles tensed up. Jade patted his head and took a few steps down, continuing, &quot;It's nice to meet you, Ralts. I'm guessing you've got some sort of mysterious quest for us to undergo, because that's what happens in dreams. So. Uh. Get on with it.&quot; Jade makes a hand motion at the Ralts, spinning her hand about. </span><br />

<b><span style="color: lightblue"><u>Icy Cave</u></span></b><br />
<span style="color: lightblue"><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Gemini Spark</u>: <i>[05:00 am]</i> </b> Confronted with the decidedly strange Snorunt, you decide to give the creature a second chance and offer to let it tag along with you, much to Carla’s dismay. She seems dumbfounded that you would offer Snorunt the chance to find some “snow or ice” to eat, when those are literally the <i>only</i> things that surround you since you entered these caves!<br />
<br />
Snorunt eyes you hungrily, once it has adjusted to the Flash’s clarity. It seems to ponder heavily on your proposition, and ultimately decides to hop over to your side and tag along, accepting the offer! Carla refuses to lower her guard, however, making you somewhat apprehensive since you know her special abilities well, but at least for now the Snow Hat doesn’t jump you…<br />
<br />
The three of you proceed along the tunnel, Espeon glaring at Snorunt all the way, who in turn skips and hops <i>very</i> close to you, perhaps a bit too much for someone you just met.<br />
<br />
After a while of walking (with you having to hunch your back to avoid hitting your head on the tunnel’s ceiling), the path culminates in another opening, similar to the one where you met Spheal but smaller in diameter. However, there’s definitely something both strange and decidedly pleasant about this area: it smells… <i>sweet</i>?<br />
<br />
Snorunt senses the odor as well, and soon starts to grow restless next to you… You take a look around the seemingly unremarkable cavern, and soon it all becomes apparent. The source of the pleasant aroma comes from a nearby creature, absent-mindedly licking a stalactite as if it was a popsicle: it’s a

, one Snorunt is quick to dash towards, eyes locked on the living ice cream while it utters the familiar words…<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red"><i>Eat you, eat you, eat you!</i></span></span></span><br />
<span style="color: lightblue"><span style="font-size: 12px"><br />
<br />
This is an unexpected turn of events, one you may or may not want to have a part in. At the far end of the cave there are two openings, most likely leading to another web of tunnels, should you choose to head there.<br />
<br />
<br />
The path goes on and so does time. What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: #99ccff"><span style="font-size: 12px">Carla could not believe Hyrem would even consider talking with something so unfamiliar that tried to eat him (as opposed to the <i>familiar</i> threats coming from her teammates, who she wouldn't be able to stop anyway...), much less offer it assistance in finding what was supposedly Snorunt's favorite food: snow and ice, which was plenty abundant in these caves! Hyrem could sense what his Espeon was having trouble with and explained: &quot;Well, if it wanted just any kind of ice, it wouldn't be <i>this</i> hungry, right? Maybe it's a picky eater, and it's looking for something fresher?&quot;<br />
<br />
This still didn't convince Carla. &quot;Something fresher&quot; could easily be taken as &quot;something living&quot;, and this Ice-type had two such things right in front of it. Still, after it looked at Hyrem and considered its options, it seemed willing to go along with his suggestion, although Carla made sure never to take her eyes off of Snorunt as they headed through the tunnel, with Hyrem needing to crouch as he walked since the tunnel was too low to fit his height. Meanwhile, Snorunt seemed happy enough to skip along to keep a really close distance to the trainer, close enough to keep Carla nervous as to its intentions, and even her warnings didn't seem to be enough to deter it.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #99ccff"><span style="font-size: 12px">Eventually, however, the tunnel opened out to another room, smaller in size but looked pretty much the same as the room where Hyrem and Carla met the Spheal. As they entered the room proper, they began to detect a peculiar smell permeating the room, and Hyrem scans the room until he sees a large stalactite and discovers a creature licking it that looked exactly like a living ice cream cone, something he and Carla both recognized. &quot;It's one of the Pokemon from before we entered the Dream World!&quot; he said out loud before getting out his Pokedex to register the Ice-type:<br />
<br />
<b><i>Vanillite, the Fresh Snow Pokemon. Vanillite is created from icicles exposed to early morning sunlight. Its extremely cold breath is used to freeze the air, creating snow crystals that fall to the ground until a big enough pile is made for it to bury itself in and sleep.</i></b><br />
</span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: #99ccff">Unfortunately for the unsuspecting Vanillite, Hyrem and Carla were not the only ones to detect its presence. He looked to the ground to find Snorunt running straight towards it, resuming its chant, &quot;</span><i><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0)">Eat you, eat you, eat you!</span></i><span style="color: #99ccff">&quot; all over again. &quot;Ah, wait, Snorunt, that's not-&quot; Hyrem began to say before being interrupted by a &quot;<i>Spee!</i>&quot; from Carla. He looked down at his Espeon who didn't make a move to stop Snorunt, instead shaking her head, meaning she thought it better to leave the situation alone. It was better that this poor Vanillite serve as proper nourishment for Snorunt instead of <i>them</i>, in her mind. Normally, Hyrem would be all for interfering...but in this case he actually had to agree with Carla. After all, this Vanillite did count as the &quot;snow or ice&quot; he had promised Snorunt, and he had enough experience with Amethyst to know better than to come between a Pokemon and its meal without a good reason, which he couldn't really come up with at this point. And so the two watched to see what would happen between Snorunt and Vanillite before moving on to the two tunnels on the other side of the room; besides, maybe Snorunt wasn't actually going for the Vanillite and wanted the stalactite instead? There was that hope inside Hyrem, at least...</span></span></span></span><br />

<b><u>Icy Cave</u></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Gemini Spark</u>: <i>[06:00 am]</i> </b> This dream took an odd turn indeed. As it turns out, you ran into one of the Pokemon from your vision, but it seems youaren’t the only one who was interested in meeting the Vanilite – Snorunt lunges itself at the living ice cream, eager to get a bite! At least that’s what It looks like, though you can’t be sure, and for that very reason you opt to hold your ground and see how everything plays out. After all, unlikely as it seems, maybe something else entirely in this barren cave got Snorunt’s attention that it couldn’t hope to find anywhere else….<br />
<br />
… yes, extremely unlikely. And, as it turns out, not the case. The Snow Hat chases the frightened Vanilite around the cave, running as fast as its tiny legs allow it, while uttering the same words over and over again.<br />
<br />
<i><span style="color: red">Eat you, eat you, eat you!</span></i></span></span><br />
<span style="color: lightblue"><span style="font-size: 12px"><br />
The Ice-Type cone floats ahead of Snorunt in a panic, probably wondering where such a crazed beast came from. After a while of running around in circles, the Snow Hat finally catches up to the Vanilite, jumps on top of it and pins it to the ground. Its eyes glow an ominous yellow…<br />
<br />
Carla stands by silently, watching the scene unfold, though she can’t help but turn to see your own reaction at the latest turn of events. She had her suspicions about Snorunt all along, but she wouldn’0t move a muscle unless you ordered her to. This was, after all, the natural order of things, though she did wonder if Snorunt ate Vanilite outside of the Dream World.<br />
<br />
The predator finally sinks its teeth into the prey, biting its side with ravenous appetite, causing the Vanilite to screech in pain. It’s a tough scene to watch, no matter how stoic one might be… Be that as it may, the way is clear for you to carry on, two tunnel entrances awaiting in the far wall, one to the left and one to the right, identical in appearance. While Snorunt feasts on Vanilite, you can easily make your way forward, deeper into the Icy Caves.<br />
<br />
Are you ready to leave the two Pokemon behind, knowing your dream won’t last forever, or will you linger a while longer? If so, will you intervene now?</span></span><br />

In what strikes you as probably the last choice of your dream, you opt to have Aiden make the final call in a show of respect and absolute trust. The chimp turns his attention to the leftmost door and you follow suite, turning the handle and allowing the breeze to fill the hall.<br />
<br />
<br />
You step out into the windy unknown and are once again confronted with the rationally impossible: up ahead, a wide sprawling grassy field stretches as far as the eye can see, bathed in warm sunlight and with a massive tree rising in the distance, the only distinguishable landmark for miles and miles around.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wind blows your air and causes Aiden’s tail flame to flicker and dance. The breeze carries the scents of flowers and soil, a lovely and immensely contrasting scenario from the grim mansion you just left behind. Speaking of leaving behind… where did the mansion go?! Looking back, there is no trace of the huge building, as if the entire structure vanished into thin air the second you closed the door behind you. The world of dreams is a truly fickle, inexplicable realm…<br />
<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a shadow briefly clouds the sun, only to disappear shortly afterwards. Instinctively you look up, expecting to see a bird of some sort… but what you spot is no bird at all! A round, purple creature floats casually in the air, carried by the currents, seemingly without a care in the world. But then, the

seems to grow dizzy and forces itself to land on the grassy floor a few feet away from you to regain its composure. It looks up into the sky again, looking frustrated… is this a Drifloon with air sickness?<br />
<br />
<br />
You too feel lightheaded once more, and get the distinct feeling your slumber might be coming to an end. Instinct tells you to head for the only tree in your line of sight. You struggle to decide whether to approach the Ghost-Type or make a run for your destination…<br />

<br />
<span style="color: lightblue">Right before Ethan passed through the door, he could feel a familiar presence, a warm and loving kind of feeling that he hadn't felt since he was a kid.<br />
<br />
The young man hesitated as he passed through the doorway, wondering if the choices he had made were the right ones, when suddenly, he felt someone else's reassuring hands push him forward out of the door way. A familiar feeling of the way his parents would push him to reassure everything he had done, everything he was ever going to do, would turn out okay in the end. <br />
<br />
He didn't need to turn back, he knew they were there somehow, telling him to continue on...whether it was just a dream or even, whether they were really there at all...maybe it was just part of his subconscious, that was trying to make sense of everything in the dream that reminded him of them. He knew now, more than ever that they were watching him, protecting him. And by catching his Chimchar smiling cheerfully on his shoulder, he knew they weren't the only ones.<br />
<br />
The trainer walked forward, walking further away from them as the door behind him closed and vanished from sight.<br />
<br />
Aiden's choice lead the duo to a different kind of place in their dream. Everything else seemed bleak and dreary compared to what he was experiencing now. A beautiful field full of blooming flowers, with a gust of wind lifting his spirits, and the breeze lightly kissing him on his cheeks. It was here he saw a balloon fly in and land gracefully to the ground. Causing his curious Chimp to jump off from his shoulder and run over to the object, except when they arrived they realized it wasn't a real ballon that fell from the sky, it was the ghost Pokémon, Drifloon!<br />
<br />
<i>In my life...especially in my line of work, I was always rushed. Half the time I never truly appreciated what I had. I was always looking for a bigger score, never stopping to smell the roses. That time has long past now...I wish...if only for a moment, to enjoy the little time I have left, before it all becomes nothing more then a blur and I wake up never realizing the time I spent here.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;You okay? You seem in need of help, my time in this realm is drawing to a close,&quot; Ethan spoke gently, with an aura of content in his voice, &quot;I know it- I can feel it. But even if it is just a dream...maybe I could help you. You wish to soar the skies don't you? I think I have a solution for you, my Chimchar can use it's flame to propel you up, you could even give us a ride with enough fire power! All I ask in return is that you take us to that tree over there,&quot; Ethan pointed towards the direction of the tree.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chimchar!&quot; Aiden gleed, finding the idea interesting.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can help one another out, don't you think, so what do you say? We help you, you help us? Everyone wins...&quot;</span></span><br />

<b><span style="color: lightblue"><u>Icy Cave</u></span></b><br />
<span style="color: lightblue"><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Gemini Spark</u>: <i>[06:00 am]</i> </b> This dream took an odd turn indeed. As it turns out, you ran into one of the Pokemon from your vision, but it seems you aren’t the only one who was interested in meeting the Vanilite – Snorunt lunges itself at the living ice cream, eager to get a bite! At least that’s what It looks like, though you can’t be sure, and for that very reason you opt to hold your ground and see how everything plays out. After all, unlikely as it seems, maybe something else entirely in this barren cave got Snorunt’s attention that it couldn’t hope to find anywhere else….<br />
<br />
… yes, extremely unlikely. And, as it turns out, not the case. The Snow Hat chases the frightened Vanilite around the cave, running as fast as its tiny legs allow it, while uttering the same words over and over again.<br />
<br />
<i><span style="color: red">Eat you, eat you, eat you!</span></i></span></span><br />
<span style="color: lightblue"><span style="font-size: 12px"><br />
The Ice-Type cone floats ahead of Snorunt in a panic, probably wondering where such a crazed beast came from. After a while of running around in circles, the Snow Hat finally catches up to the Vanilite, jumps on top of it and pins it to the ground. Its eyes glow an ominous yellow…<br />
<br />
Carla stands by silently, watching the scene unfold, though she can’t help but turn to see your own reaction at the latest turn of events. She had her suspicions about Snorunt all along, but she wouldn’0t move a muscle unless you ordered her to. This was, after all, the natural order of things, though she did wonder if Snorunt ate Vanilite outside of the Dream World.<br />
<br />
The predator finally sinks its teeth into the prey, biting its side with ravenous appetite, causing the Vanilite to screech in pain. It’s a tough scene to watch, no matter how stoic one might be… Be that as it may, the way is clear for you to carry on, two tunnel entrances awaiting in the far wall, one to the left and one to the right, identical in appearance. While Snorunt feasts on Vanilite, you can easily make your way forward, deeper into the Icy Caves.<br />
<br />
Are you ready to leave the two Pokemon behind, knowing your dream won’t last forever, or will you linger a while longer? If so, will you intervene now?</span></span><br />
<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: #99ccff"><span style="font-size: 12px">Well, Hyrem finally met one of the Pokemon in his vision at the beginning, but unfortunately Snorunt seemed to take notice and started running toward it...or was it something else? Hyrem did keep that hope within him...</span></span><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: #99ccff">Oh, who was he kidding? The Vanillite did make Snorunt earn its meal, however, as it tried its best to float away from the Snow Hat, making it give chase as it chanted, &quot;</span><i><span style="color: #ff0000">Eat you, eat you, eat you!</span><span style="color: #99ccff">&quot;</span></i><span style="color: #99ccff"> and Hyrem saw the scene play out very similar to the Vanillite in his vision that was chased around by a strange pink Pokemon. In this case, however, earn its meal the Snorunt did as it finally closed in toward Vanillite, brought it down, and pinned the ice cream underneath itself to keep it from escaping.<br />
</span></span><br />
<span style="color: #99ccff"><span style="font-size: 12px">Hyrem and Carla were simply watching up until this point, and Carla wasn't about to stop the one-sided battle anytime soon, unless of course Hyrem ordered to, but she did successfully convince her trainer that doing so would not be a good idea in this case. Besides, if Snorunt wasn't so hellbent on making Vanillite its food, Carla would've been tempted to have a taste of the sentient ice cream for herself...<br />
<br />
Ultimately, it was time for Snorunt to take its first mouthful of Vanillite &quot;flesh&quot;, and it wasn't going to wait for its prey to expire, meaning Hyrem and Carla had to listen to Vanillite's cries of pain. &quot;Um, maybe we should leave Snorunt to do its thing...&quot; Hyrem said nervously as a bead of cold sweat trickled down the back of his head. &quot;Have fun, Snorunt...maybe?&quot; There may still have been something about Snorunt that made Hyrem consider staying, but as he looked down towards his Espeon he knew she would want him to leave this particular scene before the Ice-type had thoughts about dessert (which is weird to think about, considering what Snorunt was eating), so he turned towards the two tunnels that were ahead and headed towards the right one, just like last time, occasionally taking a quick glance back at the Snorunt enjoying its catch--there was a chance he would regret doing that--before entering the tunnel proper.<br />
<br />
A part of him hoped this wouldn't be the last he would see of that Snorunt...</span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Electric Blue Eye</u>: <i>[9:00 am]</i> </b> Drifloon looks at you teary-eyed, a mixture of gratitude and apprehension… Flying seems to be what it craves the most, but it’s afraid of failing yet another time…<br />
<br />
The ghostly balloon ponders long and hard on your offer, and seems to come to terms with the fact that you didn’t run into it by chance, and it may never get another chance like this again. It holds out one of its apendages, which you proceed to grab. Then, positioning itself above Aiden’s flame, Drifloon starts to inflate… and rise!! Then, inexplicably – or perhaps explainable only in this strange real, where laws of physic depend on the dreamer – you feel yourself rising as well, effortlessly being carried upwards into the sky by the Drifloon you magically seemed to have cured! You quickly reach out to your Chimchar, who holds on as well, and the three of you find yourselves flying high across the air, towards the tree you somehow know to be called the Tree of Dreams!<br />
<br />
The sky trip gives you enough time to remember everyone you encountered along the way, and you wonder why you have the feeling you’ll find them all again very soon. Some meetings were more special than others, but you can distinctly recall every single one of them…<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Drifloon lands, gently dropping you directly in front of the massive tree, and in your heart of hearts you know you’re in the right place, precisely where you should be...<br />
<br />
When you finally arrive near the trunk, wider and taller than any skyscraper you’ve ever seen, something happens – something you’re not sure should even be possible… Every single one of the Pokemon you met before is right here! <b>Gothita</b> casually tends to her dress; <b>Woobat</b> flies circles around the trunk; <b>Yamask</b> chants ominously like before, prior to giving life to that hunk of scrap metal; <b>Golett</b> waves at you next to the other ghost; <b>Pumpkaboo</b> stares at the tree’s protruding roots, possibly wondering how to control them; and <b>Drifloon</b> continues to loop around the sky merrily, all fear of flying long forgotten.<br />
<br />
Inexplicably, you have the distinct feeling that any one of these Pokemon would be willing to leave the Dream World behind at your request…<br />
<br />
Aiden, meanwhile, is staring at something else entirely. Right in front of the Tree of Dreams, something glimmers atop a much smaller trunk, severed practically above ground level. A Berry, unlike any other you’ve ever seen, glowing with a myriad colors and vaguely shaped like a Chimchar – once again, despite not being told, you recognize the item as a Dream Berry, which Aiden looks decidedly interested in trying out…<br />
<br />
This is the culmination of your dream. Moments away from waking up, you must now make the final choice! </span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>Icy Cave</u></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Gemini Spark</u>: <i>[07:00 am]</i> </b> All in all, you decide the best thing to do is leave Snorunt to enjoy its meal… even if that means Vanillite suffers as a result. Natural order isn’t something you want to tamper with ,so you move ahead, feeling dizzy as you leave the cave behind and enter the new tunnel. This might be your first time inside the Dream World, but you have the distinct feeling you’re not going to stay asleep much longer… which would explain the lingering feeling that there is <i>somewhere</i> you have to reach, and fast.<br />
<br />
The tunnel stretches ahead for what feels like miles and miles, becoming progressively narrower as you go but never tight enough that you have to bend over. As if the more you walk, the more the hallway begins to accommodate to fit you, and only you inside. Makes sense, considering this is your dream after all.<br />
<br />
But then, just as you begin to feel confident about your direction, subconsciously feeling your mysterious destination drawing closer and closer… the tunnel ends. No branching paths, no new cave, not even a hole on the floor… just a massive wall of ice blocking your path. But how? How can this be?! Did you take a wrong turn somewhere?...<br />
<br />
<i>*crack, crack, crack…*</i>[<br />
<br />
The sound catches your attention easily – after all, it’s the only sound to be heard other than your own breathing in this seemingly lifeless place. You look down at the base of the ice wall and find a small creature repeatedly Tackling away at it… It’s a

The consecutive attacks cause the ice to crack and crumble, opening a small hole in the wall… but just as it seems like Bergmite is about to forcefully create a tunnel, the ice magically reforms and the poor Pokemon has to start all over again. It’s simply not strong enough to break through before the wall reforms again…<br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Electric Blue Eye</u>: <i>[9:00 am]</i> </b> Drifloon looks at you teary-eyed, a mixture of gratitude and apprehension… Flying seems to be what it craves the most, but it’s afraid of failing yet another time…<br />
<br />
The ghostly balloon ponders long and hard on your offer, and seems to come to terms with the fact that you didn’t run into it by chance, and it may never get another chance like this again. It holds out one of its apendages, which you proceed to grab. Then, positioning itself above Aiden’s flame, Drifloon starts to inflate… and rise!! Then, inexplicably – or perhaps explainable only in this strange real, where laws of physic depend on the dreamer – you feel yourself rising as well, effortlessly being carried upwards into the sky by the Drifloon you magically seemed to have cured! You quickly reach out to your Chimchar, who holds on as well, and the three of you find yourselves flying high across the air, towards the tree you somehow know to be called the Tree of Dreams!<br />
<br />
The sky trip gives you enough time to remember everyone you encountered along the way, and you wonder why you have the feeling you’ll find them all again very soon. Some meetings were more special than others, but you can distinctly recall every single one of them…<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Drifloon lands, gently dropping you directly in front of the massive tree, and in your heart of hearts you know you’re in the right place, precisely where you should be...<br />
<br />
When you finally arrive near the trunk, wider and taller than any skyscraper you’ve ever seen, something happens – something you’re not sure should even be possible… Every single one of the Pokemon you met before is right here! <b>Gothita</b> casually tends to her dress; <b>Woobat</b> flies circles around the trunk; <b>Yamask</b> chants ominously like before, prior to giving life to that hunk of scrap metal; <b>Golett</b> waves at you next to the other ghost; <b>Pumpkaboo</b> stares at the tree’s protruding roots, possibly wondering how to control them; and <b>Drifloon</b> continues to loop around the sky merrily, all fear of flying long forgotten.<br />
<br />
Inexplicably, you have the distinct feeling that any one of these Pokemon would be willing to leave the Dream World behind at your request…<br />
<br />
Aiden, meanwhile, is staring at something else entirely. Right in front of the Tree of Dreams, something glimmers atop a much smaller trunk, severed practically above ground level. A Berry, unlike any other you’ve ever seen, glowing with a myriad colors and vaguely shaped like a Chimchar – once again, despite not being told, you recognize the item as a Dream Berry, which Aiden looks decidedly interested in trying out…<br />
<br />
This is the culmination of your dream. Moments away from waking up, you must now make the final choice! </span></span>

<br />
<span style="color: lightblue">Joining hands with the Drifloon and his Chimchar, the feeling of weightlessness was so surreal, even for a dream that it felt particular impossible- but in a dream, was anything ever really out of reach if you wanted it enough?<br />
<br />
Soaring so high above the ground brought a level of serenity to Ethan's heart, one he hadn't felt in a very long time.<br />
<br />
This dream was like no other, even as a child, he had dreams of Pokémon he would eventually meet and go on journeys with. Playing with them and battling along side with them, over coming challenges, coming out victorious, sometimes wailing in self pity from defeat and learning from their mistakes. But the Pokémon he encountered here, had they're own desires and personalities, why if the trainer had to guess this wasn't just a dream...they felt like real Pokémon...<br />
<br />
On arrival to the large tree that he instantly recognized as the Tree of Dreams, even though it was the first time seeing the massive plant...they found a number of Pokémon were already there awaiting their descend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chimchar!&quot; Aiden jumped off once the ride was over and happily began greeting the Pokémon he and his trainer had seen through out their shared adventure.<br />
<br />
And it was at this very moment that Ethan could hear the distinct sound of ticking seconds of a clock in his head, that made him think, his time was almost up!<br />
<br />
Deep down the trainer wished he could ask for more time to spend with all of these wonderful Pokémon, but somehow he also knew this wasn't going to be the last he visited this realm.<br />
<br />
The trainer looked around, observing each and every one of the Pokémon and thought about what each one had taught him- Gothita, had reminded the young man that it was okay to self reflect on life and the past, but not to get so wrapped up in it that it makes you lose yourself and the now!<br />
<br />
Woobat had shown him that second chances weren't a waste of time.<br />
<br />
Watching Yamask, Ethan realized that believing in something greater then oneself wasn't such a bad thing.<br />
<br />
Golett taught him to always use his head and not be so skeptical on the supernatural.<br />
<br />
Pumpkaboo proved that being cautious, even when something looks harmless, is wiser then risking unprepared danger.<br />
<br />
And lastly, Drifloon's lesson was to never give up, even if your goal feels miles away and one kind act deserved another.<br />
<br />
Even Aiden, his Chimchar had given Ethan something to think about. That being curious and learning first hand experience breeds to quickly gained knowledge.<br />
<br />
There was one particular Pokémon, Ethan hadn't been able to help or even create a bond with, one that didn't even have any sort of connection to his own inner turmoils that had created this nightmare. In fact, Aiden would probably consider him crazy for even thinking on what he was about to do next...<br />
<br />
&quot;You there, <b>Pumpkaboo</b>,&quot; Ethan walked over to the Pumpkin shaped Pokémon floating before him, the same one that wrapped many vines around him and tightened them to the point of near suffocation, &quot;I don't know if we got on the wrong foot or what but I get the distinct feeling that we belong together. Call it a hunch, but you seem out of place here, your future lies beyond what this place can do for you, I can help you grow and together we can unlock your true potential. How about it, would you like to join us on our journey?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aiden seemed a bit skeptical at first, <i>this was</i> a Pokémon that had his trainer in a bind...but even the chimp had to admit, maybe what the Pumpkaboo needed was a push in the right direction and if anything were to go wrong, Aiden would be there to protect his trainer.<br />
<br />
The chimp gave one last look towards the strange Dream Berry, now wasn't the time for him to eat it. <br />
<br />
With Ethan's choice made, he awaited the ghost/grass types' response.</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Gemini Spark</u>: <i>[07:00 am]</i> </b>All in all, you decide the best thing to do is leave Snorunt to enjoy its meal… even if that means Vanillite suffers as a result. Natural order isn’t something you want to tamper with ,so you move ahead, feeling dizzy as you leave the cave behind and enter the new tunnel. This might be your first time inside the Dream World, but you have the distinct feeling you’re not going to stay asleep much longer… which would explain the lingering feeling that there is <i>somewhere</i> you have to reach, and fast.<br />
<br />
The tunnel stretches ahead for what feels like miles and miles, becoming progressively narrower as you go but never tight enough that you have to bend over. As if the more you walk, the more the hallway begins to accommodate to fit you, and only you inside. Makes sense, considering this is your dream after all.<br />
<br />
But then, just as you begin to feel confident about your direction, subconsciously feeling your mysterious destination drawing closer and closer… the tunnel ends. No branching paths, no new cave, not even a hole on the floor… just a massive wall of ice blocking your path. But how? How can this be?! Did you take a wrong turn somewhere?...<br />
<br />
<i>*crack, crack, crack…*</i><br />
<br />
The sound catches your attention easily – after all, it’s the only sound to be heard other than your own breathing in this seemingly lifeless place. You look down at the base of the ice wall and find a small creature repeatedly Tackling away at it… It’s a

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: rgb(153, 204, 255)">Entering the next tunnel, Hyrem couldn't help but feel that he kept wanting to move forward more and more, like there was someplace he needed to go, particularly before he and Carla woke up from their dream together. And the tunnel that seemingly stretched on forever just made the trip so long and frustrating as the way grew tighter and tighter until it was barely enough to continue to fit Hyrem so he wouldn't have to bend down. Because dream logic.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, however, the &quot;logic&quot; of this place started to fall against him, and he came across a dead end. There was no next room, no fork in the tunnel, nothing, just...a dead end. Maybe the left path was actually the one he should've taken? Before he turned to double back, however, he heard ice cracking somewhere after something seemingly impacted with it. Looking around, he couldn't see anything, but once his eyes trailed down to the bottom of the wall in front of them he found yet another creature that looked like it was made entirely of ice, this one with four stubby ice legs and a small pillar of ice sticking out of its back, quite a <i>Sturdy</i> animal indeed. &quot;I've never seen this Pokemon before...what could it be?&quot; Hyrem asked as he brought out his Pokedex once more to scan the Ice-type:<br />
</span><br />
<span style="color: #99ccff"><b><i>Bergmite, the Ice Chunk Pokemon. Bergmite live in snowy, mountainous areas and travel in herds. The ice covering its body is a good defense against most attacks but can be chipped and cracked over time. To repair it, this Pokemon breaths a cold air around it to fill in the cracks by forming new ice in them. They also use this frigid air to completely encase opponents in ice.</i></b><br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, probably becomes a tank of some sort then,&quot; he commented. Watching Bergmite continuously <b>Tackle</b> at the wall of ice, he figured it could probably hit like one too. This one faced a problem, however: every time it looked like Bergmite was going to open a way through the wall it always kept filling in against it, forcing it back until it was back to its original form. Hyrem didn't have much time left before the dream would be over, and it felt like the end was just past this wall. Turning back at this point would be way too inefficient, not when they were so close, but simply throwing more weight or attacks at the wall probably wouldn't do much good from what he saw was happening to Bergmite.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've got an idea!&quot; he suddenly said out loud. &quot;Carla, try using <b>Helping Hand</b> to boost Bergmite's power. Maybe with that kind of help it can break through the wall!&quot;<br />
<br />
His Espeon nodded and began channeling energy straight into Bergmite to give it a good buff to its offenses, but would giving it more strength be enough?</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Electric Blue Eye</u>: <i>[10:00 am]</i> </b> The decision is a hard one to make. So many encounters, Pokemon you’ve befriended and others not so much… but every single one of them added something to your story, to your life experience as a wandering Trainer.<br />
<br />
As you struggle to make your choice, you begin to feel light-headed again, the Tree of Dreams briefly fading from sight… you know you are now on the verge of awakening, and that you can postpone this choice no longer.<br />
<br />
Taking this trip as maybe a sign of things to come, friends to reencounter along the way in the real world, and feeling deep down that now is not yet the time for Aiden to tap into his hidden Ability, you set your eyes on perhaps the most unlikely of choices: the only Pokemon to have openly showed hostility in a dream that should otherwise be yours to control. Does it perhaps signify some superior power, in that Pumpkaboo was able to weaken the grip you had in your own dream enough to actually put you in harm’s way?<br />
<br />
You take a deep breath and point at Pumpkaboo, your mind made up. The Ghost-Type lets out a strange sound, akin to a fit of laughter, visibly amused by your proposition – as if leaving this place and the garden it tended to was its plan all along… A curious reaction, for someone who nearly killed you for trespassing earlier… Perhaps in due time you’ll come to understand Pumpkaboo’s true motives, as the living pumpkin hovers over to you glowing ominously.<br />
<br />
As soon as the choice is made, you once again feel dizzy, but the blurry vision doesn’t improve this time around. Overwhelmed by the strange feeling, you feel your eyes beginning to close on their own… knowing that once you open them back up, you’ll have returned to reality.<br />
<br />
You wake up in your bed, yawning; then, remembering everything that just transpired, you look around in alarm, but your concerns are soon laid to rest once you see Aiden just starting to wake up as well right next to you. And it’s not until you start to get up that you notice something metallic resting on the palm of your hand… on closer inspection, you realize it’s a <b>Dream Ball</b>, and that someone resides within – the <b>Lv 1 Super-Sized Female

<br />
<br />
<b><u>Icy Cave</u></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Gemini Spark</u>: <i>[08:00 am]</i> </b> Turning back now seems like a waste of time, and you can’t shake off the feeling that your goal is indeed beyond that icy wall. As it stands, helping out Bergmite seems the best option, but how to do it? Carla has a wide array of moves at her disposal that could perhaps ease the Ice-Type’s burden... but you got something else in mind! This is, after all, Bergmite’s cross to bear – rather than completing its task, you opt to instead <i>aid</i> this Ice-Type in its endeavour!<br />
<br />
Carla takes on a faint white glow, and synchronizes her mind with Bergmite’s before transferring her energy over to the Ice Chunk. Before long Bergmite too is glowing white and, feeling suddenly invigorated and owning power like it never had before, it lunges head-first into the wall one more time… this time causing it to crack and collapse entirely, revealing the path beyond!!<br />
<br />
Bergmite hops excitedly while sunlight pours inside the ice tunnel. You walk outside, astonished at the sudden change of scenery… how can this be?! Behind you are the Icy Caves you just traversed, but ahead a sprawling field of grass and flowers, and a huge tree not too far away! As if two completely different worlds met here and the wall Bergmite broke was the one frontier between them…<br />
<br />
Something tells you that tree is where you need to be, the destination you’ve unknowingly sought all this time, the goal at the end of those endless freezing tunnels and caves!<br />
<br />
When you finally arrive near the trunk, wider and taller than any skyscraper you’ve ever seen, something happens – something you’re not sure should even be possible… Every single one of the Pokemon you met before is right here! <b>Cubchoo</b> peeks around from the other side of the trunk, looking just as fearful now as it did when you first met it; <b>Spheal</b> plays with the snowflakes it blows, apparently trying to build statues to little avail; <b>Snorunt</b> looks around hungrily, eyeing the other Pokemon with dubious intentions; <b>Vanillite</b> lays on the grass, its breath shallow, its left half eaten away; and <b>Bergmite</b> runs straight past you, having followed you from the Icy Caves all the way over to the Tree of Dreams, joining the other creatures around the trunk.<br />
<br />
Inexplicably, you have the distinct feeling that any one of these Pokemon would be willing to leave the Dream World behind at your request…<br />
<br />
Carla, meanwhile, is staring at something else entirely. Right in front of the Tree of Dreams, something glimmers atop a much smaller trunk, severed practically above ground level. A Berry, unlike any other you’ve ever seen, glowing with a myriad colors and vaguely shaped like an Espeon– once again, despite not being told, you recognize the item as a <b>Dream Berry</b>, which Carla looks decidedly interested in trying out…<br />
<br />
This is the culmination of your dream. Moments away from waking up, you must now make the final choice! </span></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: lightblue"> The dream was beginning to collapse on itself; one by one the Pokémon around Ethan slowly began to vanish in a ball of smoke, the large tree before him also disappearing from sight- including the berry that hung on one of its lower branches. All that remained was darkness...dark nothingness, himself; his Chimchar and the Pumpkaboo that he asked to join him.<br />
<br />
But how exactly was he supposed to take a Pokémon from a dream to reality?<br />
<br />
Pumpkaboo inched itself closer to the trainer before giggling to itself and using it's fluffy appendages grabbed Ethan's hand, in his hand was a Pokéball he didn't quite recognize but instantly knew the name of as 'Dreamball'. <br />
<br />
The Pink and Purple Sphere glimmered in his hand. He presented the ball to the Pumpkin before a bright light began to resonate from the two circles on the front of the Pumpkaboo's body, showing a path of light that lead to one final door...<br />
<br />
Without hesitation Ethan walked down the path and reached for the doorknob, a familiar sound of raging fire reached his ears. He opened the door and the darkness suddenly transformed, the backdrop changed to an open clearing, in the middle of a forest. The sky was dark with a few visible stars and the moon covered in smoke. In front of the young trainer and his two Pokémon, was a boy crying and sobbing uncontrollably, the house he once lived in burning to the ground, he cried out for his parents...who didn't make it out. The boy's clothes were tattered and charred; even his Snivy didn't make it out without a few scorch marks...<br />
<br />
Ethan was watching his younger self cry in agony, he didn't care if it was just an old memory that didn't want to leave him, he wished there had been someone to comfort him that night...to let him know that he would be okay.<br />
<br />
Ethan began to walk away, he didn't want to remember anymore...and as he turned away a voice spoke out- &quot;It's going to be okay...&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>What?</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Mom and Dad, they're in a better place...you did everything you could to stop this from happening. They would be so proud.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>That’s- that's not how the dream is supposed to go...</i> Ethan turned around, was this what Pumpkaboo wanted to show him before?<br />
<br />
There, ahead of the much older gentlemen as his younger self cried, clinging to his exhausted and passed out Snivy in his little arms, a taller shadowy figure was comforting him.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's alright Ethan; I'm here now. Just rest and when morning comes, you'll feel the sunshine kiss you on your cheek. Tomorrow will be a new day and when you wake; your life will never be the same again.&quot;<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
Ethan woke up in a start, the sounds of bird chirping outside on his windowsill. The sun rays were already seeping through the curtains, he instantly thought of his Pokémon Chimchar- wondering where he could be, as soon as he turned to the side, he discovered Aiden was barely waking from his slumber as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chim...char?&quot; Aiden rubbed at his eyes before lazily walking over to Ethan, as monkeys do, before laying back down and resting his head on his trainer's knee.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning!&quot; James his Gastly came into the room before watching his trainer yawn, looking a tad out of it. &quot;Hey, you alright there?&quot; The ghost Pokémon asked but when he didn't get an immediate response said, &quot;Yo, earth to Ethan...you okay buddy?&quot; Waving his ghastly hands in front of the trainer's eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh...yea.&quot; Ethan mumbled, &quot;I just had the craziest dream is all...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You did just snort a weird substance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did not snort it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There he is, I was just yanking your chain. You sleep okay? You were out like a light once I sprinkled that stuff on you, or should I say the two of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait...what time is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's nearly 11am I think, why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I slept the whole night?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup...so this dream...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, I'll tell you over breakfast if you don't mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...what's that?&quot; The trainer's starter pointed towards Ethan's hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's what? Huh!&quot; Without realizing, Ethan was holding onto a special kind of Pokéball and inside of that Pokéball contained a very special Pokémon...<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a Pumpkaboo! Woo! Where did you get that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The hell am I supposed to know!&quot; Ethan retorted back, &quot;I was asleep this whole time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Were you, were you really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I said I was!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How about, calling it out from the Pokéball...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, sure.&quot; Ethan said, holding out the sphere and pointing it towards the air, &quot;Come on out, Pumpkaboo!&quot;<br />
<br />
The ball opened up and out popped a Super-Sized Pumpkin Pokémon, &quot;Pumpkaboo!&quot; She said as she greeted everyone in the room.<br />
<br />
James began asking his question and the only conclusive thing he got was that the Pokémon had come from a dream...<br />
<br />
&quot;You got to be kidding me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, it's not as Farfetch'd as we're thinking it could be. Weird things do tend to happen to us, James.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, but I'm not buying it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I vaguely remember my dream having a Pumpkaboo in it, but ahh! I can't recall!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Useful as always,&quot; James looked on a bit disappointingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever, if this Pumpkaboo is telling the truth, that makes her mine and I'm keeping her!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What!?&quot; Gastly gasped, &quot;We don't even know if she's telling the truth!?&quot; Whose voice went unheard by his trainer...<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to the team Sally, now then...&quot; Ethan turned his attention towards his Gastly, &quot;About breakfast...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye...&quot;<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
I had a blast! Thanks for the well written, great paced story, as always!<br />
Claiming a Super Sized Lv.1 Female Pumpkaboo with the Hidden Ability Insomnia inside of a Dreamball, thanks!</span></span><br />

<b><span style="color: lightblue"><u>Icy Cave</u></span></b><br />
<span style="color: lightblue"><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Gemini Spark</u>: <i>[08:00 am]</i> </b> Turning back now seems like a waste of time, and you can’t shake off the feeling that your goal is indeed beyond that icy wall. As it stands, helping out Bergmite seems the best option, but how to do it? Carla has a wide array of moves at her disposal that could perhaps ease the Ice-Type’s burden... but you got something else in mind! This is, after all, Bergmite’s cross to bear – rather than completing its task, you opt to instead <i>aid</i> this Ice-Type in its endeavour!<br />
<br />
Carla takes on a faint white glow, and synchronizes her mind with Bergmite’s before transferring her energy over to the Ice Chunk. Before long Bergmite too is glowing white and, feeling suddenly invigorated and owning power like it never had before, it lunges head-first into the wall one more time… this time causing it to crack and collapse entirely, revealing the path beyond!!<br />
<br />
Bergmite hops excitedly while sunlight pours inside the ice tunnel. You walk outside, astonished at the sudden change of scenery… how can this be?! Behind you are the Icy Caves you just traversed, but ahead a sprawling field of grass and flowers, and a huge tree not too far away! As if two completely different worlds met here and the wall Bergmite broke was the one frontier between them…<br />
<br />
Something tells you that tree is where you need to be, the destination you’ve unknowingly sought all this time, the goal at the end of those endless freezing tunnels and caves!<br />
<br />
When you finally arrive near the trunk, wider and taller than any skyscraper you’ve ever seen, something happens – something you’re not sure should even be possible… Every single one of the Pokemon you met before is right here! <b>Cubchoo</b> peeks around from the other side of the trunk, looking just as fearful now as it did when you first met it; <b>Spheal</b> plays with the snowflakes it blows, apparently trying to build statues to little avail; <b>Snorunt</b> looks around hungrily, eyeing the other Pokemon with dubious intentions; <b>Vanillite</b> lays on the grass, its breath shallow, its left half eaten away; and <b>Bergmite</b> runs straight past you, having followed you from the Icy Caves all the way over to the Tree of Dreams, joining the other creatures around the trunk.<br />
<br />
Inexplicably, you have the distinct feeling that any one of these Pokemon would be willing to leave the Dream World behind at your request…<br />
<br />
Carla, meanwhile, is staring at something else entirely. Right in front of the Tree of Dreams, something glimmers atop a much smaller trunk, severed practically above ground level. A Berry, unlike any other you’ve ever seen, glowing with a myriad colors and vaguely shaped like an Espeon– once again, despite not being told, you recognize the item as a <b>Dream Berry</b>, which Carla looks decidedly interested in trying out…<br />
<br />
This is the culmination of your dream. Moments away from waking up, you must now make the final choice! </span></span>

<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: #99ccff">Perhaps taking a more direct approach to the ice wall in the way might have worked, but Hyrem felt that might have simply ended with the ice wall reforming itself. Instead, Carla is ordered to link her mind to the Bergmite attacking the wall, hoping to give it enough of a <b>Helping Hand</b> for it to bust through and obtain passage for them. Well, Bergmite took the newfound power from its mind link and <i>owned</i> it, as well as the wall of ice, granting access to the scene ahead.<br />
<br />
In stark contrast to the icy caves that had been the setting of this entire trip, Hyrem and Carla were met with a meadow of grass and flowers and an enormous tree right in the center of it. The pair of them rush towards the tree, knowing that, not only was it going to be a welcoming place compared to the cold, crystalline caverns as far as temperature was concerned, but it was...just a place they needed to be. The first thing that catches Carla's attention was a large stump, although much smaller than the tree itself, and an Espeon-shaped berry was sitting right on the stump seemed to beckon her towards it as she started licking her chops, unable to conceal her hunger.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Hyrem saw quite a few familiar faces: the five Ice-type Pokemon he had met in the dream! Ignoring the...Vanillite...lying there...he watched as the Bergmite ran up and joined the shy Cubchoo and the playful Spheal, and then his eyes fell once again upon that devious, little Snorunt, who was looking at the other Pokemon, maybe even looking to finish what it started, which was...well, Vanillite. He couldn't deny that there was something about this Snorunt that made him feel like...he was meant to be with that Pokemon. Besides, he would probably be doing the Dream World a favor by removing this threat to the other Pokemon--though he'd have to figure out how to keep it in check if it actually did follow him into the real world as advertised--so he approached the Snow Hat, stretched out his arm and said, &quot;Hey there, would you like to come along with me? I bet I can find you some good food, maybe even better than what you ate earlier!&quot;</span></span><br />

<br />
That was what Katsura found himself asking after he opened his eyes to find himself suddenly gazing out across a bridge of rainbow that branched off in numerous directions through an open sky, connecting to a multitude of floating islands, each seeming to have its own unique biome. He had been to the Cloud Garden before, so the sight of gravity-defying landmasses was hardly unusual to him, and he knew a likely reason for why he was in this odd place.<br />
<br />
He had purchased an odd item known as <a href="http://www.serebiiforums.com/showthread.php?640278-Pok%E9mart&amp;p=18064783#post18064783" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.serebiiforums.com%2Fshowthread.php%3F640278-Pok%25E9mart%26p%3D18064783%23post18064783&amp;hash=ab382e427e77c5e139d43a95bbda126b" rel="nofollow noopener">Dream Dust</a> from the local Pokemart on a whim. It was said to have the ability to cause one to enter a particularly deep sleep; within which one could experience miraculous things. He had also heard it was best experienced in the company of a Pokemon, and so he had given his Gible, Tia, the privilege of sharing his cozy bed the night before, the little dragon having found a comfortable spot by his feet to lay.<br />
<br />
Now she was standing at his side, glancing about the unfamiliar landscape, and looking quite bewildered by her sudden change in scenery. For a dream, it felt all too real. Katsura had had lucid dreams before, but this was something else entirely. as he felt totally in control of everything he was doing, and all of his senses felt just as sharp as if he were awake. Still, he didn't feel entirely convinced, and proceeded to inquire of Tia to help him confirm whether or not he was in fact, dreaming.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Tia. Do me a favor and give me a nice big chomp on the leg, if you would please.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Gible tilted her head to the side at his odd request before following through, though her &quot;chomp&quot; was more like a nibble, for he could scarcely feel a thing as she gently closed her massive jaws around his left leg, seemingly afraid of harming him. <br />
<br />
Katsura sighed before scolding her a little. &quot;Oh, come on. Just pretend I'm Flandre. Pretend that I'm being annoying, and give it to me good, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
After hesitating a moment, the Gible gradually tightened her grip until her teeth finally began to puncture Katsura's flesh, eliciting a sharp cry of &quot;OW!&quot;, after which she immediately released him and backed off. Even though he had asked for it, she still looked a little guilty about what she had done.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">&quot;Well... I guess if I am dreaming, this must be one heck of a deep sleep.&quot; he said, as he rubbed his minor shark bite. &quot;In any case, we should take a look around.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, the two of them headed off down the rainbow bridge. A thought was lingering on Katsura's mind, though, and that was a cryptic vision he had witnessed before he &quot;awoke&quot; in the Dream World. He had had fleeting glimpses of a trio of Pokemon; a lively <b>Helioptile</b>, a cheery <b>Goomy</b>, and a skittish <b>Joltik</b> . He wondered if it was perhaps a sign of things to come. This was no ordinary dream, after all...</span></span></div>
