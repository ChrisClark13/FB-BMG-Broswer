<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Electric Blue Eye</u>: <i>[2:00 am]</i> </b> Each of the two doors calls out to you in their own way. Memories of your father’s religious inclinations surface upon listening to the eerie prayer coming from whatever lies beyond the door to the left, whereas your own visions upon entering the Dream World come back to you at the sound of wings flapping behind the door to your right. Both choices seem just as fitting, but your resolve in living this dream your own way lead you to choose the right-hand path, drawn to the rhythmic beating of wings on air…<br />
<br />
The handle turns and the door opens effortlessly, a loud creaking noise accompanying as you push it. Before you is a poorly-lit room, relatively small compared to the hall you just crossed; there’s a small bed in the corner and absolutely nothing else in this depressing scenario… save for a small creature flying around and bumping against the walls as if blind, likely due to the lack of space to maneuver properly. When you recalled the creatures you saw crossing the Rainbow Bridge, two came to mind when you listened to the sound of wings flapping, since both were Flying-Type – but now you realize it could never had been either of them. Drifloon has no wings at all, moving around by floating in the wind; and this dreaded nightmare mansion is no proper home for regular Pokemon, suitable only for those already dead or otherwise supernaturally inclined – this Spooky Manor isn’t a place where you’d find a Rufflet to begin with. No, instead the Pokemon cramped up in the tiny room turns out to be a

Aiden looks at the Psychic-Type, unsure of what to do about it, then turns to you for answers. There is indeed another door on the far wall, standing no more than five feet away from where you stand. You can try to get Woobat’s attention, proceed deeper into the dungeon or turn back and try the left door instead…<br />

<br />
<span style="color: lightblue">Opening the door with a slight hint of hesitation, both trainer and Pokemon cautiously approach the dimly lit space with nerves of steel wondering what the cause of the noise they had heard only seconds ago...<br />
<br />
With the help of Aiden’s flame, the room was casted in a warm orange glow providing them a way to see around their surroundings. Soon they found the tiny living space to be occupied by a trapped bat who kept smacking it’s body around...<br />
<br />
<i>Is it trying to find a way out?</i> the trainer wondered as his Chimchar looked at him with a sad expression on his face that said ‘We can’t just leave it like this...’<br />
<br />
If Ethan remembered correctly, bat Pokemon like this Woobat used Echolocation to get around, if they were able to draw it out then maybe they would be able to move on to the next room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woobat!&quot; the trainer called out, &quot;We have opened a door to allow you a way out, whether you take our offer is up to you!&quot; he said. Though he wasn’t interested in befriending such a creature, just leaving it there to keep tormenting itself and never getting out seemed like too much of a cruel fate fit for words. Even if it was a dream...Or was it, just a dream?...the sounds, and feelings he was receiving from this place made it feel like this place was real. The sights and smells, everything. Could this place be different from any normal dream? <br />
<br />
Walking out back to the hall, Ethan wondered if the Woobat would heed his words as he himself mused over the decision of trying to go through the door he originally decided wasn’t fit for him. <br />
<br />
<i>How many times did people get a second chance to try for a missed opportunity? Hardly ever...</i><br />
<br />
He wondered what his father might of thought of his decision, in helping a Woobat, his dad had always been a strong believer in helping anyone that may of needed a hand...as Ethan reached for the left most door, grabbing the knob with Aiden’s mind whirling with the possibilities of what it was that lied inside.</span></span><br />

<span style="color: lightblue"><b><u>Pleasant Forest</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>: <i>[4:00 am]</i></b> The Nidoran takes a step back when you approach her, wary but not frightened enough to run. She's willing to give you the benefit of the doubt which, perhaps not the wisest thing to do as far as survival instinct is concerned, certainly reveals something about her character.<br />
You reach for the Berries she could not, picking a handful and dropping them gently on the floor in fron tof the Poison-Type. Other Trainers might have been afraid to approach a venomous animal without proper protection, but you've been around them for years and know there's little to worry about; besides, this Nidoran doesn't seem to have the tiniest inclination for violence.<br />
<br />
The rabbit-like Pokemon looks on while you lay down her meal on the floor. She stares at the stash in obvious disbelief; while she seemed helpless just now, she probably didn't expect to <i>actually</i> get help from a human - but then again, this being your dream, how many humans has the Nidoran actually met before? If she's a product of your own imagination, can you say she &quot;existed&quot; before? Does she have an age, or is she only as old as this dream?<br />
<br />
Stewie seems like he couldn't disagree more with your approach. Stopping to help a random little creature who can't even look after herself is a colossal waste of time when you should be getting to the end of the Pleasant Forest and giving him the Hidden Ability he so desperately craves; what happens if you wake up midway? Absolutely <i>nothing</i>! Still, proper behavior being your starting condition, he doesn't actually do anything other than hover around you impatiently, although you have a pretty good idea what he'd <i>like</i> to do if you let him...<br />
<br />
Nidoran picks up as many Berries as she can (surprisingly, all of them) and suddenly runs away, disappearing behind a nearby bush. Stewie seems greatly pleased that the nuisance is gone, and prepares to push you down the path again... until the little Poison-Type resurfaces holding two Berries, approaches you shyly and drops the offering at your feet - one for you, and one for the Shadow Ledian!<br />
<br />
The path goes on and so does time. What do you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: lightblue"><span style="font-size: 9px">As Keith knelt down beside the Nidoran, she took a step back. The sudden presence of a human made her wary, but she wasn't frightened enough to flee. It was clear to Keith that the small Poison-type was giving him the benefit of the doubt before deciding whether or not to act on her survival instincts. Not exactly the smartest thing to do when survival is your goal, but this Nidoran was clearly a trusting sort. Still, she looked rather disbelieving as Keith deposited a number of berries on the ground before her. Keith supposed he couldn't blame her, after all, he had to look at it from her point of view- if Keith wasn't the first human Nidoran ever saw in her life, he had to be close to it, considering she lived in his own subconscious. But was this really Keith's subconscious, per se, or was the Dream World some kind of strange alternate dimension that the Dream Dust allowed access to, or- Keith banished these thoughts from his head, lest he give himself a headache pondering the true nature of the Dream World. Or worse- lest he become so lost in thought he wound up running out of time.<br />
<br />
Seething in silent fury, Stewie watched the Nidoran as she gathered up as many berries as she was able to (which, to his and Keith's mild surprise, was all of them). His mind was swimming with the very tempting idea of shoving Keith down the path, or blasting the Nidoran with an attack of some sort, but he kept reminding himself- he wanted that shot at his Hidden Ability, even if it meant that the hat man would have to wait until he was awake to be punished for this needless distraction. Yes, that seemed to comfort him- the notion that he could always wait until he actually got Iron Fist to vent his frustration at having to endure this insufferable holdup. Near as he could tell, once a Pokémon actually acquires its Hidden Ability, there's really nothing the Trainer can do to reverse this...<br />
<br />
Blissfully unaware of the true nature of Stewie's patience, Keith watched as Nidoran gathered up the berries and dashed away behind a nearby bush. At this, Stewie gave an evil grin, pleased that the Poison Pin Pokémon had gone. But then, just as Stewie was preparing to start shoving his Trainer again, Nidoran returned! This time, she only held two berries, but as she shyly approached Keith, she dropped them at his feet.<br />
<br />
Keith smiled. &quot;For us? Thank you!&quot; he said gratefully. He picked up both berries, then turned and offered one to Stewie. The Shadow Ledian initially had every intention of refusing the berry, but as he opened his mouth to start ranting again, his stomach cut him off with a rumbling sound. Between that and the knowing smirk forming on Keith's face, Stewie knew that if he refused, he'd be the one wasting precious time that could be better spent getting him Iron Fist. Without a word, he swiped the offered berry from Keith's hand, sniffed at it suspiciously (it's a habit one picks up when one's girlfriend is an unreasonably paranoid Pawniard), and took a very small bite out of it. Though his face didn't change, he kept on taking bites of the berry, more and more frequently, until he had devoured the whole thing. Keith smirked- Stewie must have enjoyed it, even if he was trying to hide it. Taking the berry Nidoran had given him, Keith ate it in just a few bites (his mouth being considerably larger than the Shadow Ledian's). &quot;Mmm,&quot; he said appreciatively as he finished the fruit. &quot;Thanks, Nidoran,&quot; he smiled.</span></span><br />

In his living quarters, Dave looked around. Only a few Pokémon shared his room after hours. In the corner, Jason was settling down for the night, the Croagunk preferring to sleep while squatting for reasons unknown to his trainer. On the floor near his bed, two Pokémon snuggled together, a Houndour nuzzling up to the slightly larger form of a Luxio as they curled up on the heated metal. Smiling, the trainer stepped around Carrot and Angua, heading for his bed, already dressed in his pyjamas. This was a special night. Opening a bedside drawer, he reached inside and withdrew a small vial, glittering purple mist swirling inside.<br />
<br />
He regarded it for a while. The substance had recently been harvested and distributed within Fizzytopia, giving trainers and one of their Pokémon access to the Dream World. He'd visited the realm before, when he was just starting out, but had been interrupted mid-dream, cancelling his adventure before he could capture a Pokémon within. This refined <a href="http://www.serebiiforums.com/showthread.php?640278-Pok%E9mart&amp;p=17663813#post17663813" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.serebiiforums.com%2Fshowthread.php%3F640278-Pok%25E9mart%26p%3D17663813%23post17663813&amp;hash=3c2dd410004c49e4d18e9f7337c350d9" rel="nofollow noopener">Dream Dust</a> could him to control when he went there, though it was limited to twice a year for every registered trainer, which made sense. Didn't want the region flooded with Pokémon with rare Abilities, after all.<br />
<br />
As he opened the vial, he sprinkled its contents onto his pillow, watching the almost smoke-like substance pour out, swirling around for a moment before settling down. Shortly after, his chosen companion for his trip to the Dream World entered. A blob of slime dripped down from the ceiling onto the bed with a splat. However, rather than being the result of shoddy waterproofing, this was actually a Pokémon. Green spots lined around its body, while two beady black eyes peered at him, a crease in the body forming into a smile. The fisherman smiled back. &quot;You sure about this?&quot; he asked, to which the Goomy nodded as vigorously as a limbless blob could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then.&quot; he said, opening the covers and sliding in. Ever since he'd met Liessa in the Friend Safari, he'd promised that he'd help her become as strong as possible. Most members of the species that had been documented had either the Hydration or Sap Sipper Abilities, but a few, extremely rare specimens had been observed to have extra-thick slime that slowed the opponent down if they made contact. The Ability had been dubbed Gooey, and no other line of Pokémon had been noted to have it. If he was going to help Liessa increase her strength, getting this unique Ability would be a great start. &quot;See you on the other side, lass.&quot; he muttered, feeling the Goomy squidge onto his chest for the night, both trainer and Pokémon settling in for a long night's sleep...<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
He'd never really been able to focus on dreams. But this time was different. He was floating in some kind of void, Liessa on his shoulder, with him clad in his normal fishing garb instead of his PJs. As they floated through purple mist, he wondered how long it would take to reach... well, wherever it was they were going, but he managed to make out a few shapes within the fog. A wriggling, whiskered form he recognised as a <b>Barboach</b> slithered past. Coming the other way was a clapping shell that he'd owned before, there was no mistaking a <b>Clamperl</b> when he saw it. His had since evolved into Moist, but the mollusc had a different fishy evolved form that he'd love to train... Lastly, a figure that looked like it had five limbs swung past from imaginary branches. A <b>Mankey</b>! Didn't quite fit with the other two, but he wasn't complaining.<br />
<br />
Before long, the mist thinned, revealing a bright blue sky with a rainbow running into it from his location. He looked around, finding himself on a strange grassy island, while across the multicoloured archway were several other areas. Looking around, he shared a glance with Liessa, smiling at the Soft Tissue Pokémon. &quot;Right then, time for you to get some thicker skin, assuming we don't meet any Pokémon I want to bring hom with me.&quot; he said with a grin, to which the Dragon-type blew a sticky Razz Berry. With his friend on his shoulder, Dave set off across the Rainbow Bridge into the Dream World, this time to come out on his own terms...</span><br />

Your Fletchinder rose to fly by your side marvelling in the new world you had woken to but you were caught in a vision, 3 unique Pokemon entered your vision each of them walking up to the bridge and crossing it before your vision cleared and you returned to your senses. Solair perched on your shoulder looking concerned before you reward him with a comforting smile, there was no where else to go but across the innocent looking bridge, time to finally discover what lay on the other side.<br />
<br />
The bridge is long and soon you can no longer make out the tree of dreams behind you and only clouds as if the bridge was built into the sky alone. Soon the end appears, the ground dusty and dry, hardy bushes and trees growing towards the bright sunshine and large mountains painting the skyline. A faint breeze brushes past your skin and you can hear the noises echoing around the rocky terrain but the landscape remained empty. There was nothing to gain from standing still admiring the view and so you walk on feeling the change of the earth beneath your feet and start your exploration. <br />
You were unsure of what you may encounter in this dream-state or what your mind would dream up but you were hoping to encounter one of those Pokemon in your vision. Soon you hear the sound of rocks falling and spot a few pebbles rolling in your direction. You turn a corner and spot a

throwing hard punches into a hard rock wall breaking off chunks with its attacks. It was focused on training itself and working on its strength and had yet to notice you. You could approach or continue on without it noticing you, time was passing you by and you didn't know how long you had here.<br />

</div></div><b>ApetureScience:</b> Visions of psychic Pokemon swam before your eyes as you dreamt and you smiled, something about them made you happy. You then begin to feel a tug on your arm and grumble against the pull. Opening your eyes you find yourself on an island floating within a sea of clear blue sky. Max was holding on to your sleeve, he must have been the one to wake you. Now that his task was achieved he looks around in wonder and you follow his gaze. Leading out before you was a glorious sight, a rainbow bridge that glistened in the sunlight heading into the clouds. Getting to you feet you remember the dream dust you sprinkled on your heads before you slept, it had somehow brought you to this place. With no-where else to explore you decide to take a leap of faith and cross the bridge.<br />
<br />
It feels as though you are walking a straight path but you could swear you were moving higher and higher with every step. Soon you can no longer see the island of dreams but rather a large looking stately home with a slightly eerie feel to it. Max walks bravely by your side and you try the large doors feeling them open under your touch and swing wide to allow you access. A large foyer opens up before you allowing you several directions in which to travel. Max appears to have chosen for you as he heads off straight ahead behind the curving steps when he hears a noise from behind there. He pokes his head around and jumps back in alarm and you hear a faint giggling. You hope you had not dreamt up some ghoulish creature to play tricks on you. Luckily enough it appears to be a Pokemon from your vision, a small

that pokes its head out and greets you with a cheeky smile. It surely couldn't be here to hurt you could it? Either way there was no telling how long you had in this Dream World and there was plenty more to explore behind closed doors, or was Ralts what you had come here for after all?<br />

</div></div><b>Shadowshocker:</b> Not fully prepared for what the Dream Dust would induce you sprinkle it over you and your little Happiny and fall instantly into a dream-filled sleep. Still half-asleep you open your eyes wondering if you were dreaming or if it was morning already as you press your hand to your forehead. Soon visions of Pokemon fill your senses, A fiery Litwick, a phasing Kecleon and a fierce looking Mawile before you snap to your senses. You hear happy giggling in front of you and look up to see Trucy dancing on top of the sparkling Rainbow Bridge. She would fall over her own feet in her excitement before picking herself and toddling away. In a panic you shoot up to your feet and take her into your arms before she could fall off into the unknown. She wriggles in your arms wanting to play some more. Looking around you could see that there was no where else to turn but to carry on down the rainbow road. <br />
<br />
The bridge rises up into the clouds and you can only see blue skies ahead. After a short walk to find the end of the bridge touching down into a beautiful park. The floor was paved with white stone and pink, green and yellow trees filled the park with colour. Flower beds were equally as bright and filled with flowers of every colour with scents that made your head swim. You knew this had to be a dream, nowhere in the real world could be this vibrant and dreamy. Trucy squealed in delight and leapt out of your arms to rush over to the flowers to inhale their scents. A pair of brown eyes watch her from within the flowers and she stops playing to look into the eyes. They sparkle with mischief their owner a little

</div></div><b>sweetbbydoll:</b> You were looking for a new adventure and where better than one full of wonder and imagination, one within your dreams. Roxy sure seemed puzzled by the idea of sharing your dreams but you won her around and with the Dream Dust you had bought earlier you both soon fell asleep safe within the Pokemon Centre. Your mind returned to your place a birth, a place the celebrated water Pokemon and you had visions of them swimming before you in a pool of clear water, a whale and two sea lion creatures before you feel the tug of consciousness. That tug was brought about by Roxy's bark and you snap your eyes open to see the wonder before you. There you were asleep beneath an old tree on what appeared to be a floating island. A rainbow bridge sparkled before you calling to you to walk along its nearly transparent surface. You share a look with Roxy and giggling nervously you place your foot on the bridge to test its actuality. Feeling a solid surface beneath your foot you decide its safe, now you could go and explore!<br />
<br />
You both walk across the bridge marvelling at how you were suspended in mid-air. The bridge rose into the clouds and soon you could no longer see the floating island behind you or anything below the bridge. The sky above was clear blue and a gentle breeze caressed your skin. You hope you find adventure at the end of the bridge, if there was an end, it felt like it was never ending. Soon you begin to feel the air temperature cool and moisture form on your skin. Your clothes become damp as if you were walking in rain and the water begins to wash over you forcing you to close your eyes. Suddenly you feel engulfed feeling a great pressure against your body. Opening your eyes you notice with a shock that you were now underwater with breathing apparatus already in your mouth and goggles over your eyes. You look down to see that Roxy was floating next you with her own underwater kit on looking rather alarmed that she was underwater too. Only in a dream could you bring a Fire Pokemon underwater, you have to giggle at that. Well this was certainly interesting and you swim forward looking to explore. <br />
<br />
The water was perfectly clear and you could see the rays of the sun beaming down through surface above you. Rocks and coral sparkled in the light and the plants danced with the currents. Swimming through the water you spot a lone Pokemon sleeping by the rocks, the sunlight shining off its purple shell. The

blew bubbles as it slept at peace with the world. You could greet this new Pokemon or let it sleep and explore a little more within your dream. <br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Davethefishguy:</b> You had researched the Dream Dust and its effects before you purchased a pouch for your self. You had made all the appropriate plans for the night and lay on your bed within the bowels of the ship, your Pokemon all in their make shift beds. You sprinkle the dust on your pillow and look up to the Pokemon you want to take into your dreams. The Goomy fell into your arms and gave you a wonky smile. You knew that her ability could change into something rather unique and recalled the promise you made to help her grow stronger, perhaps within your dreams you could achieve both of these things. Your head touches your pillow and you soon fall asleep.<br />
<br />
As you dream visions of Pokemon float before you, a small thin fish, a large blue clam and a fist fighting monkey were amongst them. The mist cleared before your eyes and you blink them open to see clear blue skies and fluffy white clouds before you. You had arrived on a mysterious floating grassy island with a large tree sat behind you. There appeared to be a few items of interest here but only one way off the island and that was the sparkling rainbow bridge leading off into the clouds. You look to the path ahead for adventure hoping to make Liessa stronger or seek out some unique Pokemon to add to your team. She blows you a raspberry meant in jest and the pair of you head down the rainbow road.<br />
<br />
The bridge heads up into the clouds and after only a few minutes of walking along its semi-transparent surface you can no longer make out the island behind you. In fact the clouds appear to be gathering before you leaving cold kisses on your skin. The air is filled with moisture that begins to dampen your clothes and it only intensifies until it feels like rain washing over your skin. You close your eyes and when you open them you are surrounded by water as you float under the sea. You blink and look down to see that you could breath normally, as if you had gills. Goomy floated into your vision with a grin on her face as she seems at home under the water too. The water was crystal clear and the sunlight filtered down shining off the smooth rocks and colourful coral. The water plants moved back and forth as the currents of water rushed past them. Goomy dances around your head before taking off ahead of you wanting to explore. Despite the plant life there appeared to be no Pokemon or creatures lurking as you hunted behind rocks for signs of life. Just as you feel that you may be alone in this dream you spot some movement within some reeds. A little creature, tan in colour with a blue tail was poking out, searching for something within the green leaves. Was this a Pokemon from your vision or was it best to move on?</span></div>

Your Fletchinder rose to fly by your side marvelling in the new world you had woken to but you were caught in a vision, 3 unique Pokemon entered your vision each of them walking up to the bridge and crossing it before your vision cleared and you returned to your senses. Solair perched on your shoulder looking concerned before you reward him with a comforting smile, there was no where else to go but across the innocent looking bridge, time to finally discover what lay on the other side.<br />
<br />
The bridge is long and soon you can no longer make out the tree of dreams behind you and only clouds as if the bridge was built into the sky alone. Soon the end appears, the ground dusty and dry, hardy bushes and trees growing towards the bright sunshine and large mountains painting the skyline. A faint breeze brushes past your skin and you can hear the noises echoing around the rocky terrain but the landscape remained empty. There was nothing to gain from standing still admiring the view and so you walk on feeling the change of the earth beneath your feet and start your exploration. <br />
You were unsure of what you may encounter in this dream-state or what your mind would dream up but you were hoping to encounter one of those Pokemon in your vision. Soon you hear the sound of rocks falling and spot a few pebbles rolling in your direction. You turn a corner and spot a

<br />
<span style="color: lightblue">Hardly comparable to the idyllic scenario of the Island of Dreams, Levin and Solair now found themselves in an arid region with little vegetation and tall ridges lining the horizon beyond. The air was dry and the sun was hot, and all of it made Solair one very happy Fletchinder.<br />
<br />
<i>Maybe this isn't <b>my </b>dream at all...</i><br />
<br />
He watched as the Fire-Type leaped off of his shoulder and took flight, soaring as high as he could as if claiming the sun for himself. There was nothing he loved more than the warm embrace of sunlight, and seeing him in such high spirits made the Saffron-native crack a smile; it'd been a while since Solair seemed genuinely excited about anything...<br />
<br />
<i>After what he went through, I thought... he might never recover. I thought maybe Vesper had really broken him, and he did for a while. But he's back now, he found his passion and a burning desire for retribution - and most of all, he knows he's good enough to get it done when the time comes. After everything that happened, I think Solair is finally at peace with himself and focused on what he has to do. Vesper is as much his ultimate focus as Ivan was mine, and I'm going to do everything I can to make sure he's strong enough when the time comes to get his revenge! This dream isn't about me - it's all about Solair.</i><br />
<br />
Levin kept walking along the dusty path of the rugged mountain, his Fletchinder following from high above, until the distinct sound of punches - which, due to his expertise with Fighting-Types, he'd learned to recognize almost instantly - made them slow down. As Levin warily kept going, small pebbles rolled from around the curve on the road at the same time that chunks of rock flew across the air. What Levin saw when he turned the corner was something Solair had already spotted from the heights - a Croagunk tirelessly throwing fists at a rock wall, looking to strengthen himself while completely oblivious to his surroundings.<br />
<br />
<i>Dartz would roll his eyes at this one; my Croagunk would never let his guard down like this - but then again, open physicality isn't his preferred MO either so this kind of training isn't something I'll ever catch him doing.</i><br />
<br />
He motioned for Fletchlinder to keep following him while he continued down the path, avoiding the Croagunk so as not to break its concentration. The path he was on led elsewhere, and he had to reach the end before waking up - which, as far as he knew, could happen at any time. The last thing he wanted was to leave the Dream World with regrets, especially after Solair's insistence that his road to redemption was to start here.</span></span><br />

</div></div><b>Davethefishguy:</b> You had researched the Dream Dust and its effects before you purchased a pouch for your self. You had made all the appropriate plans for the night and lay on your bed within the bowels of the ship, your Pokemon all in their make shift beds. You sprinkle the dust on your pillow and look up to the Pokemon you want to take into your dreams. The Goomy fell into your arms and gave you a wonky smile. You knew that her ability could change into something rather unique and recalled the promise you made to help her grow stronger, perhaps within your dreams you could achieve both of these things. Your head touches your pillow and you soon fall asleep.<br />
<br />
As you dream visions of Pokemon float before you, a small thin fish, a large blue clam and a fist fighting monkey were amongst them. The mist cleared before your eyes and you blink them open to see clear blue skies and fluffy white clouds before you. You had arrived on a mysterious floating grassy island with a large tree sat behind you. There appeared to be a few items of interest here but only one way off the island and that was the sparkling rainbow bridge leading off into the clouds. You look to the path ahead for adventure hoping to make Liessa stronger or seek out some unique Pokemon to add to your team. She blows you a raspberry meant in jest and the pair of you head down the rainbow road.<br />
<br />
The bridge heads up into the clouds and after only a few minutes of walking along its semi-transparent surface you can no longer make out the island behind you. In fact the clouds appear to be gathering before you leaving cold kisses on your skin. The air is filled with moisture that begins to dampen your clothes and it only intensifies until it feels like rain washing over your skin. You close your eyes and when you open them you are surrounded by water as you float under the sea. You blink and look down to see that you could breath normally, as if you had gills. Goomy floated into your vision with a grin on her face as she seems at home under the water too. The water was crystal clear and the sunlight filtered down shining off the smooth rocks and colourful coral. The water plants moved back and forth as the currents of water rushed past them. Goomy dances around your head before taking off ahead of you wanting to explore. Despite the plant life there appeared to be no Pokemon or creatures lurking as you hunted behind rocks for signs of life. Just as you feel that you may be alone in this dream you spot some movement within some reeds. A little creature, tan in colour with a blue tail was poking out, searching for something within the green leaves. Was this a Pokemon from your vision or was it best to move on?</span>

<span style="font-size: 9px">He looked around, trying to see what was coming. But he couldn't even see where he'd gone, the island he started on having vanished into a thick fog. The clouds had rolled in heavy, leaving him unable to see anything but the small section of the Rainbow Bridge he was standing on. He'd never seen anything this bad, even on cold mornings in the Great Marsh. As the cloud gradually turned to heavier water vapour, Liessa didn't seem too distressed, the Goomy likely loving the damp. As they walked on, the moisture intensified, eventually feeling like he was walking through still rain, soaking him to the skin, not that he wasn't used to that. He'd spent most of his life around water. Closing his eyes, he opened them to find himself... underwater?<br />
<br />
There was no mistaking it, he was definitely on some kind of seabed. But he could breathe! He didn't even need a rebreather or anything! This was incredible, and surely only attainable in the Dream World. If only it were possible when he were awake... Still, Liessa seemed to love it, Goomy naturally living in wet environments, and she squidged on ahead while he looked around. Rocks and coral were everywhere, along with seaweed, giving the environment a beautiful display of colours, like an underwater rainforest. But there was a distinct lack of Pokémon around. Following his partner, he continued looking around, until...<br />
<br />
He thought he saw movement. A bed of reeds shifted, allowing him to see something within. Something small, with tan colouration and a blue tail. &quot;Could it be...?&quot; he muttered, moving closer to have a look. He wasn't certain, but it could well be one of the Pokémon he was searching for. Slowly, he approached the reeds, peering into them to try to get a closer look at the creature, and maybe help it find whatever it was searching for...</span><br />

You hear happy giggling in front of you and look up to see Trucy dancing on top of the sparkling Rainbow Bridge. She would fall over her own feet in her excitement before picking herself and toddling away. In a panic you shoot up to your feet and take her into your arms before she could fall off into the unknown. She wriggles in your arms wanting to play some more.

You knew this had to be a dream, nowhere in the real world could be this vibrant and dreamy. Trucy squealed in delight and leapt out of your arms to rush over to the flowers to inhale their scents. A pair of brown eyes watch her from within the flowers and she stops playing to look into the eyes. They sparkle with mischief their owner a little

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">The scientist took a few moments to blink his eyes. There was no mistaking that this was the Dream World, but they had somehow ended in an area Shadow did not remember coming across. Back then, he'd journeyed through a quaint forest and an extended sky-high highway; this garden was a brand new experience for him. Standing separately so as to not block out the sky in clusters, the trees' multi-coloured array seemed to accentuate the fact that this environment was ephemeral by nature. Nonetheless, the fact that pavements and allotments had been neatly marked out and planted over suggested that someone - or something - was in charge of maintaining the garden. It didn't seem to matter to Trucy either way; the Happiny was overjoyed at simply being allowed to run around and partake in the scenery.<br />
<br />
As Trucy balanced on the edge of a flowerbox, pausing every now and then to sniff the flora before her, she glimpsed another pair of inquisitive eyes peeking out from the plants before the mystery playmate revealed itself. The Zigzagoon opened its jagged mouth and woofed merrily, causing Trucy to squee. Meanwhile, Shadow was still in thought - with his previous experiences in mind, he'd expected to have seen a tub of ice-cream or bubble-blower set somewhere. He hadn't guessed that Pokemon he'd recognise would make their appearance either, but it seemed that all they had to do was explore and move on. Still, if this was the case, erring on the side of caution could be wise; he'd barely had time to make way through the skyway the last time before the huge tree of dreams pulled him back. He knew Trucy would badly want to play, but they couldn't dilly-dally forever either.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trucy, why don't we go ahead and check this place out?&quot; he offered, extending his hand. Trucy looked up from nuzzling her nose against the Zigzagoon, who returned the gesture while wagging its tail. &quot;If we see Zigzagoon again, we can play a little more if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ny~&quot; Patting the inquisitive mammal on its cheek, Trucy bounced into her Trainer's arms, and they headed to the right.</span><br />

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: lightblue"><span style="font-size: 9px">There was a hint of pessimism as the day wound down once more in paradise, Seaside City as Matthew Brown begun the rituals of night. The sun, slowly setting, enveloped the region in orange golden hue as the waves surrounding The Power Plant began to lap slightly fiercer against the river embankment, the slow motion cascading a peaceful sound as the Pokémon trainer made his rounds. The Pokémon trainer had recently bought a vial of <a href="http://forums.upnetwork.net/showpost.php?p=679082&amp;postcount=60" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.upnetwork.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D679082%26postcount%3D60&amp;hash=4eac293204405f7c8c048cedb801beda" rel="nofollow noopener">Dream Dust</a> from the PokéMart, but years of adventuring with hard science behind him had him question the aide's knowledge of the “hidden ability” and the Dream World that lay beyond sleep-filled nights. There was a feeling of being ripped off, and Matthew's mind wandered to the story of Jack and The Beanstalk, where the protagonist traded a cow for magic beans. Of course, in that story the magic beans worked and allowed him to climb a tower and meet a giant and Matthew hoped that buying such a mysterious item from a government-run building would provide similar wizardry despite his cynical attitude.<br />
<br />
He had been told stories by the shop worker of a change in Pokémon personality, where completion of adventures could incur new abilities far beyond the research of their current states, and after listing his Pokémon and being told the nature of their “hidden abilities”, Matthew had chosen Slowpoke as his intended accompaniment. And so, as the night beckoned, Matthew Brown carried the Dopey Pokémon as he turned off the generator in his base, now finally refurbished with totems to the Gods, causing it to die down and sending the base's natural renewal of energy into reserve mode, a feat well capable through the storage of its daily routine; the Seaside Cities vast and unshakable sun transferring through the Power Plant's solar panels whilst the hydro-powered turbines converted the river's ever growing kinetic energy. <br />
<br />
As he did, he noticed many of his Pokémon already settling down for the night; Aerodactyl made its nest in the rafters, Rhyperior guarding by the door, Zigzagoon under the looming tower of Regigigas' plushie. Porygon, who's programming code origins gave the luxury of not needing sleep, took residence in the main generator, continually studying the complex machinery to advance its knowledge whilst Spinarak's insomnia forced her outside to spin her webs, where many of Matthew's water Pokémon basked in the river's sleeping spots. The trainer too headed for his sleeping spot, a double bed on the far side of the base, carrying Slowpoke with him with both hands as he flopped down on the plush mattress, stopping only to sprinkle the vial's containing powder onto his pillows. Eye's closed and ready for bed, the last word of the shop attendant rang out as he left the store;<br />
<br />
<i>“Make sure you dream of 3 Pokémon before you sleep, just make sure they aren't too rare or you'll never imagine them properly”</i><br />
<br />
He switched positions to lay on his side as his head begun to nod, his eyes feeling heavier than any time previous as his brain begun to enter the valley of dreams. Images of Pokémon all shapes and sizes begun to whiz by like a Pokédex version of Guess Who, leaving all but three to stand out. The first, a yellow bidepal mouse with brick-patterned skin and white muzzle; the unmistakable outline of a <b>Sandshrew</b>. The next, another brown bidepal Pokémon formed with naught but a light brown belly and skull atop its head to distinguish it; a <b>Cubone</b>! The last, but certainly not least, had Matthew focus on its rhinoceros-like similarities and grey colour, a Pokémon he had owned before in his starter, the ferocious <b>Rhyhorn</b> his last target...</span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"><br />

</div></div><b>sweetbbydoll:</b> You were looking for a new adventure and where better than one full of wonder and imagination, one within your dreams. Roxy sure seemed puzzled by the idea of sharing your dreams but you won her around and with the Dream Dust you had bought earlier you both soon fell asleep safe within the Pokemon Centre. Your mind returned to your place a birth, a place the celebrated water Pokemon and you had visions of them swimming before you in a pool of clear water, a whale and two sea lion creatures before you feel the tug of consciousness. That tug was brought about by Roxy's bark and you snap your eyes open to see the wonder before you. There you were asleep beneath an old tree on what appeared to be a floating island. A rainbow bridge sparkled before you calling to you to walk along its nearly transparent surface. You share a look with Roxy and giggling nervously you place your foot on the bridge to test its actuality. Feeling a solid surface beneath your foot you decide its safe, now you could go and explore!<br />
<br />
You both walk across the bridge marvelling at how you were suspended in mid-air. The bridge rose into the clouds and soon you could no longer see the floating island behind you or anything below the bridge. The sky above was clear blue and a gentle breeze caressed your skin. You hope you find adventure at the end of the bridge, if there was an end, it felt like it was never ending. Soon you begin to feel the air temperature cool and moisture form on your skin. Your clothes become damp as if you were walking in rain and the water begins to wash over you forcing you to close your eyes. Suddenly you feel engulfed feeling a great pressure against your body. Opening your eyes you notice with a shock that you were now underwater with breathing apparatus already in your mouth and goggles over your eyes. You look down to see that Roxy was floating next you with her own underwater kit on looking rather alarmed that she was underwater too. Only in a dream could you bring a Fire Pokemon underwater, you have to giggle at that. Well this was certainly interesting and you swim forward looking to explore. <br />
<br />
The water was perfectly clear and you could see the rays of the sun beaming down through surface above you. Rocks and coral sparkled in the light and the plants danced with the currents. Swimming through the water you spot a lone Pokemon sleeping by the rocks, the sunlight shining off its purple shell. The

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: lightblue">“Isn't this lovely?” Liza asked her Vulpix as the two of them crossed the Rainbow Bridge together. “Vul...” the little fox growled in response, looking down nervously, shaking slightly as she noticed that there was nothing down below to catch them if they were to slip and fall. <br />
<br />
Roxy's fears had to take a back seat however when the fox noticed water was beginning to fall on them. It first started with a few small droplets and suddenly it felt like a tsunami was coming right at them!<br />
<br />
Looking down again where Roxy expected to see the endless clouds in the sky, she found water rising underneath her paws, she struggled to fight the small waves trying to separate her from her trainer but Liza being a proficient swimmer, treaded to her Vulpix and tried to calm the brown fox's nerves by bringing her close into her arms.<br />
<br />
“Easy now, this water isn't going to hurt you...remember...” Liza said, “This is all in our heads, this is only a dream.”<br />
<br />
As the water continued to rise, now near their necks, Liza held her Pokemon close so she wouldn't be afraid, “Now...just take a deep breath and close your eyes...trust me.” Liza told Roxy softly, as she herself demonstrated, the Vulpix took a deep breath and did what she was told.<br />
<br />
Everything went black for a bit, and Roxy couldn't feel the wet water touching her fur anymore. Suddenly she got a tap on her head and when the Vulpix opened up her eyes she could see she was in a deep blue ocean, as clear as day! With the sun rays coming through the top! She couldn't believe that her, a fire type would ever be able to experience something like this, something so wonderful that only water types and a handful of others could experience.<br />
<br />
Soon Roxy realized that the reason she didn't feel the water was because she was wearing a special kind of scuba suit, with a helmet that made the Pokemon look like she had come from Mars.<br />
<br />
Next to the fox was her trainer, now in a swimsuit that highlighted her curves. Liza's mask and goggles made her look like a strange fish Pokemon, causing the fox to giggle a bit as her trainer pointed toward a Pokemom below in the water.<br />
<br />
Following where her trainer wanted the fox to look...there, sleeping peacefully at the bottom of the ocean was a Shellder. Vulpix found it interesting, how a Pokemon that was probably used to the sea just slept but to the fire type, this was something she didn't think she would be able to experience again and wanted nothing more but to explore the water depths.<br />
<br />
Liza soon motioned to her Pokemon to follow her, as the trainer didn't feel like disturbing such a peaceful creature and swam her way to a different part of the water her Vulpix began swimming like a frog Pokemon, pushing with her back paws while using her front ones to get to were she needed to...<br />

<br />
Karmas remembered what the Poke Mart clerk had said about the <a href="http://www.serebiiforums.com/showthread.php?640278-Pok%E9mart&amp;p=17671652#post17671652" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.serebiiforums.com%2Fshowthread.php%3F640278-Pok%25E9mart%26p%3D17671652%23post17671652&amp;hash=1f467a4ead7c130f433b4b748b750747" rel="nofollow noopener">Dream Dust</a>. It seemed sort of familiar to the trainer, after all he had somehow managed to get Eddie in a dream and he still wasn't quite sure how the hell that had happened. Oh well, Karmas hadn't even been thinking about that when he bought the dream dust. Lately getting to sleep had been hard, like almost as hard as trying to convince Banane not to just eat everything in sight. He had tried everything he could think of, and now Karmas hoped that the Dream Dust would help him get to sleep. He laid down on his bed and looked over at Eddie, the Herdier curled up next up on his mat next to the bed. Like his trainer, he had been having trouble getting to sleep over the past couple of weeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here you go buddy,&quot; Karmas said, sprinkling some of the dust on his pokemon before sprinkling the rest on himself, &quot;This should help us get to sleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
To his delight, Karmas' eyelids immediately felt heavy and soon everything went dark as he finally feel asleep. Only for his eyes to suddenly open again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you kidding me!&quot; he said in frustration, before realising that he was no longer in his base. &quot;Where am I?&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a bark from behind him and Karmas turned around to see Eddie was behind him... floating in a colourless void. Wait, what? Karmas quickly looked around and saw that he and Eddie were in what did indeed appear to be a colourless void. He floated over to Eddie and wrapped an arm around the dog for good measure. Wondering if the Dream Dust had somehow managed to kill him Karmas's vision suddenly went bright, as if he were looking right into the sun. Three pokemon appeared in front of him. They were blurry, but Karmas was able to make them out. The first was a white puffball with two leaves sicking out either side, a <b>Cottonee</b>. The second was a giant snake made out of rock, an <b>Onix</b>. The last of the three pokemon was a small purple rabbit like pokemon covered in barbs, a <b>male Nidoran</b>.<br />
<br />
As soon as they appeared, the pokemon disappeared and the bright light once again took over Karmas' vision. It disappeared once again, and as his eyes adjusted he realised that he was once again in a very familiar place. He was standing in front of a rainbow bridge, similar to the rainbow bridge that had lead him to getting Eddie. Sitting beside him, Eddie also recognized the place, letting out a loud bark.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, looks like we know what to do here,&quot; said Karmas, a smile appearing.<br />
<br />
Patting Eddie's head, the pair started to walk over the bridge.</span><br />

Being careful not to disturb Croagunk whilst it trained you motioned for Solair to follow you down a different path, you just had a feeling that there was something special waiting down there, something you couldn't risk missing out on by waking up before you finished your dream. Solair nods and you both sneak off down a new path and as you pass out of sight Croagunk looks over its shoulder uttering a single croak before concentrating back on the rock before it.<br />
<br />
The moon was moving steadily in the sky and you knew that time was passing you by and a little thread of worry pulled at you. This path was long and appeared to be straight and unyielding, the rocks either side were growing in size almost beginning to blot out the light in the sky. Solair suddenly spots something up ahead standing right in the middle of the path. As you approached you could see that it was a

</div></div><b>Shadowshocker:</b> You were quite shocked to encounter a Pokemon in your dream expecting something a little more bizarre and abstract to appear instead. Trucy was so happy to find something to play with and squealed loudly as Zigzagoon sniffed her tickling her skin before it wagged its tail waiting for her to play. It seemed that you could chose to spend time with Zigzagoon here or just choose another path to explore. You were erring on the side of caution since with your previous experience you ran out of time before you could finish your dream and meet one of the Pokemon you held in your heart. You knew that Trucy wanted to play but you had already made up your mind, you couldn't linger any longer. You beckon her to you and she looks up from nuzzling into the racoon's fur with a sad look but she would follow you, maybe there were more Pokemon to play with, one you would choose to keep. She patted it on the nose and it blinked in surprise as she toddled away back to you. It frowned and gave a sad whine before bouncing off through the flowers to find someone else to play with. You pick Trucy up and take the path to the right wondering what you would encounter next.<br />
<br />
The flower bed seemed to line this path too and even more multi-coloured tree's were in the distance. Trucy looked up to the sky and pointed to the pink clouds that formed different shapes like stars and leaves. Soon you reach an open courtyard, the path passing under an archway gripped by purple vines. There was a ornate fountain in the centre with orange-tinged water cascading from the Clefairy statue on top. There were white painted benches at the edges of the path and Trucy leaps out of your arms again toddling over to a bench and tries to get up to no avail. You walk over and help her up and she sits staring at the fountain with a dreamy look on her face. You take a seat too but know you can't stay long, time was ticking away. Suddenly you feel something poking you from behind and turn to see this

From within her aquatic suit she swam happily through the water, each of her 6 tails wagging behind her. You giggle at her happiness and swim by her side freely. As you move through the water you encounter your first Pokemon a peaceful little Shellder sleeping soundly on the ocean floor. Roxy swam a little closer intruiged by the water Pokemon in its natural habitat but you beckoned her away not wanting to disturb it. Roxy nodded and with an awkward froggy-paddle you swam along a different path. <br />
<br />
The sun shone down upon you casting lights and shadows on your skin, making the rocks that line the path almost appear to move. The marine plants grow large and more beautiful as you swim by, large coral formations in yellow and pink release bubbles of air alluding to the life within. Large strings of kelp wafted by brushing against your suit almost caressing you. Suddenly you see a spinning ball of blue coming right towards you, bubbles rushing off its body from the motion. You brace yourself for impact but the ball wizzes past you and around you in a circle before it stops chuckling to itself before you. You see this playful

Unfortunately not the life you were looking for as at first glance Goomy appears to be the only Pokemon around. Still the night was young and you had yet to explore and so you swim around in search for life. It doesn't take you too long as you spot a beige and blue creature poking out from within some reeds. Your heart quickens as you recognise the potential creature hiding there. You and Goomy approach carefully not wanting to startle the creature and as you get ever closer you begin to realise that your assumptions were correct. It was a

wiggling back and forth within the reeds. You have to part them to see what it was up to and it suddenly stops moving, as if frozen in time. You could see that it had something in its mouth, something that had gotten stuck between two rocks and it was in the process of trying to remove it. It looked like some kelp, it must be after the food but was struggling to remove it from its hiding place. The Barboach looked up at you fearfully wondering what you were going to do but was brave enough to keep its mouth clamped on its meal. Would you help it out before it lost its nerve and fled? </span></div>

</div></div><b>sweetbbydoll:</b> Roxy marvelled at something that would normally be impossible for her, to be completely surrounded by water and be unharmed. From within her aquatic suit she swam happily through the water, each of her 6 tails wagging behind her. You giggle at her happiness and swim by her side freely. As you move through the water you encounter your first Pokemon a peaceful little Shellder sleeping soundly on the ocean floor. Roxy swam a little closer intruiged by the water Pokemon in its natural habitat but you beckoned her away not wanting to disturb it. Roxy nodded and with an awkward froggy-paddle you swam along a different path. <br />
<br />
The sun shone down upon you casting lights and shadows on your skin, making the rocks that line the path almost appear to move. The marine plants grow large and more beautiful as you swim by, large coral formations in yellow and pink release bubbles of air alluding to the life within. Large strings of kelp wafted by brushing against your suit almost caressing you. Suddenly you see a spinning ball of blue coming right towards you, bubbles rushing off its body from the motion. You brace yourself for impact but the ball wizzes past you and around you in a circle before it stops chuckling to itself before you. You see this playful

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: lightblue">The water was cool and refreshing, memories of Liza’s first adventure on the lands of the Arcane Realm soon sprung into her mind as she continued to swim in the ocean’s reef with her fire type Pokemon Roxy accompanying her.<br />
<br />
Feelings of how helpless the trainer felt then, <a href="http://bmgf.bulbagarden.net/f252/arcane-realm-fb-training-zone-144322/index3.html#post5074564" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fbmgf.bulbagarden.net%2Ff252%2Farcane-realm-fb-training-zone-144322%2Findex3.html%23post5074564&amp;hash=ca0cecac2dab0e05aebf0ea8f20ab597" rel="nofollow noopener">being trapped inside a whirlpool</a> due to a Clamperl’s misunderstanding with her Piplup thinking the pearl in the shell was just that, a pearl...soon grew to anxiety, causing the mask she wore to feel like it was choking her rather then giving her a way to breath...<br />
<br />
Oh, how she wanted so desperately to be able to speak then, underwater but alas...she couldn’t, those were the realities of life. <br />
<br />
This time was a little different though, she wasn’t just swimming underneath the depths of the sea. Her mind had created this place, this beautiful, magnificent place. And so when the lass trainer noticed a Spheal rolling and crashing nearby she wanted nothing more then to hear it out, speak with it.<br />
<br />
But could she? Would her mind allow her to take the googles and snorkel off? Would her body back in the real world allow her to even attempt it or would she simply go into some sort of shock? <br />
<br />
Liza swam with these thoughts lingering in her mind, close enough to where the Spheal had stopped. Noticing how happily it looked up at her. Slowly the trainer mustered up the courage to take off her protective gear from her face, trying to remain calm as she attempted to speak underwater.<br />
<br />
“Do you want to play?” she asked the sea lion in a giggle, reaching her hand in a gesture that suggested that she was friendly.<br />
<br />
While the trainer was occupied, her Vulpix was having the time of her life in the back ground swimming, and doing a doggy paddle...<br />
<br />
“Where did you come from? Do you think you could show us around?” the lass smiled.<br />

Your thoughts turn to your own Croagunk Dartz and you knew he would always be on guard no matter the situation. He wasn't one to show such physicallity and preferred a different type of training. Being careful not to disturb Croagunk whilst it trained you motioned for Solair to follow you down a different path, you just had a feeling that there was something special waiting down there, something you couldn't risk missing out on by waking up before you finished your dream. Solair nods and you both sneak off down a new path and as you pass out of sight Croagunk looks over its shoulder uttering a single croak before concentrating back on the rock before it.<br />
<br />
The moon was moving steadily in the sky and you knew that time was passing you by and a little thread of worry pulled at you. This path was long and appeared to be straight and unyielding, the rocks either side were growing in size almost beginning to blot out the light in the sky. Solair suddenly spots something up ahead standing right in the middle of the path. As you approached you could see that it was a

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: lightblue">With Croagunk now well behind them, the duo of Levin and Solair continued to cross the mysterious Dream World. Why his mind would conjure up such a dry, inhospitable place was beyond him, but then again, few of his dreams were ever that &quot;dreamy&quot; to begin with.<br />
<br />
The path narrowed and massive rock structures rose on each side of the straight road, blocking out the moonlight. Levin walked in near-darkness, but Solair would have none of it; he rose high in the sky once again, beyond the mountains and closer to the moon - it wasn't anywhere near as glorious as his precious Sun, but it'd do. The Saffron-native became all the more convinced that this wasn't <i>his</i> dream at all, but quite possibly Solair's...<br />
His thoughts were interrupted by the familiar cry of his bird calling his attention to something further up ahead. He stopped briefly, squinting to try and see what blocked the path, but couldn't. It wasn't until he quietly drew nearer that he realized the reason for the Fletchinder's warning - a large, immobile Golett staring up at the moon...<br />
<br />
<i>Could this be... the one I saw back at the island of Dreams, crossing the rainbow road?</i><br />
<br />
He knew better than to find a logical reason for any dream, but there must have been something that caused him to foresee this Golett. And indeed, there was something strangely familiar about the construct, or the soul beneath the suit of armor... the Pokemon itself was entirely foreign to him, but not the vibe he felt the closer he got. He felt this way before...<br />
<br />
<i>Back when Faust the Duskull took me to the Spirit World to meet...</i><br />
<br />
He was stunned for a moment. There was no way... but what else could it be? Why did he feel like he knew the presence ahead, despite being the first time he saw a Golett of any kind?<br />
<br />
<i>Ivan?!</i><br />
<br />
It couldn't be. Dreams made no sense, and he should take nothing at face value. But maybe this Ghost-Type in iron armor was indeed a physical memory of his brother, Ivan Sanders, master of Steel... Maybe this was his own mind's way of telling him Ivan was no longer a real obstacle in his path, but still an undeniable influence on his journey - so much so that he could easily pass beyond the Golett now if he so wished. But finally at peace with himself, Levin approached the sentient automaton, who continued to gaze longingly at the moon, and smiled.<br />
<br />
- You know... I heard that if you try hard enough, you'll turn into something that can reach it one day.</span></span><br />

</div></div><b>Shadowshocker:</b> You were quite shocked to encounter a Pokemon in your dream expecting something a little more bizarre and abstract to appear instead. Trucy was so happy to find something to play with and squealed loudly as Zigzagoon sniffed her tickling her skin before it wagged its tail waiting for her to play. It seemed that you could chose to spend time with Zigzagoon here or just choose another path to explore. You were erring on the side of caution since with your previous experience you ran out of time before you could finish your dream and meet one of the Pokemon you held in your heart. You knew that Trucy wanted to play but you had already made up your mind, you couldn't linger any longer. You beckon her to you and she looks up from nuzzling into the racoon's fur with a sad look but she would follow you, maybe there were more Pokemon to play with, one you would choose to keep. She patted it on the nose and it blinked in surprise as she toddled away back to you. It frowned and gave a sad whine before bouncing off through the flowers to find someone else to play with. You pick Trucy up and take the path to the right wondering what you would encounter next.<br />
<br />
The flower bed seemed to line this path too and even more multi-coloured tree's were in the distance. Trucy looked up to the sky and pointed to the pink clouds that formed different shapes like stars and leaves. Soon you reach an open courtyard, the path passing under an archway gripped by purple vines. There was a ornate fountain in the centre with orange-tinged water cascading from the Clefairy statue on top. There were white painted benches at the edges of the path and Trucy leaps out of your arms again toddling over to a bench and tries to get up to no avail. You walk over and help her up and she sits staring at the fountain with a dreamy look on her face. You take a seat too but know you can't stay long, time was ticking away. Suddenly you feel something poking you from behind and turn to see this

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">Shadow breathed as he sat on the bench next to Trucy. He hated having to disappoint her so quickly, but at least she wasn't taking it too much to heart, simply taking in the scenery as they continued exploring the park. The forest and skyway were one thing, but this locale seemed to encapsulate the mystery of dreams, with its oddly-coloured landscapes and flora. It was hard to imagine the last time he felt so consciously relaxed; adventuring was fun, to be sure, but somehow he tended to always wind up with the team at risk of being separated, badly maimed or forever lost between realms. Trucy giggled as another swirly cloud passed her by, amused by the nonsensical form it took. What would the others have made of this place, wondered the scientist, then chuckled at the mental image of his grizzled veterans looking very out of place in the park.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Shadow was aware of a nudge on his shoulder from behind, and turned to see another pink Pokemon poised behind him. It cocked its head to the side and immediately ran over, pulling one of its ear-feelers to probe Shadow's chest. It took a while for Shadow to identify the creature as an Audino; in some places they were used in lieu of the Chansey typically seen in Pokemon Centres. Trucy stood on her little feet and watched intently, possibly as a result of her affinity with clerical duties. Every now and then the rabbit-like Pokemon would put a finger to its chin in thought, apparently attempting to work at a diagnosis. All of a sudden the Audino slid to the ground, having tripped over its own feet as it tried to move to a better position.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh dear,&quot; sighed Shadow, reaching a hand for Audino's paw to try and help it up onto the bench. The Pokemon had a rather miserable look on its face, as if this wasn't the first time something like this had happened. Shadow raised an eyebrow; was the Audino always this <b>klutzy</b>? To be fair Shadow already had a prospective medic in mind for the team sitting next to him, but this cleric in front of him seemed too clumsy for the job - no offence intended. Enthusiastic as ever Trucy tried offering the stone she held in her pocket as a peace offering, which was gently noted but pushed back by the grateful Audino - it was just a rock, after all.<br />
<br />
&quot;You take care now,&quot; Shadow said as he patted Audino comfortingly on the head, before scooping up Trucy and proceeding towards the left.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Electric Blue Eye</u>: <i>[3:00 am]</i> </b> Real life doesn’t often present second chances. But none of this is real… is it? You convince yourself that this is your dream, despite how authentic everything feels – and as such, you’re going to take every chance you get to make the most of this world your mind created!<br />
The contents of the door you chose were perhaps lackluster, but you decide to do the right thing for the poor Woobat. As soon as you open the door for it, the Psychic-Type senses a new opening and clumsily flies out of the room, eager to leave such a terribly confined space. But if all the doors were shut… how did it get inside in the first place? This truly is a strange manor…<br />
<br />
Despite dreams being temporary states of mind, you decide to take that rare second chance – the door with the strange sounds beyond it was yet to be opened, its contents yet to be revealed, even if it required you to backtrack a little, which you do. Placing a hesitant hand on the doorknob, you turn it until it clicks, and gently push the wooden door open…<br />
<br />
The unmistakable scent of candles fills your nostrils. The room itself, though vastly different in content, is exactly the same size and layout as the Woobat room, with another door on the far end should you wish to keep moving forward. But the division itself is completely different, not to mention unsettling…<br />
Wax spots fill the wooden floor; countless lit candles flicker and burn, granting the room an eerie orange light. In the center is a stone table, with several rusty scraps of blue metal piled up on top for whatever reason. And next to the table, with its back turned to you, is a creature humming a terrifying incantation, even if the prayer’s words are entirely foreign to you… a black ghostly presence, carrying a golden mask whose features you can’t make out from where you’re standing, but the entity itself is unmistakable even from behind: it’s a

</blockquote><span style="color: lightblue"><span style="font-size: 9px">As Keith and Stewie ate the berries, the small Nidoran<img class="smilie smilie--emoji" alt="♀" title="Female sign    :female_sign:" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/joypixels/emoji-assets@5.0/png/64/2640.png" data-shortname=":female_sign:" /> seemed greatly pleased by their acceptance of their offer, even if aforementioned acceptance on Stewie's part was highly reluctant. The Poison-type rubbed up against Keith's leg gently, obviously having grown closer to the Trainer. As Keith smiled down at Nidoran<img class="smilie smilie--emoji" alt="♀" title="Female sign    :female_sign:" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/joypixels/emoji-assets@5.0/png/64/2640.png" data-shortname=":female_sign:" />, however, her stomach could be heard rumbling. Sheepishly, Nidoran wandered back into the foliage, though not before giving Keith one last smile.<br />
<br />
Stewie was fuming by this point. The hat man and that blasted Nidoran<img class="smilie smilie--emoji" alt="♀" title="Female sign    :female_sign:" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/joypixels/emoji-assets@5.0/png/64/2640.png" data-shortname=":female_sign:" /> were getting along entirely too well for his liking, and frankly, he was glad to see her wander back into the foliage, and even more glad to see Keith get back up and lead the way down the path.<br />
<br />
The road continued onward, not branching anywhere that either one of them could see. The path led them in a straight line, and to Stewie's relief, their surroundings gave them no reason to stop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh,&quot; Keith sighed. &quot;This is pretty peaceful, isn't it, Stewie?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Led, led, led,&quot; grumbled Stewie. The Shadow Ledian wasn't particularly concerned with how peaceful their surroundings were. He came here for one reason and one reason only, and didn't give a Raticate's ass about the journey, only the destination.<br />
<br />
Keith sighed. &quot;You know, you could stand to try and enjoy yourself for once,&quot; he said. &quot;In a way that doesn't involve violence,&quot; he hastily amended, for he knew all too well the look Stewie was getting in his eyes in response to his idea of enjoying himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Led, Ledian!&quot; Stewie snapped in response. It was either enjoy himself or not be violent- pick one!<br />
<br />
Before Keith could guess what Stewie had said, let alone respond to hit, he could see something ahead. It was yellow and red, and hard to make out... Keith dug out his Pokédex and held it out for assistance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Plusle, a Cheering Pokémon,&quot; droned the device. &quot;Cares more for its teammates' welfare than its own. Creates electric pom-poms to cheer on its friends. This specimen's Ability is Lightning Rod.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the Pokédex finished speaking, the Plusle raced past him, seeming to not notice the Trainer or the Shadow Ledian. Clearly, something was causing it great distress, but what Keith was wondering was, was this source of distress something Plusle was running towards, or running away from?<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh,&quot; Keith murmured. &quot;Wonder what that's all about.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stewie narrowed his eyes. &quot;Led led Ledian led Ledian Ledian ian!&quot; he snapped.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you don't care,&quot; Keith said, rolling his eyes, having pretty much correctly guessed what Stewie was saying- the general gist of it, anyway. &quot;And I know we're on a time limit. Let's just keep going- I'm thinking if something got Plusle that freaked out, it'd be running away from whatever it is, not towards it, so by going that way, maybe my curiosity will be satisfied and we won't need to go out of our way to find out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Ledian,&quot; grumbled Stewie. Much as he loathed to admit it, he agreed with Keith on this. He followed his Trainer as they continued going the way they were going, just hoping that this would all pay off for him when all was said and done.</span></span><br />

You remember Oddish are usually inactive during daytime, buried underground, and are only supposed to come out at night… and it isn’t long before you realize what’s wrong – there’s a tiny hole on the ground, perfectly round and just deep enough for an Oddish to fit in, not far from where you stand, but this little one has no idea where to turn to to reach its home in the ground, half-blinded by the sun!<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: lightblue"><span style="font-size: 9px">Keith continued down the path, much to Stewie's relief- the Shadow Ledian was relieved that the hat man wasn't getting sidetracked by that insipid little rodent. Meanwhile, another point of view occurred to Keith- why the hell would there be any sort of situation in this dream that would harm a Pokémon? This was his dream, his subconscious, wasn't it? And Keith was never one to harm a Pokémon, especially an innocent one, so what would cause such a situation like that in his own subconscious anyway? Maybe if this was a nightmare, but if that was the case, then this was the tamest damn nightmare Keith could ever remember having.<br />
<br />
As he pondered this point, the road turned to the left, leading them into a sun-filled clearing. As Keith looked around, he could see something in the distance- a tree, and it was huge! But he also noticed something else in the clearing, something decidedly closer than that tree- a small, blue Pokémon that Keith recognized instantly, for the species was one of the first Pokémon he had ever gotten in the Fizzytopia region.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oddish, a Weed Pokémon,&quot; his Pokédex, still in his hand, droned. &quot;It buries itself underground during the day and emerges at night. This specimen's Ability is Run Away.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stewie glared at Keith and narrowed his eyes. &quot;Ledi...&quot; he began threateningly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax, Stewie,&quot; Keith interrupted. &quot;I already have a Vileplume, and I'm not the biggest fan of Bellossom. Now, I'll just give it some shade so it can find its way back into the hole, and we'll be on our way. Shouldn't take long at all.&quot; Indeed, as he said this, he was already taking off his trademark cowboy hat and holding it so as to try and block out the sun that was blinding Oddish so badly. He saw a small, Oddish-shaped hole in the ground not far from them, and figured that once Oddish wasn't being blinded by the sun, it should be able to find it in no time. And Stewie hoped that this was true- he was satisfied by Keith's explanation of why he wasn't going to pursue this Oddish to add it to his team, but still, if this took them too long, he wasn't going to be pleased.</span></span><br />

After all, you’ve been in this dream for a while now, who knows when the morning sunlight will forcefully pull the both of you back to that insipid reality? He crafted this master plan all by himself, lured you into the Dream World for one single purpose, and here you are being distracted at every turn by futility after futility, random acts of kindness that do nothing but set you back!<br />
<br />
But you’re not going to walk by and let the little one stumble helplessly like this; taking out your cowboy hat, you block out the sunrays to allow Oddish a brief moment of tranquility. Immediately, the Grass-Type locates his makeshift home and rushes over to the hole in the ground, leaps in and makes itself comfortable at last. Talk about a &quot;random act of kindness&quot; going a long way. But speaking of “long way”, you remember there’s somewhere you have to be… even if you’ve never crossed the Dream World before, something tells you that giant tree is the place you want to reach; why is that? And why does it seem like, where before there were none, now is a wide, clearly visible path at the end of the clearing leading deeper into the woods? Is your dream actually <i>directing</i> you towards that one goal?<br />
<br />
Just as you wonder on the matter, a gentle breeze blows and something passes you by, floating blissfully in the wind. Unlike what you might have expected, it turns out not to be a Hoppip, but a

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>: <i>[7:00 am]</i></b> Stewie’s repressed rage stats to boil again when you motion to help out the tiny Oddish. After all, you’ve been in this dream for a while now, who knows when the morning sunlight will forcefully pull the both of you back to that insipid reality?<br />
<br />
But you’re not going to walk by and let the little one stumble helplessly like this; taking out your cowboy hat, you block out the sunrays to allow Oddish a brief moment of tranquility. Immediately, the Grass-Type locates his makeshift home and rushes over to the hole in the ground, leaps in and makes itself comfortable at last. Talk about a simple act of kindness going a long way. But speaking of “long way”, you remember there’s somewhere you have to be… even if you’ve never crossed the Dream World before, something tells you that giant tree is the place you want to reach; why is that? And why does it seem like, where before there were none, now is a wide, clearly visible path at the end of the clearing leading deeper into the woods? Is your dream actually <i>directing</i> you towards that one goal?<br />
<br />
Just as you wonder on the matter, a gentle breeze blows and something passes you by, floating blissfully in the wind. Unlike what you might have expected, it turns out not to be a Hoppip, but a

being carried across the air and towards the path again as it slumber peacefully. Is it yet another sign of the path you should take?<br />
<br />
The path goes on and so does time. What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: lightblue"><span style="font-size: 9px">Ignoring Stewie's narrowed eyes and gritted teeth, Keith used his trademark headgear to block out the sun's rays. With its vision no longer obscured by blinding light, Oddish was able to see again. As Keith had anticipated, it was able to locate its hole almost immediately, and it wasted no time racing over to it and jumping in. The whole process couldn't have taken much more than four seconds.<br />
<br />
&quot;See?&quot; Keith grinned as he put his hat back on. &quot;Four seconds, if that. Now, let's keep moving, Stewie, that giant tree awaits... Wait, why'd I say that?&quot; he muttered. &quot;The tree... I don't know squat about this place, yet something's telling me we want to get to that tree... and where the hell did that come from?&quot; he added, for at that moment, he noticed a path where there wasn't one previously- a wide path, clearly visible, at the end of the clearing, leading deeper into the forest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Led Ledian,&quot; grumbled Stewie, rolling his eyes. Of course, he did agree that the big tree must be their goal, but it didn't help that the hat man was taking his sweet bloody time wondering about it instead of friggin' moving!<br />
<br />
&quot;Right... right!&quot; Keith nodded. &quot;Sorry about that, Stewie- now let's move!&quot;<br />
<br />
As they made their way across the clearing, a gentle breeze picked up, and something small, white, and fluffy floated past them, carried through the air by the breeze. Keith's first instinct was that it might have been a Hoppip, but upon getting a proper look, he recognized the species immediately, his mind flashing back to when the one owned by Marion tried to swipe his hat, back in the Bar. He chuckled at the memory of adjusting his hat only for unholy amounts of cotton puffs to fall out of said headgear, as his Pokédex, still clutched in one hand, spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cottonee, a Cotton Puff Pokémon. Escapes attack by shooting cotton at the attacker. This specimen's Ability is Chlorophyll.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Cottonee was drifting through the air, and down the very same path Keith was headed for himself. As he made his way down the path, Stewie kept a close eye on Keith, and was satisfied to see that Keith was keeping his eyes more on the path than on the Cottonee. Of course, that little wad of fluff would make for a perfect target to practice his Shadow Wave... no, no, Stewie realized- he had to focus. All this time he was trying to keep the hat man from getting sidetracked, and he was about to get sidetracked himself? <i>Hell,</i> no! If they were indeed getting closer, he couldn't afford to get sidetracked now!</span></span><br />
