Solair looked to be in his element and sat on your shoulder his chest puffed out and excitement in his eyes. You were so glad to see him so happy and as you waved Golett good bye you knew that you would meet up again in on one form or another. The experience had gotten you motivated and you were keen to move on hoping to meet more unique Pokemon. You choose the right path and move on for the along the rugged mountain path. This path was more rugged than the others you had traveled and you had to watch your step as you walked being careful to not to fall as you climbed up rocks and then back down … Solair however flies off ahead watching you struggle from above. The path becomes even more trecherous as you notice several holes in the ground ahead and you have to hop and skip as well as climb up and down and Solair chuckles at the display you're putting on. You look up to give him choice words when your foot slips down a hole and you yelp in alarm. You start to pull yourself up when you feel something moving under your foot. It suddenly forces you up and you fall on your back with a grunt of pain. You sit back up rubbing your back and look down at the little

</div></div><b>sweetbbydoll:</b> You were totally surprised to see the little yellow duck so deep in the ocean but since this was a dream anything was possible. It clung to your chest tightly afraid of what ghoulie lay in the dark and as you offer to help it find a little more sunshine and open waters it brightens nodding vigorously. It pointed in front of you in an aid to help you start and you nod making sure Vulpix was ready before making your way forth. It was still quite dark and you had to feel your way being careful not to trip over rocks and coral clusters as you half walked half swam. Soon you feel the ground incline and you make your way up swimming carefully forward spotting lighter water up ahead. It takes a good few minutes but the water lightens considerably and you can see the colourful coral and blue/green rocks. The ground plateaus and you realise that your close enough to the surface to reach out and touch fresh air above you. Psyduck quacks happily and leaps out of you arms jumping up and down in and out of the water creating ripples above you. It stops jumping to hug your legs before hugging Vulpix in thanks and points at wat looks like an underwater cave. You wonder why it would want to go back into darkness again but it appeared rather keen to show you something, would you follow or continue on now Psyduck was safe again?<br />

You silently scan the creature hoping to get a little more information that might help your situation but it stats didn't really provide you with a solution to your problem. You take a deep breath and decide that the nice approach was best in this situation and politely ask Onix if you could move past it to continue on through the tunnel. You cast a look to where you think Myrtle is floating and if you could see her aghast look at being the back up plan against this monstrocity you'd almost laugh.

Suddenly Onix grunts the sounded echoing loudly around you and it slithers off through the left tunnel leaving you alone again. You can only sigh in relief and decide to continue straight not wanting to encounter any more Onix through the side tunnels.<br />

The tunnel remains dark and almost never ending when you feel a dip in your steps. You had entered a large cavern but again there was no source of light to look upon your surroundings.

As it enters the cavern from above it lets in a shaft of light that allows you a small view of the cavern.

</blockquote><span style="color: lightblue"><span style="font-size: 9px">At Keith's words, he heard a rumbling sound, and then he felt the Onix's breath on his face. He dared not move, knowing full well that something like an Onix could very well eat him if it so chose... Of course, he had to keep reminding himself, this was a dream. But then again, who was to say that Dream World dreams functioned the same way as ordinary dreams? He already knew that such dreams could result in Pokémon gaining their Hidden Ability, so he didn't really feel like finding out what would happen if a human got eaten by an Onix in the Dream World.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, this did not become an issue- Onix gave an alarmingly loud grunt... and then slithered away, moving through the left tunnel.<br />
<br />
Keith exhaled. &quot;Whew,&quot; he sighed. &quot;That was- Myrtle, you just rolled your eyes at me, didn't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You must be psy-chic, Meat Sack,&quot; came Myrtle's snide reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, I just know you that well by now,&quot; Keith replied. &quot;Hey, it worked, didn't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Be-cause you were luc-ky,&quot; Myrtle snapped. &quot;Had that On-ix felt like it, you would have been its snack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I wouldn't have,&quot; Keith retorted as he continued on, taking note of the fact that he seemed to have descended further down into the cavern. &quot;You would've blasted Onix with Water Gun if it so much as tried. Right?&quot; he added, for Myrtle wasn't answering him. &quot;Er, right?&quot; he repeated. &quot;Myrtle, I-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, re-lax, Meat Sack,&quot; Myrtle interrupted. &quot;In-deed I would have fen-ded off the On-ix. I just wan-ted to watch you squirm like that.&quot; Keith facepalmed as Myrtle laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Should've guessed as much,&quot; Keith mumbled. &quot;I really should've- WHAT THE?!&quot; For at that moment, a drilling sound came from above his head. Immediately, he dove out of the way as something rushed down towards him. Whatever it was, it had dug through the cave's ceiling, letting in a shaft of light, allowing Keith a limited view of his surroundings- a smooth rock ceiling with icy patches, the ground wasn't quite as icy as before, and there were two tunnels up ahead. More to the point, a small brown Pokémon with blue stripes and huge claws popped up out of the ground. It eyed up Keith and Myrtle before crossing its arms, seemingly unimpressed. Keith merely raised an eyebrow, curious about this Pokémon, whereas Myrtle narrowed her eyes, irritated already by being judged by this tiny thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why you lit-tle-&quot; Myrtle began as Keith pointed his Pokédex at the newcomer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Drilbur, a Mole Pokémon,&quot; droned the device. &quot;Drilbur digs at high speeds by putting its claws together and rotating at high speeds. This specimen's Ability is Mold Breaker.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;C'mon, Myrtle,&quot; Keith said to his Banette. &quot;Let's not bother with-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay out of this, Meat Sack!&quot; Myrtle interrupted, floating down to the Drilbur. &quot;Al-right, just who do you think you are, thin-king you are so much bet-ter than me? Hmmmmm?&quot; the Ghost-type demanded. Keith sighed, he should've known better- he could easily let this go, deem dealing with the Drilbur a waste of valuable and limited Dream World time, no problem. Myrtle, on the other hand, that was a whole other swarm of Yanma. That Drilbur reminded Myrtle vividly of a particularly prideful Druddigon she frequently found herself at odds with in the Bar, and she wouldn't have it, she wanted to know just what exactly made that Drilbur think it was so superior to her.</span></span><br />

</div></div><b>sweetbbydoll:</b> You were totally surprised to see the little yellow duck so deep in the ocean but since this was a dream anything was possible. It clung to your chest tightly afraid of what ghoulie lay in the dark and as you offer to help it find a little more sunshine and open waters it brightens nodding vigorously. It pointed in front of you in an aid to help you start and you nod making sure Vulpix was ready before making your way forth. It was still quite dark and you had to feel your way being careful not to trip over rocks and coral clusters as you half walked half swam. Soon you feel the ground incline and you make your way up swimming carefully forward spotting lighter water up ahead. It takes a good few minutes but the water lightens considerably and you can see the colourful coral and blue/green rocks. The ground plateaus and you realise that your close enough to the surface to reach out and touch fresh air above you. Psyduck quacks happily and leaps out of you arms jumping up and down in and out of the water creating ripples above you. It stops jumping to hug your legs before hugging Vulpix in thanks and points at wat looks like an underwater cave. You wonder why it would want to go back into darkness again but it appeared rather keen to show you something, would you follow or continue on now Psyduck was safe again?</span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: lightblue">Hugging and partically carrying the yellow duck in one of her arms, Liza tried feeling her way through the dark cavern...she wondered how her Vulpix was fairing swimming closely behind, bumping every now and again as they made their way...when she remembered a much more frightened little girl before...herself, at the age of ten being deadly afraid of the water...<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center">~*~*~&#8203;</div>Being taught to swim was a ride of passage in the blue aquatic town of Cerulean. Some people were almost naturally born with a talent to swim, there was even a rumors of a great swimmer that learned how to swim at a few weeks of his birth...but for others, the idea of swimming seemed impossible...just like the idea of soaring the clouds seemed like a fairy tail at one time.<br />
<br />
For Liza she never seemed that interested in owning a Water Type or even being associated with water life. After obtaining her Charmander, she saw herself leaning on raising Fire Types...unfortunately, any time she had a battle with some school mate, her Charmander would constantly lose to their Water Type Moves. <br />
<br />
Her family tried convincing her to give up her Pokemon and trade it for a Water Type, this alone made her dislike Water Pokemon even more and eventually she was just feed up with anything connected to water.<br />
<br />
Even though her family would try to get their little girl to try swimming and try to learn how to swim, the little girl refused and just ended up staying on the sandy shore with her Fire Type underneath a nice shady umbrella, making sand castles.<br />
<br />
It was on a hot, sunny summer day that while taking a nap Liza's Charmander awoke from a windy breeze rolling in from the ocean side, the sand pommeling against the red lizard's skin that made her slightly irritated, Liza and her family were nearby putting things away in the car, ready to head out, when suddenly the wind picked up even more causing the umbrella they had been using to shake from out of the sand and begin to fly off, bumping into her Charmander, Samantha and flying off towards the ocean! Sam, mid air, tried holding on to the parasol using the stick as a post, her feet standing on the underside of the umbrella as it landed on water and began drifting away!<br />
<br />
“Sam!” The little girls voice broke off, as the family looked on concerned and in disbelief, Liza ran on the sandy shore as her family tried to stop her from going in the water as a wave, big enough to capsize the Charmander's little raft was about to be ripped apart, Liza jumped into the water with out thinking, she began to swim and fight the small waves coming towards her, she was determined to get to her starter before it was too late!<br />
<br />
But as the little girl witnessed the barrel of the wave begin to cascade down all hope seemed lost...that was, until a <b>Hydro Pump</b> ripped right through the wave, cutting it in half and preventing the Charmander holding its tail with one claw and holding on to the umbrella with the other from being swallowed whole.<br />
<br />
It was too soon to celebrate, as Liza still needed to get to her Pokemon but because she wasn't an expert swimmer yet, her legs began to cramp and soon her legs felt like lead falling into the abyss...lucky her uncle came swimming by and grabbed his niece from drowning as his sister, Liza's mother, came to the rescue her Pokemon.<br />
<br />
On shore, it was her mother's Blissey that gave the little girl and her Pokemon a check up, as Liza saw from the corner of her eye, her uncle thanking his Blastoise for that earlier attack that had destroyed the wave. That day, Liza learned two very valuable lessons; How to swim and that fear was a interesting thing, if you could block fear from entering your mind, you could anything.<br />
<div style="text-align: center">~*~*~&#8203;</div><br />
As Liza reminisced about past events in her life, she noticed the floor curving upward, the path she had taken had reached a dead end...but as she looked up, she knew that wasn't necessarily the case, the path continued upward and as she and her Vulpix swam up together with their Psyduck companion they could see a light at the end of the dark tunnel.<br />
<br />
Coming up, it was truly the case as their surroundings were illuminated with the bright rays of the sun, just like before when they first started their adventure. <br />
<br />
Thanking both Liza and her Pokemon for their help, it seemed the Psyduck wanted the trainer to follow it into another cavern.<br />
<br />
Liza giggled a bit, “Quite the silly duckling, aren't you? Haven't you had enough of dark caves? Or could it be, you're much braver now that you have someone else along with you. Whatever the case, you've peaked my interest...after you! But please...” She said with a much more motherly tone, “Stick close to us in case of anything.”<br />

Solair looked to be in his element and sat on your shoulder his chest puffed out and excitement in his eyes. You were so glad to see him so happy and as you waved Golett good bye you knew that you would meet up again in on one form or another. The experience had gotten you motivated and you were keen to move on hoping to meet more unique Pokemon. You choose the right path and move on for the along the rugged mountain path. This path was more rugged than the others you had traveled and you had to watch your step as you walked being careful to not to fall as you climbed up rocks and then back down … Solair however flies off ahead watching you struggle from above. The path becomes even more trecherous as you notice several holes in the ground ahead and you have to hop and skip as well as climb up and down and Solair chuckles at the display you're putting on. You look up to give him choice words when your foot slips down a hole and you yelp in alarm. You start to pull yourself up when you feel something moving under your foot. It suddenly forces you up and you fall on your back with a grunt of pain. You sit back up rubbing your back and look down at the little

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: lightblue">The fall would’ve hurt a hell of a lot more he hadn’t landed on something unexpectedly… fluffy? Levin felt himself being propelled <i>upwards</i> and immediately aided in the process with a frightened leap – this wasn’t supposed to happen, by all accounts. Staring at the ground in alarm, he locked eyes with a clearly annoyed Swinub, and finally everything made sense.<br />
<br />
<i>Thank Arceus for its Thick Fat, or I would’ve crushed the poor thing…</i><br />
<br />
Feeling genuinely sorry for the small creature, Levin dropped to one knee while Solair landed on his shoulder. After reassuring his dear companion that he was alright, the Saffron-native turned his attention to the Ice-Type and issued a heartfelt apology; at the lack of any other means of compensation, it’d have to do.<br />
<br />
-	Are you hurt? I didn’t mean to drop on you like that, the road is pretty terrible up there and I fell into some sort of hole… I’d give you something to make up for the hassle, but it seems backpacks don’t follow us into our dreams.<br />
<br />
He added the last part with a wink, but found himself wondering if it’d make any sense to the Swinub. It remained to be known whether the Pokemon inside the Dream World knew themselves to be figments of a dream. He held out his hand to pet the baby swine, taking care to move slowly as to not startle the creature.<br />
<br />
-	I mean no harm, even if we got off to a rough start. Can you help me find a way out of here? I promise not to bother you again.<br />
<br />
He smiled at the irritated Ice-Type as he thought about his own Swinub, the recently acquired Brimir – knowing <i>him</i>, he wouldn’t have so much as frowned at the incident, Levin still hadn’t found anything that could rile him up. This one seemed definitely more feisty, but maybe the promise of leaving it alone would be enough motivation for the wild Pokemon to point him the right direction. Finally, he whispered to the firebird on his shoulder, grumpily.<br />
<br />
- Don't you think for a second that I didn't hear you laughing at me just now...</span></span><br />

</div></div><b>Shadowshocker:</b> You grimace as you watch Audino trip over its own feet after trying to manoeuvre around the bench to get a better look at you. It was obviously a little clumsy but unperturbed it gets back up and continues its assessment. You already had a future medic for your team in Trucy who one day could become a powerful and happy Blissey and this Audino appeared to be a little too clumsy for the job. Trucy is keen to make friends however and offers Audino her stone which Audino takes with a nod before using it to whack your knee make both you and your knee jerk in surprise. You didn't want to interupt the healer when it was only trying to help but you didn't want to be struck anymore, that and time was running along quickly. Audino, as if sensing this steps back and nods giving you a thumbs up. It appears that you passed its health assessment and it hands Trucy her stone back. You pat Audino on its head thanking it for its attention and get to your feet before taking the path to the left. Trucy waves to Audino and it waves back as you turn a corner and it is gone from sight. <br />
<br />
You walk briskly along the purple path as yet more candy-coloured trees and plants fill your vision, it does begin to wear on you after a while. As if sensing this the environment shifts to a more toned down colour palette and the trees turn green and the path a creamy gold. Trucy pouts already missing the wild scenery but she smiles as she notices the cotton candy pink clouds remain. Suddenly the path ahead takes a steep decline and you notice that the hill you stand atop gives you a fantastic view of the world around you. The park was huge and there were clearings with play sets including swings, slides and rocking horses, there looked to be an area with refreshments not to far ahead, the colours of the flowers seemed to build together to take the shape of Pokemon such as Pikachu and Clefairy. There was so much to explore you didn't know where to turn first it was then you spot something out the corner of your eye. Sat on the grass not far from you almost obscured by a large tree was a

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">The landscape began to change in tone as they moved on, slowly easing into pleasant shades of pastel. Shadow almost felt his eyes give a sigh of relief as the trees resumed their normal viridian colouration, though Trucy wasn't nearly as pleased. Still, the sky was still filled with clouds the shape and colour of cotton candy, and the fun stuff was yet to come - as they reached a pinnacle of sorts down the path, the park opened up to reveal a far larger, open complex. Familiar structures of slides and swings dotted the area, with wide spaces for chasing and ball-based activities. Even refreshment stands, mysteriously unmanned, had been placed in corners, filling the air with their enticing sugary and salty scents. Shadow could not help licking his lips as his brain responded in kind to these stimuli - happier days in the Kids Next Door, spent without a care in the world, alongside other kids he had the privilege of knowing them as friends and comrades alike. Where were they now, after Global Command sent out the alert to permanently decommission all operatives in the Pokemon sectors? Did they survive with memories intact, and if not, would they still know how to be kids? This nostalgic introspection was interrupted briefly by Trucy struggling against his gentle grasp; understanding, the young man knelt down to let Trucy out of her arm-sized cradle. The Happiny was off, but in her distracted state of mind she ended up zigzagging along the path, not knowing which way to go.<br />
<br />
Unable to stop a smile Shadow turned his attention to the side, catching sight of a large tree and a figure leaned against it, not having noticed him. It was hunched over and about the size of a child, but unmistakable were the heaving horns atop its head that bizarrely resembled functional jaws. A Mawile, Shadow realised, from the occasional spelunking expedition Sector RSE did in Granite Cave - more importantly, from the peculiar vision that had seized him when he entered the dream world. Was there a connection?<br />
<br />
&quot;Happ?&quot; Trucy tottered over to his feet, following her Trainer's attention. By instinct Trucy disliked scenarios where people and Pokemon alike couldn't be happy, and she knew what to do at once. Before Shadow could step forward, Trucy was already on her way, tottering across the grass and around the tree trunk so she could look Mawile in the eye. &quot;Happiny!&quot; she said brightly, taking out her egg rock and raising it as an offering. Shadow accelerated just a little, hoping this Mawile wasn't as scary as its horns would suggest.</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><b>Visions of a Dream! Carla's First Adventure!</b><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #ADD8E6"><span style="font-size: 9px">&quot;<i>Carla?</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
Happy had been sitting in the bedroom of the base with Carla trying to talk to her and had been waving his paw in front of her face for minutes, but the Espeon's slack-jawed gaze hadn't budged since he saw her. She was clearly in a trance, likely having a vision, and her expression changed at random times, from happy and playful to confused and even disgusted. Finally, she blinked and exited her trance only to find her Flareon teammate suddenly in her face. &quot;<i>AH! Happy!</i>&quot; she screamed as she stumbled back in surprise. &quot;<i>How many times must I tell you not to be so close to me while I am having visions!?</i>&quot;<br />
&quot;<i>But you were actin' real weird 'n stuff-</i>&quot;<br />
&quot;<i>I <u>always</u> act strangely when I am in a trance, and apparently this time was no different. Do you not have any business to do with that team of yours?</i>&quot;<br />
&quot;<i>Team Flash Fire? Nope, Silas said we could have the day off, so I was hoping we could hang out.</i>&quot;<br />
&quot;<i>Well, I am in no mood to 'hang out'. I must have some time to think about this vision.</i>&quot; At these words, Carla began to walk into the main room.<br />
&quot;<i>Aw, but I was hoping we could-</i>&quot;<br />
&quot;<i>Just...please...leave me alone.</i>&quot; Carla caught herself about to snap at Happy and continued walking to the entrance.<br />
&quot;<i>Okay...</i>&quot; the Flareon said dejectedly, his ears and fluffy tail drooping as he padded slowly towards the basement so he could sit and watch television with the others.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm home, everyone!&quot; Hyrem's voice came just as Carla had stopped in front of the entrance. She knew from her recent visions that Hyrem would be coming at this moment to open the door and walk inside, so she stood ready to greet him as he stepped through the stone door. &quot;Hi, Carla!&quot; Hyrem greeted his Espeon warmly, not expecting her to be there as she doesn't do that usually. He reaches his hand down to rub the side of her face, and she gave a soft, happy mew as she enjoyed the affection. &quot;You're actually just the Pokemon I wanted to see,&quot; he added before taking out a small sack. &quot;How would you like to go on an adventure with me? One where we wouldn't have to leave the base at all?&quot; Carla then stared at him as if she had realized something; in her vision, she saw the two of them in a beautiful place, encountering multiple kinds of creatures, though all of them hidden from her view at this time so she had no idea of their identity, and all of this came after she saw herself staring at her trainer's face, both of their heads resting on the pillow she has seen on his bed, with what appeared to be some pink, powdery substance all over. With the vision in mind, she nodded, going along with what she saw of a possible future. &quot;Okay, then it's settled! But we'll have to wait for nighttime to do it, OK?&quot; &quot;<i>Espeon!</i>&quot; she gave another soft mew in acknowledgement. Hyrem was, of course, trying to keep it a surprise, but there wasn't much he was going to hide from a Pokemon that could see the future.<br />
<br />
After he gave dinner to all of his Pokemon that hadn't already gotten it themselves, Hyrem was certainly exhausted enough to go to sleep, so he went to his bedroom where Carla was sitting on the edge of the bed waiting for him, as well as Happy and Marion who were on the floor and Zatch, Bubbles, and Juvia swimming in the aquarium. He got out the small sack again, reached in, and pulled out a pile of pink powder. &quot;See this? This is called <a href="http://www.serebiiforums.com/showthread.php?640278-Pok%E9mart&amp;p=17759183#post17759183" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.serebiiforums.com%2Fshowthread.php%3F640278-Pok%25E9mart%26p%3D17759183%23post17759183&amp;hash=a76b2104168f705f488c2eec209b0fbc" rel="nofollow noopener"><b>Dream Dust</b></a>,&quot; he explained to Carla. &quot;This is how we get to the Dream World. We just sprinkle it on our pillows, go to sleep, and that's all we need to do! I don't know about you, but I'm ready for some shuteye, are you?&quot; A big yawn from his Espeon was sufficient enough to respond. Without further ado, he poured the dust on his pillow, spreading it out so it covered the entire pillow. Then he took another handful and spread it across his bed so Carla would be exposed to it no matter where she slept on the bed. Finally, he got under the covers and felt the Dream Dust already beginning to work, and he smiled as Carla joined him at the pillow, curling up so her head was on the pillow. He took his hand and ran it across Carla's side, feeling her soft fur and hearing her purr from the touch. Tonight would give the two of them a very good night's sleep as they drifted off into...<br />
<br />
**********<br />
<br />
The Dream World. Other regions, the most notable of them being the Unova Region, have been experiencing the power of this magical place for years, but for Fizzy Bubbles it was only recently that the technology (and magic) had been installed throughout the entire cluster of islands. Indeed, it seemed absolutely fitting of Fizzy Bubbles to have its version of the Dream World be an island. Trainers and their Pokemon came here not only to enjoy the sights but also to meet very special Pokemon who had powers that others of their species would not normally have. In addition, if the trainer desired it, they had the option of changing the ability of the Pokemon that came with them to the unique ability they would not have otherwise.<br />
<br />
Before Hyrem or Carla even got there, however, they both began to see fuzzy images of three different Pokemon. Soon the first one came into focus as cold air trailed behind an odd creature
<div class="lbContainer lbContainer--inline " title="" data-xf-init="lightbox" data-lb-single-image="1" data-lb-container-zoom="1" data-lb-trigger=".js-lbImage-_xfUid-13-1621064496" data-lb-id="_xfUid-13-1621064496">

</div>
shaped like an ice cream cone, and for a moment both of them were tempted to try tasting it. So was the second image, apparently, as it actually started to chase the first one around with something pink swimming its way through the air trying to make contact with the first Pokemon, and as the second Pokemon came into focus it turned out that the long, pink object was actually a tongue belonging to something that looked like a pink salamander

whose body seemed like it was only half as big as its tongue, and Hyrem and Carla hoped its focus would stay on the ice cream cone floating away from it. The third and final image didn't seem to care about what the other two were doing as it just sat in place inflating itself. As soon as Hyrem and Carla thought it couldn't get any bigger, the image revealed itself to be a ball-shaped whale

before it squirted a good amount of water out of its spout. None of these were creatures Hyrem had seen and registered in his Pokedex; he vaguely remembered seeing the second one belonging to his friend Connor, while the other two were completely unfamiliar to him. Could these be Pokemon Hyrem and Carla were going to meet during their time in the Dream World?<br />
<br />
As the three images faded away, the next thing Hyrem remembered was waking up to a bridge made of rainbows in front of him, with Carla curled up right beside him. He roused Carla from her &quot;slumber&quot;, and as she looked around she couldn't help but think this was a beautiful place. If only it was real...or was it? Having seen some very mysterious things in Fizzy Bubbles, the pair wouldn't be surprised if this island turned out to be a real place. &quot;Well, are you ready?&quot; Hyrem asked Carla. &quot;<i>Spee!</i>&quot; she mewed, signalling that she was ready. &quot;All right, let's see what happens!&quot; Hyrem replied before the two took their first steps on the bridge (which looked and felt solid, but Hyrem wasn't sure if it was solid the entire way) and kept an eye out for what the dream could possibly offer them.</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Gemini Spark</u>: <i>[12:00 am]</i> </b> You and Carla, your beloved Espeon, find yourselves in a place you've never seen before, and you've seen <i>a lot</i> of places. As far as you know, this land isn't part of Fizzy Bubbles, but it doesn't feel entirely foreign either - part of you feels as if it's known this landscape for a very long time, almost as if you <i>owned</i> it.<br />
<br />
Before your eyes is a wide road that stretches into the sky, a path made of rainbow that you find, much to your amazement, to be solid. You cross the Rainbow Bridge slowly, fearful that the illusion might break at any moment, sending you plunging across the sky into certain doom, but the ground beneath your feet remains strangely stable. You keep walking until the road vanishes behind a tuft of clouds; as you pass through them, feeling the cooling effect of the moisture in the air, you come face to face with an entirely new landscape... but how can that be?<br />
<br />
The air temperature seems to have dropped several degrees. All around you, ice walls rise and end in a ceiling of frozen stalactites, with a single hole on the far wall leading ahead to places unknown. How you wound up in this Icy Cave is beyond your comprehension, though if this is a construct of your imagination, what's there to understand in the first place?<br />
<br />
Carla looks around equally intrigued; after all, this is also her first time in such a curious environment - though she wouldn't mind at all if it was a tad warmer. Who doesn't seem to mind the temperature at all is the little creature you spot nearby, scavenging around a heap of boulders possibly looking for food. The

</blockquote><span style="color: #ADD8E6"><span style="font-size: 9px">As Hyrem and Carla walked across the rainbow bridge, any doubt that it would collapse at any moment seemed to fade away. They suddenly became convinced with a surety that the bridge was completely solid and that they would never take a step towards either edge of the bridge. Soon enough, the pair had successfully crossed and had come to a group of clouds that were in the way, though they could still walk through them. The misty, cool feeling of the clouds was then all they could feel at the moment before the climate transitioned from cool to freezing cold, and the road behind them disappeared only to be replaced by ice. Entire <i>walls</i> of ice, as a matter of fact.<br />
<br />
This was the Icy Cave, an entire room covered in it. Hyrem had to cross his arms and hold them while he shivered; he wasn't prepared for a change like this! Carla at least had a fur coat, so she was somewhat more comfortable in these temperatures, though not quite to the extent that the Cubchoo off to the side looking for food was. Hyrem and Carla stood by for a moment, watching the baby bear search through a pile of boulders, but it was soon aware of their presence and swiftly hid itself behind the boulders, noticeably <i>Rattled</i> by their sudden appearance. &quot;Aw, it's okay, we're not gonna hurt ya...&quot; Hyrem said trying to calm the bear cub down; he had hatched a Cubchoo from an egg before and was tempted to keep her, but felt it wasn't time to raise one yet. This one didn't seem like it wanted to accompany them any time soon, so he felt it best to back off from it and continue through the cave. &quot;Come on, Carla, let's move on. Nice to meet you, Cubchoo!&quot; &quot;<i>Spee~</i>&quot; Carla adds with a nod before joining Hyrem through the opening in the cave.</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Gemini Spark</u>: <i>[1:00 am]</i> </b> You opt to leave Cubchoo behind, as the tiny bear is clearly afraid of you. It peeks constantly from behind the pile of rubble and watches cautiously until you and Carla pass through the opening, leaving it be.<br />
<br />
The temperature begins to drop even more the deeper in you go; your hands are starting to hurt, but you persevere – after all, would your own mind let any harm come to you? Still, why didn’t you dream of a warmer place, of all the wonderful destinations it could have conjured?<br />
You find yourself n a narrow corridor of ice, so low in fact that you can’t walk completely straight or you’d bump your head on the ceiling. Your Espeon seems amused at your minor predicament, but after a while of walking, you finally reach another opening, a merciful exit as your back was starting to hurt a bit.<br />
<br />
You step into the next chamber of the Icy Cave to find a huge circular room with barely any ground to speak of – a vast round lake comprises most of the cavern, with only frail-looking ice platforms as an apparent means to cross. You can only imagine how unbearably cold the water must be, and shudder to think what would happen should you fall inside. While you contemplate the possibility of leaping across the platforms to reach the other side of the lake, Carla calls your attention to a shadow moving about underwater. You follow it you’re your gaze, intrigued, until the creature emerges for air and reveals itself to be a cheerful-looking

! <br />
<br />
The tiny creature looks around the cave absent-mindedly, without a care in the world, until it notices you. It can’t take its eyes off of you and Carla, visibly surprised by your unexpected presence and filled with curiosity. Should you approach it, or simply attempt to cross the lake and keep going?<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Gemini Spark</u>: <i>[1:00 am]</i> </b> You opt to leave Cubchoo behind, as the tiny bear is clearly afraid of you. It peeks constantly from behind the pile of rubble and watches cautiously until you and Carla pass through the opening, leaving it be.<br />
<br />
The temperature begins to drop even more the deeper in you go; your hands are starting to hurt, but you persevere – after all, would your own mind let any harm come to you? Still, why didn’t you dream of a warmer place, of all the wonderful destinations it could have conjured?<br />
You find yourself n a narrow corridor of ice, so low in fact that you can’t walk completely straight or you’d bump your head on the ceiling. Your Espeon seems amused at your minor predicament, but after a while of walking, you finally reach another opening, a merciful exit as your back was starting to hurt a bit.<br />
<br />
You step into the next chamber of the Icy Cave to find a huge circular room with barely any ground to speak of – a vast round lake comprises most of the cavern, with only frail-looking ice platforms as an apparent means to cross. You can only imagine how unbearably cold the water must be, and shudder to think what would happen should you fall inside. While you contemplate the possibility of leaping across the platforms to reach the other side of the lake, Carla calls your attention to a shadow moving about underwater. You follow it you’re your gaze, intrigued, until the creature emerges for air and reveals itself to be a cheerful-looking

<br />
The tiny creature looks around the cave absent-mindedly, without a care in the world, until it notices you. It can’t take its eyes off of you and Carla, visibly surprised by your unexpected presence and filled with curiosity. Should you approach it, or simply attempt to cross the lake and keep going?<br />
<br />
The path goes on and so does time. What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: #ADD8E6"><span style="font-size: 9px">As Hyrem and Carla left the Cubchoo to do its business, he would sometimes look behind and see the Cubchoo watching them exit through the tunnel. Once out of sight, all that he could think about was how cold it was...he could swear it was getting even colder as they continued through. It may have had something to do with the tunnel narrowing down so he had to bend down to walk through it; why would he dream up something like <i>this</i>!? Carla put her paw to her mouth to stifle her laughter as she walked ahead of her trainer, but she was happy to point out that the tunnel would soon open out abruptly.<br />
<br />
Hyrem soon walked into another large, icy room, this one with a huge lake and a few small platforms of ice that looked like they could break if he tried using them. It would certainly be a miserable dream if he were to find himself in the freezing water, but he felt as though he needed to get across the lake somehow. Still, he didn't like the way some of the platforms floated in the water; he might as well jump in and try to swim across with how unstable they looked! <br />
<br />
Before he actually attempts anything, however, he hears an &quot;<i>Espeon!</i>&quot; coming from Carla. &quot;What is it, Carla?&quot; he asks, noticing the way she was pointing towards the water. He looks at the lake and finds a small shadow swimming in the lake, one that looked very familiar to both Hyrem and Carla. As it surfaced, the pair were happy to find their thoughts concerning what the mysterious figure was were confirmed: it was a Spheal! Hyrem's thought immediately turned to Brittany, his own aquatic mammal who had become a Sealeo fairly recently, and while this little one certainly wasn't an actual flashback of Brittany's previous form it did seem to have a personality similar to hers: for a moment, it almost seemed <i>Oblivious</i> to everything around it until it saw the visitors, then it kept staring at the two with a much warmer expression than the Cubchoo from earlier. A bit unfortunate that this was not a Pokemon Hyrem was interested in taking with him, but he waved at the Ice-type nonetheless, seeing as he didn't want to hop onto the bridge of ice platforms just yet, hoping he could still make friends with it if only temporarily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi there!&quot; he spoke to it in a warm tone. &quot;Come on over, it's okay! We could use some help crossing this lake, if you want to do that for us!&quot; At that moment, he wished he had a small fish to feed the Spheal; those always worked wonders whenever he was training Brittany, but seeing as he had none on his person, unless one magically appeared in his hand (which he wouldn't be surprised if that actually happened, this was a dream after all), he would have to rely on its apparent curiosity to get the better of it and hope it would come to him on its own. &quot;<i>Spee espeon~</i>&quot; Carla added, trying to help out the cause by also trying to sound as friendly as possible. But would Spheal suddenly have second thoughts?</span></span><br />

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px">Chad was hanging out in his base for some much needed down time. It was roughly a month after Chad had met Wyatt in the Friend Safari, where he had not only caught a Tyrunt but his Ledyba evolved to Ledian. He walked through his base passing by Cascoon and Metapod suspended on the ceiling staring at each other with looks of love in their eyes. He could hear the sound of something pounding on the training equipment. He assumed it was Heracross or Pinsir training.<br />
<br />
Chad walked in to the training room, and he was a little surprised to see Ledian was punching the training bag. He watched Ledian for a little while. The Five Star Pokémon punched the bag for a few more moments when he decided to take a break. He noticed Chad watching him.<br />
<br />
“You’re getting good with your fists Ledian,” Chad remarked as he walked over to the training bag. Ledian nodded. “I think I know what we can do to help you improve. Hang tight. I’ll be right back.”<br />
<br />
Ledian returned to the punching bag to practice some more. As Chad exited the room, Mienfoo walked in. The two of them began practicing punches.<br />
<br />
After about an hour or so, Chad returned to the base. He checked the training room for Ledian, but he wasn’t there. He found Ledian in the Living room resting on a cushion. He looked up at Chad and noticed the curious bag in his hand.<br />
<br />
“Here. Look at this,” Chad held up a small bag of dust to show Ledian. “This is <a href="http://forums.upnetwork.net/showpost.php?p=705252&amp;postcount=203" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.upnetwork.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D705252%26postcount%3D203&amp;hash=a01ccbb5f89ee58b259d147234c8b49e" rel="nofollow noopener">Dream Dust</a>. I had heard the secret to the Dream World had been discovered recently, and the Pokemart made the Dust accessible to the trainers for a limited time during the year.” Ledian studied the bag curiously. “So we can either dream of obtaining a new teammate, or we can concentrate on making your punches stronger than they already are. Are you interested?” Ledian nodded eagerly.<br />
<br />
Chad opened the bag and sprinkled some dust over some pillows for the two of them. “Get comfortable bud.” As soon as he got on the pillow, Ledian almost immediately fell asleep. Chad, however, got drowsy quickly. Before falling asleep, he had some visions of some Pokémon he’d been thinking of lately. First he thought of the tiny yellow caterpillar Pokémon <b>Weedle</b>. Strangely the Weedle morphed into another bug, a <b>Nincada</b>. Lastly before Chad fell completely asleep, water swept over the Nincada; and a <b>Frillish</b> appeared.<br />
<br />
Chad was jolted awake to find Ledian by his side like before, but they weren’t in his base anymore. They appeared to be on an island, but it was nothing like the island his base is on. The pair looked around a bit, and Ledian spotted a large rainbow. “Ledian!” he alerted Chad and pointed at it.<br />
<br />
“Is that where we should go bud? Ok, yes. The brochure mentioned something about the Rainbow Bridge. That’s where we begin. Let’s get going.” The two of them walked over to the rainbow.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>jolteonjak</u>: <i>[12:00 am]</i></b> This is your first time experiencing the strange properties of Dream Dust, and although you can't possibly explain how the substance works, it's no doubt that it does - within a matter of seconds you find yourself in a new, formidable landscape you know could not ever be real: a floating island with a Rainbow Bridge that rises up to the sky.<br />
<br />
Ledian looks equally impressed while scanning the surrounding area, but after a brief while it becomes obvious that this is merely the starting point of something much grander. After all, that rainbow road is no doubt the only way out of here, and after experiencing a vision of three very distinct Pokemon vanishing into the clouds, you know you must do the same. Finding courage to step onto the ethereal bridge, you thank Arceus that it turns out to be perfectly solid despite what logic might dictate. Boldly, you cross the path where it takes you and dive into the white clouds above...<br />
<br />
When the smoke dissipates and your vision is clear again, you come face to face with an entirely new scenrio - one of lush green trees, filled with the singing of birds and flowery scents. This does indeed look like a very Pleasant Forest, where nothing could possibly ever go wro...<br />
<br />
<i>*donk*</i><br />
<br />
Something large drops from a branch right overhead and misses you by a mere inch! It looks strangely like a lump of metal that became half-buried in the soft soil below, but when it starts struggling to get back out, you realize it's actually a Pokemon - one with a very heavy shell, no doubt a distressed-looking

! You can’t help but wonder how often this has happened to the poor thing already, and it will no doubt be able to squirm out of its predicament eventually, but should you give it a hand?<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Gemini Spark</u>: <i>[02:00 am]</i> </b> You ask Spheal to help you and Carla cross the huge lake, but it takes a while for the Oblivious Ice-Type to process the information. When it finally realizes what you're requesting, it hops in and out the water happily - seems it's been a very long time since anyone asked it anything, and the idea of being helpful to someone is refreshingly new.<br />
<br />
Committed to the task, he asks Carla to hop on his head, but the Espeon seems uneasy to do so; she is, after all, much larger than Spheal. When that fact dawns on the tiny seal, it smiles sheepishly and instead proceeds to widen each ice platform by further freezing the water around it with Powder Snow. After a while of toiling incessantly, the platforms become more than wide and stable enough for you to cross, and both you and Carla make your way across the vast lake with a lot more confidence, while a proud-looking Spheal looks on and waves happily.<br />
<br />
At the far end of the lake is another opening on the wall, this one immediately bisecting into two very different tunnels: the one to your left has huge ice crystals growing all around the walls and ceiling, glimmering beautifully like rainbow fragments; it must have taken centuries for the ice to solidify like that, into such magnificent structures; on the other hand, the tunnel is so full of these crystals that it becomes considerably narrower than the ones before, and one should tread lightly not to be harmed by the sharp edges of the frozen stalactites. The tunnel to your right is pitch black, like someone took a mass of pure darkness and forced it into inside; shadows dance as if inviting you to join them, and a curious sound emanates from its depths, almost like a soft tune someone would hum to themselves...<br />

<span style="color: lightblue"><b><u>Spooky Manor</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Electric Blue Eye</u>: <i>[5:00 am]</i> </b> Golett stares at you the whole time, unblinking, unmoving, while you try to regain your composure. Something about the Ghost-Type in particular makes you uncomfortable, though you can't quite tell why - does it have anything to do with the ritual you just witnessed? Come to think of it, where now stands the living automaton, there was once nothing more than a heap of rubble and a scary Yamask preacher... Is it possible that the soul dwelling inside the machine belongs to Yamask, or is it an entirely new being? And if so, what happened to the Ghost that brought it to life?<br />
<br />
Too many questions unanswered, you wait for Golett to make a move. After contemplating and seemingly processing your request, the golem mechanically jumps off the table, landing with a thud, and holds out its hand to Aidan. He guides the Chimchar over to the door on the far wall and you follow them, with no other option left besides backtracking.<br />
<br />
Golett gently pushes the door open, revealing a sprawling corridor ahead, with heavy-looking iron doors lining the walls on both sides; just then, the loud sound of a clock striking the hourly mark echoes through the halls, ringing repeatedly. Is it this late already?...<br />
You turn your attention back to the task at hand: There is a number above each metal door - the first one to your left has a sign above it that reads &quot;12&quot;, while the one to your right reads &quot;01&quot;; the second on the left reads &quot;02&quot;, the one in front of it reads &quot;03&quot;, and you assume the rest of the doors follow the same pattern. Although the corridor is poorly lit, you can make out ten doors in total, five on each side. On the ceiling is a picture of a Moon and Sun intertwined, a beautiful impressionist painting that's been unfortunately eroded by time.<br />
<br />
Golett stops and turns to you. It seems you have to choose a door - but assuming there's only one right path, how long is it going to take for you to figure it out? Can you do it before you wake up?<br />
<br />
The path goes on and so does time. What will you do?</span></span>

<br />
<span style="color: lightblue">There were 10 different doors to choose from, which probably lead to 10 different passage ways. If he wasn't mistaken, the numbers on the doors seemed to represent time, he had also heard a ringing in his ear sounding like a clock- he heard 5 strikes so that meant it was 5 O'clock now. He seemed to have everything he needed to solve the puzzle...<br />
<br />
He looked above, noticing the strange painting. Art has always been a way for self expression, but the way the moon and sun were intertwined was...interesting to say the least...he wondered if it too represented something to this dilemma he was now facing. Or if it was just a weird painting.<br />
<br />
If the Golett had lead them here, it might know something in what the automaton wanted them to do. Of course, it didn't mention anything at all...<br />
<br />
&quot;Aiden,&quot; the trainer called out to his Chimp that was holding one of his hands with the ancient machine, &quot;You like puzzles, don't you? Got any ideas on what we should do?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Chimp stood silent, moving his head to look at all the choices he had before him. Using his free hand to rub at his chin as he wondered which door to try...finally he got an idea, &quot;Chimchar!&quot; The fire starter pointed to the door marked ‘6’ and then quickly pointed to the one marked ‘9’.<br />
<br />
&quot;You think, one of these could be answer?&quot; Ethan rose his hand to scratch the slight stubble on his face, &quot;Well, that certainly narrows things down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Door ‘6’ made sense if they wanted to follow the pattern of time...‘9’ was the last door, which meant...it could've let them out of the dream, could've being the key word here, and who knew what would happen then...would the Golett follow them out?<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's play it safe and go for, door number 6.&quot; Ethan said, &quot;Worst case scenario we simply come back and try again.&quot;</span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Gemini Spark</u>: <i>[02:00 am]</i> </b> You ask Spheal to help you and Carla cross the huge lake, but it takes a while for the Oblivious Ice-Type to process the information. When it finally realizes what you're requesting, it hops in and out the water happily - seems it's been a very long time since anyone asked it anything, and the idea of being helpful to someone is refreshingly new.<br />
<br />
Committed to the task, he asks Carla to hop on his head, but the Espeon seems uneasy to do so; she is, after all, much larger than Spheal. When that fact dawns on the tiny seal, it smiles sheepishly and instead proceeds to widen each ice platform by further freezing the water around it with Powder Snow. After a while of toiling incessantly, the platforms become more than wide and stable enough for you to cross, and both you and Carla make your way across the vast lake with a lot more confidence, while a proud-looking Spheal looks on and waves happily.<br />
<br />
At the far end of the lake is another opening on the wall, this one immediately bisecting into two very different tunnels: the one to your left has huge ice crystals growing all around the walls and ceiling, glimmering beautifully like rainbow fragments; it must have taken centuries for the ice to solidify like that, into such magnificent structures; on the other hand, the tunnel is so full of these crystals that it becomes considerably narrower than the ones before, and one should tread lightly not to be harmed by the sharp edges of the frozen stalactites. The tunnel to your right is pitch black, like someone took a mass of pure darkness and forced it into inside; shadows dance as if inviting you to join them, and a curious sound emanates from its depths, almost like a soft tune someone would hum to themselves...<br />
<br />
The path goes on and so does time. What will you do? </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: #ADD8E6"><span style="font-size: 9px">After Hyrem and Carla had asked a Spheal to help them cross an almost certainly freezing lake, Hyrem wasn't sure if the baby seal had actually heard him or even if it understood Carla. Before he could repeat himself, however, it jumped around in the water, happy to help out. It then swam over to Carla offering to give her a ride with her jumping onto its head, but Carla did not like the idea at all. &quot;<i>I'm afraid I won't fit on your head, and I would rather not have any part of me in that water.</i>&quot; Once again, it took awhile for Spheal to register this in its head, but it eventually understood the problem and began to work on the platforms, using Powder Snow to reinforce them and make them safer to cross. It took a lot of time and effort, but Spheal eventually covered all of the platforms with extra ice, and there were almost no cracks or flaws visible in the platforms. Hyrem took the step onto the first platform and found it did not budge at all now, and his form surged with confidence as he hopped to the next platform. &quot;Spheal, you did it,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;We can make it across now! Come on, Carla!&quot; The Psychic-type's sleek form soon leaped onto each platform after her trainer, and after a few more platforms the pair jump on to a much bigger patch of ice on the other side of the lake. Thanks to Spheal, they safely made it across!<br />
<br />
&quot;We did it!&quot; the trainer cheered before pumping his fist in the air, then he looked back toward Spheal. &quot;We couldn't have done it without your help though, thanks Spheal! See you around!&quot; &quot;<i>Spee~</i>&quot; Carla added, the two of them waving to their new friend before leaving the scene and approaching the end of the room in this cave. Soon enough, they were met with two tunnels, one of them with lots of colorful light reflected off of the ice crystals dotting the walls, and the other looking so dark that nothing could be seen past the entrance. On closer inspection, however, the path with all of the ice crystals looked very narrow, and there was a real danger of brushing up against the sharp crystals and getting nasty cuts that way, making it more foreboding than was seen on first glance. Meanwhile, while Hyrem couldn't see anything down the other path, he could definitely <i>hear</i> something...a song of some sort, soft, quiet...and relaxing. Slowly he made his way toward the entrance to the right path, where the singing could be heard amidst the darkness. &quot;What...is that?&quot; he whispered to himself, having been entranced with curiosity about the path, and he let himself take slow, steady steps, luring himself further in to the dark with nothing to fixate on but the singing. Carla didn't quite feel right about picking a path where she couldn't see anything, but she had no choice but to follow her wandering trainer or risk getting seriously lost and separated from him. One thing nagged at the back of the Espeon's mind, however: despite this being a world of dreams where nothing bad was supposed to happen, was this voice leading them into a trap?</span></span><br />

<span style="color: Lightblue">“I’m back!” the trainer yelled out excitedly when stepping into his base. “And guess what I have with me.” He holds up <a href="http://www.serebiiforums.com/showthread.php?640278-Pok%E9mart&amp;p=17803449#post17803449" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.serebiiforums.com%2Fshowthread.php%3F640278-Pok%25E9mart%26p%3D17803449%23post17803449&amp;hash=0ee8736bd371820e11e03417cb771232" rel="nofollow noopener">an innocuous bag</a>. A few of Lucas’ younger and eagerly excited Pokémon walked up. Each in turn shouting their names as they asked what it was. “It’s a special type of powder they’re now selling at the Pokémart. The Swirlix licked her lips when hearing the word ‘powder’, immediately assuming it was some sort of sugar.<br />
<br />
“Swirl-swirl-swirlix.” The Fairy type conveys her suspicions to the other Pokémon as she follows her trainer.<br />
<br />
Lucas walks over to the kitchen to get something to drink. Mrs. Khan was standing in the kitchen, cooking something to eat for the younger Pokémon. “Khan!” she yells angrily at her trainer’s entrance. As if he were trespassing in her domain. She holds up a ladle to scare him off.<br />
<br />
“Hey!” Lucas backs off gently. “I’m just getting something to drink. Sheesh.” Mrs. Khan kept a watchful eye on him though. The trainer placed the bag of Dream Dust on the counter as he bent over to the fridge.<br />
<br />
Floss waddled in silently and made her way to the kitchen counter, eager to eat the assumed powdered sugar. A candy-like Pokémon such as herself couldn’t contain her excitement around sugary treats. Mrs. Khan noticed the Swirlix easing her way up the counter and gave one fell smack with the soup ladle to knock the Swirlix off. “Khan.” The Kangaskhan herself mistook the bag itself now for some sort of ingredient and grabbed it to use for her cooking.<br />
<br />
Just then, Rags the Gallade walked in. “Gall!” he quickly exclaims.<br />
<br />
“Oi. No.” Lucas nabs the bag from his Kangaskhan before she could waste it. In turn he got a fell smack from the ladle for his defiance. “Ouch.”<br />
<br />
“Cha-chatot.” Blackbeard swooped in and swiped the bag off of Lucas in turn when he wasn’t watching. “Cha-cha. You’re an idiot,” he teases his trainer.<br />
<br />
“Black!” It became a fairly familiar one-liner in the base. The Chatot had a penache for purposefully obstructing his trainer when he could. He flew out of the kitchen area to the living room. Floss chased after him, still wanting the bag of powder for herself.<br />
<br />
“Come back here!” Lucas yells as he runs after them, passing the Gallade who could only sigh. Doom, the young Absol heard the commotion and thought everyone was playing. The Absol chases after the company of three, wanting to join in on the game of capture-the-bag. The Chatot looked back and was startled by the group of three that was known chasing him across the base. He ducked under the table and slalomed through the chairs, making his way to the bedroom as well. The Swirlix and Absol were close on his tail feathers and knocked down the tables and chairs. “Stop!” Lucas yelled at them. But the party continued across the rooms. Pillows were flung around in the flurry and the TV the rest were sitting in front of was almost knocked over as well.<br />
<br />
The napping Slaking woke up to find Black flying above him. The Swirlix and Absol didn’t stop and trampled over their lazy comrade. Floss got stuck in the Slaking’s hair. “SLA!” the now angry Slaking yelled. He rose up gently and roared through the base. He pounded the floor with his fists in anger. The entire base shook and started the Ponyta. The rather timid and bashful Ponyta got scared and raced across the base, leaving trails of fire as was common for her species.<br />
<br />
“No,” Lucas said weakily as he watched his base that now lay in shambles and was catching fire. “Star, calm down.” He tried to reassure the frightened Ponyta. “Star.” The quiet Duskull decided to help and came into action. He slowly hovered over and fired an Ice Beam to cool down the fire. The Chatot zoomed past him, quickly followed by the Absol. The Duskull’s aim was thrown off and the Ice Beam missed its target, freezing large portions of the base in chips off ice. The Slaking continued his pounding in anger and Lucas was thrown off balance.<br />
<br />
He fell on his back. He eased himself up and took a look at the picture in front of him. The Chatot and Absol were knocking over furniture. The Slaking was wrecking the base once again while the Swirlix was trying to untangle herself from his fur. The wildered Ponyta was racing in circles, sending embers across the wooden base while the Duskull was freezing what remained left. “Evereyone please,” he said pathetically. His voice was drowned out by the struggle. “Eveyo-“<br />
<br />
“EVERYONE STOP!”<br />
<br />
The trainer yelled at his Pokémon to obey. His voice rose above the confusion and each Pokémon stopped what they were doing. The Slaking stopped slamming the wooden floor and looked up at his trainer. The Ponyta calmed down and came to a slow trot. The Duskull’s Ice Beam attack stopped. The Chatot stopped his antics and slowed to a standstill, suspending himself above his trainer. As reckless as each of his Pokémon may have appeared, they were obedient to their trainer.<br />
<br />
The juvenile Absol was the lone soul who didn’t immediately quit. Right after Black stopped fleeing, he jumped towards the bag he was holding and ripped it open. The bag spilled its contents and Dream Dust was scattered across the base. Small flakes fell across the trainer’s head and shoulders. The Swilrix’s eyes twinkled at seeing the sparkling dust settle. She immediately managed to unlatch herself from the Slaking’s fur and zipped across the base to the dust. She jumped around her trainer as she gulped in big mouthfuls of air and Dream Dust.<br />
<br />
Before Lucas could tell her to stop he felt a strange drowsiness run through him. He yawned an collapsed on his back snoozing. The Swirlix, after seeing her trainer, yawned in turn from the contagion. She dropped down and nesteld herself near her trainer. The two fell into a deep sleep, leaving Rags and the others to clean up the mess. If they would that is.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Lucas saw visions in front of him. A few were of faint memories. Him sitting in his bedroom with a Ralts. The two of them browsing through a picture book. Another was of the time Kong evolved into a Slaking. One other was of his time in the FB Bar. Lastly he remembered his first capture in the Friend Safari; the Swirlix now named Floss. Unlike the other memories, Floss greeted him warmly as if having known him. And unlike the Pokémon in his other dreams, Floss stayed to watch the blank screen in front of them race across various scenery and shared memories. The two came to a close trance and their minds slipped into imagination of rainbow roads and rundown decrepit buildings.<br />
<br />
In one of these buildings, the two saw three other familiar faces. Lucas’ Purrloin, SKitty and Meowth were there. The Skitty walked over to them and spoke in a kind lady-like voice that wasn’t hers. “Would you like to hear a lullaby master?” She didn’t wait for an answer and walked back to the other two. The trainer could see they were accompanied by two other cat Pokémon and various instruments.<br />
<br />
As if somehow being humans in costumes, they each got set to a particular instrument. The Meowth started strumming his guitar. An otherwise unknown <b>Glameow</b> was doing the same to a bass. The Purrloin patted her paws down hard on the drums. The Skitty stroked the various keys on the piano. An <b>Espurr</b> started blowing on the trumpet she held in her hands. One by one, each chimed in and song in a human voice.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rrXR6n0RTY" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D4rrXR6n0RTY&amp;hash=49838ddd111295eda85532fa1ba1ea0a" rel="nofollow noopener">The song was a memory as well. From Lucas’ earlier childhood. He knew it well but he couldn’t remember where he heard it from before.</a> This was slightly different though. Female voices and with a slightly different pitch. Lucas and Floss didn’t question what was going. They were both entranced by the song. They sat on the floor and swayed left and right on the beat.<br />
<br />
The group came to a slow halt and the Skitty now walked over to the microphone. She started singing in her soft, lady-like voice she had before. The remaining four cat Pokémon calmly strummed their instruments in tune with the Skitty’s lullaby. It went on for quite a bit.<br />
<br />
A tongue clicked out of nowhere and licked the Espurr’s saxophone. The entire group burst into their earlier cacophony. The tongue revealed itself to be of a <b>Kecleon</b>. Discolights seemingly came out of nowhere and gave a disorienting display as they altered colour every second. The Kecleon danced on the group’s jamboree while making his way up to the trainer and Swirlix. His colour pattern changed in turn with the disco lights. He came up very close, he was practically rubbing against them with his dancing. The Swirlix and her trainer stared in trance at the Kecleon’s one stripe that remained a constant in a body that was otherwise constantly changing colours. Like some sort of drug-induced hallucination. It all became too much for them. The loud noise, the epileptic display of light and the otherwise strange event they had found themselves into.<br />
<br />
The two rolled their eyes back in daze before they collapsed on the floor, knocked out. Their dreams became more tranquil and a white screen was set in front of them. The white screen parted like clouds and in front of them the rainbow road from their earlier dream sprawled out, seemingly endless. They didn’t question it and in a dream-like trance they walked across the rainbow road.</span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>jolteonjak</u>: <i>[12:00 am]</i></b> This is your first time experiencing the strange properties of Dream Dust, and although you can't possibly explain how the substance works, it's no doubt that it does - within a matter of seconds you find yourself in a new, formidable landscape you know could not ever be real: a floating island with a Rainbow Bridge that rises up to the sky.<br />
<br />
Ledian looks equally impressed while scanning the surrounding area, but after a brief while it becomes obvious that this is merely the starting point of something much grander. After all, that rainbow road is no doubt the only way out of here, and after experiencing a vision of three very distinct Pokémon vanishing into the clouds, you know you must do the same. Finding courage to step onto the ethereal bridge, you thank Arceus that it turns out to be perfectly solid despite what logic might dictate. Boldly, you cross the path where it takes you and dive into the white clouds above...<br />
<br />
When the smoke dissipates and your vision is clear again, you come face to face with an entirely new scenrio - one of lush green trees, filled with the singing of birds and flowery scents. This does indeed look like a very Pleasant Forest, where nothing could possibly ever go wro...<br />
<br />
<i>*donk*</i><br />
<br />
Something large drops from a branch right overhead and misses you by a mere inch! It looks strangely like a lump of metal that became half-buried in the soft soil below, but when it starts struggling to get back out, you realize it's actually a Pokémon - one with a very heavy shell, no doubt a distressed-looking

! You can’t help but wonder how often this has happened to the poor thing already, and it will no doubt be able to squirm out of its predicament eventually, but should you give it a hand?<br />

The path goes on and so does time. What will you do? <br />

<span style="font-size: 9px">With all the Chad knew about science growing up, he was shocked that the Rainbow Bridge was solid and that it could support a human’s weight. Perhaps it’s the fact that this is a dream that allowed him to cross the bridge, but whatever it was, he was across now. Ledian hovered in the air beside him.<br />
<br />
The pair entered a beautiful forest. While he’s no stranger to forests, Chad knew this wasn’t a place he should be bringing his Quilava, or any of his other Fire types. What he found interesting about this forest is that he could smell some flowery aromas. Chad hadn’t remembered many dreams in the past, so he thought it was special to even be able to smell flowers.<br />
<br />
The pair entered the forest on the path before them. He knew why they were there, but he also wondered the importance of the three Pokémon he envisioned before falling asleep. Would they be Pokémon he would see in the forest? After reading reports that a Mega Stone for a Beedrill was discovered, Chad’s interest in the Poison Bee Pokémon had grown considerably. He also remembered that he had promised Ledian a dream trip, since his punching moves were invaluable against the Tyrunt they had faced in the Friend Safari.<br />
<br />
Suddenly something fell from a tree above Chad; it even just missed landing on him! The sound of it landing on the ground was almost metallic. When he looked down to see what it was, he found it was some metal. There was something familiar about that metal though. It looked strangely like a Pokémon he once owned before it evolved. The cover opened to reveal that it was in fact a Shelmet that fell from the tree.<br />
<br />
Shelmet seemed stuck in the ground. The shell must have been pretty heavy for that to happen. Chad bent down to check it out. “Hey buddy, are you all right?” he asked the Snail Pokémon. Ledian landed beside Chad and Shelmet to investigate. “Do you think we should help get it unstuck?” Chad looked at Ledian. “I don’t think it will take too long.” Ledian nodded. <br />
<br />
He and Chad got closer to Shelmet, and they attempted to lift the Snail Pokémon out of the ground. “Good gravy, this shell is heavy!” Chad said amazed. “I don’t recall my Shelmet being this heavy. Ok Shelmet, we’re going to help you get out of trouble, but then we have to go. We have a mission to complete.”<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>jolteonjak</u>: <i>[01:00 am]</i></b> Despite knowing dreams are fleeting, and that this is a unique opportunity to explore this mysterious land, your sense of duty speaks louder and you decide to help out the poor Shelmet.<br />
<br />
Your efforts combined with Ledian’s allow you to pull out the unusually heavy Shelmet. Perhaps it’s due to its Overcoat adding extra weight to its metal shell that it fell into such a predicament… Either way, lingering isn’t something you can afford to do and the Bug-Type seems to understand. It claps its shell as a way to express its gratitude, but something tells you that sooner or later the same thing’ll happen to it again… Not only that, you have a distinct feeling that the two of you will see one another again fairly soon. But how can you know that?...<br />
<br />
Ledian points to the road ahead and you’re quick to follow. The last thing you want is to wake up before achieving what you set out to do – after all, the Dream World is elusive and you can’t simply return whenever you want. You know you have to make the most of this opportunity, and that involves going deeper into the Pleasant Forest.<br />
<br />
The further in you go, the more intense the aromas become, flowery scents that fill your nostrils and leave behind a soothing sensation. However, as you progress, something <i>else</i> begins to fill the air, a distinctly unpleasant smell that you’re soon able to identify – burning! There’s no doubt about it; the unmistakable odor of ash stands out clearly among th otherwise lovely perfumes of the Pleasant Forest’s depths. You rush to the source – somehow you know exactly where to head, as if your mind conjured the whole thing, the kind of omniscience that can only be attained in dreams. And after a while of dashing, you reach the place in question – the heat surrounding you is noticeable, and the origin is right in front of you: a single oak is ablaze, flames dancing around the large tree from top to bottom in a spectacle of light. For some unexplainable reason, as befitting of dreams, no other tree catches fire, no matter the proximity – the oak burns alone, but brightly, in the middle of the forest.<br />
<br />
Temporarily dazed by the miracle, you take a while to notice something fluttering busily around the fire. When you do realize it, you manage to spot a single

looking very distressed; on closer inspection, it seems her hive has caught fire as well, and there’s nothing the tiny bee can do on its own but watch her home burn to cinders...<br />
<br />
Due to the strange properties of this land, it doesn’t seem like there’s going to be a forest fire any time soon. You could leave the scene behind and press onwards, or take time to help out the poor little Combee, which might take a while.<br />

The path goes on and so does time. What will you do?</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Electric Blue Eye</u>: <i>[6:00 am]</i> </b> The setting is too perfect to ignore – there must be a pattern here, a reason for the hall’s display. Numbered doors, the painting on the ceiling… and then the striking of the clock, somber, melancholic even – six tolls this time, as you expected. That has to be it.<br />
<br />
You reach for the handle on door number 6, turn it effortlessly and hear a merciful click. You got it right! Before you dare open in and face what lies beyond, you turn to Golett one last time… only to find the Ghost-Type has vanished, leaving not a single trace behind. Why? Was his place in this dream merely to show you the way? No, surely that can’t be all there is to the automaton’s role. Something tells you you’ll meet one another again, in the not-too-distant future. But in order for that to happen, you have to make it to the end of the path, and who knows how long that’ll take you?<br />
<br />
With no other option, you pass through the sixth door and into the room ahead. Or you would have, if there was a room to begin with! You find yourself outside the mansion, in what looks to be the back garden of the house. A rusty iron fence in the distance limits the propriety, and the grounds around you are effectively a small vegetable garden. No flowers seem to grow here, but small plots of land are neatly lined next to one another, and the soil seems fertile despite the ghastly surroundings – super-sized pumpkins grow everywhere, which is awkward considering nobody seems to be around to water them.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, something snaps you out of your musings. A thick vine wraps itself around your leg, tightening its grip progressively – the vegetation seems to be coming to life, and the source of it all is soon made manifest: from the tilled soil ahead one of the biggest pumpkins unearths itself, and starts floating in mid-air! On closer inspection, it seems to be a huge

The vines around you continue to wrap themselves around your body, apparently under the Pumpkaboo’s control, and if this keeps up, who knows what’s going to happen! This might be your dream after all, but can you really afford to do nothing?<br />
<br />
The path goes on and so does time. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>Icy Cave</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Gemini Spark</u>: <i>[03:00 am]</i> </b> Torn between the light and the shadows, you choose the latter, drawn in by the strange sounds emanating from the dark path – something about the sound resembling a melody has earned your interest, and telling yourself no harm should befall you in your own dreams, you press onwards. Carla, however, isn’t quite so sure…<br />
<br />
The path is narrow, decidedly colder than before (how is that even possible?) and each of your careful steps echoes audibly across the tunnel. Sneaking in proves nigh-impossible despite the blackness ahead… The melody continues, louder but still impossible to define. The sound is foreign to you, and the closer you get, the less certain you feel about it being a melody at all. Your hands blindly run across the tunnel’s wall; after all, you could see the icicles clearly on the tunnel you didn’t pick, but who’s to say no same structures exist on this path? However, the ice wall feels smooth to the touch. If such obstacles exist, they must be only further ahead.<br />
<br />
Just then, out of nowhere, something clings to your right leg. Something small for sure, but strong enough to hold your limb in place. What’s going on?! The melody ceases, and the second it does, a sharp piercing pain on your shin makes you wince… and soon afterwards, an intense cold unlike anything you’ve felt thus far starts running up your leg and spreads through your entire body, as if the blood on your veins is about to freeze!<br />
<br />
It’s too dark to see who, or what, your assailant is. But one thing’s for sure, you have to do something fast! Will you stay and try to fight the invisible foe off, make a run for it or convince yourself it’s all a dream and pay no mind to what’s happening?<br />
<br />
The path goes on and so does time. What will you do?</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Electric Blue Eye</u>: <i>[6:00 am]</i> </b> The setting is too perfect to ignore – there must be a pattern here, a reason for the hall’s display. Numbered doors, the painting on the ceiling… and then the striking of the clock, somber, melancholic even – six tolls this time, as you expected. That has to be it.<br />
<br />
You reach for the handle on door number 6, turn it effortlessly and hear a merciful click. You got it right! Before you dare open in and face what lies beyond, you turn to Golett one last time… only to find the Ghost-Type has vanished, leaving not a single trace behind. Why? Was his place in this dream merely to show you the way? No, surely that can’t be all there is to the automaton’s role. Something tells you you’ll meet one another again, in the not-too-distant future. But in order for that to happen, you have to make it to the end of the path, and who knows how long that’ll take you?<br />
<br />
With no other option, you pass through the sixth door and into the room ahead. Or you would have, if there was a room to begin with! You find yourself outside the mansion, in what looks to be the back garden of the house. A rusty iron fence in the distance limits the propriety, and the grounds around you are effectively a small vegetable garden.

<br />
<span style="color: lightblue">What was going on? First his friend Golett had disappeared and now an over grown pumpkin was trying to hurt his trainer?! Unforgivable!<br />
<br />
Chimchar, who had started walking further up ahead then it's trainer before soon noticing that his trainer was no longer walking along side with him. Thinking the worst, the chimp ran back in between the Pumpkin patches where he found his trainer ensnarled by some vines! Looking all around he soon caught sight of the corrupt, Pumpkaboo! <br />
<br />
Any fire type move would do well in a situation like this one and because of how emotionally unstable the chimp was from his friend disappearing all of a sudden, Aiden wasn't just going to burn down the vines either. Aiden was prepared for vengeance!<br />
<br />
Ethan could see it, as he struggled from the intense pull of the vine around his leg, desperately trying to break free, that the look his fire Pokemon had wasn't that of the carefree, inquisitive nature he grew to love. <i>This must be...his innate power, hidden away this whole time...he must of not been in an intense emotional state to unlock it before.</i> Ethan thought, as Aiden seem prepared to jump into action-<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop!!!&quot; the trainer roared, halting any sort of confrontation to take place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chimchar!!&quot; the chimp tried to argue back, considering the circumstances, why wouldn't his trainer allow him to attack?<br />
<br />
&quot;It's okay.&quot; Ethan assured, in a more calming manner, &quot;Remember Aiden, this is only a dream, things can't physically harm me, and I also know things don't just happen out of a whim...&quot; Ethan turned his attention towards the Great Pumpkin before him, &quot;There's a reason you stopped me, my Budew nags me all the time to watch where I'm stepping when I take a stroll in her garden. Is this your garden?&quot; The trainer said looking around, &quot;It's a very nice garden...won't you please let me go, and show me the reason why you decided to stop me? We could start ove-r...w-with an a-polog-y...&quot; Ethan said as the vines now became increasingly tighter, wrapping themselves around his whole body, as he held on to hope he wouldn't have to fight the ghost/grass type to be able to befriend it...<br />
<br />
Ethan pleaded, giving into his gullible-dreamer nature that everything had meaning! With the vines beginning to entangle his whole body, the trainer turned to look at his Chimchar, asking the Pokemon with his pleading eyes not to do something rash.<br />
<br />
But to Aiden, the Pumpkaboo had only 3 seconds to decide on what it's next course of action would be before ignoring Ethan's orders completely and deciding to cut the vines with one of his powerful <b>Scratch</b> attacks!</span></span><br />

It was another night in Fizzytopia. The stars twinkled in the otherwise dark sky. Many people and Pokemon were winding down for the day, resting for another full day tomorrow. One such place was in Cloud Garden, in a secret base, in fact. This base was nestled in a cozy little oak tree. There, another trainer was about to visit the Dream World.....<br />
<br />
The front door to the base quietly creaked open and a young trainer stepped inside. Looking about, he could see many of his Pokemon had gone off to sleep. A Mareep was dozing off near the table, an Abra and Emolga, both fallen asleep while cards covered the area. Trying not to disturb them, Jake tiptoed past them and into his bedroom. There, he removed a small cloth bag and placed it under the bed.<br />
&quot;What do you have there?&quot; A small voice asked from behind the teen. Jake turned around to see a small Snorunt.<br />
&quot;I-I didn't think you were still awake Willbert&quot; Jake said to the Snorut.<br />
&quot;I wanted to get some practice in with my acting.&quot; Willbert replied.<br />
&quot;I see.... you were asking about what's in the bag? It's Dream Dust, it's supposed to take you to this place called the Dream World&quot; The teen explained.<br />
&quot;Oh ok, well I've got to go! The more practice the better!&quot; The Snorunt said before scurrying away.<br />
Jake scratched his head in confusion, but decided to ignore the Snorunts strange behavior. With a sigh, he too left to make himself something to eat.<br />
----<br />
&quot;Are you sure it's Dream Dust?&quot; Elena asked.<br />
Willbert nodded to the Tynamo. &quot;That's what Jake said.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good, good, and where did you say he was keeping it?&quot; The Tynamo further inquired.<br />
&quot;Under his bed&quot; The Snorunt replied.<br />
&quot;I hope you know what this means.&quot; <br />
Willbert looked slightly reluctant to answer Elena.<br />
&quot;You want to take it and analyze it?&quot;<br />
&quot;No silly! I'm sending you to the Dream World!&quot; Elena responded boldly.<br />
&quot;Wait what? How?&quot; Willbert asked.<br />
&quot;It's easy, we just need to sprinkle some on his pillow while he's gone! Come on!&quot; The Tynamo said, before floating over towards Jake's room.<br />
Willbert quickly followed suit, not wanting to waste any time.<br />
<br />
Once in the room, Elena floated under the bed and next to the bag. <br />
&quot;Come on, hurry up before he comes back!&quot; The Tynamo urged.<br />
&quot;I'm coming, I'm coming&quot; The Snorunt replied as he walked over to the bag.<br />
Using his tiny hands, the Snorunt open up the bag. Both Pokemon peered inside, seeing a fine fluffy looking dust at the bottom.<br />
&quot;This is so exciting! I have so much to learn about this!&quot; The Tynamo exclaimed.<br />
&quot;So I just sprinkle it on his pillow? All of it?&quot; Willbert asked.<br />
&quot;No not all of it, you need some to!&quot; Elena replied slightly frustrated. <br />
&quot;Right...&quot; The Snorunt murmured before scrambling onto the bed.<br />
There, the snow hat Pokemon lightly dusted the soft pillow with the mysterious <a href="http://www.serebiiforums.com/showthread.php?640278-Pok%E9mart&amp;p=17811622#post17811622" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.serebiiforums.com%2Fshowthread.php%3F640278-Pok%25E9mart%26p%3D17811622%23post17811622&amp;hash=babe8d3d413aa225b816b1a4743f98ec" rel="nofollow noopener">Dream Dust</a>. <br />
He then sprinkled the rest on his sleeping spot.<br />
&quot;All done!&quot; Willbert exclaimed when the dust had all ran out.<br />
&quot;Ok, now you're going to need to write down some notes for me, let me get you some paper!&quot; Elena explained.<br />
However, before the Tynamo could do that, footsteps could be heard approaching.<br />
&quot;He's coming! Hide!&quot; Elena exclaimed before diving under the bed.<br />
The Snorunt frantically looked around, before jumping into his resting place.<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; Jake asked as he entered his room. The room looked like it had before, no trace of the pairs antics could be seen.<br />
&quot;Strange&quot; Jake murmured before climbing into bed.<br />
Preparing for another long night, the teen slowly rested his head on the pillow, where he quickly drifted off.<br />
After being sure the cost was clear, the Tynamo reemerged from the bed and floated toward Willbert.<br />
&quot;We did it! Now be sure to... huh?&quot; Elena didn't finish, as she heard the Snorunt start to snore.<br />
&quot;Noo! He fell asleep!&quot; The Tynamo yelled in frustration.<br />
--------------------------------<br />
Meanwhile Jake started to slowly wake. But the teen didn't find himself in his bedroom, but rather a black void of emptiness. <br />
&quot;Where am I?&quot; Jake asked no one in particular.<br />
As if to answer, an image of a Pokemon popped up. This Pokemon had orange cheeks and small black antenna shaped whiskers. Jake had never seen this Pokemon, yet he suddenly knew it's name. <b>Dedenne</b>.<br />
Just as sudden as the first image, a second one popped into the teens mind. This one was also foreign to him. The Pokemon was yellow and black, and had two long frills on it's head. <b>Helioptile</b>. Jake murmured, he somehow knew it's name as well. Finally a third image popped up. This Pokemon, Jake recognized. It was decidedly less shocking then the other two, sporting a pink body and a long tongue.<br />
<b>Lickitung </b>. The darkness then vanished, leaving Jake on a mysterious island.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, what the heck is this place?&quot; Jake wondered.<br />
&quot;Oh wow, this place is amazing&quot; A familiar voice came from beside him<br />
Jake turned to see Willbert, gazing at there surroundings.<br />
&quot;Willbert? What are you doing here? And where are we..wait, is this the Dream World?&quot; Jake asked.<br />
&quot;I believe so! Isn't it awesome?&quot; The Snorunt asked<br />
&quot;It is, but that means you took my Dream Dust, didn't you?&quot; The teen asked sternly.<br />
The Snorunt nodded. &quot;Yup, sorry about that, but Elena wanted me to help her study this place.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hmm, well I guess since we're here, we mine as well explore&quot; Jake said <br />
&quot;Where do you suggest we start?&quot; The snow hat Pokemon asked.<br />
&quot;I don't know, let's see....&quot; Jake trailed off as he started looking around.<br />
Finally, his eyes fixated on a bridge, however this wasn't an ordinary bridge, but rather a rainbow bridge.<br />
&quot;If I had to bet, I'd say we go there&quot; Jake said, pointing to the bridge.<br />
&quot;Umm, ok looks like fun!&quot; The Snorunt said before walking towards there destination.<br />
&quot;Dream World, here we come!&quot; The teen cheered before following Willbert.<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Electric Blue Eye</u>: <i>[7:00 am]</i> </b> Reasoning with the Pumpkaboo is your first option. After all, from your own experience, no matter how terrible a nightmare, you always wake up just fine the next morning. But when the vines start to tighten, you begin to wonder, in the back of your mind, if you’re going to wake up at all…<br />
<br />
Pumpkaboo listens to your plea intently. While it’s definitely not oblivious to what you’re saying, it seems your words have the opposite result than you intended – the more you struggle to speak, and the more you squirm to break free, the brighter Pumpkaboo’s inner light glows, as if it’s enjoying your suffering. It turns out you invaded her personal garden, and that is all the reason it needs to dispose of you – the Ghost-Type is a territorial one, proud of the vegetation it single-handedly tends to, and is obviously taking great pleasure in rooting out the unwanted guests. Goes to show that the Dream World can be a dangerous place, and unlike regular dreams, it seems you might end up seriously hurt – or worse – from this nightmare trip!<br />
<br />
However, in its desire to punish your transgression, it seems Pumpkaboo has neglected Aiden. The Chimchar counts to no more than two – the instant it becomes obvious Pumpkaboo is enjoying itself, he lunges forward and rakes apart the vines that bind you with a Scratch! The Ghost-Type squirms and lets out a long moan, as if physically hurt by the attack as well, and before you know it all the vegetation around you starts to vanish into smoke… and then the garden itself! In a matter of seconds, the landscape has changed dramatically – was it all an illusion, or did the dream’s original course change as a result of your partner’s interference? There is no telling the reason, but fact remains that you now find yourself in a small room, with walls lined in purple velvet, and two huge doors on the wall ahead – each door large enough for a Snorlax to pass through, you’d wager. You suddenly feel very small, but something tells you journey is nearing its end… the dream may be over soon. This could well be the last choice on the path ahead.<br />
<br />
Both doors in front of you are tinted purple. They are nearly identical; maybe choosing either one leads to the same result after all? No, there’s something… a slight difference. Not between the doors themselves, but what lies beyond. From beneath the door to your left, a gentle breeze blows at a constant rate, as if the area that lies ahead is for some reason windy. And from beneath the door to your right a subtle but notable heat wave escapes the chamber ahead, as if something burns behind the gate.<br />
<br />
Knowing that you might be close to awakening, choosing one of the two doors might be all that remains.<br />
<br />
The path goes on and so does time. What will you do?</span><br />
