<b><u>Rakurai</u>: <i>[12:00 am]</i></b> If you were still sceptic in any way about the properties of the mysterious substance known as Dream Dust, after Tia’s reluctant aid all shadows of doubt are now gone. Not only did you fail to return to your room after the Gible’s bite, you are confronted with strange visions of Pokemon you never met before and find yourself in a strange little floating island to boot… way too much to take in all at once.<br />
<br />
At first, finding a way to make progress proves tricky; the piece of grassy land you’re standing on is not only extremely tiny, it is also seemingly suspended countless feet up in the air, among white clouds that you really don’t feel like stepping on. Which means that, despite the absurdity of it all, the beautiful rainbow that begins on the isle’s edge and extends upwards into the unknown, much like a bridge, seems like the only way to go… Carefully, reluctantly, you place a single foot on the iridescent path and, much to your astonishment, you discover the bridge to be solid! With renewed confidence but no small amount of disbelief, you make your way along the rainbow road, penetrate the mass of clouds where the path leads…<br />
<br />
… and suddenly find yourself in a lush green forest, surrounded by massive trees with no trace of the previous path! This is all way too weird to understand… so you decide you might as well go with it.<br />
<br />
Tia hops along by your side while you brave the admittedly Pleasant Forest; curiously enough (as if everything else wasn’t already), there seems to be a path carved out along the grassy floor, a route that by all means should not be here unless your own mind is shaping a way for you to follow. And if it is… where to?<br />
<br />
You keep going, taking in the lovely floral scents and the merry chirping of birds (which, incidentally, you can’t spot) but find nothing noteworthy along the way for quite a while. Just as you start to get a bit more relaxed and accustomed to all the strangeness of the last moments, you feel something wrap around your left leg and proceed to hold it in place, impeding your progress! Looking back, you see a creature standing on the path a few away from you: a mess of vines concealing a pair of eyes, and one of those vines extending from its body all the way to your leg… it’s a

<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Gemini Spark</u>: <i>[09:00 am]</i> </b> Your journey across the inhospitable Icy Caves has come to an end, and out of all the creatures you ran into along the way, you know which one you want by your side once you awaken – a difficult decision, considering the quirky personality of the Pokemon in question.<br />
<br />
You suddenly feel as if you’re about to faint, everything spinning madly for a brief while then mercifully slowing down and stopping altogether. But you’re certain that the next time you feel like this, it won’t get better until you’ve left the Dream World behind entirely…<br />
<br />
Your eyes instinctively shift away from the severely injured Vanillite; for one, you know you had the chance to help it out and didn’t, and not only that, but you actually intend to take its assailant with you, further weighing on your conscience. But even if this weren’t a land fabricated by your own mind, you know Snorunt would have dined on the living cone had you not been there at all – this is, after all, the natural order of things. Your mind is made up and there’s no turning back now.<br />
<br />
You take a deep breath and point at Snorunt. It looks at your outstretched hand with visible curiosity; if it even heard what you said, you can’t be sure, but your mere approach intrigue it enough that it doesn’t flinch or run away… and why would it? It agreed to follow you, a complete stranger through the darkness of the Icy Caves until it ran into its next meal. Snorunt keep looking at your arm, motionless, weighing its options… and suddenly lunges at you and sinks its teeth into your hand! Intense cold envelops your entire limb, then a sharp pain…<br />
<br />
Despite the sudden assault, the very second you utter your choice out loud, you once again feel dizzy, even more than before and this time it’s not improving. Overwhelmed by the mixture of feelings, you feel your eyes beginning to close on their own despite the pain coursing through your arm…<br />
<br />
When you come to, you find yourself looking up at your ceiling – the Dream World is now long behind you. Despite how unreal it all felt, you know in your heart you were actually there – and just then, your heart skips a bit when you remember Carla! But looking to the side, you find your Espeon just beginning to wake up herself… You then recall the final instances of your dream, the ravenous Pokemon biting away at your hand, which somehow no longer hurts. Looking down at the supposedly-bitten pal, you find no teeth marks whatsoever; what you <i>do</i> find is a strange sort of pink Pokeball… upon closer inspection, you realize it’s a <b>Dream Ball</b>, and that someone resides within – the <b>Lv 1 Female

<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Ex-Admiral Insane</u>: <i>[12:00 am]</i></b> A powerful substance, this Dream Dust… so many visions sprawl before your eyes before everything settles down into a calm, quiet landscape: a solitary island up in the clouds. After a while of looking around for a path to follow, the cat band’s music still stuck in your head, you finally come to terms with the unlikely truth: that rainbow road leading towards the unknown does seem to be the only way to progress. Taking a deep breath, and looking over at Floss for a much-needed boost of confidence, you finally decide to risk it… and luckily find the iridescent bridge to be solid and traversable!<br />
<br />
It leads high up into the clouds, a white veil so think nothing else can be made out… until your eyesight suddenly clears and you find yourself inexplicably in the middle of a huge, gorgeous garden! Topiaries taller than any human rise to your left and right, creating a corridor of green walls that you can follow, but have no idea where it leads…<br />
<br />
Every now and then, beautiful flowers sprout from amidst the carefully trimmed hedges. Some are white roses, other red carnations, each with unique and delightfully soothing scents… until you reach what seems like a patch of yellow flowers you can’t quite identify. They emit no scent whatsoever…. Wait, these aren’t flowers. Not yellow leaves sticking out from the otherwise green hedge either; upon closer inspection, it seems like a random patch of yellow <i>something</i> that really doesn’t belong…<br />
<br />
<i>Swiiirl, Swiiirlix!!</i><br />
<br />
Floss’s sudden cry startles you; looking over at your partner, you find it trying to dodge something waving around in the air, resembling a Vine Whip but… is that a tongue?! Following the extending rope-like appendage to its origin, you realize it too is coming from inside the topiary… Until suddenly it all makes sense! The yellow stripe begins to move, and a creature emerges from the hedge wiggling its extendable tongue trying to catch Floss, until it finally succeeds in wrapping it in its grasp! It’s a hungry

<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>EpicSquirtle</u>: <i>[12:00 am]</i></b> Complete darkness is replaced by the beautiful sight of an island in the clouds. Everything seems much too fantastical to be believable, but there’s no denying that you’re actually here… and you have a witness! Willbert, your Snorunt, seems to have successfully entered the Dream World alongside you, which means you’re not alone any longer! Enthusiastic about braving your own dreams, you don’t even think twice about <i>jumping on a rainbow</i> – not once contemplating the possibility that it’s just a regular rainbow and that it could result in you plummeting to your death.<br />
<br />
But as it turns out, this <i>is</i> your dream, and the rainbow path is indeed solid enough for you to cross! The bridge goes up into the clouds, and once you enter the white mist, the Island of Dreams vanishes behind you… giving place to an entirely new location! Is this even possible? Well, this is a dream after all, so maybe you shouldn’t read too much into it.<br />
<br />
But this place is beautiful! Everywhere you look, tall walls made entirely of carefully-trimmed bushes, sculpted into shapes reminiscent of Pokemon, are placed next to one another on each side of you, effectively creating a path along what you assume is actually a gigantic garden! This should be fun to explore! A maze within a park… where can this possibly lead?<br />
<br />
Willbert seems fascinated as well, its attention being drawn to a beautiful patch of flowers sprouting from within one of the bushes – it messes up its symmetry somewhat, but the gardeners probably let flowery patch stay to lend the grassy maze some color. You walk over to Willbert and notice one of the flowers moving curiously… until a <i>head</i> springs up from behind the foliage and smiles at you! Wait, this is no ordinary flower… it’s actually a

Your eyes instinctively shift away from the severely injured Vanillite; for one, you know you had the chance to help it out and didn’t, and not only that, but you actually intend to take its assailant with you, further weighing on your conscience. But even if this weren’t a land fabricated by your own mind, you know Snorunt would have dined on the living cone had you not been there at all – this is, after all, the natural order of things. Your mind is made up and there’s no turning back now.<br />
<br />
You take a deep breath and point at Snorunt. It looks at your outstretched hand with visible curiosity; if it even heard what you said, you can’t be sure, but your mere approach intrigue it enough that it doesn’t flinch or run away… and why would it? It agreed to follow you, a complete stranger through the darkness of the Icy Caves until it ran into its next meal. Snorunt keep looking at your arm, motionless, weighing its options… and suddenly lunges at you and sinks its teeth into your hand! Intense cold envelops your entire limb, then a sharp pain…<br />
<br />
Despite the sudden assault, the very second you utter your choice out loud, you once again feel dizzy, even more than before and this time it’s not improving. Overwhelmed by the mixture of feelings, you feel your eyes beginning to close on their own despite the pain coursing through your arm…<br />
<br />
When you come to, you find yourself looking up at your ceiling – the Dream World is now long behind you. Despite how unreal it all felt, you know in your heart you were actually there – and just then, your heart skips a bit when you remember Carla! But looking to the side, you find your Espeon just beginning to wake up herself… You then recall the final instances of your dream, the ravenous Pokemon biting away at your hand, which somehow no longer hurts. Looking down at the supposedly-bitten palm, you find no teeth marks whatsoever; what you <i>do</i> find is a strange sort of pink Pokeball… upon closer inspection, you realize it’s a <b>Dream Ball</b>, and that someone resides within – the <b>Lv 1 Female

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: rgb(153, 204, 255)">As Hyrem approached the Pokemon of his choice, a sudden dizziness overcame him for a moment, and he lightly clutched his forehead. He knew his time here was coming to an end very soon, and he had to make his choice known. One last glance toward the Vanillite, and there was a brief regret before justifying it being a part of nature. Rather than take a Pokemon that would resent the help it never got, he instead opted for the Pokemon that attacked it and looked like it would attack the others if given the chance, and he offered the Snorunt a chance to join his team while presenting it his hand. Meanwhile, Carla longingly gazed at the fruit that drew her towards it, ready to offer itself to her. She glanced back towards her trainer, seeking his approval to partake of the Dream Berry, and was shocked to find him in front of Snorunt. Of all the choices he could have made! Back at the tree, Snorunt stared straight at the hand offered to it and considered the opportunity the human gave to join him, as well as the promise of some good food...<br />
<br />
And she seized the hand of this free meal right in her jaws.<br />
<br />
It all happened in an instant. Hyrem did not expect Snorunt's attack and felt the freezing cold as well as the pain of the bite shoot up his arm, but before he could attempt to pry the Ice-type off the dizziness took over once again, though much stronger and longer lasting. Was this what hypothermia was like? This had to be him going numb from the Snorunt's <b>Icy Fangs</b>, right? If so, there wasn't much he could do about it, he was already succumbing to the effects, and he blacked out with the Snorunt's jaws still clamped to his hand. As soon as Carla saw the attack, she tried to rush towards the scene (she <i>knew</i> that Snorunt was bad news!), but she began to feel the same dizziness as her trainer. She tried to keep her eyes and feet focused towards Hyrem, but it was too much, and she slumped to the floor as well, her last sight being of the Snorunt still attached to Hyrem's hand.<br />
<br />
<i>I should not have looked away. I should have resisted the food on the stump. I took my eyes off of Master, and he will die for my mistake!</i><br />
<br />
<i>Why did I not resist that berry...why...</i><br />
<br />
<i>Why...</i><br />
<br />
Hyrem bolted awake, finding himself in the bedroom of his secret base. <i>So it <u>was</u> all a dream,</i> he thought. <i>Then Carla is... </i>He looks to the floor and finds his Espeon wide awake, looking around until her deep purple eyes found what they were looking for. &quot;<i>Speonnnn...</i>&quot; she cried, then immediately leaped onto the bed, <b>Tackling</b> her trainer back down to his pillow before embracing his head with her paws and feverishly nuzzling and licking all around it, especially his face. &quot;Mmmmorning, Carla...&quot; he responded, his voice muffled by her unusual affection; this wasn't at all how she normally greeted him. Then it came to him: she must have seen the Snorunt attack him before the dream ended for both of them. That must have been quite a nightmare for her! &quot;Aw, baby, did you have a bad dream? It's okay, I'm here, I'm here...&quot; He tried to console her as best he could by hugging her back and kissing her on the forehead, just above the gem. After that, he simply let her cover his face with as much bathing and scent marking as she wanted, which very likely lasted about as long as it felt like. <br />
<br />
He tried moving his hand, and it felt like it had never been bitten, so he raised it up, looking at it as best he could between nuzzles and licks. No bite marks on it at all, and it was at that point that he realized his hand was holding something...a Pokeball? No, not just any Pokeball, but a <b>Dream Ball</b>! And inside it- oh. He signaled to Carla that he wanted to sit back up, which she let him do, then he took a good look at the Dream Ball in his hand. Did it really have the same Pokemon he met from the Dream World? There was only one way to find out...<br />
<br />
As he opened it, however, the beam of light strangely shot to the ceiling, right above his face, and he looked up to see the ravenous Snorunt materialize, then fall straight for him, mouth wide open, prepared to make her dream a reality, but a dark sphere of concentrated energy quickly impacted and sent the Ice-type straight into the wall, causing her to slowly pick herself up from the ground. Hyrem looked down to see a few residual, eerie drips of Ghost energy used to create the <b>Shadow Ball</b> trickle from Carla's mouth, and the fur on her back and her tail stood erect as she tensed up. &quot;<i>You will refrain from that abhorrent behavior from now on,</i>&quot; she hissed angrily at the new teammate, baring her fangs to prove a point. &quot;<i>This human is my master and is now your master, not your prey, and until you internalize that fact I will make it my priority to remind you of it should you dare to walk out of line. I know you will try--I don't need my powers to see that--and every time you do I will be there. Now go, and explore: you have some new friends you had best be acquainted with.</i>&quot; <br />
<br />
The Snorunt simply stared at Carla and Hyrem before seemingly waddling out of the bedroom. &quot;<i>I said 'explore', not 'hide behind the doorway and wait for your chance to attack again',</i>&quot; Carla hissed again, to which she could hear, &quot;<i>Too smart, too smart!</i>&quot; Only when she could sense the Snorunt a safe distance away was she at ease and cleaning herself. Hyrem got up out of bed and stretched before saying, &quot;Let me guess, you're going to be my personal bodyguard for the rest of the month, aren't you?&quot; &quot;<i>Espeon~</i>&quot; she nodded, stretching herself and letting out an adorable yawn before jumping off the bed and into Hyrem's arms, which he had to quickly move to catch. &quot;Haha, okay then, thanks for the help! Well, let's get some breakfast and hope our new friend hasn't got herself into <i>too</i> much trouble already!&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>And welcome home...Tsurara.</i><br />
</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Ex-Admiral Insane</u>: <i>[12:00 am]</i></b> A powerful substance, this Dream Dust… so many visions sprawl before your eyes before everything settles down into a calm, quiet landscape: a solitary island up in the clouds. After a while of looking around for a path to follow, the cat band’s music still stuck in your head, you finally come to terms with the unlikely truth: that rainbow road leading towards the unknown does seem to be the only way to progress. Taking a deep breath, and looking over at Floss for a much-needed boost of confidence, you finally decide to risk it… and luckily find the iridescent bridge to be solid and traversable!<br />
<br />
It leads high up into the clouds, a white veil so think nothing else can be made out… until your eyesight suddenly clears and you find yourself inexplicably in the middle of a huge, gorgeous garden! Topiaries taller than any human rise to your left and right, creating a corridor of green walls that you can follow, but have no idea where it leads…<br />
<br />
Every now and then, beautiful flowers sprout from amidst the carefully trimmed hedges. Some are white roses, other red carnations, each with unique and delightfully soothing scents… until you reach what seems like a patch of yellow flowers you can’t quite identify. They emit no scent whatsoever…. Wait, these aren’t flowers. Not yellow leaves sticking out from the otherwise green hedge either; upon closer inspection, it seems like a random patch of yellow <i>something</i> that really doesn’t belong…<br />
<br />
<i>Swiiirl, Swiiirlix!!</i><br />
<br />
Floss’s sudden cry startles you; looking over at your partner, you find it trying to dodge something waving around in the air, resembling a Vine Whip but… is that a tongue?! Following the extending rope-like appendage to its origin, you realize it too is coming from inside the topiary… Until suddenly it all makes sense! The yellow stripe begins to move, and a creature emerges from the hedge wiggling its extendable tongue trying to catch Floss, until it finally succeeds in wrapping it in its grasp! It’s a hungry

<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: lightblue">The white veil surrounded them as they went up, higher and further across the surprisingly solid rainbow path. The stretch of colours sprawled out in front of them high up into the clouds where it disappeared. Nothing could be seen for quite some time but a strange sense of relaxation settled into the trainer and his Pokémon’s mind that it was safe. The white clouds part slowly until finally a new scene was lain out in front of them, one of a tranquil garden. Lucas took his first step further onto the path, his partner Pokémon Floss closely beside him.<br />
<br />
“Where are we? This can’t be Fizzytopia, can it?”<br />
<br />
“Swiirl,” the Swirlix glanced left and right at vivid greenery.<br />
<br />
The gorgeous bushes were finely trimmed and full of colour they noticed as they went on. Patches of flowers, both known and exotic, sprouted across the path’s side, imparting the two with sweet soothing scent as they passed them. One patch of red flowers caught Floss’s nose in particular as it had a surprisingly strong sweet smell.<br />
<br />
Floss took no time to waddle over to them, licking her lips as she entertained the thought of eating the bushes and digesting their sweet nectar. Even for a Swirlix Floss had a rapacious appetite to devour anything that smelled so sweet, but Lucas felt no need to stop her right away. A curious bush of yellow was bundled right next to them and they were the only ones for which no discernible scent could be found. Upon a closer look, Lucas noticed the lack of green stems and leaves near the flowers. He took a step back and thought he saw them move for a brief moment.<br />
<br />
“Swiiirl, Swiiirlix!!”<br />
<br />
“Huh?” Lucas looked over his shoulder at his Pokémon and found Floss making clumsy movement left and right. Lucas was about to snigger when he saw the vine-like appendage that was trying to snatch her up. Was the bush attacking? Lucas quickly followed the length of the vine with his eyes until they rested beside him by the yellow flowers. Lucas startles back when the yellow flowers move and reveal a green lizard of some kind, seemingly pooping out of nowhere. His tongue concentrated on grabbing a hold of the Swirlix and as luck would have it, she tripped and her sticky cotton coat got her caught on the ground. The green lizard scooped Swirlix up from the floor and hinted at his desire to eat the cotton candy Pokémon.<br />
<br />
“Hahaha!” Lucas burst out laughing and fell over. There was a touch of irony in seeing his voracious hungry Pokémon, who was always testing her capability to eat other Pokémon drenched in chocolate, being in the opposite role for once.<br />
<br />
“Swiiiirrlliiix!” Floss clearly didn’t see the humour in this as her trainer did.<br />
<br />
“All right, all right, calm down,” Lucas knew perfectly well how to get a Pokémon away from eating another. His experience with Floss had prepared him for this. All he had to do was provide him with an alternative like a berry.<br />
<br />
A thought occurred to Lucas. Did he even have his items with him? His backpack and clothes were brought along but it made little sense to him to have real berries be brought along as well. Not that it mattered, this was a dream after all. Right?<br />
<br />
“Swirlswiiirliix!” Floss was being brought closer to the green Pokémon’s mouth.<br />
<br />
“Oh right,” Lucas snapped himself out of his thought. “Come on Floss, get yourself out of here. He’s hungry so give him a <b>Chocolate Magic</b>.” If that didn’t work, Lucas would simply grab the thing by his tongue and ask it to stop. Not that it probably could do much else if its tongue was held.</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><b><u>Ex-Admiral Insane</u>: <i>[01:00 am]</i></b> In a decidedly ironic twist of fate, Floss now finds itself the <i>target</i> of uncontrollable gluttony rather than the culprit. The Kecleon maintains its tight grip on the Swirlix, its tongue no doubt feeling the tingling sweet sensation one would get from sampling cotton candy, which certainly isn’t doing your Fairy-Type partner any favors; if anything, it’s making Kecleon all the more eager to get a bigger sample!<br />
<br />
Your first thought goes to providing Kecleon an alternative it might enjoy more than your Swirlix, perhaps a Berry, hard as it’ll be to find one with a more poignant taste than the very incarnation of a sugary sweet… and then it dawns on you that items might not be something that gets carried over to this strange dream-reality. Indeed, while you find yourself in possession of both your clothes and your Bag, reaching out to any of its contents (which you notice seem to be all there) simply results in your hand passing <i>through</i> the objects as if they were made of air! Strange place indeed, this Dream World…<br />
<br />
Then it dawns on you. If Kecleon has a sweet tooth, maybe Floss isn’t the only thing that would keep it entertained – everyone likes chocolate, after all, at least anyone worth being part of a dream of yours! The Swirlix controls his panic just long enough to do as told, and manages to spit out a blob of gooey chocolate! The strange substance expands on contact with Kecleon and grows to envelop him like glue – a very tasty brand of glue – that the chameleon seems to be thoroughly enjoying at first, enough to release Floss and retract his tongue…<br />
<br />
… but soon the wild Normal-Type begins flailing about frantically, realizing it’s trapped, perhaps revealing some latent claustrophobia as it panics circles around you, stumbling on occasion due to the magic chocolate wrapping itself around the Kecleon’s stubby legs!<br />
<br />
One crisis has been averted, Floss is safe for now, but Kecleon looks visibly distressed. Overtime he might just eat the chocolate away and break free on its own, though it might take a while for the visibly scared little Pokemon. Will you stick (hah!) around to help or move long in search of new sights?<br />
<br />
The path goes on and so does time. What will you do?</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: #99ccff"><br />
Butternut, the devious pumkasaur, waddled into a small clearing within the woods that the group had made camp in, following a peculiar sort of smell that indicated that Berue was attempting to make some sort of potion. <i>&quot;Hi, hi, Berue! What sort of magic potion are ya cookin' up dis time?&quot; </i>he asked, causing the tangela to jump in surprise.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Ah, um, nothing big in particular,&quot;</i> she muttered in response, quickly regaining her composure. <i>&quot;Just a tiny brew to determine if this-&quot;</i> she indicated to the bag beside her cauldron <i>&quot;-is the real deal. So far, it seems like we've got a positive.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Butternut sniffed at the bag before being swatted back by a couple vines. &quot;What is dat?&quot; he asked, clearly wondering if it could be used in some sort of practical joke.<br />
</span></span><br />
<i><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: #99ccff">&quot;That, my fellow Grass type, is something known as <a href="http://forums.upnetwork.net/showthread.php?p=773657#post773657" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.upnetwork.net%2Fshowthread.php%3Fp%3D773657%23post773657&amp;hash=19554ea22805e3d387f30b07b8908c47" rel="nofollow noopener">Dream Dust</a>. With this, a trainer and one of their pokemon will be able to enter a different realm within their dreams- the appropriately named Dream World.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, so what would one do in dis 'Dream World'?&quot; the odd bulbasaur inquired. &quot;Frolic in the woods without a care in the world?&quot;<br />
</span></span></i><br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: #99ccff"><i>&quot;I suppose that's one possibility, but that's not it's main use,&quot; </i>Berue cheerily explained. <i>&quot;It is said that the pokemon that accompanies the trainer could come back with a different and rare ability, or even more peculiarly, a whole new pokemon could wake up with them wielding said ability for their own kind!&quot; </i>She was clearly excited at this point. &quot;<i>Just think of it, Butternut, a pokemon born of dreams- a friend who never should've been! How amazing would that be?!&quot;</i><br />
<br />
<i>&quot;That'd be pretty neat, indeed!&quot; </i>he exclaimed, an idea forming in his mind. <i>&quot;I'd like to have a new buddy. Excuse me!&quot; </i>He quickly grabbed up the bag of pink dust and rushed off, batting away Berue's vines with his own. <i>&quot;Let's give this a test run!&quot;</i><br />
<br />
~ ~ ~ <br />
<br />
Chroma, their trainer, opened her eyes to find herself in some sort of swirling void. &quot;Where... am I?&quot; she asked to nobody in particular. <br />
<br />
The closest thing she got to an answer was the formation of a blurry image a yellow and brown pokemon, with it's eyes closed in sleep and it's tail twitching as if it were really awake. <b><i>Abra. </i></b><br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I see!&quot; the human exclaimed, finally figuring out what was happening. &quot;Guess Berue decided I didn't get ripped off and went sprinkled some of the Dream Dust on my pillow! Nice going, little one!&quot;<br />
<br />
The image soon dissipated and was replaced with a different one, this time of a gray cloth-like pokemon with piercing blue and yellow eyes and a gleeful smirk on it's face. <i><b>Shuppet.</b></i> The picture soon gave way, just as fast as it came, and the third and final image came into view. This one was of a yellow and brown pokemon like the first one was, except the pokemon was larger all around and had a trunk that twitched incessantly as if it were looking for something. <b><i>Drowzee.</i></b><br />
<br />
As soon as the last image faded to view, the whirling maelstrom itself gave way into a pleasant clearing of sorts with a large rainbow leading into the bright blue sky beyond. &quot;So this is the Dream World...&quot; Chroma whispered in awe. <br />
<br />
<i>&quot;It would certainly seem that way,&quot; </i>came a sarcastic response, barely hiding the mawile's own wonder as she appeared beside the human. <i>&quot;Can't say I expected to have this happen tonight, that's for sure!&quot;</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, hello there, Louise! Nice to see you here tonight! I have admit that I expected Berue to volunteer herself first, though.&quot; Chroma shook her head as the mawile gave an indignant huff. &quot;Oh well, no use dwelling on that now. Let's just get going and see what this world has to offer us!&quot;</span></span><br />

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: lightblue">Rowan is walking in circles in his bedroom, holding a <a href="http://www.serebiiforums.com/showthread.php?640278-Pok%E9mart&amp;p=18269277#post18269277" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.serebiiforums.com%2Fshowthread.php%3F640278-Pok%25E9mart%26p%3D18269277%23post18269277&amp;hash=c492a813fc3e897ce8164a834c5278f4" rel="nofollow noopener">small sachet of a mysterious powder</a>. He’s contemplating whether his idea is a good one and if he should go through with it or not. He stops and holds the sachet against the light that shines down on him from the ceiling light. A sigh follows. “Is this really the way to go? Isn’t it too invasive? I don’t know what will happen, not with me, not with her. I don’t even know if the information I received about this Dream Dust is correct. What if it will result in a complete change of character for Rose? She’s such a sweet girl, I would never forgive myself if I were to traumatize her through this experience simply to settle my own curiosity. And that is <i>if</i> I even get the answers I’d like to get.” Another sigh. “I really don’t know if I should go through with this. Maybe I should just put it away and never look back.” Again Rowan sighs deeply and walks up to his desk and places the sachet on it, while keeping it in his hand at the same time. He looks at his hand and the sachet of Dust and stares at it for almost five minutes, the same thoughts racing through his mind.<br />
<br />
A tab against his leg. Rowan’s thoughts return to the room he’s in and looks besides him to see who poked him. He sees his Kirlia standing there, Rose is holding a book in one hand while she runs her eyes with other. Rowan smiles and puts the sachet in his pocket, “I know Rose, it’s getting late here. Let’s get you to bed and I’ll read you a story.” Together they walk to the bed and Rose makes herself comfortable in it while Rowan takes hold of the book his Kirlia picked to be read from. It’s a story about a Ponyta who dreams of winning the races and how, against all odds, the Ponyta makes her dream come true. And when Rowan closes the book, Rose is already fast asleep.<br />
<br />
Rowan sighs and smiles. He then takes the sachet of Dream Dust out of his pocket, opens it and sprinkles the dust on Rose her pillow before walking over to his side of the bed and sprinkle in on his own pillow too. He doesn’t know what this night will bring, or what will happen in the Dream World, but Rowan has made up his mind and whatever he learns, he will make sure Rose will benefit from it in the end. And maybe, just maybe, he will find out what happened in the woods where he found Rose as merely a baby Ralts all those years ago. Rowan rests his head on his pillow, makes himself comfortable in his bed and closes his eyes curious about what is to come.<br />
<br />
“Master, master, where are we?” Rowan hears a voice, but is too sleepy to really hear it, or even realize it’s in his head, and says “Five more minutes mom, I’m tired.” But the voice is not having it. “Master, wake up, please!” The voice sounds louder than before and slightly scared too. Rowan opens his eyes and immediately sees why. He is no longer in his room, but instead finds himself on a platform in the sky. The surroundings are beautiful with all the plants and flowers, and many Pokémon walk, fly and hang around such as <b>Rattata</b>, <b>Pidove</b> and <b>Spinarak</b>. Furthermore, at the edge of the platform there’s a wide Rainbow Road that leads off into the distance. Rowan can’t exactly see where it leads, but a quick look tells him the rainbow is the only way off the platform.<br />
<br />
“Master?” The voice again, it sounds concerned this time. “Where are we? I’m scared, I want to home.” Rowan now realizes this voice is coming from inside his own head. “Who are you? I can hear you in my head, but I see no one around me who can talk.”<br />
<br />
“It’s me, Rose.”<br />
<br />
Immediately Rowan turns towards the Kirlia that stands next to him and get up from the ground where he was still laying. His eyes are wide open, as is his mouth, from surprise. “Where did you learn how to do this? <i>When</i> did you learn how to do this?” he asks amazed, “It’s wonderful you can talk with me like this, I’m in awe.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know,” Rose replies, “I woke up here and I just, could. I don’t know why.” Rowan heard every word Rose said in his head, yet the Kirlia’s mouth stayed close the whole time. Then, realizing where they are, Rowan pulls out his Pokédex and scrolls through the information in it. He’s looking for Kirlia’s entry. “Here it is,” he has found the page and pushes the button on the devise to have it read the information.<br />
<br />
<blockquote class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">
<div class="bbCodeBlock-title">
Pokédex said:

<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">

</div>
</blockquote>“That explains everything. We are in the Dream World and because of that your Hidden Ability has unlocked itself. Though I’m afraid it’s only here in this world that you can use it. This world really is something different, far different from what I had imagined too when I heard it was possible to enter dreams. But I think we should get going Rose, I think we’ll have a long way to go before we’re back in our own world, and there is so much I want to ask you.” Rose nods and holds her hand up, gesturing her trainer to hold it which he happily does before they make their way up the Rainbow Road, looking for answers and the way back out.</span></span><br />

</span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: #99ccff">Despite his last adventure in the Dream World, Hyrem was willing to give it another chance. After all, there was plenty more to the Dream World than the Icy Caves he visited, that much he knew for sure, and plenty of Pokemon other than Ice-types with special powers that weren't normally in their species. With that in mind, he pocketed his newly purchased <a href="http://www.serebiiforums.com/showthread.php?640278-Pok%E9mart&amp;p=18313415#post18313415" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.serebiiforums.com%2Fshowthread.php%3F640278-Pok%25E9mart%26p%3D18313415%23post18313415&amp;hash=c9b726a8f536dac7715b5f79be6bc33c" rel="nofollow noopener">Dream Dust</a>, ready to give a great surprise to one of his Pokemon, before opening the door to his base. After escaping the usual affection his Pokemon would smother him with, he looked around trying to figure out who would be the best Pokemon to take with him on his second adventure to the Dream World.<br />
<br />
That was when he headed into the TV room and noticed his Druddigon, Sarkhan, all alone and curled up, his huge, scaly arms covering his face as if in shame. &quot;Sarkhan? You okay, bud?&quot; he asked, about to approach. &quot;<i>Drudd!</i>&quot; he grunted, clawing towards the trainer before Glaring at him, a clear signal that he wanted to be left alone. Hyrem backed off a little but kept watching as this was unusual behavior for his powerhouse partner. He then started clawing his own arms, then his belly, then clamped down on his arm with his jaws and seemed to be tugging at his skin. Now Hyrem was <i>really</i> worried, this wasn't normal Druddigon behavior at all! &quot;Sarkhan, something's wrong, you've gotta stop!&quot; he called out to him, but as he took a step back forward those same jagged pair of jaws snapped shut in front of his face without warning, causing him to reel back, and it was then that he noticed claw and bite marks all over the cave dragon's body--his tail, his legs, his arms, his chest and belly were all covered with self-inflicted wounds, and it pained Hyrem to see Sarkhan like this. Sarkhan himself drew back, fully ashamed of what had happened; he knew better, he had more control over himself than this! Desperate to keep himself from hurting anyone else he quickly turned towards the burrow he would normally use for sleeping and crawled inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarkhan, wait!&quot; Hyrem called out again, but there was no response. <i>Perhaps it is best,</i> he heard a voice in his head that was unmistakably Sera's, <i>if you leave him be for now.</i> He turned toward the doorway to see his trusted Gardevoir there with a forlorn expression on her face. <i>He told me what had happened,</i> she spoke telepathically before explaining the story to him. Sarkhan's love interest, Pomona, had come here on her own, like Keith's Pokemon sometimes do, and the two of them found a nice, quiet place all to themselves, like they do. It started out like normal, but eventually Pomona had laid down on his belly as she leaned in for a kiss, and--while they didn't...do the thing (though Sarkhan was tempted to)--their feelings for each other grew so intense that Sarkhan didn't think about suppressing his ability, his Rough Skin, and the Ivysaur in his embrace hurt all over from it. It wasn't anything a quick trip to the Pokemon Center wouldn't fix, but just the thought that he had inadvertently hurt the Pokemon closest to him was all that was needed to break his heart, and he ran inside and balled himself up in the very room Hyrem was in now, turning away any request from Pomona to see him until she reluctantly left.<br />
<br />
<i>But there is more,</i> Sera continued. <i>That scratching you saw him do was not just out of shame of his ability; it seems he is being hurt physically, or at least irritated, by its properties.</i></span></span><br />
<span style="color: #99ccff"><span style="font-size: 12px">Hyrem gasped. <i>He's...being hurt...by his own Rough Skin!?</i> he thought-spoke back to Sera, to which she simply nodded. <i>Then he needs help, he needs to go to the Pokemon Center! But...that would only help him for a little while, it wouldn't be a permanent solution...</i> As he thought, his hand drifted back to the special bag in his pocket, and he immediately knew what he needed to do. <i>Sera...I'm going down there.</i><br />
<i>Where Sarkhan is!?</i> she thought-spoke with alarm. <i>But what if he attacks you? I would not be able to-</i><br />
<i>He needs help,</i> he interrupted. <i>And I think this is the only way I can. You know what I'm talking about, right?</i><br />
<i>...Yes, I do,</i> she admitted. <i>And it may work, but...what if you do not even get the chance to use it?</i><br />
<i>That's the risk, isn't it? We've had to take risks to even survive, to get to where we are now! What's one more?</i><br />
Sera ultimately sighed in surrender as she knew there was no changing her trainer's mind at this point. <i>Please...be careful,</i> she cautioned, as usual, to which he simply nodded before crawling inside the tunnel.<br />
<br />
The tunnel was one Sarkhan dug himself, and if a Druddigon could crawl through it a human certainly could as well, though Hyrem had to stay on his hands and knees the entire way. Eventually he heard a familiar rumbling right as the tunnel began to open out somewhat into a small cave that barely fit the large dragon nestled up ahead--most reptiles do like small spaces, after all--and Hyrem slowed down his movements to avoid spooking his friend into lashing out at a target that had minimal wiggle room and practically no chance of escaping. &quot;Listen, Sarkhan,&quot; he whispered. &quot;I can help you, I have an idea.&quot; He continued to slowly approach him despite Sarkhan's growling intensifying with every advance he made. &quot;I have something that can help you get rid of your Rough Skin!&quot; He then squeezed his arm back into the tunnel and into his pocket to pull out the pouch of Dream Dust. &quot;We just use this, and we'll be in the Dream World so we can change your ability! I just need to get close so we can use this, so you have to trust me!&quot; One more advance, however, and Sarkhan opened his large, yellow eyes in a deadly Glare, this time the effects taking hold on Hyrem's body, limiting his movements out of fear of the cornered Druddigon.<br />
<br />
The two soon looked at each other in the eyes, with Hyrem desperately hoping that Sarkhan wouldn't take advantage of his extreme vulnerability and Sarkhan, in reality, thinking hard on what was being offered to him. After what seemed like forever spent in that tense moment, Sarkhan's claws grasped Hyrem's arm and dragged his trainer further towards him, and in that moment Hyrem thought he was a goner. However, he could somewhat feel the bag of special powder leave his hands before he saw it dumped out and scattered, seemingly filling the whole of the tiny cavern they were in. As he started to feel the effects of the powder take over his body, he could also feel his body held tightly by Sarkhan; in fact, his entire body had been pulled in and was in the Druddigon's clutches, making the sleeping arrangements particularly cramped. The last thing he saw before he shut his eyes was a skull scattered with various bones, and he recalled Sarkhan sometimes took a kill of his into this very tunnel, if it was small enough, to finish off his meal in peace. Hyrem then hoped Sarkhan had eaten very recently or at least wasn't going to get hungry until long after the next morning...<br />
<br />
***************<br />
<br />
So far, so good. Hyrem was standing right next to Sarkhan, and it was as if nothing had happened to either one of them. Then they saw three mysterious figures, two large and one small, just like what happened last time when he and Carla made their first foray into the Dream World. This time, however, the first figure to be revealed, the smallest of the three...it appeared to be birdlike in its features but more resembled a small humanoid with what looked like a brightly colored mask and costume

, a sight that would be very fitting for a superhero or a wrestler. The other two figures, both larger than the first, soon started sparring with each other before they both revealed themselves: Hyrem and Sarkhan actually recognized one of the figures as a

Sawk, recalling when one of this very Fighting-type named Just Lee was on the team, while the other figure looked very similar to a Sawk but was instead red in color and had a thicker body and musculature

seemingly suited to grabbing onto an opponent and tossing them wherever it wanted as opposed to the Sawk whose build was about punches and kicks. The first figure soon entered the fray and surprisingly made short work of both of the other combatants, with the Sawk unable to land a single blow on the nimbler fighter and its own blows landing quite cleanly on the Sawk, before it leaped over the other Pokemon, landed behind it, grabbed it by the waist, and somehow lifted a Pokemon twice its size over its own body and slammed it down onto its back in a good ol' suplex. Hyrem and Sarkhan both looked on, amazed at this smaller Pokemon's feat as it helped both of its larger sparring partners up before looking at its spectators with a smile and a pose, the other two Pokemon also looking at the trainer and Druddigon, albeit with expressions that showed embarrassment at their shortcomings. Sarkhan in particular looked at all three of the Pokemon revealed to him and saw some sort of special property about them that he just knew they all shared, and he also felt in his heart there was a possibility he could somehow obtain the same trait they did; hopefully, he would meet one of them so he could find out more about it...<br />
<br />
At last, they both stood on a trail of rainbows that Hyrem found familiar, and he knew they were about to have a particularly special adventure together, while Sarkhan looked worried that the road would somehow not support their combined weight and collapse on them. &quot;Don't worry, Sark,&quot; Hyrem chuckled, &quot;I was a little scared when I first came here too, but it'll be fine! Well, at least until we get to wherever it is we're supposed to go.&quot; And Hyrem hoped it wouldn't be nearly as chilly as the frigid caverns he and Carla traversed last time.</span></span><br />

“What is that supposed to mean?” Tate muttered, flipping a slip of paper over in one hand. A small sachet of glittery powder sat in the other palm. There had been a display of <a href="http://www.serebiiforums.com/showthread.php?640278-Pok%E9mart&amp;p=18358563#post18358563" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.serebiiforums.com%2Fshowthread.php%3F640278-Pok%25E9mart%26p%3D18358563%23post18358563&amp;hash=18aaf14a288dcda07e25e50ff78b7b4f" rel="nofollow noopener">Dream Dust</a> in the Pokemart last time Kahakai and her trainer had visited, and Tate couldn’t resist the intrigue. It had come with a small slip of paper, upon which was printed a poem. Only now, while preparing to sleep, did Tate read it. It was cryptic and -- Tate thought -- mostly nonsense. Good money had been paid for the novelty item, however, and so it was to be used, cryptic or otherwise.<br />
<br />
The hammock was already hung and the fire was dying down. Stars spilled across the purple sky like diamonds on the bed of a river, swept up in the cosmic current and blinking from a hundred million years in the past. Taking a seat in the well-loved hammock, Tate peeled off mud-stained boots and left them in a pile on the earth below. Kahakai was already curled up on the ragged pillow which laid at one end of the fabric nest, having been ready for bed well over half an hour ago. Tate nudged her gently to one side by a couple of inches, rousing her from a shallow sleep; she yawned and stretched, blinking sleepily into the moonlit night.<br />
<br />
“Here,” Tate extended, crumpling up the poem and stuffing it into one pocket, before untying the sachet of Dream Dust. Pinching a bit between two fingers, the young naturalist sprinkled it atop Kahakai’s head. The Eevee sneezed, eliciting a laugh from her trainer. “Now you’ll have sweet dreams.”<br />
<br />
Unimpressed, Kahakai tried to scrape off the powder with one palm, but found it mostly futile. Shaking the worst off it from her fur, she repositioned herself and curled back up, returning to her slumber despite Tate’s antics. Tate gave her a brief scratch on the ruff in apology, before dumping the rest of the Dream Dust onto the pillow. The empty sachet was pocketed as well, and then Tate wriggled into the cocoon formed by the hammock and the blanket draped over it. Cheek meeting the pillowcase, it immediately became evident that this was not going to be a good night’s sleep; the dust felt gritty and clung cloyingly to the faintest moisture. Known to be a drooler, Tate feared what sort of congealed mess would manifest overnight. Oh well. If nothing else, it made for a good story.<br />
<br />
Kahakai was quickly snoring again next to Tate’s head, but the human had more trouble drifting off with what felt like loose sand smeared across the pillow. Tate tossed, and Tate turned, and Tate ummed, and Tate erred. The more one moved, the more the dust clung and cloyed and spread out. Within half an hour, everything from the neck up was coated in a fine glaze of dust. Breeding season was upon them soon, Tate recalled, seeking distraction from the discomfort. The Unpheazant would lek, and then the woods would be filled with the airy cries of Pidove, begging for food. Mating for life, the mature Swanna who had already established a breeding pair would have gaggles of young Ducklett following them around before their younger peers had even settled on a partner. The best part of breeding season, however, was always the fat Vullaby, wandering the cliff edges under the watchful eyes of their mothers. Celebi be praised, if only they could see the Mandibuzz roosting this year...<br />
<br />
--- --- --- --- --- ---<br />
<br />
Tate couldn’t recall falling asleep, but was roused after what felt like an eternity by what was initially assumed to be the sun. Blinking against the glow, Tate sat up and stretched, nudging Kahakai awake before sliding off of the hammock. Bending down to fetch footwear, however, Tate was shocked to find the grass void of boots. Had someone stolen them? Whirling around to see if maybe they’d just fallen further than Tate had thought, it was only then that the trainer realized it wasn’t the glow of the rising sun rousing the pair, but rather a rainbow. The forest where Kahakai and Tate had settled in for the evening was gone, having given way to what seemed to be an island in the sky. To the north, there was a bridge -- a bridge! -- of multicolored light. It was, in the most literal sense, unbelievable.<br />
<br />
Grabbing Kahakai rather unceremoniously, the Eevee having yet to even fully wake, Tate approached the magnificent sight with slow caution. This was… what was this? Was this more of the freakery that seemed to be endemic to Fizzytopia? Was it an hallucination? Was it the Dream Dust? Tate’s thoughts raced, thinking this must be a head trip, but Kahakai was only curious. Wriggling out of her trainer’s grasp, she landed on the grass with a hard thump and rolled, before sprinting off with a slightly irregular gait towards the bridge, excited by the rainbow. Horrified, Tate squealed and chased after the Eevee.<br />
<br />
“Kai, don’t-!” Tate yelled, as Kahakai’s fluffy body hit the bridge. In an instant, the trainer could see the beloved Pokemon falling through the illusion and plummeting to her death. Instead, she kept going, tail bouncing gleefully. Heart thundering, Tate watched in disbelief from the edge of the island -- barren except for the hammock and the two trees suspending it -- before cautiously extending one foot, and testing the bridge with a bare toe. To much shock, it seemed to support the weight of one foot, and then two feet. Then Tate was walking cautiously after Kahakai, trying not to look over the edges lest a lifetime of acrophobia rear its ugly head. In the distance, light glinted off of water, and Tate could finally see what Kahakai was sprinting towards. Tate, however, was distracted by the fluffy clouds drifting by the bridge, images of bird Pokemon dancing in the mind's eye.<br />
<br />
(OOC: The Dream Dust is technically expired. However, because permission issues had a hand in the delay in use, I'm hoping you'll be willing to accept it! If not, I'll be happy to buy another one. - Tate)</span></span><br />
