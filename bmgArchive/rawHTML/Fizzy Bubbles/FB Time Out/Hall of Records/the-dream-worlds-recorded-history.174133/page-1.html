<span style="font-size: 9px">A place where fantasy and reality unite to the point it's difficult to tell what is real and what is not, the Pokémon Dream World will keep you guessing with every step you take. Whether you are strolling through the Pleasant Forest, soaring across the Windswept Sky, swimming in the Sparkling Sea, exploring the Spooky Manor, trekking up the Rugged Mountain, navigating the Icy Cave, or lazing around the Dream Park, this fantasy world will stretch your imagination well beyond its limits.<br />
<br />
Sprinkle some Dream Dust on your pillow(s) before you sleep and you and your partner Pokémon will wake up on the <b>Island of Dreams</b>. Follow the rainbow bridge stretching out before you and you'll end up in one of the following seven locations:-<br />

<br />
<br />
The <b>Pleasant Forest</b> is an area of the Island of Dreams in the Pokémon Dream World. Many trails wind their way through the thick shrubs and tall trees in this area. Bug, Electric, Grass and Poison-type Pokémon are often found here.<br />
<br />
The <b>Windswept Sky</b> is an area of the Island of Dreams in the Pokémon Dream World. These beautiful cloudy skies are never marred by ugly storm clouds. It's only the fluffiest of big white clouds you'll find way up here where many a Flying-type Pokémon can be found.<br />
<br />
The <b>Sparkling Sea</b> is an area of the Island of Dreams in the Pokémon Dream World. Sunlight glitters off the surface of this beautiful deep blue sea. The waters are mostly calm, inhabiting all sorts of Water-type Pokémon.<br />
<br />
The <b>Spooky Manor</b> is an area of the Island of Dreams in the Pokémon Dream World. This creepy old manor is said to harbour some of the scariest Dark, Ghost, and Psychic-type Pokémon.<br />
<br />
The <b>Rugged Mountain</b> is an area of the Island of Dreams in the Pokémon Dream World. The tough and unwelcoming terrain attracts many Fire, Fighting, Ground, Rock and Steel-type Pokémon.<br />
<br />
The <b>Icy Cave</b> is an area of the Island of Dreams in the Pokémon Dream World. Nobody knows exactly how deep it goes as most cannot handle the sub-zero temperatures. Ground, Ice, Rock and Steel-type Pokémon can be found here.<br />
<br />
The <b>Dream Park</b> is an area of the Island of Dreams in the Pokémon Dream World. A large park showcasing professionally trimmed hedges and a large beautifully manicured lawn, many Normal and Fairy-type Pokémon can be found here enjoying the wide open space.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>Special Area</u></b><br />
The <b>Pokémon Café Forest</b> is an exceptionally rare area of the Island of Dreams in the Pokémon Dream World. How it is accessed is still a mystery but should you find the Pokémon Café - home of a Pansage, Pansear, and Panpour - you will uncover the secret path leading to this special forest where some of the rarest Pokémon are found.</span></span>&#8203;</div></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: lightblue"><b><u>Zone Guidelines</u></b><br />
Currently, this zone is the only way members can obtain Pokémon with Hidden Abilities. As such, there are restrictions placed upon it. Please ensure you read the following guidelines before entering the zone.<br />
<br />
- Each member may enter this zone twice per calendar year. Both introduction posts must be made between 1st January and 31st December to be considered a part of that year. For example, if I enter the zone on 31st December 2014 but the majority of my adventure is in 2015 it's still considered a 2014 adventure. If I then enter in April of 2015 it will officially be my first for the year and then October will be my second. I will have had three adventures in one year, but only two of them are 2015 adventures. I must then wait until 1st January 2016 before I can post another intro.<br />
<br />
- All adventures will be from 10-12 updates in length so don't enter this zone expecting an epic adventure. These updates are designed to be rapid-fire. Updaters will also need to curb themselves here as this is not your usual adventure zone so please try and stay on track!<br />
<br />
- Purchase some Dream Dust from your local Pokémart and sprinkle it on your pillow as well as your partner Pokémon's sleeping area. The mysterious qualities of this special powder will have the two of you falling into a deeper than usual sleep where mysterious things are said to happen.<br />
<br />
- When entering their dream state players may envision up to three Pokémon on the Island of Dreams, but there is only a 50/50 chance of these three Pokémon being encountered during your adventure. During your first annual run through the zone you may only choose common and/or rare Pokémon (please refer to the Egg House rarity schedule). During your second run only two of the three Poémon you choose may fit the super rare or ultra rare categories, the third must be either a common or rare Pokémon.<br />
<br />
- Upon reaching the Tree of Dreams you will have the option of choosing to leave with a Pokémon you have met, or of changing your partner Pokémon's ability to a Hidden Ability.<br />
<br />
- Only one Pokémon will come out of the zone with a Hidden Ability, whether that's your existing partner Pokémon or a new one you meet in the zone.<br />
<br />

<article class="message-body js-selectToQuote">
<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: lightblue"><span style="font-size: 9px">It was nighttime in the Fizzytopia region, the bright blue sky of daytime replaced with a vast, dark expanse peppered with bright, shining stars all across the region, and the grounds of the old, abandoned Hidden Mansion were no exception. While the ghosts in said mansion were just becoming active for the night, it was just the opposite in one of the Secret Bases built on its inexpensive property.<br />
<br />
In one such base, many Pokémon were either asleep or close to it. A dark grey Scolipede was curled up into a ball larger than a truck tire outside, snoring softly as he slept. Inside, a Meowth had fallen asleep on one of the couch cushions, a Pawniard had fallen asleep by the front door, though would awaken in an instant to the sound of someone breaking in, and so forth. Some Pokémon, however, weren't even close to being ready to sleep. A Shuppet and Banette were still wide awake, due to their Ability of Insomnia; a Crobat had just flown off to go hunting; and a Swalot, clad in a unique red outfit, had snuck away under the cover of night to fight crime as Captain Stomach. But the reasons these Pokémon had for staying awake weren't all as innocent as those...<br />
<br />
Deep, deep underground, in a small, dark room illuminated only by the numerous monitors on the wall which displayed the goings-on inside the base above, a room accessible only by pressing a secret, hidden button in the elevator to make it go down, much further down than the base's owner knew it ever went, a very much awake insect was engrossed in whatever it was he was doing with his computer. The Shadow Ledian's four hands worked the mouse and keyboard as he watched the monitor intently. And then, as his piercing red eyes fell upon a certain piece of information, said eyes widened.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Hidden Ability?</i>&quot; murmured Stewie. &quot;<i>What the deuce?</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
Working furiously, Stewie typed and clicked away, his eyes scanning the various websites he was pulling up. At last, he seemed to be satisfied with what he had discovered, as he beat his wings rapidly and was in the air, pacing around his secret lair in midair.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>So,</i>&quot; he murmured to himself. &quot;<i>It seems I need not settle for Swarm, then, as I've been doing all this time. Iron Fist- it's perfect for the future ruler of the world. Yes, yes, haven't I always wished to someday rule the world with an iron fist?</i>&quot; he chuckled evilly. &quot;<i>So all I would need is to access this Dream World... but how?</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
As he pondered this point, he glanced at the monitors on the wall, and at that moment, he spotted his Trainer walking into the library on one of the monitors. He held a small bag of some sort in one hand, and seemed to be looking around warily. Intrigued, Stewie pressed a button on a remote control, and he began getting sound from the room as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK,&quot; Keith was saying as he hid the bag behind a book on one of the bookshelves. &quot;The Dream Dust will be nice and safe there for the night. I'll decide who to take with me to the Dream World tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Well, well,</i>&quot; Stewie said, his evil grin growing wider and more ominous by the second. &quot;<i>So the hat man's got his hands on some Dream Dust, hmm?</i>&quot; His plan coming together in his twisted little mind, the megalomaniacal Shadow Ledian flew down to the center of the room, where a skull sat on the floor, for seemingly no purpose other than decoration. Landing before the skull, Stewie jabbed the left eye socket with one of his fists, then the right, then the left again, then the right two times, and then one more time in the left.<br />
<br />
As he made that final jab, the skull began to glow light blue. &quot;Password accepted,&quot; said a soft voice emanating from the skull's mouth, as the glow spread to Stewie, who then promptly vanished into thin air.<br />
<br />
In the entrance hall on the first floor, one of the hidden closet doors slowly opened, and Stewie poked his head out cautiously, glancing warily in all directions. It was by no means the first time he used the teleporter skull to exit his secret lair, and he had yet to be caught emerging from the closet where the teleporter would warp him to, but still, better safe than spotted. Indeed, all the Pokémon on the floor seemed to be either asleep or too busy to notice anything. Satisfied with this, the Shadow Ledian swiftly and silently flew up the stairs. Judging by the sounds coming from the bathroom, he could guess where his Trainer was. And this worked out quite well for Stewie- in fact, his plan depended on it. The entrance to the library was directly across from where he emerged from the staircase, and so he flew straight ahead. Once in the library, he wheeled around and made a Beedrillline straight for the book Keith had hidden the Dream Dust behind. He quietly pulled out the book, which seemed to go into detail on the history of evolution stones, and grabbed the small bag that had been hidden behind it. Replacing the book, he then flew into Keith's bedroom, smirking his satisfaction at hearing the sound of running water still coming from the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Stewie hovered over Keith's bed, carefully opening up the bag. Then, he gently sprinkled a nice, even coating of <a href="http://www.serebiiforums.com/showthread.php?640278-Pok%E9mart&amp;p=17648177#post17648177" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.serebiiforums.com%2Fshowthread.php%3F640278-Pok%25E9mart%26p%3D17648177%23post17648177&amp;hash=04469ef3e3bb4c77c4a23b0a134de05e" rel="nofollow noopener">Dream Dust</a> all over the bed. And as he finished, he heard the sound of footsteps just outside. Thinking quickly, he dove under the bed, just as Keith entered the room, yawning loudly. The Shadow Ledian listened intently as Keith climbed into bed, and soon enough, all was quiet. Slowly, carefully, quietly, Stewie crept out from underneath the bed, and flew up onto said bed. Keith was lying on the left side of the bed, very close to falling asleep. Smirking his satisfaction that his plan thus far was working, Stewie lied down next to his Trainer and quickly felt himself falling into a deep sleep, as he thought of nothing but gaining his most fitting Hidden Ability of Iron Fist.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
&quot;Zzzz... huh... wha?&quot; Keith murmured groggily. He was just waking up... or was he? He couldn't be sure. He didn't know where he was, it seemed like some kind of small island. And was it his imagination, or did he see some Pokémon floating around every time he blinked? Experimentally, he closed his eyes and tried to focus. It was kinda blurry... but one of them was small and blue, with long ears and numerous spikes. It almost looked like how Godric, his Nidoking, looked before he had even evolved into Nidorino- kind of like a <b>female Nidoran</b> would look. Satisfied with this assessment, he moved on to the second vision- this one was yellow, with a very large head, and what appeared to be a pair of exceptionally baggy pants- a <b>Scraggy</b>, he suddenly realized. Moving on to the third one, he focused- it was red and beige, and somewhat human-shaped, albeit with a long tail, large ears, and a curious tuft of fur on the forehead. This one didn't look too familiar to Keith, but he knew he had seen a picture of something like this before... oh, yeah, it was something called <b>Pansear</b>, wasn't it? Now satisfied with his assessments of what these mental pictures were of, Keith opened his eyes, only to find he was still on that strange island. Oh, and there was now also the minor detail of the Shadow Ledian hovering over him, staring intently at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;WAH!&quot; Keith exclaimed, jumping up. As he did so, he vaguely registered the fact that he seemed to be fully dressed in his usual attire, complete with his cowboy hat. &quot;St-Stewie?! What the- what are you- what is-&quot; he stammered as he looked around. And then, as he saw what appeared to be a bridge that looked just like a rainbow, it sank in. &quot;...this is the Dream World?&quot; he murmured. &quot;I- but- wait a second!&quot; he exclaimed suddenly. &quot;I didn't put that Dream Dust on my bed- wha-&quot; And then, as he looked back at Stewie, he realized what must have happened. &quot;You did this, didn't you?&quot; Keith sighed. &quot;Arceus damn it, Stewie! And the only reason you'd do this is if it benefited you in some way, so I'm guessing this has everything to do with your Hidden Ability.&quot; As he spoke, he dug out his Pokédex- mainly out of habit, though he was surprised to find that his Pokédex was indeed now in his hand. Remembering that most anything can happen in dreams, he shook it off, pointed the device at his Shadow Ledian, and pressed a few buttons.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ledian, a Five Star Pokémon. An evolved form of the Ledyba,&quot; droned the device. &quot;Its possible Abilities under normal circumstances are Swarm and Early Bird. This specimen's Ability is Swarm. Its Hidden Ability is the Iron Fist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Iron Fist, huh?&quot; Keith muttered, pressing another button.<br />
<br />
&quot;Iron Fist- Ledian's Hidden Ability,&quot; the device continued. &quot;Ledian's punching attacks are more powerful than usual.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith sighed. &quot;Well, that explains it, then,&quot; he said. &quot;You want your Ability changed to Iron Fist, don't you, Stewie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Led, Ledian,&quot; snapped Stewie, nodding at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ho, boy,&quot; groaned Keith. &quot;OK, look, Stewie, here's how it's gonna work. We'll go through this Dream World place, and by the time we get to the end of it, I might allow you to change your Ability, but this depends a lot on your behavior. If you listen to me and do what I say, give me no problems, don't try to scare away any of the Pokémon we find, I will consider changing your Ability. So, we have a deal?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Stewie folded both pairs of arms defiantly. &quot;Led Ledian, Ledian led Ledian,&quot; he replied. Keith knew what this meant- of course, he couldn't understand a word of Ledian language, but Stewie's tone of voice and body language made it unmistakable to him- Stewie was telling him that he would make no promises. Basically, there was no guarantee either way. Keith nevertheless sighed, knowing this was the best he'd get out of Stewie, and led the way towards the rainbow bridge. He had a feeling Stewie might end up getting what he wanted even if he didn't behave like Keith wanted him to, but only time would tell...</span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="color: lightblue">The chirps of Kricketot echoed through the valley. Trees dotted the scene here and there, reaching toward the brightening stars with welcoming boughs. In the midst of these, a lone tent sat propped up, just above a large boulder. If a passerby were to approach, they might see the varied silhouettes of a trainer and her Pokemon within, conversing in the way such beings tend to do.<br />
<br />
“Pax, you know how this goes.” Pest held a bag just out of reach, though she couldn’t keep a smile from her face. “Finish your food, and then we’ll see what this stuff we got from the Pokemart is about. I’m curious too, but first things first.”<br />
<br />
The slender Sylveon didn’t quite pout — she was evolved now, and a fairy besides — but her mouth still drew a little to the side. Big blue eyes stared up at the trainer, breaking only briefly to cast pointed glances at the half-eaten food in her bowl. In keeping Pest’s attention on her face, Pax sneaked a feeler around and behind the human; the feeler wiggled for a second, anticipating, before seizing the bag with an audible <i>yoink!</i><br />
<br />
“Pax!” Grabbing futilely after it, Pest burst out laughing. “Okay, okay. We can do this now, if you want. It’s getting late, and I shouldn’t have gotten the discount feed anyway.” She took the bowl and dumped its contents outside, much to Pax’s delight. “You ready?”<br />
<br />
Pax nodded vigorously.<br />
<br />
Taking the bag back, Pest reached in and grabbed a pinch of <a href="http://forums.upnetwork.net/showpost.php?p=675562&amp;postcount=43" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.upnetwork.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D675562%26postcount%3D43&amp;hash=fbe65d46995be4ee221bb067534892f7" rel="nofollow noopener">Dream Dust</a>. The mysterious substance sparkled in the lamplight as she sprinkled it across her pillow. Another pinch of dust was scattered next to the sleeping bag, and Pax leaned in to sniff at it; her nose wrinkled, and she sneezed adorably.<br />
<br />
“All right, let’s do this.” Pest slipped into her sleeping bag, resting her head on her pillow. By her side, Pax circled her area a few times before settling down. “Let’s get some sleep. I’ll see you soon, Pax.”<br />
<br />
The lamp clicked. Gradually, in the growing darkness, their breathing grew even.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Shapes swam across Pest’s mind. Dimly, she could recognize their forms, even as they passed from one to the next seamlessly. The wide, mad eyes of a <b>Darumaka</b> … the swishing tails of a <b>Vulpix</b> … the scuttling legs of a <b>Venipede</b>, skittering back into the darkness —<br />
<br />
With a gasp, she stumbled. Arms flailed wildly, and eventually, she regained her balance. Taking a few deep breaths, she calmed herself, and took in her new surroundings. A bright blue sky stretched overhead, dotted with puffy clouds. Around her, vivid green grass spread beneath her feet. What caught her attention, though, was the broad path in front of her, reaching up into the sky. Translucent and striped with attractive colors, it bore the appearance of a rainbow. A smile broke out on her face as she thought of the Cloud Garden; this sight would fit right in there.<br />
<br />
A light trill rose at her side. Pax stood attentively, taking in the sight of this strange place. Her feelers waved lazily in the hint of a breeze, and her tail wagged slowly, evenly, like the ticking of a clock.<br />
<br />
“This place … it’s amazing. And we haven’t even really seen it yet!” Pest scratched Pax behind the ears. “This is really going to be great. Let’s go!” And with growing optimism, she set foot on the rainbow path.</span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="color: lightblue">&quot;Argh!!! Why can’t I sleep!!!&quot; a man’s voice full of anger, stress and annoyance resonated from at least a mile away from a medium sized tree cottage situated on the end of a long winding road, at the end of a hill overlooking the ocean.<br />
<br />
Night had long fallen in the island known to many as the Volcanic Isle, many people made their base of operations here, but for one specific individual this place was more then that, this place was home. Inside a tree top base where many Pokemon lived, Ethan, the owner of this residents was currently screaming inside his pillow as he laid on his comfy king sized mattress, lined with nice silky sheets. He also wore some comfy looking PJs, with a shirt that had a design of a Gengar laughing maniacally and his pants having a pattern of the different variety of pokeballs printed on them. <br />
<br />
Floating across the darkened space, with only the moon's rays giving the room some illuminating glow through the blinds of the windowsill, the trainer's Gastly, James, came to see what he could possibly do for his trainer who was in distress.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still can’t sleep, huh?&quot; James said rather worried for the young man barely in his early 20s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope! Nada! Everything I try doesn't seem to be working. Every night I lay in my bed staring at the ceiling before taking a glance at the clock at the far end wall. Telling myself 'If I fall asleep now, I'll get 5 hours of sleep. But if I sleep now, I'll get 4 hours of sleep.' no matter what I do I can't seem to go to sleep!&quot; the trainer frustratedly tossed his pillow to the side as he sat up, &quot;It’s been 7 days now James, what the hell!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wonder what the cause might be?&quot; the Gastly mused.<br />
<br />
&quot;It all started on the first night, that is all I know...when I had a nightmare of-&quot; the boy cut off before looking down solemnly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Continue...&quot; Gastly urged.<br />
<br />
&quot;When I had a nightmare of my home burning in a gulf of flames...&quot; The boy sighed, &quot;Why is this happening now? I thought I got over these nightmares, now suddenly I’m starting to feel just like I did when I was 10. Scared and alone...it always starts the same, I'm standing in front of my house with Snivy next to me, beaten and bleeding my clothes are covered in dirt as the only home I'd ever known is burning to the ground...I can hear my parent's crying for help but I can't seem to move...why can't I move?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There, there.&quot; Gastly said coming to his trainer's side, &quot;It's just a nightmare,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or a buried memory...&quot; Ethan responded shaking a little as he rested his head on his knees, seating up hugging his legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! I know, maybe Darkrai has decided to visit this island thinking that no one lives here.&quot; The Gastly chuckled, joking to lighten the mood, &quot;Maybe that's why you can't sleep!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe...&quot; is all his trainer could say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; James sighed a little realizing his joke fell flat, &quot;We tried all the usual home remedies: warm milk before going to bed, a soothing bath, a nice comfy place to lay, a tiring workout- maybe it’s time we tried something new.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what?&quot; Ethan inquired.<br />
<br />
Floating over to the bed stand, James went and opened up a hidden compartment the trainer didn’t know about, and came out with a bag full of something.<br />
<br />
&quot;What’s that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This my dear boy is <a href="http://bmgf.bulbagarden.net/f231/poka-mart-172029/index2.html#post5498910" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fbmgf.bulbagarden.net%2Ff231%2Fpoka-mart-172029%2Findex2.html%23post5498910&amp;hash=83778e8aa34fc9ab51e9e1f4465761ae" rel="nofollow noopener">Dream Dust</a>, something rather special actually, these are particles that allow the user to fall asleep into a deep dream like state. I got it after I realized you wouldn't be beating this thing anytime soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you use it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; James floated next to the boy, &quot;You apply the powder to the pillow like so,&quot; Gastly said, before opening the bag and began to sprinkle some of it on the pillow, &quot;Then you lay your head and drift into a dream state. It’s usually only advised to use for people that really need to get some sleep, like people that have insomnia, and you my boy seem to be in direr need of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well- what do I got to lose?&quot; Ethan said but before he could lay his head on top of the pillow his bed room door suddenly swung open, finding a rather sleepy looking Chimchar with his flame out rubbing at his eyes and yawning quite loudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there buddy, did us talking wake you?&quot; Ethan said motioning for the little chimp to come and seat next to him.<br />
<br />
The Chimchar, sleepily waddled over and crawled onto the bed before laying his head on his trainer’s lap.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect!&quot; James exclaimed, &quot;He can accompany you in your dream.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, I thought you were going to come with?&quot; the trainer asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That’s okay, it’s better this way. I’ll get to keep an eye on both of you as you two rest. Now then, lean back...and close your eyes,&quot; Gastly instructed as Ethan and Aiden did as they were told. &quot;You should start feeling the effects as soon as you hit your head on the pillow...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yawwwnnnnnn!...you’re right I am getting a little drowsy...&quot; Ethan admitted as his Chimchar laid next to him sharing the pillow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I want you to count to three...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; Ethan closed his eyes, &quot;1...2...*yawn*...3&quot;<br />
<br />
As the young man difted into dream land, he began to envision Pokemon he had always wanted to meet. The first was an automaton with a round shape and glowing features, <i>That one is <b>Golett</b>...</i> the young man thought, as the image seemed to fade before being replaced with another, this one was round too but it had some fluff ontop of it's body and wings! <i>A <b>Rufflet</b> perhaps?</i> then it too faded, the last image was of a creature that looked a lot like a ballon, with a strings attached to the bottom, <i>Could that be...a <b>Drifloon</b></i>?, as the magic of the particles took hold, Ethan's breathing and heart rate steadied allowing his mind to dive deeper into REM sleep...<br />
<br />
–-<br />
<br />
When Ethan opened his blue eyes again, he couldn’t believe the awe and wonder he was experiencing. It was of course just a dream, but he had never felt a dream so...real, before. As the wind blew through his black wavy hair, he looked above to a piercing blue sky.<br />
<br />
On a tiny little island, the young man looked all around him, clouds were just an arm stretch away from him, he looked down below and realized the isle he was standing on was indeed floating above the clouds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chimchar!&quot;<br />
<br />
His attention was however brought to his fiery chimp, who looked more alive then he did a feel minutes ago.<br />
<br />
Climbing up his pants leg Aiden arrived to his favorite spot to be on, Ethan’s shoulder. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can you believe this, this place is amazing- oh wow!&quot; his jaw dropped when he saw it, a rainbow bridge that arched from the tiny little isle they were on to an even bigger island in front of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chim! Chim!&quot; Aiden pointed excitedly, Ethan didn’t need to speak Pokemon to know what his chimp was thinking, &quot;I agree buddy, lets go see what wonders things lie ahead from here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Walking over the rainbow bridge, Ethan and Aiden eagerly waited to see what their joint dream would have in store for them.</span></span><br />

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px">Levin sat on the bed, lost in thought, holding the vial of <a href="http://www.serebiiforums.com/showthread.php?640278-Pok%E9mart&amp;p=17648568#post17648568" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.serebiiforums.com%2Fshowthread.php%3F640278-Pok%25E9mart%26p%3D17648568%23post17648568&amp;hash=20a6059e3834ea8475b91faa610702e6" rel="nofollow noopener">Dream Dust</a> firmly in his hand. The substance held special meaning - he knew more about its properties than most people, thanks to Zion's pioneer research into the matter. That it was approved and available for use in every Pokemart in the land was already a meaningful achievement, but to be able to use it himself was a frightening prospect at the same time. There was a world of difference between the Dust's theoretical properties and what could happen for real when he tried it out. He knew for a fact that it opened a gateway to the Dream World in his slumber... but he knew nothing about getting <i>out</i>.<br />
<br />
<i>Zion assured me the Dust's effects were temporary and that waking back up was practically a statistical certainty. But as Zion itself also said, it doesn't sleep.</i><br />
<br />
It wasn't just the fact that he might be trapped in a dream-like coma that scared him - it was the thought of condemning someone else to that same fate. He knew he'd need protection inside the Dream World, because his dreams very rarely went smoothly from start to finish, and he had no idea whether the Pokemon in that realm would be hostile. Going in alone was dangerous, but bringing someone along was selfish.<br />
<br />
He briefly contemplated storing the Dream Dust away, knowing it'd vanish in just 72 hours... until something started lightly pecking his leg repeatedly. Looking down, he saw his beloved red bird, one of his closest companions - Solair the Fletchinder. His sense of honor and bravery were second to none, knightly virtues he made sure to uphold at all times - or, according to Mazo's translation, &quot;as long as the Sun shines&quot;. Levin was quick to realize what Solair wanted, and couldn't help but smile as he picked the bird up and sat him on his lap.<br />
<br />
- You don't have anything to prove anymore. We'll face Vesper again sooner or later, and that's all the retribution you'll need. I can't put you through this, not knowing if we'll make it back... <i>especially</i> not you.<br />
<br />
But Solair was relentless. He chirped loudly, clearly arguing his point; it was obvious he disagreed and wanted to travel to the Dream World, but Levin couldn't understand the Fletchinder's stubbornness on this particular matter, when he'd always been flawlessly obedient.<br />
<br />
<i><span style="color: darkorange">His wings. He needs to prove a point, master.</span></i><br />
<br />
Mazo was at the door, smiling at the scene. As always, he had it all figured out... but this time, Levin was quick to follow.<br />
<br />
- Your wings... Vesper had them pierced and rendered useless. That's what this is about then... You want to face him with even stronger wings than before.<br />
<br />
<i><span style="color: darkorange">With the strongest wings in the world. Solair needs to show Vesper he's unbreakable. And you too.</span></i><br />
<br />
The Fletchinder nodded affirmatively, spreading his mended wings as he did.<br />
<br />
- You don't need to show me anything Solair. But I owe you a rematch against that Mega Beedrill... and I want to see Vesper's face when we show him the true results of his actions! You win... let's do this.<br />
<br />
Mazo smiled and left the room to resume his training with Aya. Levin hesitated briefly but finally opened up the vial, sprinkling the magical dust on his pillow. He grabbed <a href="http://forums.upnetwork.net/showpost.php?p=487890&amp;postcount=246" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.upnetwork.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D487890%26postcount%3D246&amp;hash=cad30cabee42fd2c0ec8ae20024735f0" rel="nofollow noopener">Ivan's coin</a> for luck and laid down, Solair by his side. And while it usually took him hours to fall asleep, this time he found himself drifting off almost instantly...<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
<span style="color: lightblue">- I can't believe it...<br />
<br />
They made it. Somehow, it actually worked; there was no mistake about it. Lush grass surrounded them and the sky above was clear blue. A gentle breeze touched his skin and it felt warm, although the Sun itself wasn't visible. Solair, flying close by, looked equally astonished. And if any further proof was necessary, a wide rainbow road stretched before him into the unknown. Maybe the Heiml myth of the Bifrost bridge had a layer of truth to it after all...<br />
<br />
Before he could address Solair, his vision went blurry for a moment and his head felt excessively light; he brought a hand to his forehead, as if about to faint, and looked ahead to find three creatures crossing the rainbow path towards the sky... From what he could make out, the first one was limber and much faster than the other two, running across the rainbow road as it it were in a hurry; his blurred eyesight had trouble adjusting to its speed at first, but it soon became apparent that it was a <b>Sentret</b>. Farther back, two other creatures walked lazily side by side but not acknowledging each other's presence. A blue automaton Levin had little difficulty in identifying as a <b>Golett</b>, and a brown furball that was harder to name, but could very well be a <b>Swinub</b>.<br />
Mere seconds later his vision was back to normal, and the three creatures were gone - the rainbow road was empty. What the hell just happened?<br />
<br />
<i>No time to dwell on this. I've studied the matter extensively - the only way to progress across the Dream World is to cross the rainbow bridge... and hope for the best.</i><br />
<br />
Solair perched himself on the Saffron-native's shoulder; they exchanged one last determined glance, nodded simultaneously and stepped ahead into the unknown...</span></span><br />

<div class="bbWrapper"><b>Dream #01: Pilot</b><br />
<br />
<span style="color: lightblue"><span style="font-size: 9px"> A Buizel ran down the street with a plastic bag trailing behind his neck. He peeked between alleyways and up to fire escapes and down stairwells in the city. The weasel ducked between the legs of pedestrians and up lampposts to look about in the dark night. The sun was long gone, but the lights of the city kept it alive and bustling. Waves of people, moving like an ocean towards their homes or wherever they belonged. They were the lucky ones.<br />
<br />
He wasn’t quite sure what he was looking for, but he remembered the image that his trainer showed him; “Arceus’ Light Shelter”. It was the 3rd place they had gone this month, 4th if you considered their ad hoc tent beneath the bridge to be a place. Many adventurers fell to their fate; homeless, unknown, and forgotten by the successfuls. At the very least, they had each other. The 7 of them have been together for a long, long while. Most trainers come in with one starter, but Jade had 6 of us and she didn’t want to get rid of any of them. So she brought all of them; Max, Marc, Alice, Hazel, Orville, and Bridget. With them, she expected that they could go on grand adventures, but fate had other plans. Every trip to a dangerous area led to no danger at all, every plan for treasure hunting was pocket change, and every attempt to help another was just a con. Their plans were shattered.<br />
<br />
Max saw the sign hanging above glass doors. He ran in and untied the bag from his neck. The workers there disregarded him, too busy carrying their Holy Books to every person inside. He scaled the side of the wall, jumping onto pipes and searching the large room. Mats and blankets sat on the floor, strewn about in an orderly fashion. He spotted Jade in the far corner, along with two balls of fluff chasing each other. He made his way back down and sprinted across the floor with the bag in tow. Jade was glancing through the Holy Book offered to her before unceremoniously tossing it to the side, spotting Maxwell after. Two puff balls perked up and separated into actual Eevee.<br />
<br />
“Max! Welcome back, bud.” Jade said, scratching the Buizel’s head. He raised up his paws in protest, almost knocking her hands away. She tried to poke his belly quickly, but Buizel’s paws moved quick and knocked her hands away. He made a grumpy sound, but Jade giggled at him. He dropped the bag in front of her and fell to the ground, only to be attacked immediately by Eevee. Jade looked through the bag; just the usual stuff. A Rare Candy, a few cans of tuna and beans, a pack or two of ramen, and a purple pouch. She picked it up and shook it a bit. “Max? What is this?” An orange head poked up from the fluff. He broke free of their tackle hug and moved closer to Jade. He peeked in the bag and found a tiny card, pulling it out and tossing it to Jade.<br />
<br />
Jade read from the card, “<a href="http://forums.upnetwork.net/showpost.php?p=675539&amp;postcount=40" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.upnetwork.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D675539%26postcount%3D40&amp;hash=b2ffe4a9724e72731727e6a90b1bfb34" rel="nofollow noopener">Dream Dust</a>. Sprinkle on yourself and a companion before rest for sweet dreams.” She glanced down at her friend, already trying to sleep after his journey to the Pokemart. “Lights are out in a few minutes, according to the missionaries. Want to try it out?” Max yipped back and crawled closer to her. The Eevee duo curled up near Jade too; Hazel at her feet and Alice on the opposite side of Max. Jade took the pouch and sprinkled the pink dust inside on her head and onto Max. The Buizel sneezed from the dust, but settled down shortly after. The lights were still on in the shelter, but Jade found herself falling to sleep swiftly.<br />
<br />
Dreams came to both of them swiftly; simple visions at first. A Ralts, wandering about in curiosity. A Munna hovering in place, calm in meditation. An Elgyem, who seemed to be a tiny bit distressed.<br />
<br />
And then, they saw the Rainbow Bridge.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u> <i>[12:00 am]</i>:</b> The Rainbow Bridge sprawls before your eyes, and it’s fairly obvious it’s the only way to go. Soothing as the Island of Dreams itself may be, it soon becomes apparent that nothing noteworthy is going to happen anytime soon, so crossing the ethereal road into the sky seems to be the only way to progress before you wake back up.<br />
<br />
Although it’s clearly arching upwards, you feel no effort whatsoever in climbing it, as if you were walking a straight line the whole time. The rainbow disappears into an amalgam of clouds, which you effortlessly pass through… only to suddenly find yourself walking out of a bush into a forest clearing! You have a hard time understanding what’s going on, but this being a dream, it’s hard to expect everything falling into place like in real life… If anything, it might be best to approach this world with nothing but a sense of wonder to make the most of it.<br />
Birds are chirping and a gentle breeze is blowing across the woods, carrying a pleasant aroma. Sunlight bathes the forest grounds and lends everything a beautiful glow – a dream world indeed.<br />
<br />
You remember that, wonderful as the sights may be, you might be waking up at any time, and you want to make the most of your first trip to this world, so you begin braving the wilds ahead. Nothing seems to happen for a while, although the forest is very much alive. It isn’t until the familiar scent of honey fills your nostrils that you stop once more, your stomach rumbling from all the walking; you didn’t know you could feel hungry in a dream… The origin of the sweet odor is easy to track, a nearby tree of imposing height. But as you approach it, a loud buzzing noise is heard and your eyes instantly turn to the large blue creature which reaches the trunk seconds before you do – it’s a

<b>Heracross</b>!<br />
<br />
It doesn’t seem to have noticed you yet, too eager to reach the delicious honey. And even if it did spot you, something tells you it probably wouldn’t turn aggressive – it’s hard to picture anything becoming hostile in such a charming environment.<br />
<br />
The path goes on and so does time. What will you do?</span><br />

<b><u>Rugged Mountain</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>SugarPesticide</u> <i>[12:00 am]</i>:</b> Dreams are funny things. They never quite go according to plan, but at the same, you can never shake off the feeling that if you <i>really</i> tried, you could get everything to go the way you want it. That seems to be the case for regular dreams anyway; this is anything but. The rainbow road you’re currently crossing seems to be a recurring theme in every Dream Dust-induced slumber, but if this is <i>your</i> dream, how can it be the same for everybody else? It makes no sense, but then again… dreams rarely do. Best to just go with it, really…<br />
<br />
You and Pax cross the bridge side-by-side, curious to see what lies beyond; if it’s anything as peaceful and welcoming as the Island of Dreams, then… oh. It’s… it’s not.<br />
<br />
An arid, unbearably hot landscape spreads as far as the eye can see. Fire-spewing mountains rise in the distance, and jagged pillars of rock protrude from the cracked, sterile soil. All of a sudden, you find yourselves in the Rugged Mountains, when just a couple of seconds ago you were walking on rainbows…<br />
<br />
Pax looks uncomfortable in this environment, far from the flowery fields she’d no doubt have preferred. The dry atmosphere and high temperatures aren’t something she’s used to, but then again, it doesn’t look like many other living things are, either. The place feels deserted, but you reason most lifeforms that inhabit this land are simply hiding somewhere from the inhospitable climate; after all, Pokemon are hardy creatures.<br />
Not a moment too soon, you hear a repeated, rhythmic sound of something blunt colliding over and over again with a hard surface. Though you can’t quite make out where it comes from, it proves an easier task for Pax, who senses someone nearby with her feelers. She turns to a rock formation to your right, and after squinting, you realize there’s a Pokemon hitting the pillar continuously; you approach it just enough to realize it’s a

<b>Scraggy</b> right in the middle of a training session! How stubborn do you have to be to keep practicing out in the open in a place like this?...<br />

<b><u>Spooky Manor</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Electric Blue Eye</u> <i>[12:00 am]</i>:</b> You find yourself drifting off almost instantly, a luxury you hadn’t been able to afford for seven days in a row. The deep sleep is welcome, but in the back of your mind, you know it’s not something you can resort to every night to come… still, you decide to make the most of it this time and recharge your batteries.<br />
<br />
… But if you were hoping for a calm, uneventful slumber, that illusion is quickly shattered once you find yourself alongside your Chimchar on a very small island floating among the clouds! This is unlike any other dream you’ve ever experience, yet you’re certain it’s not real. Whatever this represents, it’s exceedingly obvious your mind wants you to go in a certain direction, as it creates a rainbow path for you to follow into the unknown… and it seems to be the only way out of the Island of Dreams. The chimp follows you without hesitation when you take your first hesitant steps across the magical bridge, then more confidently when it doesn’t crumble beneath your feet. In a matter of seconds you’re crossing the rainbow road with nothing but excitement in your heart, looking forward to what this dreams has in store for you after landing in such a beautiful scenario!<br />
<br />
Except… you find yourself walking into a bleak, abandoned-looking hallway that belongs nowhere but in a haunted mansion like those you see in movies. What the heck’s going on? Why would you dream up something so ghastly to explore when you could’ve ended up in a thousand different wonderful places?<br />
Aiden doesn’t seem intimidated though, and looks around bewildered by the sudden change. And if you can cast your fears aside, maybe this manor might hold something of value… after all, isn’t this <i>your</i> dream?<br />
<br />
While you try your hardest to embrace positive thinking, a bone-chilling hum begins to echo through the hall… as if someone is singing to themselves! Intrigued, you follow the almost imperceptible tune, that grows louder as you draw closer; and peeking around the first corner you come across, you see a

<span style="color: lightblue"><b><u>Pleasant Forest</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u> <i>[12:00 am]</i>:</b> The Rainbow Bridge sprawls before your eyes, and it’s fairly obvious it’s the only way to go. Soothing as the Island of Dreams itself may be, it soon becomes apparent that nothing noteworthy is going to happen anytime soon, so crossing the ethereal road into the sky seems to be the only way to progress before you wake back up.<br />
<br />
Although it’s clearly arching upwards, you feel no effort whatsoever in climbing it, as if you were walking a straight line the whole time. The rainbow disappears into an amalgam of clouds, which you effortlessly pass through… only to suddenly find yourself walking out of a bush into a forest clearing! You have a hard time understanding what’s going on, but this being a dream, it’s hard to expect everything falling into place like in real life… If anything, it might be best to approach this world with nothing but a sense of wonder to make the most of it.<br />
Birds are chirping and a gentle breeze is blowing across the woods, carrying a pleasant aroma. Sunlight bathes the forest grounds and lends everything a beautiful glow – a dream world indeed.<br />
<br />
You remember that, wonderful as the sights may be, you might be waking up at any time, and you want to make the most of your first trip to this world, so you begin braving the wilds ahead. Nothing seems to happen for a while, although the forest is very much alive. It isn’t until the familiar scent of honey fills your nostrils that you stop once more, your stomach rumbling from all the walking; you didn’t know you could feel hungry in a dream… The origin of the sweet odor is easy to track, a nearby tree of imposing height. But as you approach it, a loud buzzing noise is heard and your eyes instantly turn to the large blue creature which reaches the trunk seconds before you do – it’s a

<b>Heracross</b>!<br />
<br />
It doesn’t seem to have noticed you yet, too eager to reach the delicious honey. And even if it did spot you, something tells you it probably wouldn’t turn aggressive – it’s hard to picture anything becoming hostile in such a charming environment.<br />
<br />
The path goes on and so does time. What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: lightblue"><span style="font-size: 9px">Keith looked at the Rainbow Bridge ahead of him as he started to cross it. Oddly, though it was clearly arch-shaped, and thus was currently making him climb, he... wasn't feeling it. He may as well have been walking on level ground. It was strange, but he liked it. And then he remembered- Dream World. Dream. Laws of physics not such an influence here. Right.<br />
<br />
Stewie, on the other hand, was not feeling the sense of wonder here. He buzzed impatiently around Keith, shouting at him to move faster. Of course, Keith, not being able to understand Ledian language, did no such thing. He was too taken by the wonderful world around him. And then, before either of them knew it, they walked into a bunch of clouds... and emerged from a bush in a forest clearing!<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa,&quot; Keith remarked, looking all around him. He hadn't been expecting that. Of course, he hadn't really had any kind of reasonable expectations for this place, what with the whole dream thing... Still, though,who expects to enter a cloud and come out of a bush?<br />
<br />
Shaking off the decidedly weird experience, Keith began to explore the forest, with Stewie following him, his only thought being that of getting his Hidden Ability out of this experience.<br />
<br />
For a while, nothing happened. All was quiet and peaceful, and then suddenly, the sweet scent of honey reached Keith's nostrils. He sniffed at it, and suddenly found that he was hungry. &quot;Huh,&quot; Keith remarked. &quot;I guess you can feel hungry in dreams. Who knew? Wanna check that out, Stewie?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Shadow Ledian crossed his arms defiantly and shook his head. &quot;Led Ledian!&quot; he snapped- an exclamation almost entirely drowned out by the sudden sound of his stomach growling.<br />
<br />
Keith smirked at the Shadow Pokémon. &quot;Wanna run that by me again?&quot;<br />
<br />
In response, Stewie shot Keith a furious glare, though he followed his Trainer as they followed the scent nonetheless.<br />
<br />
Not long afterwards, they reached the source- a very large tree, very tall, very imposing. But as they drew near, a buzzing noise got their attention as a large blue bug arrived at the trunk of the tree. Keith knew what this was, and even owned one for an extremely brief period, but this was still his first time seeing one outside of his Pokédex's screen- it was a Heracross, and it looked very eager to get to the honey that the tree promised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm,&quot; Keith murmured. &quot;Hey, Stewie, what say we leave that Heracross be, OK?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ledi?!&quot; snapped Stewie. &quot;Led Ledian ledi led Ledian!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I get it, you smell the honey, it smells good, but we could wake up at any time, OK?&quot; Keith said sternly. &quot;We can't just stand around snacking, we got our waking hours to do that. I say we leave the Heracross be and keep exploring, OK?&quot;<br />
<br />
Stewie had every intention of arguing with Keith over this, but realized he was right- suppose they woke up prematurely, before Stewie could work out how to get his Hidden Ability out of this experience? He gave Keith a very curt nod, and Keith, willing to take whatever he could get, nodded back and led the way through the forest.</span></span><br />

<span style="color: lightblue"><i>How did we manage to get here?</i> Ethan asked himself, <i>I don't remember taking a turn or entering any sort of forest...</i> While his companion simply scratched his head in confusement as well...the trainer couldn't be sure how they had ended up in the middle of a long flowing hall, in what seemed in be an abandon mansion...<br />
<br />
But he wasn't that surprised, he knew that his mind was being haunted with thoughts of the dead. And Aiden didn't seem that fazed either, his trainer after all- unconsciously or otherwise associated himself with Ghosts all the time. Maybe it was due to how much freedom they had, from the materialistic world and many other things, they could prank and have fun without any consequence...it's like they had a second chance at living, and could do whatever they wanted!<br />
<br />
They walked with very little caution. A bone chilling sound causing chills to go up their spines as they were immediately drawn in by the only source of any life around. &quot;What was that?&quot; <br />
<br />
Coming around the corner, drawn in my the sudden singing with a rather calming feeling coming over him, Ethan peeked to a room where the singing seemed to originate from, finding a Gothita of all things, singing to herself in front of a mirror. The Chimchar does nothing but look at her intriguingly, her voice an eerie but beautiful sound not thought to be found in a strange mansion as the one they were in.<br />
<br />
They listened for a while before leaving the Psychic Type to it's own musing...but as they walked away Aiden can see the song they had just heard had a bigger effect on his trainer then one might of thought.<br />
<br />
Ethan had tears forming in his eyes, and the curious Chimchar didn't quite understand why, &quot;Chim?&quot; the fire type said before the trainer realized he wasn't being very good at hiding his emotions.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know it's silly,&quot; the young boy said, &quot;I mean...but seeing the Gothita sing, it reminded me a lot of my mother. She would sing all the time when I was little, she wasn't a superstar but it was beautiful it would give me great comfort when I was home or when I was hurt, she would sing to me to make me feel better, to let me know that she was there. I guess I just miss that sometimes,&quot; he finally admitted wiping a few tears from his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;My favorite song she used to sing would have to be,&quot; the gentlemen cleared his throat, &quot;Cielito lindo...&quot; he began to sing a little before continuing down the long flowing hall...</span></span><br />

This particular dream, however, you aren’t keen on waking up from just yet – not until you accomplish what you set out to do. Heracross are powerful Pokemon in their own right when raised properly, but your aspirations lie elsewhere; after all, in all your years of travel, if it wasn’t for perseverance you’d never have made it where you are today. Patience is a virtue, even when time is against you, and something tells you to keep searching these woods rather than stop and interact with the Hercules beetle. Leaving the Heracross behind, feasting on the sweet honey it craved so badly, you and Stewie progress deeper into the forest.<br />
<br />
The further in you go, the livelier and more colorful your surroundings become; a scenery straight out of a movie it’d seem, with colorful, blossoming flowers all around you, strong sunlight and the chirping of birds – even their melody seems to become happier the longer you keep going, making for a particularly pleasant trip. The only thing off about the painting created by your own mind is the supremely-evil Shadow Pokemon flying right behind you, sticking out like a sore thumb in an otherwise idyllic setting; fortunately, it seems to be behaving for now, even if solely to serve its own interests.<br />
After a while, you make it to a large sun-filled clearing, lush grass all around the circular opening and a single larger yellow bloom half-buried right at the center, eagerly taking in as much sunlight as it can to grow strong and healthy. Upon closer inspection, you realize the giant seed is actually a cheerful-looking

<b><u>Spooky Manor</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Electric Blue Eye</u> <i>[1:00 am]</i>:</b> Gothita’s tune gets to you, stirring up all kinds of unwanted emotions. This isn’t how a perfect dream is supposed to go at all, reliving things from your past wasn’t why you entered this world in the first place! Aiden seems to understand your situation, nodding reassuringly when you muster the courage to keep walking down the hall.<br />
<br />
The further in you go, the creepier the place gets… and there you were thinking that Gothita’s humming was bad enough for your nerves! Ancient paintings line the walls, portraits of long-deceased owners of the Manor, and you can’t shake off the feeling that every single one of them is watching you with their lifeless eyes. Moans and cries can be faintly heard from time to time, belonging to whatever tortured souls weren’t fortunate enough to leave this reality after departing. The mansion feels dead, cold and unwelcoming but something – perhaps your natural affinity for Ghosts – urges you to keep going against the darkness that surrounds you at every step.<br />
<br />
It isn’t until you reach a crossroads of sorts that you’re forced to stop, and you can almost feel the shadows crawling up your legs the second you do. The corridor ends in a wall with two doors side by side! Both are identical, with no indication of where they lead or what might lie beyond… but the sounds coming from behind each of them are clearly different.<br />
From the old wooden door to your left comes the unsettling sound of something resembling a chant, a monotonic repetition of undecipherable syllables that makes you think of some sort of prayer. From the one to your right, the unmistakable sound of wings flapping rhythmically can be heard, despite being partially muffled by the wood.<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: lightblue"><span style="font-size: 9px">Keith proceeded onwards through the forest produced by his own mind, and Stewie semi-reluctantly followed. Hungry though the sweet aroma of honey was making him, he knew better than to lose sight of his goals. He just hoped the hat man didn't happen upon a kind of Pokémon he wanted to take back, though- little though he knew of the Dream World, he knew enough that Keith electing to take a Pokémon he encountered would mean no Iron Fist for him. He looked all around as he followed Keith, his piercing red eyes glancing in every direction, on the lookout for any Pokémon, any potential competition.<br />
<br />
Keith was also looking around, albeit for decidedly nicer reasons. Much as he had been hoping to properly plan out the trip, decide who to take with him, and get an idea as to what he might want to get out of it, the fact remained that he was unceremoniously dragged into it as part of Stewie's own goal of acquiring his Hidden Ability. Keith had considered the option back when he had first bought the Dream Dust, but he hadn't had much time to give it further consideration, Stewie had seen to that. As it is, Keith was here now, so he figured he might as well enjoy himself, take in the lovely sights, and maybe, just maybe, bond a little with Stewie. Of course, Keith knew that Shadow Pokémon were practically pure evil, but he enjoyed a good challenge, and Stewie definitely fit the description there.<br />
<br />
Keith turned to the Shadow Pokémon following him around. &quot;So, Stewie,&quot; he said, &quot;how about this Dream World, huh? Beautiful, isn't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Led, Ledian,&quot; Stewie replied in a decidedly uninterested tone. He continued glancing around, though Keith was getting the idea that the Bug/Flying-type wasn't admiring the scenery like his Trainer was.<br />
<br />
Keith narrowed his eyes. &quot;Remember what I said, Stewie,&quot; he said warningly. &quot;I don't want you scaring off any Pokémon, OK?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ledian led Ledian!&quot; snapped Stewie. He started ranting and raving, making wild gestures with all four hands, shouting at Keith about how he would do as he damn well pleased, and how Keith may be his Trainer but was not the boss of him, and so on.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, come on, take it easy,&quot; Keith said, raising his voice a bit to try and be heard over Stewie's ranting. &quot;Or do you want me to rule out letting you have your Hidden Ability?&quot;<br />
<br />
Stewie flew in close, so his face was less than an inch from Keith's. &quot;Le. Di. An,&quot; he hissed.<br />
<br />
Keith was unfazed by this. &quot;Maybe you're right. Maybe I wouldn't dare,&quot; he agreed. &quot;But are you really willing to take that chance? Trainers only get to visit the Dream World twice a year, and next time I might decide to take someone else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stewie had nothing to say to this, and so he backed off, shooting Keith a death glare the whole while. But as they walked, the Shadow Ledian realized that he was just a tiny bit impressed with his Trainer. He knew Keith didn't underestimate his powers by any means, and yet he kept calm and cool in the face of what he would undoubtedly have perceived as imminent danger. Of course, Stewie wouldn't have done anything to Keith in any case, but Keith didn't know that. Blast that vile Pawniard, why was he keeping his promise to her to not harm the hat man anyway? Oh, yeah, the love and stuff. Right. Damn.<br />
<br />
As they continued, they came to a large clearing, filled with lush grass and bathed in sunlight. A beautiful sight, for sure, and Keith couldn't help but grin at it. Then, he noticed a half-buried plant of some sort at the center of the clearing, soaking up the sunlight. And then, as he looked, he realized that that was no plant- it was a Pokémon! A large, yellow seed with two leaves sprouting from its top. Upon spotting Keith, it happily shook its leaves at him and Stewie, seemingly unfazed by the evil megalomanic with grandiose plans for world domination. Keith took out his Pokédex and pointed it at the large seed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sunkern, a Seed Pokémon,&quot; droned the device. &quot;Extremely weak, it can only shake its leaves to drive off attackers. This specimen's Ability is the Early Bird.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh,&quot; grinned Keith. &quot;It's kinda cute, isn't it, Stewie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Leeeeed, Ledian!&quot; Stewie exclaimed, shaking his head vehemently and flying in between Keith and Sunkern. He started ranting again, though this time, one of his gestures was to point at one of his wrists, as though to remind Keith that they were on a time limit. He also pointed at Sunkern, then pounded one of his fists into the other hand, as though saying that Sunkern wouldn't stand a chance on the team.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stewie, will you give it a rest?&quot; demanded Keith. &quot;It was a simple question- 'it's kinda cute, isn't it?'. I didn't say anything about wanting to catch the Sunkern or anything, it was a simple, direct question, and I would appreciate your answer.<br />
<br />
Seething with anger, Stewie glared at the Sunkern and examined it for a few seconds. It <i>was</i> kinda cute, though he wasn't exactly the biggest fan nor the best judge of &quot;cute&quot;. He turned back to Keith and gave a very curt nod. &quot;Led,&quot; he snapped.<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree,&quot; Keith grinned. &quot;Now, was that so hard?&quot;<br />
<br />
Stewie decided to not answer this, if only for the sake of not doing anything that would lead to him maiming his Trainer. He had to keep focused, after all- the hat man was the tool he needed to gain the necessary strength to become the unquestioned leader of the world, and it would not do well to render the tool unusable before actually using it.<br />
<br />
Blissfully unaware of Stewie's aspirations for world domination as ever, Keith crouched down near the Sunkern. &quot;Hey, Sunkern,&quot; he smiled. &quot;You want us to relax in the sun for a while, don't you? Sorry, but we gotta be going- there's a lot to this place and I'd like to see as much as possible before I wake up. You keep doing what you're doing, though- this is a beautiful spot, and if we had that kind of time, we'd gladly hang out here with you.&quot; He then stood up and addressed his Shadow Ledian. &quot;Come on, Stewie,&quot; he said. &quot;Let's see what else this place has to offer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stewie followed Keith, grumbling to himself- for the sake of his plans, this place better damn well not have anything to offer the hat man!</span></span><br />

&quot;Goodnight, Numbuh 2nd Opinion.&quot; Deftera blearily smiled, her plus eyes thinning into minuses as she flickered out her antennae, and she wrapped her little fins about herself to sleep on her favourite desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goodnight, Numbuh 10 Picarats. You too, Numbuh Ice-Nine.&quot; In a basket of their own that was already starting to glaze over with particles of frost, Luke and Frazil murmured incoherent things with their eyes close, possibly dreaming of another play date.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goodnight, Numbuh 48 Teeth.&quot; Contrary to the others, Chomp Chomp decided to camp out on the floor where he'd ripped up one of the wooden planks as a chew toy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goodnight, Numbuh Population: 625 and Level 3 Sentry.&quot; Poised on a large shelf, the two multi-headed female operatives Zoombini and Streisand prepared to stand down for the night, though one of their heads would cast a suspicious glare at the other every now and then.<br />
<br />
&quot;Happ! Happiny!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Coming, Trucy.&quot; Though she had already been on the team for a while, Trucy still was the team's &quot;baby&quot; - literally, at that. As Shadow tucked himself in the Happiny nuzzled his wrist. &quot;You don't have to stay up just to wait for me, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Happ!&quot; The Playhouse Pokemon shook her head, indicating that she didn't mind. It was her nightly ritual to not fall asleep until her Trainer had retired for the night himself; until then she would keep vigil on his pillow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, let's see if this helps you go to sleep quicker,&quot; mused Shadow, producing a small sachet on the bedside table. <a href="http://forums.upnetwork.net/showpost.php?p=678127&amp;postcount=54" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.upnetwork.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D678127%26postcount%3D54&amp;hash=082f399dae4894364bc677e0e6094130" rel="nofollow noopener">Dream Dust</a>, the PokeMart called it. Shadow didn't quite understand what the fine print had meant, but if the stores were selling the stuff, it had to be legitimate, right? The scientist sprinkled the bag's contents onto the pillow, eliciting giggles from Trucy as she tried to catch some of the powder on her hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goodnight, Numbuh Less Than 3.&quot; &quot;Happ!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Trainer and Pokemon were out like a light.<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center">***&#8203;</div><br />
In what felt like less than a minute, Shadow blinked his eyes open. He was no longer in his bed, and was instead reclining on a surface of flat... something. &quot;What in the - &quot; Bringing a hand to his forehead, Shadow's brain tried to rationalise the situation, but images began exploding in his mind. A <b>Litwick</b> phasing through barriers like mist; a <b>Kecleon</b> phasing in and out of existence; a <b>Mawile</b> posed in meditation before its jawed horns swung open to strike... What did it all mean? Shadow drummed his fingers on his temple, but all he got was fuzziness. Fuzziness? That was it - he was back in the Dream World, where he'd first met Durin, one of his many trusted operatives.<br />
<br />
&quot;Happ!&quot;<br />
<br />
Shadow blinked again. This time, it seemed, he wasn't the only one who journeyed into the Dream World. Trucy was just ahead of him, having the time over life bumping about the rainbow road. Again she tripped over her feet, giggling as she tumbled around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, Trucy!&quot; Panicking a little, Shadow darted forward to scoop the precocious Pokemon in his hands. There was no telling what they'd come across, or if the consequences they encountered would carry over out of the Dream World. All they could do for now was go forward...</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Electric Blue Eye</u> <i>[1:00 am]</i>:</b> Gothita’s tune gets to you, stirring up all kinds of unwanted emotions. This isn’t how a perfect dream is supposed to go at all, reliving things from your past wasn’t why you entered this world in the first place! Aiden seems to understand your situation, nodding reassuringly when you muster the courage to keep walking down the hall.<br />
<br />
The further in you go, the creepier the place gets… and there you were thinking that Gothita’s humming was bad enough for your nerves! Ancient paintings line the walls, portraits of long-deceased owners of the Manor, and you can’t shake off the feeling that every single one of them is watching you with their lifeless eyes. Moans and cries can be faintly heard from time to time, belonging to whatever tortured souls weren’t fortunate enough to leave this reality after departing. The mansion feels dead, cold and unwelcoming but something – perhaps your natural affinity for Ghosts – urges you to keep going against the darkness that surrounds you at every step.<br />
<br />
It isn’t until you reach a crossroads of sorts that you’re forced to stop, and you can almost feel the shadows crawling up your legs the second you do. The corridor ends in a wall with two doors side by side! Both are identical, with no indication of where they lead or what might lie beyond… but the sounds coming from behind each of them are clearly different.<br />
From the old wooden door to your left comes the unsettling sound of something resembling a chant, a monotonic repetition of undecipherable syllables that makes you think of some sort of prayer. From the one to your right, the unmistakable sound of wings flapping rhythmically can be heard, despite being partially muffled by the wood.<br />
<br />
The path goes on and so does time. What will you do? </span></span>

<br />
<span style="color: lightblue">As Ethan continued to walk along his path, his Chimchar couldn't help but try to cheer his trainer up after what happened only moments ago. Aiden tried everything from making funny faces to trying to show off his great aerobatics skills. The best the chimp could get unfortunately was a small smile out of the trainer before the monkey decided to hang his head down in failure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be that way!&quot; Ethan said picking up his monkey into his arms, tickling him on his belly which made Aiden giggle a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm glad you care about me so much to try to make me smile, but the truth is, I'm not really that sad about my old memories, I think I'm more sad about forgetting them...I can barely remember what they look like now,&quot; Ethan said rather monotoned like, &quot;Every time I try to picture my parents I don't see their faces anymore instead I see James standing there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chim?!&quot; Aiden said sounding a bit astonished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't tell him this, but whenever I think about my past I think about when I was a kid and how it was James that taught me how to put on a tie or how I'd go about asking a girl out, anytime I'd needed advice he was there...I don't blame my parents for leaving me and but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't angry they left me on this world to fend for myself. I look back a few years and think...they'll never see me get married...or, they'll never see me raise my kids and it just gets to me...&quot; Ethan paused before sighing, &quot;Of course what happened to them wasn't in their control. Someone wanted them dead and I may never find out who or why or if, it was nothing more then an accident...I've made my piece with it, for now. But at least I'll always know that James will be by my side.&quot;<br />
<br />
The trainer and his Pokemon, now seating on his shoulder again, continue when they approach what seems to be old paintings of the deceased owners of the manor hanging along the wall. Ethan runs his fingers across the old wooden walls, hoping not to get a splint as the structure feels too real that it freaks the boy out a tad remembering that this was supposed to be nothing more then a dream.<br />
<br />
Ethan's heart begins to race as voices of moaning and cries of despair could be heard from somewhere along the manor. He looks at his monkey before they both nod in unison, both agreeing to get the hell out of there!<br />
<br />
Feeling like they are being watched Aiden makes the mistake of looking back, only to find the eyes of the paintings follow them out.<br />
<br />
They reach a fork in the road, with two doors, both seemingly similar in many ways, except the sounds that come from within are very different from each other.<br />
<br />
One door, the one on the left, sounds like a voice of some kind praying. While the other one, the one on the right, sounds like muffled wings flapping in the air.<br />
<br />
Ethan couldn't help but think his mind is trying to tell him something. If he recalled correctly the Pokemon he saw in his vision were all Pokemon that could fly. Excluding the automatic, it's evolution could theoretically fly. <br />
<br />
The trainer wasn't afraid of heights however, he had been in the clouds before with the help of his Garchomp, gliding instead of flying. But for some reason the trainer could never find a suitable partner to allow him the pleasure of flight.<br />
<br />
As for the other door, he's biological father was a very religious man. Ethan often questioned the reason for his pursuit of the ancient Arceus Plates was because of this reason.<br />
<br />
Now he was faced with two doors that seemed to represent his own conflicts. Maybe he would be able to resolve one of them? Both? Or none at all...<br />
<br />
Ethan reached for the knob, his Chimchar nervously awaiting for what it was that unconsciously lead them here as they both prepared to enter the door on the right hand side.</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>: <i>[2:00 am]</i></b> “Cuteness” apparently doesn’t register all too well in Stewie’s mental dictionary, but he humors anyway, if only to get it over with. He has places to be, stuff to do and skills to attain, and stopping to play with the sun-loving Sunkern hinders <i>all</i> of those.<br />
<br />
Part of you wants to stay. The sun is warm and inviting, and the Sunkern itself seems to enjoy your company; but you know what you came here to do, and dreams don’t last forever. As much as you’d like to take it easy, the path ahead beckons, and time is of the essence. When you wake up, you don’t want to have any regrets.<br />
The sunflower seed seems to understand and continues its leisurely sunbath, while you and Stewie walk out of the clearing and back into the thick of the woods. The road keeps going practically in a straight line, with flower and berry bushes on each side, but after what feels like a long time of uneventful strolling, the path splits into two.<br />
<br />
The left branch of the road is blocked by a huge tree trunk, the ground around it covered in leaves and crushed petals; the soft cries of a creature can be heard nearby, perhaps a Pokemon stuck under the log or one trying to make it past the obstacle effortlessly – you can’t tell from where you stand. The right side of the path is unimpeded, and stretches deeper into the forest; in the distance, you spot a small quadruped skitter away from your field of vision.<br />
You must make a choice – whether to try and overcome the obstacle to your left, or keep walking the road to your right. You can almost feel Stewie’s red eyes burning a hole in the back of your head while you struggle to decide…<br />
<br />
The path goes on and so does time. What will you do? </span><br />

<b><u>Spooky Manor</u></b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Electric Blue Eye</u>: <i>[2:00 am]</i> </b> Each of the two doors calls out to you in their own way. Memories of your father’s religious inclinations surface upon listening to the eerie prayer coming from whatever lies beyond the door to the left, whereas your own visions upon entering the Dream World come back to you at the sound of wings flapping behind the door to your right. Both choices seem just as fitting, but your resolve in living this dream your own way lead you to choose the right-hand path, drawn to the rhythmic beating of wings on air…<br />
<br />
The handle turns and the door opens effortlessly, a loud creaking noise accompanying as you push it. Before you is a poorly-lit room, relatively small compared to the hall you just crossed; there’s a small bed in the corner and absolutely nothing else in this depressing scenario… save for a small creature flying around and bumping against the walls as if blind, likely due to the lack of space to maneuver properly. When you recalled the creatures you saw crossing the Rainbow Bridge, two came to mind when you listened to the sound of wings flapping, since both were Flying-Type – but now you realize it could never had been either of them. Drifloon has no wings at all, moving around by floating in the wind; and this dreaded nightmare mansion is no proper home for regular Pokemon, suitable only for those already dead or otherwise supernaturally inclined – this Spooky Manor isn’t a place where you’d find a Rufflet to begin with. No, instead the Pokemon cramped up in the tiny room turns out to be a

<br />
Aiden looks at the Psychic-Type, unsure of what to do about it, then turns to you for answers. There is indeed another door on the far wall, standing no more than five feet away from where you stand. You can try to get Woobat’s attention, proceed deeper into the dungeon or turn back and try the left door instead…<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>: <i>[2:00 am]</i></b> “Cuteness” apparently doesn’t register all too well in Stewie’s mental dictionary, but he humors anyway, if only to get it over with. He has places to be, stuff to do and skills to attain, and stopping to play with the sun-loving Sunkern hinders <i>all</i> of those.<br />
<br />
Part of you wants to stay. The sun is warm and inviting, and the Sunkern itself seems to enjoy your company; but you know what you came here to do, and dreams don’t last forever. As much as you’d like to take it easy, the path ahead beckons, and time is of the essence. When you wake up, you don’t want to have any regrets.<br />
The sunflower seed seems to understand and continues its leisurely sunbath, while you and Stewie walk out of the clearing and back into the thick of the woods. The road keeps going practically in a straight line, with flower and berry bushes on each side, but after what feels like a long time of uneventful strolling, the path splits into two.<br />
<br />
The left branch of the road is blocked by a huge tree trunk, the ground around it covered in leaves and crushed petals; the soft cries of a creature can be heard nearby, perhaps a Pokemon stuck under the log or one trying to make it past the obstacle effortlessly – you can’t tell from where you stand. The right side of the path is unimpeded, and stretches deeper into the forest; in the distance, you spot a small quadruped skitter away from your field of vision.<br />
You must make a choice – whether to try and overcome the obstacle to your left, or keep walking the road to your right. You can almost feel Stewie’s red eyes burning a hole in the back of your head while you struggle to decide…<br />
<br />
The path goes on and so does time. What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: lightblue"><span style="font-size: 9px">Sunkern seemed pretty understanding about Keith's reasoning for not staying behind, and continued to bask in the sun. Keith, meanwhile, continued onward with Stewie following impatiently behind. As they ventured back into the thick forest, they followed a path which led in a nearly straight line, lined on either side with bushes of all sorts. It was pretty nice to look at, too, Keith noted. Still, though, after some time passed, Keith registered the notion that nothing was happening.<br />
<br />
And then, just as this thought to occur to him, they happened upon a fork in the road. Well, what was intended to be a fork in the road, anyway- the left path was obscured by a fallen tree trunk, absolutely enormous, the surrounding land buried beneath leaves and petals. And what was more, Keith could hear soft Pokémon cries nearby, though he couldn't spot the source. Was there something just behind the log... or, Arceus forbid, <i>beneath</i> it? The right path was completely clear, leading further into the forest, but as Keith looked, he could spot something small with four legs in the distance, running away from his field of vision.<br />
<br />
Stewie did not notice this, however; he was too busy glaring at Keith, as though trying to psychically will him to pick a freaking path already. Mainly because he was trying to psychically will him to pick a freaking path already. Keith glanced back and forth between the two paths- the one on the left would take some effort to get past, but there was also the matter of the unidentified Pokémon that was possibly behind or under the fallen tree. On the other hand, the path on the right would take no effort whatsoever, and he also found himself curious as to the identity of that four-legged creature that ran down the path. Either way, he realized, only one of his questions would be answered, no matter which path he chose. And while he felt worried about the possibility of the tree trapping the Pokémon-<br />
<br />
&quot;Ledian led led Ledian ian led Ledian!&quot; Stewie burst out, his impatience getting the better of him. If the hat man wasn't gonna make up his damn mind, then Stewie was going to make it up for him! The Shadow Ledian started shoving Keith down the unimpeded path.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha- hey- ow- what- Stewie, quit it!&quot; Keith exclaimed, as he was forcibly walked down the path. &quot;OK, I get it, I'll make up my mind!&quot;<br />
<br />
Stewie stopped shoving Keith, and folded his two sets of arms. &quot;Ledi...&quot; he replied.<br />
<br />
Keith sighed- he knew if he didn't make his decision in the next three seconds, Stewie would make the decision for him. &quot;OK, fine, we're already a little ways down this one, might as well go with it,&quot; he said. With that, they continued down the clear, unblocked path, though to be perfectly honest, Keith was starting to lean towards this one in any case. He hadn't had any time whatsoever to recognize the creature he had seen, he didn't even know whether it was something he recognized or not. Either way, he found himself wanting to find out.</span></span><br />

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: lightblue">It had been a long and uneventful day in Fizzytopia as a young Lass Trainer that went by the name, Liza, was currently packing up her things into her bag, getting ready for bed.<br />
<br />
Beside the girl was her Vulpix, Roxy. A rather bored expression rested on the little fox's face as she waited for the nightly routine her trainer was used to. Showering, getting dressed then drying and brushing her hair, brushing her teeth, putting her contacts away before finally drifting off to dreamland.<br />
<br />
When the fox first had decided to leave her royal life behind to travel with her new trainer, Roxy had expected there would be more 'adventure' in traveling.<br />
<br />
The fox yawned loudly, causing the trainer to turn around and take notice in her own Pokemon's condition.<br />
<br />
“Bored?” Liza asked her Pokemon who simply nodded back at her, yes, she was.<br />
<br />
“Well, I was thinking...” the Lass Trainer said, “If you wouldn't mind going on a trip with me? Just the two of us? I know you've been training very hard, and that it can be boring when you never put it into practice...so how about we go somewhere very special?”<br />
<br />
This indeed perked the little fox's interest, causing the Vulpix to straighten up and wag her six tails happily before jumping up and down on the Pokemon Center bed, barking enthusiastically. <br />
<br />
“Hehe,” Liza giggled, &quot;Okay! But not so loud! Don't want to wake up everyone else in the building,” she said, before tapping at the bed so the Vulpix would seat next to her. <br />
<br />
“This place we are going isn't outside, this place is only accessible in our dreams.” The trainer continued to say before digging into her bag and coming out with a sack full of powder. <a href="http://bmgf.bulbagarden.net/f231/poka-mart-172029/index2.html#post5511805" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fbmgf.bulbagarden.net%2Ff231%2Fpoka-mart-172029%2Findex2.html%23post5511805&amp;hash=4763189fea7f4bcf1a926eeed6eed97c" rel="nofollow noopener">Dream Dust</a>...<br />
<br />
“Vul?” The fox titled her head.<br />
<br />
“It's a way for us to share our dreams and go into this wonderful place. I heard lots of rumors floating around about it and figured we should at least give it a try.”<br />
<br />
The fox seemed unsure at first, part of her thought her trainer was out of her mind. But it was better then just doing nothing...“Vulpix!” Roxy barked, deciding to give it a try!<br />
<br />
“Okay,” the trainer said turning off the lights with only the moon providing some light. “I just sprinkle this on us like so...” Liza said yawning a tad, “and sooner or later we will be...” at the same time as Liza was nodding off, her Vulpix was finding it incredible difficult to keep her eye lids from closing and before they both knew it, they had both knocked out!<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center">~*~*~&#8203;</div><br />
As Liza slept she would at times get images floating in her head, one of them was a vision of her swimming in a giant pool in the shape of her home town’s gym’s badge, the Cascade badge. In her dreams she was playing in the water with three Pokemon, all of them she had recognized...The first one was of a giant round Pokemon that could ferry her anywhere on water, <b>Wailmer</b>. The second was a Pokemon she had at one time in her career owned, and one she had regretted trading away only so she could get a Pokemon she <i>really</i> wanted even more...this one was a <b>Spheal</b>. The last one, though not round like the others was similar to the one before it, this was a <b>Seel</b>...<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center">~*~*~&#8203;</div><br />
When Roxy opened her eyes she noticed her trainer sleeping next to her, and found herself a little disappointed that the magic powder didn't work, that was until she took a better look and saw that they were outside...but not just outside, on a floating piece of rock high above in the clouds!<br />
<br />
Not understanding what was happening the Vulpix barked and nudged her trainer to wake up, “Huh? Uh, I'm awake!” Liza snapped out of her dream induced coma before coming to realize, “Where are we?!” That she was no longer in her comfy Pokemon Center bed, “Is this the place?” She wondered, “The place where dreams come true?”<br />
<br />
“Vulpix!~” Roxy leaped and jumped for joy.<br />
<br />
“Isn't it beautiful,” her trainer looked out at the scenery. “Hey,” she said getting up, “I wonder what's over there...” Liza pointed to an island in the sky. “I wonder if we can get across...I'd love to explore there!” <br />
<br />
It was as if the dream they had been experiencing so far had heeded her call, and soon a rainbow road connected the islands together making it possible to cross...trainer and Pokemon looked at each other warily, before smiling and giggling.<br />
<br />
Carefully Liza stepped on the bridge, trying to see if it was stable enough to stand on. When she found it was she called out to her Pokemon and together they walked over waiting to see what other interesting things this place held for them.<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>: <i>[3:00 am]</i></b> This is all a dream, right? It’s not like Pokemon are real and can actually get hurt, can they? The question goes unanswered since you choose to take the open path to the right, looking to chase after the four-legged creature you think you spotted. Behind stay the blocked road, the massive trunk and the cries of another Pokemon…<br />
<br />
Stewie doesn’t seem the least bit fazed by your decision, but the further you walk down the right-hand path, the stranger your surroundings get – trees fall with a loud thud through the corner of your eyes, shortly followed by the cries of wildlife crushed beneath them; but when you turn your head to look, everything looks perfectly fine with the forest around you. Your mind’s playing tricks on you, taunting you with the uncertainty of having made the wrong call. After all, dreams are fickle things, as are the minds of the dreamers themselves…<br />
<br />
It takes a fair bit of walking (and no short amount of fleeting illusions of collapsing tress along the way) before anything actually happens. The flora begins to change, age-old barks replaced by tall, slender bushes filled to the brim with Berries unlike any you’ve ever seen – yet another product of your imagination. The grass ahead seems to have been stepped on just recently by a creature with small feet and not a lot of weight; the path it took is linear and ends right in front of one of these bushes. While at first you see no living creatures in the vicinity, a Pokemon slowly emerges from behind the vegetation with a half-scared, half-pleading expression. It’s a light blue quadruped with small spikes protruding from its back, and the way it looks up at the out-of-reach Berries leaves little room for doubt: the

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>: <i>[3:00 am]</i></b> This is all a dream, right? It’s not like Pokemon are real and can actually get hurt, can they? The question goes unanswered since you choose to take the open path to the right, looking to chase after the four-legged creature you think you spotted. Behind stay the blocked road, the massive trunk and the cries of another Pokemon…<br />
<br />
Stewie doesn’t seem the least bit fazed by your decision, but the further you walk down the right-hand path, the stranger your surroundings get – trees fall with a loud thud through the corner of your eyes, shortly followed by the cries of wildlife crushed beneath them; but when you turn your head to look, everything looks perfectly fine with the forest around you. Your mind’s playing tricks on you, taunting you with the uncertainty of having made the wrong call. After all, dreams are fickle things, as are the minds of the dreamers themselves…<br />
<br />
It takes a fair bit of walking (and no short amount of fleeting illusions of collapsing tress along the way) before anything actually happens. The flora begins to change, age-old barks replaced by tall, slender bushes filled to the brim with Berries unlike any you’ve ever seen – yet another product of your imagination. The grass ahead seems to have been stepped on just recently by a creature with small feet and not a lot of weight; the path it took is linear and ends right in front of one of these bushes. While at first you see no living creatures in the vicinity, a Pokemon slowly emerges from behind the vegetation with a half-scared, half-pleading expression. It’s a light blue quadruped with small spikes protruding from its back, and the way it looks up at the out-of-reach Berries leaves little room for doubt: the

</blockquote><span style="color: lightblue"><span style="font-size: 9px">Keith tried to push the path he hadn't taken out of his mind as he ventured down the path he had taken, but it wasn't easy. At first, things seemed relatively normal, but then, the surrounding scenery changed, and very strangely, too. Out of the corner of his eye, Keith spotted a tree falling to the ground, followed by a loud thud, accompanied by the pained cries of whatever was unfortunate enough to be in the tree's way. &quot;Wah?!&quot; Keith exclaimed, as he wheeled around to face... nothing? What the- but the tree was- but it-<br />
<br />
&quot;Led!&quot; snapped Stewie. He had followed Keith's gaze initially, but upon failing to spot anything out of the ordinary, now he was getting impatient again. This, nevertheless, snapped Keith out of it, and he continued walking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Stewie,&quot; he murmured. &quot;I could've sworn that a tree had fallen just there- WHAT THE-&quot; he exclaimed, now turning to his left, where he was sure a tree had just fallen and crushed something. But again, when he looked at it properly, he could see no fallen tree.<br />
<br />
Stewie rolled his piercing red eyes and resisted the urge to start firing attacks at his easily-distracted Trainer. The fool was seeing things- that's all they needed, some stupid illusions that only the hat man could see, making him stop and wheel around every two seconds. However, Keith started moving again, and though he seemed to flinch every so often at what he thought to be a falling tree just outside his field of vision, he was starting to be less and less distracted with each passing one.<br />
<br />
&quot;...I gotta stay focused,&quot; Keith was murmuring to himself. &quot;It's a dream, after all. Anything can happen in dreams.&quot; This thought seemed to calm him down, and though he still turned his head each and every time he thought he could see and hear a falling tree, he no longer stopped in his tracks for each one.<br />
<br />
A fair amount of walking (and a decidedly unfair amount of arboreal illusions) later, the surroundings began to change. The trees became very tall, slender bushes, each of them sprouting multitudes of berries unlike anything Keith had ever seen in his life. Either these were some new variety, or, far more likely, a mere product of Keith's imagination. And then, just as he noted that the grass ahead of him seemed to have been walked upon by a lightweight creature of small stature, he spotted a small Pokémon emerging from the bushes, the look on its face simultaneously scared and pleading. And as Keith spotted it, his eyes lit up with a familiar gleam- it was a Pokémon, a Nidoran, and not just any Nidoran, but a female Nidoran. One of the few, if not only, varieties of Poison-type Pokémon he had yet to own- and one of the three Pokémon he had had a vision of upon his arrival in the Dream World, for that matter! Keith dug out his Pokédex and held it out at the Nidoran<img class="smilie smilie--emoji" alt="♀" title="Female sign    :female_sign:" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/joypixels/emoji-assets@5.0/png/64/2640.png" data-shortname=":female_sign:" />.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nidoran, a Poison Pin Pokémon,&quot; droned the device. &quot;The female's horns are smaller than the male's, but are still extremely poisonous. This specimen's Ability is Hustle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stewie, meanwhile, was looking at Keith- the excitement on the Poison-type Trainer's face was unmistakable, and Stewie had a grim feeling that this would hardly be the last they'd see of that Nidoran if the hat man had his way.<br />
<br />
Keith, however, noticed the look Stewie was giving him, and turned to face the Shadow Ledian, a stern look on his face. &quot;I meant what I said,&quot; he whispered to the Shadow Ledian. &quot;You getting your Hidden Ability depends on your behavior. If you chase the Nidoran away, I will not let you get Iron Fist. If you don't, you at least have a chance.&quot; Stewie stared back at Keith, his expression unreadable. Finally, he gave a curt nod. He'd hold back- for now, anyway. He'd see how this would play out, mainly because he knew full well that Keith would simply stall things out until he woke up if it had to come to that. If there was one thing Stewie was certain of, it's that his Trainer was a very stubborn man. If he decided that Stewie wasn't going to get his Hidden Ability, then Stewie wasn't going to get his Hidden Ability. He wasn't liking the odds of having to compete with a friggin' Poison-type, and one that the hat man had yet to own, at that, but he figured a 50% chance still beat a 0% chance.<br />
<br />
Satisfied with this, Keith knelt down beside the bush. Being decidedly taller than a female Nidoran, he was able to pick berries off the bush with no trouble. Once he got a decent amount, he lowered them down to the ground beside the Nidoran<img class="smilie smilie--emoji" alt="♀" title="Female sign    :female_sign:" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/joypixels/emoji-assets@5.0/png/64/2640.png" data-shortname=":female_sign:" />. &quot;Here you go,&quot; he smiled.</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Missingno. Master</u>: <i>[4:00 am]</i></b> The Nidoran takes a step back when you approach her, wary but not frightened enough to run. She's willing to give you the benefit of the doubt which, perhaps not the wisest thing to do as far as survival instinct is concerned, certainly reveals something about her character.<br />
You reach for the Berries she could not, picking a handful and dropping them gently on the floor in fron tof the Poison-Type. Other Trainers might have been afraid to approach a venomous animal without proper protection, but you've been around them for years and know there's little to worry about; besides, this Nidoran doesn't seem to have the tiniest inclination for violence.<br />
<br />
The rabbit-like Pokemon looks on while you lay down her meal on the floor. She stares at the stash in obvious disbelief; while she seemed helpless just now, she probably didn't expect to <i>actually</i> get help from a human - but then again, this being your dream, how many humans has the Nidoran actually met before? If she's a product of your own imagination, can you say she &quot;existed&quot; before? Does she have an age, or is she only as old as this dream?<br />
<br />
Stewie seems like he couldn't disagree more with your approach. Stopping to help a random little creature who can't even look after herself is a colossal waste of time when you should be getting to the end of the Pleasant Forest and giving him the Hidden Ability he so desperately craves; what happens if you wake up midway? Absolutely <i>nothing</i>! Still, proper behavior being your starting condition, he doesn't actually do anything other than hover around you impatiently, although you have a pretty good idea what he'd <i>like</i> to do if you let him...<br />
<br />
Nidoran picks up as many Berries as she can (surprisingly, all of them) and suddenly runs away, disappearing behind a nearby bush. Stewie seems greatly pleased that the nuisance is gone, and prepares to push you down the path again... until the little Poison-Type resurfaces holding two Berries, approaches you shyly and drops the offering at your feet - one for you, and one for the Shadow Ledian!<br />
<br />
The path goes on and so does time. What do you do?</span><br />
