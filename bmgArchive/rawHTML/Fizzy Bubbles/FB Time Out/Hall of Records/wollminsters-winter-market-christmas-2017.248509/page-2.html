</blockquote><span style="color: Lightblue">Mélina was tired. Very much so. She had quite a difficult year, full of turmoils in her life, bad and good, but all draining. Job instability, quitting said job, take on Pokémon journey, open a boutique, travelling, base-building… She was completely out of energy. Also… despite being surrounded with Pokémon, from old friends to new, she couldn’t help feeling a little lonely, being out on her own, away from home, for so long. She didn’t know where to go, besides spending yet another boring day playing on her cell phone behind her boutique’s counter, and another boring night sleeping in the little mattress she left in the storage room…<br />
<br />
Glitch wanted nothing of this for her. More than anyone, it knew what she has and was going through. It may be just a Pokémon, but it wasn’t <i>any</i> Pokémon: it was her starter, and an Arceus-damn Porygon. And it was going to give her a mini-vacation for the holidays.<br />
<br />
<br />
One morning, about a week before Christmas, Mélina received at the boutique a pretty thick letter addressed to her. She scratched her head as she wondered what it could be. As she opened the envelope, an eyebrow raised as much as the questions in her thoughts.<br />
<br />
“A trip to... Wollminster?” she read and wondered aloud.<br />
<br />
It included a pamphlet detailing some Christmas celebrations offered there… and a letter congratulating her for winning an all-included train trip for the duration of the holidays.<br />
<br />
“I never signed up for such a contest… Smells like a scam to me.” she walked right by the recycling bin and just about to throw everything in it when she got interrupted by her phone’s alarm, startling her.<br />
<br />
“Noooooooooooooo don’t throw it away!” the phone’s text-to-speech said.<br />
<br />
Mélina paused for a moment, before putting her hands on her hips with a scorn on her face. “Glitch, what did you do, this time?”<br />
<br />
“I swear that I didn’t spend a single dollar!” the Porygon continued to communicate through its trainer’s device. “Not even with someone else’s credit card info! And it is totally not my fault that the contest’s randomisation system really, really sucked. Especially with their security.”<br />
<br />
She groaned then facepalmed. “What are you getting me into this time...”<br />
<br />
“Aw come on, I’m just giving you a little nudge so you can take a freakin’ vacation. You need a break, and you’re gonna take it. Doctor’s orders. Besides, I just know for a fact that you want to do something for the holidays. Or at least do something other than rot in here.”<br />
<br />
“...Yeah, I do,” the woman sighed, admitting defeat. “Did it really need to involve controlling the results of a contest for this? Next time you could’ve just suggested me to go.”<br />
<br />
“If I didn’t, you wouldn’t want to go, because the travelling there is either expensive or slow and cold.”<br />
<br />
“...Touché.”<br />
<br />
“So are you going to this free thing I worked on to get you or not!?”<br />
<br />
“Yes yes, I’ll be going. Just promise me that we’re not gonna get in trouble with what you did.”<br />
<br />
“I swear it won’t!”<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
Mélina may not admit it to Glitch, but its idea perhaps one of the best that he ever did for a while. (Even though it did have a few implications she didn’t agree on.) That train trip was luxurious; something she could only dreamed of. The bed was comfortable, the food was delicious, the view on that panoramic room was beautiful, and she was treated like a queen by the staff. There was even a Pokémon sitter of sorts so they could have a bit of the treatment too. She enjoyed her time so much that she didn’t want to leave… but she had to as the train arrived to its destination: the far-off town of Wollminster.<br />
<br />
When she arrived, she couldn’t help but feel a little nostalgic from the weather and the decorations: it felt a lot like like home. A bit too much, perhaps, because her laziness crept up on her again. But she really didn’t want to miss out on the festivities. So she pulled up the scheduling pamphlet to try and find some events that would be simple and comfortable to do.<br />
<br />
“Entertainment Exhibitions... ” she mumbled to herself aloud. “Starlette would love that but nah, don’t feel like getting on stage… Merchant’s Market? I’m curious, but ugh, I hate shopping, especially at this time of the year.”<br />
<br />
She did a double-take as she read the third event. “Food? By the best cooks of the area? Oh my Mew.” While already salivating just from reading the description, Mélina grabbed a highlighter and circled at least a couple of times “<b>Snacky Stalls</b>” on the paper.<br />
<br />
“Trim-a-Tree… Decorating trees is fun, and Catalina could make a good Christmas star tree...” she giggled, “but meh. Feels like too much trouble.”<br />
<br />
“<b>Sweet Stockings</b>, on the other hand… I love the sound of that. More food with a side of Tapu Cocoa, all in the comfort of a home warmed up by a fireplace. I’m aaaall in.” Just like the cooking competition, she marked it as a must-see.<br />
<br />
Looking over the last event though, she did a bit of a disgusted face. Going door-to-door in the cold to sing to strangers does not sound like a good time. Anyhow, she have a feeling she won’t have enough time to go to any more events.<br />
<br />
So with that, Mélina headed to the Snacky Stalls, hoping her stomach was empty enough to sample every single dish it had - and have plenty of room for dessert afterwards.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
OOC: If it wasn't clear enough (or just want a TL;DR), choosing <b><u>Snacky Stalls and Sweet Stockings</u></b> as the events Mélina is attending.</div>

</blockquote>The festival was in full swing when Schala arrived. Several of her Pokemon were in tow, including Apate and Airmid. Uttu lounged on her new favorite perch and their newest addition to the team, Ager, a Mudbray. While Schala had wanted to explore a bit, Airmid had overheard that you could decorate an Abomasnow at the Trim-a-Tree area. Schala hurried after the Shroomish before she lost sight of her. <i>How does she move so quickly! </i>Ager followed behind at a more sedate pace.<br />
<br />
Apate floated above everyone, complete with what Schala had dubbed a ‘Santa Sack’ and a haphazardly attached santa hat. (Schala had gone through all of her gifts beforehand, just in case. The present containing fake Spinarak hadn’t made the cut, unfortunately.) The Pumpkaboo watched the mass of people enjoying the festivities. Her eyes met those of a white Vulpix peeking over the shoulder of her trainer as they leaned over to look at the wares of a booth. The Vulpix’s wide eyes drew her in, and she descended quickly to attach a bow festooned with holly to the Vulpix’s ear, before speeding after her disappearing trainer and teammates.<br />
<br />
She caught up just as Airmid arrived at the tree decorating area. The Shroomish made a beeline for the largest Abomasnow she could find. Schala watched a bit helplessly, and looked longingly at the large amount of other, less angry looking trees. Somehow, she figured the excitable Shroomish didn’t quite get the point of ‘tree decorating’.<br />
<br />
In fact, said Shroomish was currently in a staring contest with her chosen tree. She held a garland, made of white and red Amaryllis to be more Holiday themed, up imperiously. The Abomasnow stared back impassively, and made no move to take it, or even bend down to make it easier for her to place it on him.<br />
<br />
Schala approached, and reached out to break the stalemate by lifting Airmid into reach. But Airmid grunted and shuffled forward, thrusting the garland clutched in her tiny arms towards the Abomasnow with a decisive “Shroom”.<br />
<br />
The Abomasnow remained unmoving. Apate floated past with a giggle, but also made no move to help.<br />
<br />
“Airmid--” Schala began nervously. The Shroomish was starting to puff up a bit, and Schala had seen first hand how badly she took anyone refusing her gifts.<br />
<br />
The trainer was cut off as Airmid started to glow. Her form grew taller, and then when the light faded she stood tall as a Breloom. The Abomasnow looked surprised, but Airmid didn’t waste any time. With her new height, and her stretching arms, she quickly placed the garland onto the the Abomasnow’s head. She leaned back, triumphant.<br />
<br />
“Did you really just evolve so you could be <i>taller</i>?” Schala asked, aghast. Apate hovered closer to get a better look at Airmid’s new form. Unrepentant, the newly evolved Pokemon, quickly looked for a new target.<br />
<br />
“Woah, you can’t just go ‘decorate’ all of the trees and people.” Schala was quick to stop her before she got them all in trouble.<br />
<br />
With one potential disaster averted, Schala explained the point of tree decorating. Apate immediately sped off to look at the various ornaments and other provided tools at their disposal, while Airmid examined her stash of presents. She couldn’t decorate their <s>victim</s> tree with only garlands, so she’d have to construct some things from scratch.<br />
<br />
Uttu, meanwhile, had decided to give her own brand of help. Using <b>Magnet Rise</b> to lift herself off of Ager's head, the little Joltik used her <b>String Shot</b> and <b>Spider Web</b> to cover the Abomasnow with drapes of silk. While they weren’t colorful, the pattern of the web was rather nice (in Schala’s opinion, at least), and it offered plenty of extra places to hang decorations from. Apate wasted no time taking advantage of them, hanging a few lighter ornaments from them--little sparkling baubles and gingerbread shapes. Schala took a few from her to place on, though she was still a bit wary of the Abomasnow, it seemed dedicated to playing the role of a Christmas tree, even if it didn’t look particularly happy about it.<br />
<br />
As Schala and Apate worked to hang ornaments and then a few Christmas lights, Airmid put the finishing touches on the ‘star’ for the top of their tree. Constructed of bright red Poinsettia’s arranged with a wreath of Holly as a base to act as a crown, the tree topper was set carefully on top of the Abomasnow’s head, ringed by the earlier garland.<br />
<br />
The group stepped back a bit to take in the sight, as Ager offered Uttu (who had just returned to his head) the plug for the lights. With a bit of electricity, everything was complete.<br />
<br />
“Great job, everyone!” Schala said, enchanted. It was a bit of a tense start, but the decorations had turned out wonderful.<br />
<br />
___________________<br />
<br />
“I did say we would need to get you a real scarf.” A Liepard commented to her trainer as they walked the Merchant's Market. Eskil carried the newest addition, Beira, in his arms. The Alolan Vulpix had quickly discovered the effectiveness of doe-eyes. Or in this case, <b>Baby-Doll Eyes</b>, and had been using them to manipulate everyone around her as much as possible. Even Arwan wasn’t immune, and he couldn’t even <i>see</i>.<br />
<br />
The trio walked the stalls, looking for scarves, but also anything else that looked interesting. Eskil had some presents already, (including a Razor Claw for Khione that was sitting in his pack until he found a good time to give it to her), and so he was primarily looking for gifts for Beira and Nyx.<br />
<br />
He stopped at a stall with some unique looking pieces of jewelry, though he doubted either of them were particularly interested. He and Nyx leaned over the stall for a better look, while Beira looked over his shoulder, disinterested. The pieces were nice, but Nyx indicated she wasn’t interested, and so the pair moved on.<br />
<br />
As he shifted Beira in his grip, he noticed a new addition on her head. He was certain that the bow decorated with holly attached to her head had not been there earlier.<br />
<br />
“Where did you get that?” He asked. She only gave him an innocent look. He stared suspiciously for a bit, but she wouldn’t have been able to steal the bow and attach it to her head without help. Someone probably gave it to her. Probably.<br />
<br />
Electing to keep a closer eye on her, just in case, he headed to the next stall. This one contained a multitude of leather items--belts, wallets, collars and more. Beira’s eyes lit up (at least more than usual), at the sight, and she leaned forward to place a paw on one particular collar. It was dyed a dark blue, and the silver snowflake charm hanging from it glinted in the surrounding lights.<br />
<br />
“That one, huh?” Eskil commented, as he freed one hand to pick it up. It did look well made, and Beira had turned the full force of her eyes on him. Not that she’d needed to. Mysterious bow notwithstanding, he had already planned on buying her something.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure? This is your only present.” A nod in response. Eskil turned to the bemused shopkeeper and inquired about the price. After hashing out the details, and ensuring that the collar fit her well, the group left the stall with their new purchase, Beira preening with her new gift. Nyx quickly spotted their next target.<br />
<br />
“This way.” She brushed past Eskil, heading towards a stall with what looked like brightly colored fabric hanging for display. Once Eskil got closer, he realized that it was actually countless scarves. He reached up to touch one, thick and dyed deep purple, almost the same shade as Nyx’s fur.<br />
<br />
“All of my scarves are made with 100% Mareep wool!” Chirped the woman behind the counter. Eskil didn’t really know the difference, but they did feel like they would be very warm.<br />
<br />
“Purple isn’t really your color,” Nyx commented bemusedly, as if she was aware of why he had focused on that particular color. She leaned up against the counter on her front legs, examining all of the options. “That one, or that one. Try them on.” She gestured to two scarves.<br />
<br />
Eskil placed Beira on the ground with an instruction to stay put (and ignored her pout), and reached for them. One was a vibrant green. The other was a royal blue. He tried both on and modeled them for Nyx.<br />
<br />
“Hmm. I like them both, but the blue matches your eyes better.” She commented. Decision made, he paid the woman, wrapped his new scarf around his neck, and retrieved Beira.<br />
<br />
Their main objective had been achieved, but he was missing a gift for Nyx, and so he continued to explore. Keeping an eye on her to see if anything caught her eye, their next stop was another jewelry stall. Nyx was eying an assortment of bangles, simple and made of different metals with various designs. She made no comment, but Eskil made a note of them. He’d stop by later if she didn’t decide on something else. The trio continued on taking in the sights and the wares.<br />
<br />

<br />

<i><span style="font-size: 12px">To Wollminster's fest, which only comes round once every year.</span></i></span>&#8203;</div><span style="color: Lightblue"> <br />
</span><br />
<div style="text-align: center"><span style="color: Lightblue"> <br />
<b><u><span style="font-size: 15px">Entertainment Exhibitions</span></u></b> <br />
<span style="font-size: 12px">An area filled with artisan’s drafts, displaying statues, portraits and other fine crafts.<br />
The most visited place here is the annual scene, a show of sorts, though nothing too obscene.<br />
Costumes aplenty donated by realtors, for you to try on and join in the theatres.<br />
It is here you will find much to be held, some which have been said to make Pokémon excel.<br />
Though to try something on, is a pact with a stagehand, to act out on set with your Pokémon in hand.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10px"><br />
</span><br />
<b><u><span style="font-size: 15px">Merchant’s Market</span></u></b> <br />
<span style="font-size: 12px">Along the thin lanes of rustic wood cabins, lie shops full of trinkets produced by men’s talents.<br />
An ocean of scents wafts through the air, as wise men from the east show off their wares.<br />
Amidst all the trifles, the sparklers and doodads, lie mysterious orbs brought by these nomads.<br />
Jewels and gems, strange rocks and glass eyes, all neatly lined up for you to ogle and buy. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10px"> <br />
</span><br />
<b><u><span style="font-size: 15px">Snacky Stalls</span></u></b> <br />
<span style="font-size: 12px">The local cuisine is too much to take in, as all the chefs in the area converge and begin.<br />
With grace and dexterity, and a tad bit of rush, the cooks cater snacks after you’ve drudged through the slush.<br />
They cook their speciality, all just for you. So take a sip and a bite as you take in the view.<br />
They each compete, or so their songs do tell, as music is played with high decibels.<br />
Plastic discs, coloured, and neatly lined up, to aid your digestion and accompany your cup.<br />
Their dish is quite hearty, it boosts many strengths, as is your Pokémon’s by the songs’ wavelengths. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10px"> <br />
</span><br />
<b><u><span style="font-size: 15px">Trim-a-Tree</span></u></b> <br />
<span style="font-size: 12px">Out by the park, trees have been gathered, all in anticipation for them to be slathered.<br />
Tinfoil and baubles are lying in wait, to be hung from a pine by a trainer and mate.<br />
There is no admission, no fee to pay, simply decorate a tree on this holiest of days.<br />
Ornaments are provided by retailers from near, all free to take, so there’s nothing to fear.<br />
When everyone’s finished and proud of their feat, the judges may pass and provide something neat.<br />
But there’s no need to fret, no reason at all, everyone’ll receive the leftover balls. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10px"> <br />
</span><br />
<b><u><span style="font-size: 15px">Sweet Stockings</span></u></b> <br />
<span style="font-size: 12px">If you’ve had enough of the cold, and need a place warm, then come on inside, away from the storm.<br />
Nestle by the fire, all proud a crackling, and enjoy Tapu Cocoa while you hear the crowds laughing.<br />
Children join in as they hang up their stocking, eagerly waiting for the Delibird’s knocking.<br />
Trainers may join, along their Pokémon friend, by the fireplace a sock that they may append.<br />
A bonding experience between buddies of gold, with sweeties delivered to both young and old.<br />
Fruit to the good and candy to the better, all will feel right in spite of the weather. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10px"> <br />
</span><br />
<b><u><span style="font-size: 15px">Christmas Carolling</span></u></b> <br />
<span style="font-size: 12px">Off to the side, you hear Christmas cheer, as a choir has gathered, though they need volunteers.<br />
Join the ensemble and go door-to-door, to invite people out and sing carols galore.<br />
Many may thank you for the songs you endow, and reward you in kindness, though who can say how.<br />
Whatever may lie in their pocket lining, is yours to keep, perhaps something shining.<br />
Gold, silver, buttons and trinkets, all may be given, as well as stale biscuits. </span><br />

<b><u><span style="font-size: 15px">Merchant’s Market</span></u></b> <br />
<span style="font-size: 12px">Along the thin lanes of rustic wood cabins, lie shops full of trinkets produced by men’s talents.<br />
An ocean of scents wafts through the air, as wise men from the east show off their wares.<br />
Amidst all the trifles, the sparklers and doodads, lie mysterious orbs brought by these nomads.<br />
Jewels and gems, strange rocks and glass eyes, all neatly lined up for you to ogle and buy. </span><br />

With grace and dexterity, and a tad bit of rush, the cooks cater snacks after you’ve drudged through the slush.<br />
They cook their speciality, all just for you. So take a sip and a bite as you take in the view.<br />
They each compete, or so their songs do tell, as music is played with high decibels.<br />
Plastic discs, coloured, and neatly lined up, to aid your digestion and accompany your cup.<br />
Their dish is quite hearty, it boosts many strengths, as is your Pokémon’s by the songs’ wavelengths.</span></span><br />&#8203;</div><br />

</blockquote><span style="color: lightblue"><span style="font-size: 9px">&quot;Brrr. Sure would like to try some of that warm Tapu Cocoa I've been hearing about right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess glanced to her comrades for confirmation, but unfortunately they didn't seem very receptive to the suggestion. Royal the Carbink merely stared blankly back at her (while Jess wondered whether he ate or drank at all, or even felt the rise and fall of temperature), and Zoom the Sandshrew seemed more preoccupied with acting petrified of all the people surrounding her, clearly not used to being in a crowd. As for the other, well...<br />
<br />
Jess glimpsed back down the busy street, where she sensed a brief shadow of movement before it darted behind a pole - although the thin column wasn't near wide enough to cover the bushel of white tails whisking about. She sighed, having hoped that this outing would prove a chance to get acquainted with some of the newest &quot;members&quot; of her team, although at least one of them was deliberately being rather uncooperative.<br />
<br />
Fortunately there was one who was more than accommodating and supportive, whom she had brought along for that very reason. Link padded alongside Zoom, encouragingly nudging the young rodent on, while their follower watched from behind her hiding spot, ducking back into darkness whenever he turned his head. Meanwhile Royal kept up quietly beside his new trainer, neither making any intonation nor expression.<br />
<br />
Since none of them seemed particularly interested in snacks at the moment, Jess decided to try a different tactic by tempting them with trinkets. Turning into the market mobile, she strolled down the lane full of dazzling distractions, as each peddler they passed vigorously hawked their wares to unwary customers. Despite the din and commotion of commerce, Zoom seemed spell-bound by the sparkling selection, and even Royal appeared intrigued by the gemstones which bore striking resemblance to himself. Out of the corner of her eye, Jess caught the kit's ears perk curiously as well, and shared a knowing smile with Link.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, how about it, guys? Up for some Christmas shopping? If you see anything you like, let me know. You each can pick out one thing and I'll buy it for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
As they strolled along the stalls, Zoom eventually stopped at a stand selling an assortment of snowglobes. Her gaze was fixated on a small sphere containing a miniature model of a modest igloo, humble and homely. Jess recognized the recent hatchling must be feeling homesick, and missing her mother - whatever happened to mysteriously remove parental presence from her life. Jess's heart softened as she asked the dealer for permission to handle his wares, before gently lifting the orb and bending down to bring it to Zoom's level.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, watch this.&quot;<br />
<br />
She shook the orb rigorously, tilting from side to side to swirl a storm of glittering flakes inside the globe, as her spectator marveled in awe at the magic raining down within the watery winter world. When the white slowly settled at last, Jess proffered the pocket planet to her amazed partner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Want to give it a try?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zoom delicately accepted the marble, flipping it upside-down and peering delightedly at the glistening grains of pearls precipitating gradually to the bottom, own beads of black shimmering with joy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you like to keep it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zoom nodded eagerly, and Jess beamed as she stood to pay for her purchase. They continued on, Zoom gingerly cradling her prize close, careful not to let it drop due to its fragility. As they traveled, Royal abruptly came to a halt before another artisan's artifact booth, with several pieces of exotic jewely on display. Prominent among them was a burnished golden crown with a star-shaped emblem in its center, albeit rather unremarkable compared to the fancy, flashy festoons adorned with a myriad of shining ornaments. Rather than rubies or diamonds though, the Carbink seemed captivated by the dull diadem. When Jess inquired about the work, the trader confessed to little knowledge about its origins either, but judging by appraisal it was possibly of Greek craftsmanship. An enigmatic circlet, circa ancient times, rumored to once belong to a race of powerful warriors. So the legends say anyway.<br />
<br />
While Jess had some doubts about the authenticity of the article, Royal nevertheless appeared charmed by the chaplet, which was a rarity unto itself. Thus she consented to fork over enough cash for the coronet, which she placed reverently atop the rock's rabbit-like ears. They merely twitched slightly in response, revealing no other reaction. Something told her the wearer was satisfied though, and he admittedly looked quite regal in it, befitting his name. Jess then revolved to Link (still keeping an eye on the one lingering behind them as well):<br />
<br />
&quot;What about you? Anything you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Poochyena paused for a bit, considering. Eventually he trotted over to another tent stocked with festive clothing such as warm, woolly stockings and sweaters, tugging at a green pointed hat - just the right size for an elf. Jess smiled as she helped him try it on, selecting a crimson cap with silver trim and a jingle bell on its end for herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you really look like Santa's little helper.&quot;<br />
<br />
She declared with a chuckle, admiring themselves in the mirror provided. (While a part of her was tempted to add a scarlet scarf to complement the ensemble, her personal reservations prevented her from physically sporting such items close to her neckline.) As her headgear rang merrily with laughter, she detected a stir as the straggler finally stepped out from behind the screen to investigate the source of the sound, enchanted by the chime. Jess grinned at the Alolan Vulpix, glad she had finally decided to join them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Makoto. Would you like something as well? Go on, feel free to choose whatever catches your eye.&quot;<br />
<br />
Makoto wavered, but then boldly marched up to a rack of accessories, pulling off a plain red ribbon with a pair of bronze bells attached.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're sure?&quot; Jess blinked in surprise. &quot;You just want that? You don't want something better?&quot;<br />
<br />
The fox dipped her chin, ringing the string in the process and producing a clear, pleasant note. Thus Jess amiably agreed and knelt down to assist with wrapping the collar around her new friend's snowy scruff in a neat bow (almost simulating a present herself), petting her coat proudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, now that we've all got our gifts, what do you guys say to some food now?&quot;<br />
<br />
This time the chorus resounded with concurrence, and so they trekked back towards the direction of delicious aromas wafting through the air. When they arrived, most of their mouths were already watering from the smells, having worked up an appetite from all the walking (well, aside from Royal anyway).<br />
<br />
&quot;So many different options to choose from...&quot; Jess gaped at the extensive menu, inflated with deluxe dishes. &quot;Anything you guys want to try first?&quot;<br />
<br />
Link lifted his snout, sniffing his way to a vendor who specialized in steamed meat buns. Makoto trailed after him, drooling visibly from the delectable scent. Jess took that as a sign of approval and so procured a pack of baked pastries for the two to share. As soon as Makoto bit into the soft, fluffy shell and her tongue met with the succulent filling inside, her blue eyes brightened and she wolfed down as many as she could alongside her wolven companion, who upon reaching the last roll obligingly offered it to her, resulting in a pink tinge against pallid fur as she blushed furiously, which she attempted to conceal with her fan-like appendages.<br />
<br />
Suppressing a snicker with her own sleeve, Jess swiveled to her other two comrades. She spotted Zoom eyeing another sign with what appeared to be brown Magikarp painted on it, which turned out to be an advertisement for said fish-shaped red bean cakes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I think those are called taiyaki. They're filled with a sweet paste, kinda like moon cakes. I've always wanted to try one myself, want to join me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zoom indicated affirmation, and so she obtained a couple of the karps, handing one to the shrew as she cheerfully dug in, smearing cherry across her cheeks. Jess giggled and retrieved a napkin to wipe the mess, before rotating to Royal.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about you? Do you, um, wish to eat anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Carbink cocked his head, processing the question. Finally, he floated over to - of all things - an ice cream machine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh? Really? Are you sure?&quot;<br />
<br />
A silent, yet positive feedback. And so despite feeling somewhat nonplussed, Jess scooped some vanilla into a cup (determining a cone would probably prove too difficult for the limbless stone to handle) and set it down for him to consume. To her astonishment, he scarfed down the sundae without problem, and dare she say - seemed to thoroughly enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Smiling to see everyone satiated with their meals, Jess wandered over to treat herself to a mug of famed Tapu Cocoa at last, which she sipped contentedly as she nibbled on her own dessert, sitting next to her pals as they listened to the music and mirth around them in bliss; observing as Makoto entertained by jangling in time to the melody's rhythm and Link howled in tune to the lyrics. Zoom clapped along in glee, and while Royal still made no noise, he seemed to bob a bit with the beat. Happy and harmonic, ready to welcome the holiday and toll in the new year - together.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: #4dffff">While Lillian remained deep in her slumber, the crowd amidst them was growing in number.<br />
But little did the petite woman know, an angry god was to deliver a blow.<br />
For his Pokémon he would take revenge; that poor, fuzzy, dark-green Ekans.<br />
The silver-haired girl pulled herself away, <i>“eww, you stink”</i> she said with dismay.<br />
Green fur started sprouting from your finger’s tips, growing in size until it reached your lips.<br />
Lillian wanted to scream but she could only screech, a devilish squeal like that of a leech.<br />
Her fur became sticky as it grew all over, a dirty colour of a very sick clover.<br />
Her heart shrank as it became three sizes too small, her breath a stench of foul methanol.<br />
And all the kids cried, and all the kids flinched, in fear of that creature known as the Grinch.<br />
<br />
You woke up in tears and you woke up in sweats, a monster you had become with deepest regrets.<br />
But Remilia calms you from that foul affair, ensuring you it was only a nightmare.<br />
But deep in your mind you hear a cackling laugh, the god of vengeance clearly made this gaffe.<br />
Next time perhaps be a little bit wary, but for now enjoy your Gummis and Cheri.<br />
The Delibird had come and had given you each, some berries and candies to make a sweet feast.<br />
Remilia searches amongst her gown of silk thread; embroidered in gold with a beautiful red:<br />
Your precious gifts, something well-known; six beautiful gems and a single Damp Stone</span></span><br />

With a little help from his pall Zyll of course, the people gifted him with food of force.<br />

Stahl came a knocking with Berg in his grip; the Alolan Sandshrew who gave you the slip.<br />
He wanted nothing of you, his kidnapper of woe, the one who had taken him away from the snow.<br />
But the Ice-type’s cold heart melted in sight, of your warm and kind words on this coldest of nights.<br />
The Delibird approved as he witnessed the snuggle, and gave you some sweets that he managed to smuggle.<br />

<b>Missingo Master:</b></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: #4dffff">Christmas was an entertaining time for you that brought you much joy, and infected your Pokémon with similar Christmas cheer. There were surprises and gifts waiting around nearly every corner, least which was not Noxie's evolution, the snow and ice surroundings infusing themselves into the Mightyena's fur coat. Even Myrtle cheered up when she saw the Missingo costume, and put it on to help perform an act. The director was clearly delighted by the effort put in and thanked you in person for joining. As a small token of his appreciation he gifts you with some spare costumes left over from a school play he once managed.<br />
<br />
After browsing through the markets, you buy a few stray items to send to your family far off in Lavardige, but for your own mother and parent you had something special in mind. All of your Pokémon joined in to squeeze together for a group picture, which you then sent along with the long-lost Abomasnow Jack to your parents back home. The valet returned, eager to help you find a post office, but not before he gifted you with a small token of appreciation from his employers for the more than generous tip you gave them earlier.</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: #4dffff">Amph gazed at her reflection for quite a while, the look of her new hairpin more than appealing to her. The vendor noticed her marvelling in the mirror and proposed she might make some bows of her own with the leftover fabric he had. They were ragged and useless to him, so Amph would be doing him a favour. The man, not being able to understand Pokémon, shoved the pieces of dirty cloth in the Ampharos' hand. When Amph and Belle left to find Tyrant, they came to the realisation that the merchant had no clue what he was giving away and discovered that the pieces of fabric were in fact 2 rare Reaper Cloths.<br />
<br />
The eating contest was more to the taste of the other two Pokémon; a Panphy and Slowpoke, who eagerly signed up in the hopes of winning (and avoiding payment). The judges set the plates near and were ready to start as the CD for contest music was loaded. Ready, set, go, the music scratched stiff at first and the audience clasped their hands to their ears to drown out the cacophony. The music was quickly halted and the CD removed but the eating contest was underway. Trunks and Pokey Jr. Emerged victoriously. Their reward?: not having to pay for the food. Satisfied with a belly full, they were about to leave when the judges passed by, explaining that the music they wanted to play got mixed up with some TMs. As a small congrats for winning the contest, they offer you the Christmas CD case containing the TMs. Not like it was of any use to them.</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: #4dffff">“Oi, you!” an angry voice shouted. “You just took my scarf and thought you could run away with it? Didn’t think I’d chase, did ya.” The man was practically seething with rage while he indicated the red scarf with bells wrapped around your Vulpix. Saddled across his back was a huge sack that nearly spilled its contents, most likely his wares which he hastily threw in his sack before he made chase. “You’d better pay up missy, and no returning. It’s filthy now that your Pokémon is wearing it.”<br />
<br />
“Oi!” another voice shouted. The man you had given the money to quickly hurried towards you. “Pardon me mam, but you gave me this,” he shows the money. He turns to your assailant, “I believe she meant to give this to you,” he says as he hand it over. “Ahh, finally. Wait…this is too much! I don’t have change for this on me. I had to run after you. You’d better be able to pay exactly for it or else-“ “Now now,” your rescuer protested. “What kind of attitude is that, especially during this time of year? The young lass was clearly happy to pay you more than your fair share. You should be happy. If you really can’t pay her back, why don’t you give her something else instead.” The merchant only grumbled. “Fine, I have some leftover perfume and incense I can’t get rid of. She can have that.” He handed you some incense and then quickly left, back to the Merchant’s Market. “Sorry about that,” the other man says. “The guy can be a real scrooge during the winter. Please don’t let this mar your visit. I know, I’ll by you something nice from these here stalls, and I know just the place. Your Alolan Vulpix is sure to love it.” He leads you to a stall that served Big Malasada’s and bought three. He seemed to be talking to the cook for quite a while before he returned to explain why. “I just told that nice lady what happened. She’s a friend of mine and real sympathetic. She told me to give you this.” He hands you some plastic discs. “She said she found it amongst her Christmas CD collection, but she has no use for it. Well, I’m off. Enjoy the Malasada.”</span></span><br />

<b>Myles II:</b></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: #4dffff">While you sat back to enjoy your warm Tapu Cocoa, hours passed before the door burst open and a small flock of Delibird entered. The children immediately erupted in cheer upon seeing their arrival. The first few Delibirds went up near to the children, responding to their jovial cheers while handing small portions of sweet candies to them. Other Delibirds flew towards some of the parents who were keeping them watch and gave them a few snacks or treats themselves. The majority of the flying Pokémon though went to each stocking one by one and poured some of the contents from their big Santa sack into them. Despite hanging you own stocking way up high, the Delibird’s had no problem reaching it, though you couldn’t tell what they were giving you. One Delibird flew up to you and your Pokémon and gave each of you a single gummi as a small start.<br />
<br />
Eventually though, after having emptied their candy reserves, the Delibird’s gave a warm goodbye, wishing everyone a happy holiday, and left. Everyone flooded to their stockings to see what they got, and you and your Pokémon would have to do the same if you were going to see what you got. Hanging it up high was one thing, but taking it down was another. Looking into your Chatot-patterned stocking, you find a few more gummies for you and your friends. After returning to your pine tree, you find the judges had already passed, and had placed a small parcel under the three with a note that congratulated you on a job well done. You gift was a set of Pokéballs, specially designed with an intricate detail.</span></span><br />

<b>Isaac:</b> <span style="font-size: 12px">The director came up to you personally after your performance, the crowd still applauding in the background. “Splendid,” he said. “That was Shakespeare, wasn’t it? I’m not quite sure myself, but I think it is. Truly amazing though, to be able to recount those lines on the spot, don’t you agree,” he turned to his stagehand who had ushered you on stage earlier. She seemed a bit hesitant at first but she agreed with the director. “Most young folk recite Romeo and Juliet, but my favourite Shakespearian play is…” he drivelled on about Shakespeare and other famous plays for quite a while. Somewhere in between his talks he quips about the poison and dagger used by Romeo and Juliet and hands you a Poison Barb. He then goes on about something with <i>’Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble’</i> and hands you some orbs that apparently had to do with it. Both items were considered too dangerous to use on set, so the director asked you to consider it a gift for your performance on stage.</span><br />

<b>Danielle:</b> <span style="font-size: 12px">You nestled yourself quite neatly in the lodge as you enjoyed your hot beverages and complementary snack for your Pokémon. Despite being stood up by your has-been date, you quickly cheer up at the sight of Christmas stockings being hung up and join in the festivities, writing your name and creating a snowflake with glue and glitter, even the barista had to chuckle to see you and everyone else in their merriment. It wasn’t long after that the Delibirds’ entered and started spewing candy all about, clearing a small path so some could get to the Christmas stockings while others stayed behind to entertain and distract the children. Once the Delibirds’ left and every child’s mouth was full of sweeties, the stockings were free for examination, in which you find a few nice treaties to give to your Pokémon.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: #4dffff">Your kleptomaniac Sableye grumbled as he had to return to the shopkeeper to give back his loot. The merchant was, luckily for you, a good sport and only laughed at your Pokémon’s antics. “You really want to get away with something don’t you?” He chuckles some more. “Why don’t I give you some of these gems I have left over instead?” He searches through a couple of crates behind him and hands them to Ore to take. He bends down and whispers something in the Sableye’s ear as he hands him something else, before giving you a brief glance. Ore seems to understand and returns back to you, showing the small collection of gems he received as well as some perfume/incense for you.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, your Pokémon were in slight agony of each other as they crossed one another’s paths and got in each other’s way in decorating. Most though, merely enjoyed the scene from afar, making the display their holiday amusement as they huddled up close to the Fire-types for warmth. By the time the judges got round, they looked in small shock at the decorated tree. “Oh,” one said, “only Pokémon? Where’s your trainer.” Another judge, a somewhat old and slightly crooked man, chuckled at the disastrously, haphazardly decorated pine. “Well well,” he said. “A valiant effort, I’ll give you that.” “But sir,” one of the others protested, “you can’t really be thinking-“ “Calm down young’un, I’m not thinking anything right now.” He turns to your Pokémon. “But we have something leftover that might help. How’s about I give you some of these ornaments to hang up in your tree,” he asks them and chuckles a bit more. The judges left your Pokémon in peace afterwards to give them some more time to decorate if they so wanted to. The gift they received was a set of special Pokéballs, though with hooks attached to them so they could be hung.</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: #4dffff">Your song finishes and you and Geddy bow, hoping for an applause. There’s a long silence for a while and you hear someone coughing as the crowd looks a bit confused. One man starts slowly clapping, a pity applause, before a few more join in and afterwards the entire audience cheered with great joy. There were a few whistles and you could relax as some threw flowers of admiration, though others could only throw seed, one of which you managed to catch. After descending the stage you were met by a rather punkish-clad gentleman. “Yeah man, rock on!” “Please sir,” the stagehand interrupted him, “keep it down, we-“ “Why didn’t you come to my stage?! We could have set up a sick sound system, and a fireworks display. Yeah man, fireworks and fire!” “That’s dangerous,” the woman said. “Never mind that. Boy, your performance was heavy, heavy like a, like a, well an Iron Ball. Have at it man!” He hands you two very heavy items which he apparently seemed to have on him without hindering even a slight. “Next time, you make sure you come see me, yeah?”<br />
<br />
Later that day, you and your party quickly scanned the food stalls for an sign of funnel cake. One cook stops you to ask you what you were looking for. When you answer funnel cake he protests. “No man, why go for funnel cake. At this time of year you should be eating fruitcake. They’re my specialty and they’re really good. Here, try some,” he insists you and your Pokémon try his fruitcake and hands you three platters. You take a tentative bite out of one of the served pieces and…and…it was terrible! Fruitcakes were notoriously an acquired taste but this one really took the cake. It was hard, stale even, and for some reason salty. It almost made you want to gag. The vendor beams at you with delight. “And? What do you think?”</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: #4dffff">The crows looked in puzzlement as a group of Pokémon entered the cabin, unaccompanied by a trainer. A few suspicious glances were made and some whispers were heard, but pretty soon afterwards everyone welcomed the band of Pokémon with cheer and made sure they were comfortable. A lone Beartic came to greet them and offered them a place by the fire, recounting tales of harsh winters in which he found lone hikers trapped in the mountains which he had to save. (Most of his stories appeared to revolve around humans doing amazing, but stupid, things for which he had to intervene and help.) The group rejoiced in their company as hours passed before a slight slumber came to pass. They were awoken by the Beartic who informed them they had missed the secret Delibird grand entrance along with a few children who had taken a similar nap. The Beartic indicates their stockings, left alone by everyone out of good spirit, and were pleasantly surprised by the small amount of treats they had received.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Atalanta and Boudicca rode into the Merchant’s market, looking for something to give to their trainer. A lone vendor mistook Atalanta for a human. “You there, great man. Can I interest you in any of my fine wares?” Atalanta turned her head aside to reveal her identity after which the vendor gave a small yelp of surprise. “Oh, my goodness! A Pokémon? But I-“ He shook his head. “Never mind. I didn’t mean to disturb you but are you by chance looking for something?” While your Pokémon couldn’t exactly communicate with humans properly, the vendor somehow understood they were part of a team under a trainer’s command and were looking for a present to give to him. Even if the vendor might have misunderstood them, he started marketing his wares and promised that, in good faith, he had something that would please many a trainer. He showed them a mysterious stone that was said to have fallen from the moon and was much sought after. He offered a good price, which only made it more suspicious, but the shimmering glow that it reflected off the moon’s light mad it so alluring that it must have promised something good for their trainer.</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: #4dffff">Your Pokémon gathered orbs and tinfoil in droves as they sorted out what to hang next onto the pine tre- “ABOMASNOW!” Your whole posse froze in a terrified shock upon the realisation that they had been decorating an Abomasnow! The Frost Tree Pokémon looked at you angrily, but after pointing to the red tinsel it became clear that he wanted you to continue in a specific way. Your party gladly obliges and towards the end, the Abomasnow rips a statue of Jirachi off the ground to crown himself. While you might not have won any contests, you and your group could have a warm laugh at the whole event. Before your departure, the Abomsnow plucks a few special baubles off of his cloak and a nearby tree, wanting to offer them as a gift to remember the occasion by.<br />
<br />
While most carolling groups were made of humans, a few special Pokémon wanted to partake in the festivities by setting up groups of their own. One group in particular was spotted by Megas and Silver, who promptly joined in to sings carols to nearby houses (even if not everyone would have understood). By the time you and the rest of your party catch up to them, the Chikorita is ensured your Pokémon can taken on the next house by themselves, along with you and the rest of your team. They knocked, and each sang a verse to the sweet and old lady who answered. “Oh, oh my,” she chuckled. “I wasn’t quite expecting this,” she wasn’t quite sure how to respond to the Pokéspeak she didn’t understand but appeared nonetheless pleased by them. “What an adorable little group you all make. I don’t have much on me but I heard this item has more use for Pokémon.” She hands them a few sparkling white shells and then looks at you. “And you, kind sir. These must be your Pokémon. You can have this. These tokens are meant for a trainer. They’d be wasted on an old lady like myself.” She gives a warm smile to each of you with a ‘Merry Christmas’ before wishing you off.</span></span><br />

Large quantities of different baubles were laid out before you. You picked out the red, the green and gold, and some blue and purple. Lastly, a single star and a shower of glitter were thrown on top to form the pièce de résistance. The judges arrived to look over you tree and seem to be firmly impressed by your strict adherence to the traditional colours. They want to point out the blue and purple baubles you decided to hang. Not because they went against the colour theme you initially went for, but because it turned out someone had mistaken Pokéballs for Christmas baubles and added hooks to them. They were yours to keep now the judges assured you with a smile.<br />

After the contest was over, a place nice and warm would be a good place to visit next. Many taversn were sprawled out to visit and you head up inside one to enjoy a splendour of fine drinks. Most of your Pokémon enjoyed Tapu Cocoa which they offered you as well, but you preferred the fine taste of a more wintery cocktail. While some stalls in the snack places could offer such a fine drink, the baristas are sure of themselves they can compete well enough with them to provide you such a festive drink. You hung up your stockings and took your surroundings in, before the effects of your chosen poison took some hold on you. You were definitely going to sleep well tonight. The stocking you chose had the pattern of a Delibird, like the ones that were to visit later on, but on closer inspection you find it to suddenly start moving. You squint a little more and try to inspect it closer when suddenly it draws near. The Delibird’s face examines you up close and suddenly Double Teams’ before your very eyes. You hear the whole crowd rejoicing about something but you can’t quite tell what. Eventually you doze off for a while, just to take a small nap, and by the time you get up you find that actual Delibir’s had arrived and had provided you with some get-well sweets as well.</span></span><br />

There was almost nothing to find that seemed to fit quite right but you assure the Espeon that she just had to pick something that reminded her of Nadie. She looks a bit further when a peculiar scent piques her interest, She scurries over to a merchant selling all manner of incense and finds a particular sweet aroma that reminded her of it. The vendor informs you and Freighya that that particular incense was what was known as a ‘Rose Incense’, popular in perfumes with a fresh, rosy smell that had a certain sting to it as well that some might find pleasurable. Seeing your Pokémon’s keen interest in it, he offers to sell it to you for a cheaper price than usual, one that was too good to ignore, and so you take it. Meanwhile, your Spoink comes across a few particular gems that strike it’s fancy. The vendor turns out to be a brother of the other man who sold you the Rose Incense, and so he offers them to you for a near similar low price that is too good to pass up.<br />

Later on, at a warm tavern inn, your Skitty quickly befriends a Pokémon, whom is quickly thereafter enamoured by your Pokémon’s charms. The Delibird’s had come and left already and so it was too late to hang up a stocking in anticipation for them. If you wanted, you could still decorate one and hang it up though. The shy Pokémon blushed and offered your Skitty some of its own, hoping Rumpleteaser would accept the gift and so perhaps, if it was lucky, return its affection.</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: #4dffff">A shadow Pokémon’s dark heart was set alight bright, as she handed over her stocking without much of a fight.<br />
To the young girl she could not ignore, who thanked her and looked up with adore.<br />
Was something a rumbling, was something amiss? To the Pokémon no one would hug, no one would kiss?<br />
Bah humbug, in all things it’s likely, as she pulled away and tried to restore her psyche.<br />
When the Delibirds entered with a loud boisterous noise, the children they cheered, both the girls and the boys.<br />
And towards all the Pokémon, yes even the Zangoose, they gave them some candy and berries for juice.<br />
For even they could tell, with only the slightest of doubts, all hearts were one while under the roof of this house.<br />
<br />
After Attila ran off with stones very pretty, she didn’t get far in this festive city.<br />
Stopped why a Whim, a Pokémon of fair, to which she could only reply with the most dreadful of stare.<br />
But a lesson well learned as she returned the baubles, with no need to beg and no need to grovel.<br />
The rest all looked on with face of admiration, at the Larvitar who learned the importance of felicitation.<br />
The vendor impressed by the change of heart, offered four gems before he left to depart.<br />
They were but a trifle, and to add some more sense, he gave for free some odious incense.<br />
<br />
And that is the epilogue of the story you know, so says that poet; the dark, jesting Murkrow.</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: #4dffff">You and your Pokémon enjoyed the small feast of various snacks you had given yourselves from the many stalls that surrounded you. After your meal was completed however, a slight thirst settled in and some felt in need of perhaps rinsing their mouth with a drink. Luckily, enough vendors offered drinks in addition to the meals they provided. Some, even, made drunks their specialty. Sure, most could go and enjoy Tapu Cocoa in one of the many taverns and inns surrounding the markets, but as a specific merchant was telling you, the best drinks can be gotten here by the stalls. To prove this fact to you, he gives you some free samples of his delicacy. His drink has to be served warm, so you had to be careful, but after enjoying some of it, he gives you a few bottles to take with you.<br />
<br />
When returning to your tree you find the judges had passed. What’s worst, your tree appears to have been knocked over. Seemingly, the tree had been uprooted before and so didn’t have a sturdy holding. Someone had clearly tried to set it back up but the sight was still a mess. A small note was appended to a hook, addressed to you; it was from the judges themselves. It seems one of them accidentally bumped into it and found it toppled over. They apologised greatly and offered you a small present in compensation. Below the tree you find a wrapped present for you and your Pokémon, inside of which you find a few special Pokéballs.</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: #4dffff">Amongst the confectionery stands of the snacking stalls, sweet music poured from the radios as your dragons gorged themselves on sweet caramel, chocolate (and not dead Emolga). Amidst the sweetness of all the candy, were some specialised cakes made just for this season. For some reason, your Pokémon’s interests are piqued and so they obtain some of that special cake, even though it may contain fruit. They took a bite and have instant regret. The cake was like ash in their mouth and as hard as steel. Even for Poison-types, the cake could induce vomiting. The cake was horrible and hard, and so they decide to not eat it up for now but perhaps keep it for a rainy day.<br />
<br />
While your Blaziken and Zangoose are fighting amongst themselves and reminiscing of days BC (Before Capture), a few stockings are hung up by you and/or your Pokémon. The children all cheer and start singing in eager anticipation of the Delibirds’ arrival. Then, at once and all sudden, the door burst open and many red-coated penguin-like creatures fluttered in while tossing small candies in all directions. You and your Pokémon stand around to try and catch as much as you can, which ends up a surprising success. The Delibirds fluff of the stocking further with candies, gummis and quite a few berries before taking their leave, allowing the children, you and your Pokémon to enjoy their new candy cache they received for Christmas.</span></span><br />

<b>EpicSquirtle:</b></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: #4dffff">With aplomb you presented a stunning magic show with strong notes of contest appeals that did not go unnoticed. Despite some potential nervousness, a stray attack or a single trip, the entire act went smoothly until it reached its crescendo. The crowd erupted in applause while all of you bowed. The stagehand came to congratulate you, saying the success was no small surprise. She notes that she’s had a lot of luck lately in directing the plays on her stage and indicates the inside of your costumes. Inside the stitching of some of these, you find a precious four-leaved clover. The stagehand indicates that these were to give people good luck. While she didn’t believe in them herself, every little bit counts and so she sewed them inside the clothing. As a thank you for your performance you’re all allowed to keep the clothes you have on you, and you might as well take the clovers as well.<br />
<br />
A little later, by the warm fire of the tavern, the two of you enjoyed your Tapu Cocoa. With the help of your Pokémon friends you knitted your names into stockings and hung them up. By the time the Delibirds arrived, each of the stocking were filled to the brim with candies and sweets. Though Robin had almost no clue as she had fallen into a deep lull by now. When she wakes up she’ll be pleasantly surprised to hear of the sweeties she has been given (and the fruit as well).</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: #4dffff">You were surprised, to say the least, when you heard the ornaments were free to take and hang. You now mischievous Mawile appeared to be nothing more than one of any Pokémon who had joined in on the contest, adorned all over with baubles. Your Pokémon join in, excitedly, as they hung up festive baubles, tinsel and strings of popcorn and cranberries (if they didn’t chew on them that is). The ornaments are hung up on by one, taken from their box individually when you find to your surprise that a small set of them were just to heavy to be hung. Whenever you’d try they’d end up slipping and dropping, though luckily didn’t crash on the ground. The clerk explains when you ask; these were Pokéballs it seemed and not baubles. Heavy Balls, to be exact. “You might as well keep them,” he says with a laugh.<br />
<br />
To make it up to Éclair, you scanned around the markets in the hopes of finding something pretty for her. There were many pretty gems to be bough, yet somehow none of these felt quite right for your Mawile. It was starting to get late and most of the stores were closing, before a gift-wrapping station provided you an answer. Éclair gladly wanted one of the ribbons as a fine accessory to which the clerks all but happily agreed. You offered to compensate them for it but they wanted nothing for such a trifle. Instead though, you find another vendor who was all but too glad to give away the last of his wares. He explains how he wasn’t a real merchant but just a regular man who happened to come across a curiosity he heard many tech-savvy geeks would want to buy. Yet here on Christmas eve he could find none who wanted it. He couldn’t so much as even give it away as so few people would apparently have a use for it. Even the man himself had no clue what it was, just that it was rare and worth a lot. And so, instead, he shoves them in your clutches, practically begging you to take the computer hard drives off his hands.</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: #4dffff">There were many places to go and many things to see, too many all for one day. While the thought of acting on stage appealed to you slightly, and the thought of carolling was frightening, you decide to go take a look at the various food and beverages that were on offer. You find many a tasty treat; hot cross buns, fruitcakes, chili peppers and chocolates. Some vendors gave away stuff for free while others asked for a small compensation from you, nothing too big though. One vendor in particular perks up a little after looking over you and then your Pokémon. “You a trainer,” he asks. You confirm his suspicion after which he lights up a bit more and offers you a free gift with the food he was serving. Apparently a mistake was made and they had a hold of some TMs that were of no use to them, but might have been some use to a trainer such as yourself.<br />
<br />
Later at the Christmas stockings, you enjoy some warm Tapu Cocoa, or perhaps something else, as you nestle by the fire before finding a pile of stocking from which you could take one and decorate it to your personal taste. You affix your stocking by the fireplace and not soon thereafter the Delibirds arrived to give everyone a sweet treat, including you and your Pokémon.</span></span><br />

<b>Schala:</b> <span style="font-size: 12px">While most would try to decorate trees on these occasions, you and Airmid had your sights on an Abomasnow that hid between the rows of pines. Your Shroomish, so eager about decorating an Abomsnow, even goes so far as to force an evolution on herself so she’d grow taller. Garlands and silk threads are weaved over the Abomasnow’s body, who was more than a bit wary about his role in all of this but allowed you to proceed nonetheless. After that came baubles, gingerbread men and lights. And just in time, as the judges were passing the rows and came up to you. “Oh what a marvellous tree, such a-“ “OH!” one of them yelled when they noticed the tree’s two large eyes. “Sir, I think this is a Pokémon,” after which the tree stirred and gave an ‘Abomasnow’. “Oh dear, well these do love to hide amongst the forests. Pines are like catnip to them.” It would seem you were disqualified from the contest itself but the judges congratulate you still on a job well done and give you props on decorating a pine tree. They had a few spare prizes left and so they hand you a box of one of them so you won’t feel too dejected. “They’re not really Christmas-themed, so we’d rather not give these out as rewards,” was their explanation.</span><br />

<b>Eskil:</b> <span style="font-size: 12px">You were looking for small presents to give to your friends. You found a collar for Beira and a scarf for yourself but were still in search of something for Nyx. You came upon a jewellery store that sold all manner of gems, jewels and stones but none seemed to fit quite right with Nyx. Th day was coming to a quick close though and a surprising number of items had been bought by your competing visitors. Somehow, your eyes had landed on a few silver-coloured gems which the vendor made an elaborate sales pitch for. A straggler passed by and warned you not to be fooled. They were more common than he let on. The vendor looked a bit surprised and choked for a moment, before offering a smooth rock as a complementary item, clearly hoping it would shush you.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: #4dffff">You browsed the wares of the kings and nomads and the items they peddled. A curious snowglobe caught the eye of Zoom, while the Carbink was more interested in the diadems, rubies and sapphires abound or not. But link was not interested in sparkling objects nearly as much as those two, and preferred the woollen clothing that was sold a little ways down, specifically the little Santa hat with a bell attached. Makoto finally joined the team, and allowed for a rather nice-looking collar to be wrapped around her neck. One vendor in particular was calling for your attention, explaining how he had something you might like for your Vulpix. He shows of a strange piece of ice before elaborating that it was a rare stone whose magical properties had only recently been discovered. You’re a bit sceptical at first but a strange light seemed to reflect off of it, and Makoto was more than curious about it when she saw it.<br />
<br />
Later on, you find yourself amongst the wafting scents of fried food, warmed spirits and chilled sugars. Each also provided their own musical tones to try and attract new visitors. One such chef, amidst his frantic back-and-forth to serve all his customers, tried asking you who you thought had the best taste in music of all the cooks in the area. When you didn’t answer immediately at first, he tries to curry favour with you and hands you an album. “A copy of my mixtapes,” he boasts. “For you.” You open it thought to find out he had recorded them on some TMs. The discs were a bit scratched but perfectly serviceable, (even if you might have to hear some Christmas music out-of-season when using it).</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: #4dffff">There were many places to go and many things to see, too many all for one day. While the thought of acting on stage appealed to you slightly, and the thought of carolling was frightening, you decide to go take a look at the various food and beverages that were on offer. You find many a tasty treat; hot cross buns, fruitcakes, chili peppers and chocolates. Some vendors gave away stuff for free while others asked for a small compensation from you, nothing too big though. One vendor in particular perks up a little after looking over you and then your Pokémon. “You a trainer,” he asks. You confirm his suspicion after which he lights up a bit more and offers you a free gift with the food he was serving. Apparently a mistake was made and they had a hold of some TMs that were of no use to them, but might have been some use to a trainer such as yourself.<br />
<br />
Later at the Christmas stockings, you enjoy some warm Tapu Cocoa, or perhaps something else, as you nestle by the fire before finding a pile of stocking from which you could take one and decorate it to your personal taste. You affix your stocking by the fireplace and not soon thereafter the Delibirds arrived to give everyone a sweet treat, including you and your Pokémon.</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: rgb(77, 255, 255)">You browsed the wares of the kings and nomads and the items they peddled. A curious snowglobe caught the eye of Zoom, while the Carbink was more interested in the diadems, rubies and sapphires abound or not. But link was not interested in sparkling objects nearly as much as those two, and preferred the woollen clothing that was sold a little ways down, specifically the little Santa hat with a bell attached. Makoto finally joined the team, and allowed for a rather nice-looking collar to be wrapped around her neck. One vendor in particular was calling for your attention, explaining how he had something you might like for your Vulpix. He shows of a strange piece of ice before elaborating that it was a rare stone whose magical properties had only recently been discovered. You’re a bit sceptical at first but a strange light seemed to reflect off of it, and Makoto was more than curious about it when she saw it.<br />
<br />
Later on, you find yourself amongst the wafting scents of fried food, warmed spirits and chilled sugars. Each also provided their own musical tones to try and attract new visitors. One such chef, amidst his frantic back-and-forth to serve all his customers, tried asking you who you thought had the best taste in music of all the cooks in the area. When you didn’t answer immediately at first, he tries to curry favour with you and hands you an album. “A copy of my mixtapes,” he boasts. “For you.” You open it thought to find out he had recorded them on some TMs. The discs were a bit scratched but perfectly serviceable, (even if you might have to hear some Christmas music out-of-season when using it).</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: #4dffff">Christmas was an entertaining time for you that brought you much joy, and infected your Pokémon with similar Christmas cheer. There were surprises and gifts waiting around nearly every corner, least which was not Noxie's evolution, the snow and ice surroundings infusing themselves into the Mightyena's fur coat. Even Myrtle cheered up when she saw the Missingo costume, and put it on to help perform an act. The director was clearly delighted by the effort put in and thanked you in person for joining. As a small token of his appreciation he gifts you with some spare costumes left over from a school play he once managed.<br />
<br />
After browsing through the markets, you buy a few stray items to send to your family far off in Lavardige, but for your own mother and parent you had something special in mind. All of your Pokémon joined in to squeeze together for a group picture, which you then sent along with the long-lost Abomasnow Jack to your parents back home. The valet returned, eager to help you find a post office, but not before he gifted you with a small token of appreciation from his employers for the more than generous tip you gave them earlier.</span></span><br />

</blockquote><span style="color: #944D94">I'd RP this response, but what I lack is time,<br />
So instead my reply is entirely in rhyme.<br />
Three Superhero Capes, wondrous items to hold,<br />
One of them going to a Swalot so bold.<br />
Another one he keeps, though only one makes him glide,<br />
Just in case of a sidekick who'll fight by his side.<br />
Six Fighting Gems to strengthen attacks,<br />
Putting the power of Fighting moves to the max.<br />
And one Smooth Rock, to make Sandstorm last longer,<br />
Could make a Tyranitar or Gigalith that much stronger.<br />
And so in closing, Merry Christmas to you,<br />
Now it's off to the GTS- I've got trading to do!</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: #4dffff">Your Pokémon gathered orbs and tinfoil in droves as they sorted out what to hang next onto the pine tre- “ABOMASNOW!” Your whole posse froze in a terrified shock upon the realisation that they had been decorating an Abomasnow! The Frost Tree Pokémon looked at you angrily, but after pointing to the red tinsel it became clear that he wanted you to continue in a specific way. Your party gladly obliges and towards the end, the Abomasnow rips a statue of Jirachi off the ground to crown himself. While you might not have won any contests, you and your group could have a warm laugh at the whole event. Before your departure, the Abomsnow plucks a few special baubles off of his cloak and a nearby tree, wanting to offer them as a gift to remember the occasion by.<br />
<br />
While most carolling groups were made of humans, a few special Pokémon wanted to partake in the festivities by setting up groups of their own. One group in particular was spotted by Megas and Silver, who promptly joined in to sings carols to nearby houses (even if not everyone would have understood). By the time you and the rest of your party catch up to them, the Chikorita is ensured your Pokémon can taken on the next house by themselves, along with you and the rest of your team. They knocked, and each sang a verse to the sweet and old lady who answered. “Oh, oh my,” she chuckled. “I wasn’t quite expecting this,” she wasn’t quite sure how to respond to the Pokéspeak she didn’t understand but appeared nonetheless pleased by them. “What an adorable little group you all make. I don’t have much on me but I heard this item has more use for Pokémon.” She hands them a few sparkling white shells and then looks at you. “And you, kind sir. These must be your Pokémon. You can have this. These tokens are meant for a trainer. They’d be wasted on an old lady like myself.” She gives a warm smile to each of you with a ‘Merry Christmas’ before wishing you off.</span></span><br />

<i><span style="font-size: 12px">The land was plain grim, stuck in perpetual snow, where the clouds were oft grey, and the cold wind did blow. </span></i><br />
<i><span style="font-size: 12px">The villagers worked hard, as they toiled through their day, though they never complained, not once, no way. </span></i><br />
<i><span style="font-size: 12px">The people were merry, I know it’s hard to believe, all for that one week, leading up to Christmas eve. </span></i><br />
<br />
<i><span style="font-size: 12px">It is in this period, during these fine celebrations that they open up stalls, markets and other workstations. </span></i><br />
<i><span style="font-size: 12px">The vacant town square, a centre in mute snore, comes alive with energy, with the civilian uproar. </span></i><br />

<i><span style="font-size: 12px">They rejoice in their company with a warm cup of tea, and some other hot drinks, that might make one feel tipsy. </span></i><br />
<i><span style="font-size: 12px">Statues and theatres, both quiet and loud, for you to join in and show to the crowd. </span></i><br />
<i><span style="font-size: 12px">Ice skating and snowballs, or, if you want to relax; Tapu Cocoa by fire, surrounded by knick-knacks. </span></i><br />
<i><span style="font-size: 12px">Singing and chanting, if you don’t want to dance. Come and join in while you still have a chance. </span></i><br />
<br />
<i><span style="font-size: 12px"> But the biggest of all, is the large Christmas tree, adorned in its entirety, down to a tee. </span></i><br />
<i><span style="font-size: 12px">Behind that of which lay the small town’s small temple, which was usually dull, but today rather special. </span></i><br />
<i><span style="font-size: 12px">At the holidays climax, when all’s said and done, they hold hands and sing, all man, everyone. </span></i><br />

An ocean of scents wafts through the air, as wise men from the east show off their wares.<br />
Amidst all the trifles, the sparklers and doodads, lie mysterious orbs brought by these nomads.<br />
Jewels and gems, strange rocks and glass eyes, all neatly lined up for you to ogle and buy. </span><br />

Nestle by the fire, all proud a crackling, and enjoy Tapu Cocoa while you hear the crowds laughing.<br />
Children join in as they hang up their stocking, eagerly waiting for the Delibird’s knocking.<br />
Trainers may join, along their Pokémon friend, by the fireplace a sock that they may append.<br />
A bonding experience between buddies of gold, with sweeties delivered to both young and old.<br />
Fruit to the good and candy to the better, all will feel right in spite of the weather. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: #4dffff">Your kleptomaniac Sableye grumbled as he had to return to the shopkeeper to give back his loot. The merchant was, luckily for you, a good sport and only laughed at your Pokémon’s antics. “You really want to get away with something don’t you?” He chuckles some more. “Why don’t I give you some of these gems I have left over instead?” He searches through a couple of crates behind him and hands them to Ore to take. He bends down and whispers something in the Sableye’s ear as he hands him something else, before giving you a brief glance. Ore seems to understand and returns back to you, showing the small collection of gems he received as well as some perfume/incense for you.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, your Pokémon were in slight agony of each other as they crossed one another’s paths and got in each other’s way in decorating. Most though, merely enjoyed the scene from afar, making the display their holiday amusement as they huddled up close to the Fire-types for warmth. By the time the judges got round, they looked in small shock at the decorated tree. “Oh,” one said, “only Pokémon? Where’s your trainer.” Another judge, a somewhat old and slightly crooked man, chuckled at the disastrously, haphazardly decorated pine. “Well well,” he said. “A valiant effort, I’ll give you that.” “But sir,” one of the others protested, “you can’t really be thinking-“ “Calm down young’un, I’m not thinking anything right now.” He turns to your Pokémon. “But we have something leftover that might help. How’s about I give you some of these ornaments to hang up in your tree,” he asks them and chuckles a bit more. The judges left your Pokémon in peace afterwards to give them some more time to decorate if they so wanted to. The gift they received was a set of special Pokéballs, though with hooks attached to them so they could be hung.</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: #4dffff">The crows looked in puzzlement as a group of Pokémon entered the cabin, unaccompanied by a trainer. A few suspicious glances were made and some whispers were heard, but pretty soon afterwards everyone welcomed the band of Pokémon with cheer and made sure they were comfortable. A lone Beartic came to greet them and offered them a place by the fire, recounting tales of harsh winters in which he found lone hikers trapped in the mountains which he had to save. (Most of his stories appeared to revolve around humans doing amazing, but stupid, things for which he had to intervene and help.) The group rejoiced in their company as hours passed before a slight slumber came to pass. They were awoken by the Beartic who informed them they had missed the secret Delibird grand entrance along with a few children who had taken a similar nap. The Beartic indicates their stockings, left alone by everyone out of good spirit, and were pleasantly surprised by the small amount of treats they had received.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Atalanta and Boudicca rode into the Merchant’s market, looking for something to give to their trainer. A lone vendor mistook Atalanta for a human. “You there, great man. Can I interest you in any of my fine wares?” Atalanta turned her head aside to reveal her identity after which the vendor gave a small yelp of surprise. “Oh, my goodness! A Pokémon? But I-“ He shook his head. “Never mind. I didn’t mean to disturb you but are you by chance looking for something?” While your Pokémon couldn’t exactly communicate with humans properly, the vendor somehow understood they were part of a team under a trainer’s command and were looking for a present to give to him. Even if the vendor might have misunderstood them, he started marketing his wares and promised that, in good faith, he had something that would please many a trainer. He showed them a mysterious stone that was said to have fallen from the moon and was much sought after. He offered a good price, which only made it more suspicious, but the shimmering glow that it reflected off the moon’s light mad it so alluring that it must have promised something good for their trainer.</span></span><br />

<span style="color: #4dffff"><b>Isaac:</b> <span style="font-size: 12px">The director came up to you personally after your performance, the crowd still applauding in the background. “Splendid,” he said. “That was Shakespeare, wasn’t it? I’m not quite sure myself, but I think it is. Truly amazing though, to be able to recount those lines on the spot, don’t you agree,” he turned to his stagehand who had ushered you on stage earlier. She seemed a bit hesitant at first but she agreed with the director. “Most young folk recite Romeo and Juliet, but my favourite Shakespearian play is…” he drivelled on about Shakespeare and other famous plays for quite a while. Somewhere in between his talks he quips about the poison and dagger used by Romeo and Juliet and hands you a Poison Barb. He then goes on about something with <i>’Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble’</i> and hands you some orbs that apparently had to do with it. Both items were considered too dangerous to use on set, so the director asked you to consider it a gift for your performance on stage.</span><br />

<b>Danielle:</b> <span style="font-size: 12px">You nestled yourself quite neatly in the lodge as you enjoyed your hot beverages and complementary snack for your Pokémon. Despite being stood up by your has-been date, you quickly cheer up at the sight of Christmas stockings being hung up and join in the festivities, writing your name and creating a snowflake with glue and glitter, even the barista had to chuckle to see you and everyone else in their merriment. It wasn’t long after that the Delibirds’ entered and started spewing candy all about, clearing a small path so some could get to the Christmas stockings while others stayed behind to entertain and distract the children. Once the Delibirds’ left and every child’s mouth was full of sweeties, the stockings were free for examination, in which you find a few nice treaties to give to your Pokémon.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: #4dffff">You and your Pokémon enjoyed the small feast of various snacks you had given yourselves from the many stalls that surrounded you. After your meal was completed however, a slight thirst settled in and some felt in need of perhaps rinsing their mouth with a drink. Luckily, enough vendors offered drinks in addition to the meals they provided. Some, even, made drunks their specialty. Sure, most could go and enjoy Tapu Cocoa in one of the many taverns and inns surrounding the markets, but as a specific merchant was telling you, the best drinks can be gotten here by the stalls. To prove this fact to you, he gives you some free samples of his delicacy. His drink has to be served warm, so you had to be careful, but after enjoying some of it, he gives you a few bottles to take with you.<br />
<br />
When returning to your tree you find the judges had passed. What’s worst, your tree appears to have been knocked over. Seemingly, the tree had been uprooted before and so didn’t have a sturdy holding. Someone had clearly tried to set it back up but the sight was still a mess. A small note was appended to a hook, addressed to you; it was from the judges themselves. It seems one of them accidentally bumped into it and found it toppled over. They apologised greatly and offered you a small present in compensation. Below the tree you find a wrapped present for you and your Pokémon, inside of which you find a few special Pokéballs.</span></span><br />
