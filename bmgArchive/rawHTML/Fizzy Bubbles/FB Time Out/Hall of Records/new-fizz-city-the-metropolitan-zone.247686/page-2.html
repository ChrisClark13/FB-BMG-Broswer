<span style="color: rgb(128, 128, 128)"><b>Biggggg5</b>:</span><br />
<span style="color: #808080">As it turns out, there <i>is</i> a way of getting Azurill to move! The newborn takes a while to comprehend your plan, but once it tries out a Water Gun, it screams in excitement to find itself moving across the sea on its bubbly tail! Overwhelmed with happiness, it keeps blowing out water, causing it to gain much more speed than you would’ve liked, forcing you to give chase swimming. And after a while, the two of you are traversing the water side-by-side with little difficulty, much to Azurill’s delight. Great planning!<br />
<br />
The journey towards the sunken ship isn’t terribly long, but ends up taking a lot more out of you than it does Azurill (who, despite its fears, is much more conditioned for water travel than any human). Midway, you run into other swimmers and surfers, and can’t help but overhear their conversations.<br />
<br />
“Hey, look at that one!”<br />
<br />
“He’s not seriously going to?...”<br />
<br />
“Guy’s crazy! Did nobody tell him that ship’s cursed?!”<br />
<br />
“Daaamn dude, you got some Ultra Balls, that’s for sure!”<br />
<br />
Deciding to pay them no mind – you <i>do</i> have a point to prove to that lifeguard, after all – the two of you keep going, determined to reach the broken hull of the cruise ship. Schools of Finneon swim merrily below you, while flocks of Wingull fly overhead; and after a bit longer of strenuous swimming (and effortless Water Gun-blowing), you finally arrive at your destination.<br />
<br />
Up ahead is the rusty, half-sunken husk of the once glorious S.S. Fortune, as you can tell by the engraving on the hull that is yet to fade away completely. In its heyday, the ship must have been a wondrous sight to behold, designed and painted to resemble a Wailord in every aspect. Now, it is no more than a heap of rusted iron sticking out like a sore thumb in the otherwise idyllic scenario of Bubbling Beach. And nobody is even sure why the S.S. Fortune sank to begin with…<br />
<br />
Finding a way inside the actual vessel doesn’t prove too hard – there is a massive breach right in the middle of the ship, likely where it snapped in half; the front of the ship has since stuck out of the water like an iron tower, while the back half rests mostly in the depths of the ocean. Swimming through that gap towards the interior of the cruise ship is relatively easy, but for some reason, it seems nobody else – not even kids, who love to explore this kind of mysterious places – has ventured this far. Why is that?...<br />
<br />
Once you make your way inside and climb out of the water onto solid ground, you find yourself in what must’ve been the ship’s grand hall. Broken glass chandeliers hang from the mouldy ceiling, half-crumbled wooden tables and chairs are scattered all over the place, a once-priceless piano missing two legs rests against the wall it must’ve crashed when the hull cracked… This was no doubt where guests gathered to eat and socialize during the evenings.<br />
<br />
You exchange a glance with Azurill, and find all trace of its previous excitement gone, replaced by a look of concern and apprehension. And now that you think about it, something has been bothering you too since you got out of the water – not just the sight of devastation before you, but something more. As if an ominous, lingering presence rests in the halls of this ship, staring at you from the shadows…<br />
<br />
Trying to push these thoughts aside, you focus on your goal – retrieve something from the ship to prove to Sean that you made it here. A wooden fragment from one these tables is hardly convincing proof, you reason, meaning you must find something which undeniably belonged to the S.S. Fortune and which <i>hasn’t</i> been destroyed by water or the passing of time. Not an easy task…<br />
<br />
Your eyes catch sight of what appears to have been a plant of the ship on a nearby wall, but saltwater has ruined most of it. All you can make out is that you are right in the middle of the ship; the engine room, kitchen, workers’ quarters and other “utility” divisions are located in the front of the ship (the one sticking mostly out of the water), while the Captain’s Cabin, guests’ rooms, casino and other entertainment areas are in the back of the ship, the one left mostly underwater after the disaster.<br />
<br />
Azurill presses itself against your leg, scared and on the verge of crying. Still, for better your worse, <b>you are now accompanied by a Level 14 Male Azurill with EM Camouflage</b>…<br />
<br />
Well, what will you do next?</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: #808080">Inspired by a recently beaten video game Big watches pretty happy with himself as the Azurill is now able to move across the water fairly competently. No matter what the rest of the day brought, Big would be satisfied in teaching the young pokemon how to survive better in and around water. However, he still had an asshole to prove wrong. And with that to motivate him he makes sure to recall his pokemon and take his pokeballs and then encourages the Azuril to follow and heads for the sunken ship. Taking a less than sprinting pace to avoid tiring himself out he is able to catch some conversations of other swimmers and surfers. He is slightly concerned at what he hears. Apparently, the ship was more dangerous than the lifeguard had let on, but Big wasn't terribly worried having his several competent pokemon with him. As he heads into the giant Wailord-esque ship he takes note of the lack of... well activity. &quot;Man, this is such a cool place to explore, I wonder what is keeping people away.&quot; He ponders treading water, before heading toward where he could stand. He looks over the destroyed place, taking care to avoid the glass from the crashed chandelier. He ponders prying a key from the piano and claiming that as his proof but he decided that may not fly. But his eyes finally land on what seems to be a plan of the ship, a map like one might find at a shopping mall, only nearly ruined by the seawater. &quot;Hmm, a casino token seems like that would be the easiest was to definitely prove we were here.&quot; He says to the Azuril but mostly working through things out loud for his own benefit. &quot;But it looks a bit hard to get to, and you can't learn dive till you evolve anyway. Why don't we try for the worker's quarters, maybe there will be a uniform or something we can bring back.&quot; He nods and eyes the shadows a bit and keeps his hand near his pokeballs as he heads towards where the map might lead him to the worker's quarters.</span></div>

<div style="margin-left: 20px"><span style="color: gray">Tempted as you are, your goal comes first. You worry you might be missing an opportunity, worse-case scenarios flitting through your mind. You force yourself not to worry too much though; it just means you need to move quicker! Perhaps not too quickly though, after a near stumble almost sends your Togepi sunny-side up. You slow your pace to a brisk walk across the grass, but it seems luck is not on your side today. As you almost reach the pond, a tug on your ankle is the only warning you have before you tip forward, the grassy ground nearing all too quickly. With the thought of Meringue almost coming to harm still on your mind, you twist your torso about, trying to keep him from becoming scrambled. The impact of your back against the ground knocks the wind from you, and only seconds after you feel the back of your head make an impact of its own. Everything goes dark.<br />
<span style="color: gray"><br />
Through the haze of unconsciousness, you feel a prod on your face. First one cheek, then the other, and then finally your nose as hearing returns to you. The chittering of your Togepi enters your ears, and its odd, you think; there seems to be a strain to the normally serene Meringue’s voice. Slowly, you blink open your eyes to a pink sky, and almost immediately close them again with a groan as you finally feel the dull throbbing of your head. It hurts, to be sure, though thankfully there was enough spongey grass to cushion you from any lasting harm. <br />
<br />
Reaching a hand up to rub at the area, you re-open your eyes, again seeing the pink tinge to the sky, as if the sun was beginning to set. It takes you a moment to realize why that seems weird: during the last moments you remember the sky was a bright, midday blue. Had… Had you really been out that long?<br />
<br />
Before you can follow that train of thought for too long, Meringue gives another prod to your face, harder this time. You give a questioning glance down your chest at him, only to receive an immediate answer in the form of hot, humid breath fanning across your face.<br />
<br />
You slowly tilt your head back, pain forgotten. Pink fills your vision, brighter and closer than the that of the sky, along with one tan, rounded muzzle. Leisurely, the mouth opens, letting out another exhale of fishy breath with an accompanying “Sllllloooooowwwwww…”<br />
<br />
On the bright side, that answers one question. You were at least out long enough for a

</blockquote><span style="color: gray">Makoto tried to assess the situation, but his still bleary eyes and the overpowering smell of raw fish interfered with that. Meringue’s poking only disoriented him more. But with a quick shake of the head, the daze subsided. He could finally get a good look at that formless pink shape in front of him.<br />
<br />
This one didn’t seem familiar. A pink, long-tailed creature with a vacant expression? He may have seen it walking around somewhere once, but the name eluded him. And without a name or any other knowledge of what this pokemon was, Makoto couldn’t figure out if they are what he’s looking for.<br />
<br />
Pokedex time! The Pokedex scanned the slowpoke for a moment, then retrieved some figures. Oh, so <i>that’s</i> where the term “slowpoke” comes from! He read through the descriptions. The dopey pokemon… fishing with its tail… entire days loafing at the water’s edge… Nothing about these descriptions suggested psychic powers. “<i>This doesn’t seem to be what I’m looking for…</i>” he thought, glancing once more at the slowpoke’s seemingly spaced-out stare. “<i>I should get back on my way… But could they get offended? Maybe I should… erm… I’ll just ask.</i>”<br />
<br />
Makoto took a moment to dust himself off before he rose to his knees. “Um… Hello.” He paused for a short moment. “I… I’m looking for a pokemon with psychic powers. If you have seen any pokemon lifting rocks without touching them… floating without wings… um… ones who shoot waves out of their heads? …T-That hit things without it looking like they hit them with anything? If you do, please tell me... I… need one.” Against his better judgment, he stared at the slowpoke in anticipation of an answer.</span></div>

<div style="margin-left: 20px"><b>(Congratulations! You have now captured a Lv. 14 Female Corsola knowing Camouflage, Screech, &amp; Mud Slap!)</b><br />
<br />
Despite the circumstances, you can’t help the little rush of excitement at making a new friend, at feeling the beginnings of a bond between kindred spirits blossom. Heartwarming as it is, though, you don’t want to dally for too long lest Hank leave without you. Gathering the as-yet-unnamed Corsola – clearly unused to this abundant affection, but nevertheless enjoying it at least a little bit - close to your chest, you take off across the sand in the direction Hank went as fast as you are able, beelining to the Fishing Hut.<br />
<br />
As you near, you can better take in the Hut, and it looks much like one would expect a beachside hut to look: wide bamboo walls, slanted thatched roof, and long wooden awnings overlooking the front entrance and side outdoor seating area (the latter of which is currently unused except for a single, plump-looking Buizel stretched out across a table soundly sleeping). The two large double doors that make up the main entrance are propped wide open, though whatever group of people might have been hanging around at the time you arrived at the cove have since left.<br />
<br />
Upon entering the Hut huffing and out of breath, your nose is immediately assaulted with the strong smell of <b>incense</b>, a salty scent not unlike that which accompanies <b>waves</b> cresting the shoreline. You look around, and you see that the front half of the Hut is almost a small store. For the most part what is being sold, unsurprisingly, is fishing gear – rods, lures, and such – or kitschy tourist souvenirs. There are a few things that catch your eye, however. Amid the practical fishing supplies, you see a small shelving unit devoted to pokeballs: two large and full tubs of <b>Net</b> and <b>Dive</b> balls, a smaller-by-half tub of recognizable <b>Lure</b> balls, and on the top shelf <b>a single blue-and-black ball with a stylized ‘A’</b> resting on a stand. The last, in particular, is notable as it isn’t a type you’ve ever seen before. Near that stands a glass case with a row of <b>blue-tinted TMs</b> and a sign saying, ‘See cashier for purchase.’ The way they’re arranged you can’t see many labels, though the few you do see say in mechanic script ‘Surf’ and ‘Dive’ giving some guess as to their natures. Across the store with the souvenirs, intermixed with clothing and other wearables, you can see the familiar shape of <b>Mystic Waters</b> hanging from a post. Moreover, amid the kitschy items, there is a rock coated in <b>faintly-glowing moss</b> that draws the gaze as well as a very <b>damp-looking</b> crystalized <b>rock</b> that brings to mind the Icy Rock obtained during the debacle in the Cloud Garden. Lastly, near the counter where the register and strong incense (and, currently, one very surprised cashier flailing about, trying not to fall from his stool at your sudden appearance) are located, you see a large refrigerator of <b>Fresh Water</b> with a large sticker on the glass reading ‘$25 a bottle.’<br />
<br />
In your brief look around, you find yourself equally relieved and anxious that Hank is nowhere in sight. You look further back, hoping he hasn’t left, and though you don’t see him in the back of the Hut - where the outdoor seating continues inside around a small stage – you do hear two voices from a backroom marked ‘Employees Only.’ Neither is loud enough to comprehend, but the caw of a Wingull accompanying them is immediately recognizable. The tenseness in your frame vanishes; you aren't late.<br />
<br />
By this point, the cashier, a late-middle-aged man with a poorly-kept beard and the single-most stereotypical fishing hat you’ve seen, wide-brimmed and covered in decorative lures, has gathered himself enough to call out to you. “Oh, lass!” he says in an accent you can’t quite place but definitely not from around here, “Welcome t’ the Fishing Cove Fishing Hut! If ya’d like t’ look around, we’ve got some sales goin’ on t’day. Lures are all half off, see, and the TMs there, got some nice discounts on some o’ them. Oh! And this here incense.” He slaps the counter next to the deep blue bowl of incense. “Got a batch o’ Wave Incense in recently, s’what ya’d be smelling righ’ now.” From his excitement and overall demeanor, you get the feeling that either he’s just that enthusiastic about selling fishing gear or business has not been terribly well today and he’d really like to make some sort of sale before closing.<br />

<br />
<div style="margin-left: 20px">You check your Pokedex for information about the so-called Dopey Pokémon, and what you find does not seem promising. At the least, not what you’re really looking for. Still, it is rude to just walk away without a word, so you tell the Slowpoke of your search and ask it if it has seen any Psychic-types that fit the bill. <br />
<br />
For a moment, nothing happens as the Slowpoke stares silently off into space, breathing out fishy breath at odd intervals. You start to wonder if it even heard you or if it really is that slow, when the pink head dips down in a small nod. The Slowpoke slowly turns its gaze up until it looks you square in the eye, after which it turns and starts for the pond. It moves at honestly a quicker pace than you expected, given what you read. You aren’t familiar with them though, so you don’t pay that much mind; it might be normal behavior for all you are aware. That train of thought distracts you for a moment or two, enough to cause the Slowpoke to stop about halfway the short, remaining distance to the pond and look back questioningly. It seems it wants you to follow it.<br />
<br />
Hesitantly you do, gathering Meringue back into your arms. You quickly catch up and trail behind the Slowpoke’s shuffling walk (it is, after all, still a Slowpoke) until it reaches the pond’s edge. Flopping down lazily onto the ground, the Slowpoke dips its head down and stares into the clear water. After another moment in which you wait for some sort of answer, it turns its head to look at you again questioningly. Unsure what is happening, you give a little shrug sharing a glance with your Togepi and continue this game of follow-the-leader.<br />
<br />
Kneeling near the Slowpoke, Meringue and yourself bend over to peer down into the pond. It is crystal clear, despite the pinkish tone the setting sun seems to have given everything around, and in in any other instance this would be a very pretty picture. Pond weeds, just beginning to bud, sway gently along the bottom within circlets of yellow rock, and tiny, baby Magikarp drift through aimlessly. One looks up upon seeing your shadow and hurries on past.<br />
<br />
For a long while (as everything seems to be with this Slowpoke), nothing of note happens. You simply stare into the pond until time starts to lose meaning. It is at this point, just when you start to wonder if this is worth it, when a deep, gravelly voice speaks up behind you. <br />
<br />
Only… not quite.<br />
<br />
No words are spoken aloud; the serenity of the surroundings unbroken. You, and only you, feel a twinge in the back of your brain. A little pulse, just before this voice – deep, rich as the finest chocolate, and so incredibly foreign – speaks directly into your mind: <i>“Soooo… What are we looking at?”</i><br />
<br />
You start at the suddenness of it, tipping forward towards the drink; only a grip tight at the back of your shirt stops you from belly flopping. The grip pulls you backwards, onto your rear and away from the pond. You turn to see who saved you from an impromptu bath, but there’s no one there. No physical hand had helped you. Again, you hear the low voice enter your mind. <i>“Whoa, there, friend. That was a close one.”</i> <br />
<br />
Looking around, trying to find a source of this mental intrusion, you immediately notice the Slowpoke has vanished. You notice this, because in its place stands an upright being: equally pink and very similar in body type to the Slowpoke but with a ruffled red-and-white collar and a large, ornate spiked headpiece. You don’t know much about this Pokémon but having just read about Slowpoke from your Pokedex, it is unmistakable as its evolution:

<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: grey">Finally arrived at the fist hut, completely out of breath (maybe she should’ve kept her Corsola in her Pokéball after all), Mélina’s face distorted in worry, as Hank was nowhere to be found, outside or inside. Did she arrive too late? In her frantic search of the old well-built harbormaster, she overheard a conversation happening behind closed doors, the “Employees Only” door in fact. Curious, the girl paid more attention to it. Although she couldn’t make out any words from it, she definitely could recognise the undistinguishable caw of a Wingull.<br />
<br />
“Awilda! Thank Arceus,” Mélina almost collapsed in relief. Hank was simply still talking to his brother, literally behind closed doors.<br />
<br />
With that weight off her shoulders, the trainer thought the best thing to do now was to look around the place until Hank was done chatting. Looking over the main counter, she spotted one very startled cashier, barely able to keep his balance on his chair - probably because she showed up so suddenly. After recovering from the surprise, he then went into a heavily accented and enthusiastic sell pitch mode. Since she had nothing else to do and happened to have saved up quite a bit of money lately, Mélina decided to shop around a little while chatting with him.<br />
<br />
“That‘s a strong smell! Quite soothing. I’m actually here to meet up with the owner’s brother, Hank, but since they’re caught up in a chat, I’m sure a little bit of shoppin’ wouldn’t hurt!”<br />
<br />
First thing Mélina noticed was all the fishing equipment, to no surprise. She couldn’t tell at all if any of it was of good quality, but there was definitely a good variety of types and brands. Perhaps she should ask for some help on the selection. There was also plenty of clothing, accessories, even random fish-themed babbles as souvenirs, likely for non-fishermen visitors. With her trained eye though, she was able to easily spot the <i>real, good stuff</i>.<br />
<br />
“Fresh water, Damp Rocks, Luminous Moss, Net, Dive and Lure Balls, water-typed TMs… that’s a pretty good selection,” she nodded in approval. “Quite a few things that interests me, actually! I would definitely like to look into those sales you talked about.”<br />
<br />
First, she walked up to the fishing equipment section, specifically in between the line of rods and the lure display. “For starters, I’m looking for a good, generic lure and a new, good quality-price rod. A bit of an upgrade from what I got right now,” she turned to her side a bit, showing her current fishing rod tied on the side of her backpack. “Got any good recommendations?”<br />
<br />
She then pointed the glass counter where all the TMs were shown. “What’s your selection on TMs? I see Surf and Dive in there, I’ll probably going to need those soon,” she smiled. “Oh, and which ones have a discount?”<br />
<br />
Afterwards, she walked over the shelves of Pokéballs. “I do love Pokéballs, in fact I collect them! Got more than 50 models of ‘em right now,” Mélina chuckled, not sure herself for being proud or embarrassed. “Of course I already got the common ones like Net, Dive and Lure ones, but this one there...” she lifted her head, her nose pointing at the mysterious, blue and black ‘A’ Ball, “what is <i>that</i> one!? I’m never seen one like that! Was it custom-made?” As soon as she said those last two words, she wondered if ‘custom-made Pokéballs’ would make a good new line of services for her Boutique.<br />
<br />
Finally, she couldn’t help wanting to get something for her new friend in her arms. “Hey girl, you feeling ok? You’ve been out of the water for a while now, haven’t you?”<br />
<br />
“Corso!” The Corsola perked up, which besides missing all but one of her branches, didn’t seem to be bothered from being out of her element for that long.<br />
<br />
“Well I know you need to to recover, so better start sooner than later, no?“ The trainer then walked to the vending machine with the Fresh Water bottles. “Besides, if we’re going to help your family and friends, we might want to stock up a bit on these...”</span><br />

<div style="margin-left: 20px"><span style="color: gray"><span style="color: gray">You check your Pokedex for information about the so-called Dopey Pokémon, and what you find does not seem promising. At the least, not what you’re really looking for. Still, it is rude to just walk away without a word, so you tell the Slowpoke of your search and ask it if it has seen any Psychic-types that fit the bill.<br />
<span style="color: gray"><span style="color: gray"><br />
For a moment, nothing happens as the Slowpoke stares silently off into space, breathing out fishy breath at odd intervals. You start to wonder if it even heard you or if it really is that slow, when the pink head dips down in a small nod. The Slowpoke slowly turns its gaze up until it looks you square in the eye, after which it turns and starts for the pond. It moves at honestly a quicker pace than you expected, given what you read. You aren’t familiar with them though, so you don’t pay that much mind; it might be normal behavior for all you are aware. That train of thought distracts you for a moment or two, enough to cause the Slowpoke to stop about halfway the short, remaining distance to the pond and look back questioningly. It seems it wants you to follow it.<br />
<br />
Hesitantly you do, gathering Meringue back into your arms. You quickly catch up and trail behind the Slowpoke’s shuffling walk (it is, after all, still a Slowpoke) until it reaches the pond’s edge. Flopping down lazily onto the ground, the Slowpoke dips its head down and stares into the clear water. After another moment in which you wait for some sort of answer, it turns its head to look at you again questioningly. Unsure what is happening, you give a little shrug sharing a glance with your Togepi and continue this game of follow-the-leader.<br />
<br />
Kneeling near the Slowpoke, Meringue and yourself bend over to peer down into the pond. It is crystal clear, despite the pinkish tone the setting sun seems to have given everything around, and in in any other instance this would be a very pretty picture. Pond weeds, just beginning to bud, sway gently along the bottom within circlets of yellow rock, and tiny, baby Magikarp drift through aimlessly. One looks up upon seeing your shadow and hurries on past.<br />
<br />
For a long while (as everything seems to be with this Slowpoke), nothing of note happens. You simply stare into the pond until time starts to lose meaning. It is at this point, just when you start to wonder if this is worth it, when a deep, gravelly voice speaks up behind you. <br />
<br />
Only… not quite.<br />
<br />
No words are spoken aloud; the serenity of the surroundings unbroken. You, and only you, feel a twinge in the back of your brain. A little pulse, just before this voice – deep, rich as the finest chocolate, and so incredibly foreign – speaks directly into your mind: <i>“Soooo… What are we looking at?”</i><br />
<br />
You start at the suddenness of it, tipping forward towards the drink; only a grip tight at the back of your shirt stops you from belly flopping. The grip pulls you backwards, onto your rear and away from the pond. You turn to see who saved you from an impromptu bath, but there’s no one there. No physical hand had helped you. Again, you hear the low voice enter your mind. <i>“Whoa, there, friend. That was a close one.”</i> <br />
<br />
Looking around, trying to find a source of this mental intrusion, you immediately notice the Slowpoke has vanished. You notice this, because in its place stands an upright being: equally pink and very similar in body type to the Slowpoke but with a ruffled red-and-white collar and a large, ornate spiked headpiece. You don’t know much about this Pokémon but having just read about Slowpoke from your Pokedex, it is unmistakable as its evolution:

Makoto twitched in shock from the sudden voice he heard behind him. Stranger still, he swore he didn’t actually hear the voice. Was his mind making him hear things? No time to think about that, however, when he was flopping right into the pond! Makoto closed his eyes and clutched his companion, bracing for impact…<br />
<br />
…But where was the splash? Something was tugging at his shirt, pulling him away from the pond and right onto his bottom. He opened his eyes and turned behind him. Did his rescuer already leave? …Could it be telekinesis? But he hasn’t seen any pokemon or humans with powers like his. But there was another pink creature where the slowpoke was before, standing upright with a shell crown on its head. Its posture and expression seemed much more composed than that slowpoke’s.<br />
<br />
“Did you just… evolve?” Makoto replied, “…Into a psychic-type?” Makoto’s bewilderment lingered for a bit, only to give way to excitement. Finally, he had found what he was looking for. And an <i>evolved</i> psychic-type, no less! Makoto’s anticipation rose. He was ready to prove himself to this pokemon in a ba-<br />
<br />
Wait, an <i>evolved</i> psychic-type. Bad idea, bad idea. A powerful, intelligent, second-stage pokemon against the small, stubby eggshell pokemon curled in his arms, arms that began shaking as he imagined the harm that could come to Meringue. But they did seem friendly. Maybe they could work something else out. He never specified that his mentor would need to be a <i>human</i>, after all.<br />
<br />
“In that case… um…” His words skittered back into his voice box, nervous to meet this stranger. He tried comforting them with a deep breath. “M-Maybe you can help me…with… my powers…” His eyes were nowhere near making contact with the slowking. “I’m, um, I’m a psychic too.”<br />

<br />
<div style="margin-left: 20px">As you finish pointing out what interests you and asking questions over the merchandise, the clerk lets out a pleased bark of laughter. “Oh ho! Ya got a nice eye there, lass. Well,” and gestures you to come to the counter, “let’s see wha’ we can do for ya t’day.” <br />
<br />
The man steps out from behind the counter and heads over to a large rack of rods. He skims over the display a moment before gathering a few items into his arms and returning. The clerk places them down on the counter in front of you, setting down a box of colorful looking lures and a pink fishing rod, keeping the remaining one in his hand. <br />
<br />
“So,” he starts, holding the rod in his grip out to you. As you look you see it’s a very short thing, orange in color with a gradual gradient along the handle down to a pale tan. “If’n it’s a nice, <b>good rod</b> you’s looking for, this’d be about the best ya could ask for. It’s a retractable rod for better storage,” he said, stretching out the pole; now that it’s fully extended, you can see some markings along the shaft: a yellow ring and two blue fin-shapes, giving it an appearance not too dissimilar to the Buizel you saw napping outside. Suddenly, then, he whaps it on the edge of the counter before showing how it doesn’t even have a scratch. “It’s extra durable too. Guaranteed not t’ break under normal use, but if it does, bring in the pieces an’ we’ll give ya a new one.<br />
<br />
“Now, tha’ one would cost ya <b>$500</b>, but for just a lil’ bit more at <b>$750</b> ya could get one o’ our <b>super rods</b>.” Setting the Good Rod down onto the counter, the clerk picks up the pink rod, which you now see has a white tip not unlike a Slowpoke tail. “It’s a bit longer an’ a bit more flexible, which are good things in a rod. Plus, the spool on these is larger for longer casts into the deeper parts o’ the water. Let’s ya sometimes catch some rarer things, that does. Jus’ as sturdy though, an’ it has the same policy as the good rod.”<br />
<br />
Again, he sets the rod down, and this time he simply leans against the counter rather than picking anything up. “Each o’ our rods’ll come with one o’ our basic lures here in this box, your choice, and at half-off any extra o’ these would cost only <b>$5</b>. Them’s so cheap ‘cause they don’t do none o’ that blinking or shaking fancier ones do, but sometimes less is better than more. Of these, we got jus’ about any type o’ fish Pokémon ya could think of: ol’ fashioned Magikarp, Goldeen, a few Bruxish, some Wishiwashi…” He points to each as he talks, showing you the wide variety, before pausing a chuckling to himself. “That last one’s my personal favorite, ‘cause it’s actually to scale of its flesh-&amp;-fin counterpart. You ain’t never fished until you find a full school o’ Wishiwashi thinking your lure’s one o’ them. Now <i>that</i> was a fun time.”<br />
<br />
The clerk gets a faraway look to his gaze, lost in thought of this supposed fun time, but it’s only a moment before he seems to remember you and shouts out. “Oh! And you was wondering ‘bout the TMs. Give me jus’ a mo.” He bends down a little and digs something out from underneath the counter: a rather large, multi-layered TM case. Unlocking it, he turns it around to show you the stock. “Well, we got at least one o’ pretty much every Water-type move them TM makers make. A lot of ‘em are runnin’ on the low side, on account o’ the discounts we’re givin’, but we’ve still got the last o’ this batch. Mind, this batch is the reason for the discounts – we was supposed to be gettin’ those fancy multi-use ones, but somethin’ in ‘em glitched or somethin’ and these don’t work right.” After a beat he realizes what he said and hastily adds, “I mean, they work, don’t worry. Jus’, they only work once before breakin’.”<br />
<br />
A little flustered now, he starts taking the discs out and separating them into piles to better show you. “Well, um, we’ve got a good <b>7 TM Water Gun</b> and <b>5 TM Whirlpool</b>. Neither one’s ever been that popular; they’d run for <b>$150 each</b>. Got <b>2 each</b> of <b>TM Surf and TM Dive</b> like ya saw on the display. The Surf ones’d be <b>$600 each</b> and the Dive ones <b>$500 each</b>. Looks like we got <b>1 TM Waterfall</b> left, that one’d also be <b>$500</b>, and we got <b>1 each of TM Brine and TM Scald</b>. Each of those’d be <b>$600</b>. We got <b>2 TM Rain Dance</b>, the only status move we got – each is <b>$500</b>. An’ it looks like we don’t have any o’ the <b>TM Water Pulse or TM Bubblebeam</b> righ’ here, but if’n you’re wanting either o’ those we’ve got <b>1 of each</b> in the display ya saw I could take out. Those two would be <b>$400 each</b>. An’ all that’s with the discounts, mind.”<br />
<br />
By the end he’s regained his stride for the most part, and he takes a step back to look over the array of things on the counter. “Well, tha’s the rods and the TMs, that jus’ leaves the Poke ball then. Oh, and the <b>Fresh Water</b>,” he corrects as he goes and picks the unique ‘A’ ball off the shelf. “We got loads o’ that; help yourself. Like the sign says, a <b>single bottle is $25</b>, but we could also sell ya <b>5 bottles for $100</b>.<br />
<br />
“Now then, you was asking if’n this was a custom ball, yeah?” the clerk asks as he sets said ball in front of you. “Well, I dunno for sure but I reckon it was. Two months or so back, this big, burly fellow dressed swear-to-God like some wannabe pirate came in with a big box o’ these, called ‘em <b>Aqua Balls</b>. Said he wanted nothin’ t’ do with ‘em any more. Dunno why he didn’t take ‘em up t’ that Poke ball Emporium place in the city – this’d be right up tha’ ol’ Kloet guy’s alley – but we ain’t complaining. Anyway, we used a few an’ experimented with ‘em t’ figure out what they’s good for. Seems they work best on Water- and Dark-types, for whatever reason. Now, this is the last we has of ‘em period, so I don’t think I can let it go for anythin’ less than <b>$1000</b>.” <br />
<br />
All your questions finally answered, the clerk leans an arm down against the counter. “So, what do ya think you’ll be wanting then? Or do ya have any other questions?”<br />
<br />
<i>(Updater Note: If you have any questions of things you don’t want to RP or want clarifications on any of the prices &amp; such, let me know in Discord and I can try to answer them.)</i>&#8203;</div></span><br />

<div style="margin-left: 20px">Following your initial question, the Slowking’s stout frame shakes as lets out a low chuckle, something slightly disorienting as you hear the laugh both aloud and within your mind. He holds off, though, until you finish, only then musing <i>“Are we not all in a constant state of evolution?”</i> He gives a shake of the head, clearing his thoughts, before he turns and takes you in, looking you and Meringue over. Not, really, that you notice given how determinedly you are staring at everything but the Slowking.<br />
<br />
A long moment passes in, as felt by you at least, an awkward silence until it finally breaks. <i>“I suppose,”</i> the Slowking says, slowly. <i>“You do hold potential, I’ll grant you that. I could sense you from as far away as the carnival. I don’t normally take apprentices, humans even less so… but this is not the first I’ve been asked that today. I’d say that’s a sign if there ever was one.”</i> <br />
<br />
The Slowking raises a pink, clawed paw up to his chin, rubbing it in thought. <i>“Yes,”</i> he says after another long moment. <i>“Yes, I just might…”</i> You feel a warmth brush against your face, centered under your chin, almost as if a hand were tilting your head up, bringing your gaze finally to the Slowking, who stands regally with hands clasped behind him. He locks his gaze with yours, and, though you feel no actual intrusion into your mind, you feel a shiver run down your spine as it seems like he peers directly into your very soul. <i>“…But you have something to prove don’t you?”</i><br />
<br />
Your chin is released, and you see the Slowking’s eyes close in concentration. Not seconds pass before you hear a tiny pop, and where there was empty air near the Slowking and yourself floats an

Abra. The small Psychic-type looks amid you and the Slowking with a mix of trepidation and hope in its expression.<br />
<br />
The Slowking steps between you and Abra, back to the pond. Lowering himself into a sitting position, he gestures out with his paw. <i>“Fate has brought both of you to me asking for instruction. You both have something you wish to prove. Prove yourselves. Show me your skills, your strengths. Show me who I should instruct.”</i> With a final nod the Slowking quiets, waiting expectantly for you both.<br />
<br />
You glance at the Abra. You see it steel itself for action. What will you do?&#8203;</div></span></div>

</span><br />
<div style="margin-left: 20px"><span style="color: gray">As you finish pointing out what interests you and asking questions over the merchandise, the clerk lets out a pleased bark of laughter. “Oh ho! Ya got a nice eye there, lass. Well,” and gestures you to come to the counter, “let’s see wha’ we can do for ya t’day.”<br />
<span style="color: gray"><br />
The man steps out from behind the counter and heads over to a large rack of rods. He skims over the display a moment before gathering a few items into his arms and returning. The clerk places them down on the counter in front of you, setting down a box of colorful looking lures and a pink fishing rod, keeping the remaining one in his hand. <br />
<br />
“So,” he starts, holding the rod in his grip out to you. As you look you see it’s a very short thing, orange in color with a gradual gradient along the handle down to a pale tan. “If’n it’s a nice, <b>good rod</b> you’s looking for, this’d be about the best ya could ask for. It’s a retractable rod for better storage,” he said, stretching out the pole; now that it’s fully extended, you can see some markings along the shaft: a yellow ring and two blue fin-shapes, giving it an appearance not too dissimilar to the Buizel you saw napping outside. Suddenly, then, he whaps it on the edge of the counter before showing how it doesn’t even have a scratch. “It’s extra durable too. Guaranteed not t’ break under normal use, but if it does, bring in the pieces an’ we’ll give ya a new one.<br />
<br />
“Now, tha’ one would cost ya <b>$500</b>, but for just a lil’ bit more at <b>$750</b> ya could get one o’ our <b>super rods</b>.” Setting the Good Rod down onto the counter, the clerk picks up the pink rod, which you now see has a white tip not unlike a Slowpoke tail. “It’s a bit longer an’ a bit more flexible, which are good things in a rod. Plus, the spool on these is larger for longer casts into the deeper parts o’ the water. Let’s ya sometimes catch some rarer things, that does. Jus’ as sturdy though, an’ it has the same policy as the good rod.”<br />
<br />
Again, he sets the rod down, and this time he simply leans against the counter rather than picking anything up. “Each o’ our rods’ll come with one o’ our basic lures here in this box, your choice, and at half-off any extra o’ these would cost only <b>$5</b>. Them’s so cheap ‘cause they don’t do none o’ that blinking or shaking fancier ones do, but sometimes less is better than more. Of these, we got jus’ about any type o’ fish Pokémon ya could think of: ol’ fashioned Magikarp, Goldeen, a few Bruxish, some Wishiwashi…” He points to each as he talks, showing you the wide variety, before pausing a chuckling to himself. “That last one’s my personal favorite, ‘cause it’s actually to scale of its flesh-&amp;-fin counterpart. You ain’t never fished until you find a full school o’ Wishiwashi thinking your lure’s one o’ them. Now <i>that</i> was a fun time.”<br />
<br />
The clerk gets a faraway look to his gaze, lost in thought of this supposed fun time, but it’s only a moment before he seems to remember you and shouts out. “Oh! And you was wondering ‘bout the TMs. Give me jus’ a mo.” He bends down a little and digs something out from underneath the counter: a rather large, multi-layered TM case. Unlocking it, he turns it around to show you the stock. “Well, we got at least one o’ pretty much every Water-type move them TM makers make. A lot of ‘em are runnin’ on the low side, on account o’ the discounts we’re givin’, but we’ve still got the last o’ this batch. Mind, this batch is the reason for the discounts – we was supposed to be gettin’ those fancy multi-use ones, but somethin’ in ‘em glitched or somethin’ and these don’t work right.” After a beat he realizes what he said and hastily adds, “I mean, they work, don’t worry. Jus’, they only work once before breakin’.”<br />
<br />
A little flustered now, he starts taking the discs out and separating them into piles to better show you. “Well, um, we’ve got a good <b>7 TM Water Gun</b> and <b>5 TM Whirlpool</b>. Neither one’s ever been that popular; they’d run for <b>$150 each</b>. Got <b>2 each</b> of <b>TM Surf and TM Dive</b> like ya saw on the display. The Surf ones’d be <b>$600 each</b> and the Dive ones <b>$500 each</b>. Looks like we got <b>1 TM Waterfall</b> left, that one’d also be <b>$500</b>, and we got <b>1 each of TM Brine and TM Scald</b>. Each of those’d be <b>$600</b>. We got <b>2 TM Rain Dance</b>, the only status move we got – each is <b>$500</b>. An’ it looks like we don’t have any o’ the <b>TM Water Pulse or TM Bubblebeam</b> righ’ here, but if’n you’re wanting either o’ those we’ve got <b>1 of each</b> in the display ya saw I could take out. Those two would be <b>$400 each</b>. An’ all that’s with the discounts, mind.”<br />
<br />
By the end he’s regained his stride for the most part, and he takes a step back to look over the array of things on the counter. “Well, tha’s the rods and the TMs, that jus’ leaves the Poke ball then. Oh, and the <b>Fresh Water</b>,” he corrects as he goes and picks the unique ‘A’ ball off the shelf. “We got loads o’ that; help yourself. Like the sign says, a <b>single bottle is $25</b>, but we could also sell ya <b>5 bottles for $100</b>.<br />
<br />
“Now then, you was asking if’n this was a custom ball, yeah?” the clerk asks as he sets said ball in front of you. “Well, I dunno for sure but I reckon it was. Two months or so back, this big, burly fellow dressed swear-to-God like some wannabe pirate came in with a big box o’ these, called ‘em <b>Aqua Balls</b>. Said he wanted nothin’ t’ do with ‘em any more. Dunno why he didn’t take ‘em up t’ that Poke ball Emporium place in the city – this’d be right up tha’ ol’ Kloet guy’s alley – but we ain’t complaining. Anyway, we used a few an’ experimented with ‘em t’ figure out what they’s good for. Seems they work best on Water- and Dark-types, for whatever reason. Now, this is the last we has of ‘em period, so I don’t think I can let it go for anythin’ less than <b>$1000</b>.” <br />
<br />
All your questions finally answered, the clerk leans an arm down against the counter. “So, what do ya think you’ll be wanting then? Or do ya have any other questions?”<br />
<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: gray">Most of the cashier’s description of the items and his stories were met with oohs, aahs and smiles from Mélina. She could tell the salesman was a passionate and truthful one, not messing around and lie just to try to sell. She also thought she found a treasure trove of bargains and rarities within the fishing hut, at least compared to those from the standard stores. She felt a little dumb though as he explained the origins of the unique Pokéball that caught her eye, as she would’ve recognised the ‘A’ symbol as Team Aqua’s. Perhaps it was because it was a little far from her to see the details of that logo (does she need new prescription lens for her glasses?), and that she has seen from pictures in the past their Pokéballs being either <a href="https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/d/d3/TeamAquaBallEXTeamMagmavsTeamAqua75.jpg" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.bulbagarden.net%2Fupload%2Fd%2Fd3%2FTeamAquaBallEXTeamMagmavsTeamAqua75.jpg&amp;hash=f4233552acbbb1a45f13d2ed0f340550" rel="nofollow noopener">white with blue outlines</a> or or <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Team_Aqua%27s_Great_Ball_(Double_Crisis_27)" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbulbapedia.bulbagarden.net%2Fwiki%2FTeam_Aqua%2527s_Great_Ball_%28Double_Crisis_27%29&amp;hash=e476bf613d55e357e857a33974866689" rel="nofollow noopener">half blue half white</a>, instead of the blue and black one standing in front of her. No matter though, the color difference would make it more valuable in her collection! Lightly tapping then rubbing her hands together in anticipation, the shopper went over all the items.<br />
<br />
“I was thinking more of the Good Rod at first, but thinking more about it, I’ll prefer to get the Super Rod instead! It would be a waste of money if I buy the good one only to upgrade to the super one later. Plus, I <i>love</i> that Slowpoke theme going on with it! Very appropriate, and call me girly stereotype, but I dig the pink. As for the lures, well I think it would be cool to have an extra one along the one with the rod… question is, which ones should I pick?” Mélina hummed and tilted her head, thinking which two lures would be best. “...Well Magikarp is a classic prey for many Pokémon, so it would be logical to have one of those to catch different kinds of Pokémon! As for the second one...” she paused some more, “your tale about the school of Wishiwashi sounds a lot of fun, it would be cool to experience that myself! Besides, they’re also a species source of food for others. So, I’ll have one of those!”<br />
<br />
Now looking over the TMs, the woman subtly danced side to side in excitement. “It’s been a while since I wanted to shop for water-type TMs; and with these great prices, it’s the best place to start! Fizzytopia still mostly sells those single-use ones instead of the permanent ones like at home anyways, so why would I skip that opportunity?” Hovering her finger over the piles of technical machines, she started pointing at those she wanted. “I definitely can see how Water Gun isn’t popular, but I’m a little surprised about Whirlpool. Might not be powerful, but not that many Pokémon can learn it naturally, and it can cancel out existing whirlpools! I’ll take three of that one. Next, I’ll take the two Surf and Dive, because I know for a fact they are almost essential for water travel! Only one Waterfall left? Kinda surprised of that, at least for here. Is there waterfalls around? Anyways, I’ll take it! Brine and Scald… Interesting moves, but not really needed. Although Scald could be useful in a pinch...” She paused, unsure. “...I’ll go ahead and pick that one up too. Same goes with Rain Dance, but just one also. And for Water Pulse and Bubblebeam…? I think <i>je vais me garder une petite gêne</i>.* I may be spending a lot, but I still need to keep an eye on my shopping, and stick to the more practical things!”<br />
<br />
“...Except for that Aqua Ball,” she laughed at her own hypocrisy. “Not gonna lie, I have a hard time resisting from making my collection grow, especially seeing rare beauty like this one! I’m definitely buying it before anyone else does!”<br />
<br />
“And last but not least, I’ll go ahead and pick up fifteen bottles of Fresh Water. Don’t know how many Corsola will need help at the reef, but I bet there’s a lot of them! So better take a good stock of them.”<br />
<br />
“Corsola?” her new coral friend perked up on hearing her species’ name.<br />
<br />
“ Mmmhmm. They’ll also be useful for you, to help on your recovery! In fact, I think I’ll give you one as soon as we buy them. I’ll treat you with some of those TMs too!”<br />
<br />
“Coooor!” the pink Pokémon smiled, amazed for all that pampering. Her day was sure full of surprises!<br />
<br />
Mélina smiled back at her, patting her head. “I’ll even introduce you to another of my friends, who’ll learn some moves along with you. But for now, let’s see how much that ‘little’ shopping spree cost me...” she walked to the cash register, then began to list out the items she wanted to buy, and calculated the total with her cellphone:<br />
<br />
<b>x1 Super Rod + Magicarp Lure - $750</b><br />
<b>x1 Whishiwashi Lure - $5</b><br />
<b>x3 TM Whirlpool - $450 ($150 x 3)</b><br />
<b>x2 TM Surf - $1200 ($600 x 2)</b><br />
<b>x2 TM Dive - $1000 ($500 x 2)</b><br />
<b>x1 TM Waterfall - $500</b><br />
<b>x1 TM Scald - $600</b><br />
<b>x1 TM Rain Dance - $500</b><br />
<b>x1 Aqua Ball - $1000</b><br />
<b>x15 Fresh Water - $300 ($100 x 3)</b><br />
<br />
“So if my calculations are right, the total should be…” she pressed on the equal button, “<b><a href="http://forums.upnetwork.net/showpost.php?p=811013&amp;postcount=279" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.upnetwork.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D811013%26postcount%3D279&amp;hash=7da8c7402e607305f96198785d02ca0d" rel="nofollow noopener">six thousand, three hundred and five Pokédollars</a></b>! Wow, that’s gonna leave a mark in my bank account,” she giggled, “but no worries, I’ve saved up enough. Do you accept credit cards?”<br />
<br />
As she pulled out and opened her wallet, the trainer leaned her body to the side and looked over the ‘Employee’s Only’ door, thinking she could either catch a glimpse of Hank or the store’s owner, or try to figure out if ever their conversation was almost over or not. “Geez, are those two always been so chatty like that? Good thing I was able to prep a bit in the meantime. Hmm, that reminds me,” she gazed back to the cashier, “Hank told me earlier something about a ‘little something extra’ if I told his brother he brought me here. Got any idea what’s that about?”</span><br />

You decide to make your way forward, since reaching the sunken back half of the ship is not something Azurill can pull off quite yet. Thus, proceeding to the front of the vessel is the only option, and you hope there is something in the workers' quarters that you can bring back as evidence.<br />
<br />
You make your way over to the door on the north wall of the room; it creaks loudly as it is pushed open, and a long dark corridor appears behind it. But more importantly, a message written in seaweed dangles from the ceiling in the middle of the hallway:<br />
<br />
<i><b>&quot;TURN BACK.&quot;</b></i><br />
<br />
There are doors on both sides of the corridor, each with a name tag on them, long left unreadable by the humidity and salt. But from what you remember of the plan you saw earlier, these should definitely correspond to the rooms of the crew members!<br />
<br />
As you are inspecting the doors, trying to decide which - if any - you should enter, the seaweed forming the ominous warning begins to wave, then twist and turn, as if possessing a life of its own. They move like tentacles, swaying side to side, before withdrawing into a hole on the wooden ceiling...<br />
<br />
<i>*Thump*</i><br />
<br />
Suddenly, something breaks through the wooden planks behind which the seaweed had just vanished; a massive anchor comes crashing down through the ceiling and lands right in front of you, wrapped in algae which look suspiciously sentient. There's no doubt about it - it's a wild

<br />
For a moment, nothing happens besides the heart-stopping stand-off. But then, as if there were any doubts about its intentions, the Dhelmise then lets loose an ear-splitting <b>Metal Sound</b>, before rearing its anchor back... it's going to strike!<br />

He holds off, though, until you finish, only then musing <i>“Are we not all in a constant state of evolution?”</i> He gives a shake of the head, clearing his thoughts, before he turns and takes you in, looking you and Meringue over. Not, really, that you notice given how determinedly you are staring at everything but the Slowking.<br />

A long moment passes in, as felt by you at least, an awkward silence until it finally breaks. <i>“I suppose,”</i> the Slowking says, slowly. <i>“You do hold potential, I’ll grant you that. I could sense you from as far away as the carnival. I don’t normally take apprentices, humans even less so… but this is not the first I’ve been asked that today. I’d say that’s a sign if there ever was one.”</i> <br />
<br />
The Slowking raises a pink, clawed paw up to his chin, rubbing it in thought. <i>“Yes,”</i> he says after another long moment. <i>“Yes, I just might…”</i> You feel a warmth brush against your face, centered under your chin, almost as if a hand were tilting your head up, bringing your gaze finally to the Slowking, who stands regally with hands clasped behind him. He locks his gaze with yours, and, though you feel no actual intrusion into your mind, you feel a shiver run down your spine as it seems like he peers directly into your very soul. <i>“…But you have something to prove don’t you?”</i><br />
<br />
Your chin is released, and you see the Slowking’s eyes close in concentration. Not seconds pass before you hear a tiny pop, and where there was empty air near the Slowking and yourself floats an

Abra. The small Psychic-type looks amid you and the Slowking with a mix of trepidation and hope in its expression.<br />
<br />
The Slowking steps between you and Abra, back to the pond. Lowering himself into a sitting position, he gestures out with his paw. <i>“Fate has brought both of you to me asking for instruction. You both have something you wish to prove. Prove yourselves. Show me your skills, your strengths. Show me who I should instruct.”</i> With a final nod the Slowking quiets, waiting expectantly for you both.<br />
<br />
You glance at the Abra. You see it steel itself for action. What will you do?</span></span>&#8203;</div>

</div>
</blockquote> <span style="color: gray">The slowking agreed to help him. He couldn’t believe it. He already found a tutor!<br />
<br />
…Wait. He had to hold his enthusiasm. There was a catch. Of course there had to be a catch. A stare so precise and unsettling from such an earnest-looking pokemon wouldn’t lie. He shivered slightly with anticipation, wondering how he would need to prove himself to the pink psychic.<br />
<br />
His answer would soon teleport in. An abra’s eyes met his. Did the slowking already have a student? Would the two have to compete for the right to be tutored? His shaking started to intensify.<br />
<br />
Then the slowking’s words echoes in his head. A test of strength. A test of skill. The abra’s eyes meeting his. All of this added up to a pokemon battle!<br />
<br />
The pressure piled on. His anxiety swelled. Why did this have to be his first battle? Why did winning have to be so crucial here? Losing a shot at a wild pokemon, being bested by another trainer, those would have been fine. At least he could try again. But here, he only had one shot. Fail here, and this avenue of mentorship would be permanently closed to him.<br />
<br />
A slight quivering sensation tapped his wrists, silencing his thoughts. <i>“Focus. Stay determined,”</i> he thought, trying to get it together. <i>“Losing just means you won’t be learning from this mentor… the first mentor who talked to you… the only one who isn’t a human. You didn’t have to walk up to a human and ask them anything for this one. This… is only exception you’ll… ever… get.”</i><br />
<br />
And then it fell apart again. His movements were stiffened by hesitation as he lowered Meringue onto the ground. He didn’t want to let go. He didn’t want the battle to start. But he had no choice; only by battling this abra would <i>something</i> happen. He just wanted to get this over with…<br />
<br />
<br />
Reluctantly, he let Meringue loose. <i>“Please just let me win…”</i></span></div>

You decide to make your way forward, since reaching the sunken back half of the ship is not something Azurill can pull off quite yet. Thus, proceeding to the front of the vessel is the only option, and you hope there is something in the workers' quarters that you can bring back as evidence.<br />
<br />
You make your way over to the door on the north wall of the room; it creaks loudly as it is pushed open, and a long dark corridor appears behind it. But more importantly, a message written in seaweed dangles from the ceiling in the middle of the hallway:<br />
<br />
<i><b>&quot;TURN BACK.&quot;</b></i><br />
<br />
There are doors on both sides of the corridor, each with a name tag on them, long left unreadable by the humidity and salt. But from what you remember of the plan you saw earlier, these should definitely correspond to the rooms of the crew members!<br />
<br />
As you are inspecting the doors, trying to decide which - if any - you should enter, the seaweed forming the ominous warning begins to wave, then twist and turn, as if possessing a life of its own. They move like tentacles, swaying side to side, before withdrawing into a hole on the wooden ceiling...<br />
<br />
<i>*Thump*</i><br />
<br />
Suddenly, something breaks through the wooden planks behind which the seaweed had just vanished; a massive anchor comes crashing down through the ceiling and lands right in front of you, wrapped in algae which look suspiciously sentient. There's no doubt about it - it's a wild

For a moment, nothing happens besides the heart-stopping stand-off. But then, as if there were any doubts about its intentions, the Dhelmise then lets loose an ear-splitting <b>Metal Sound</b>, before rearing its anchor back... it's going to strike!<br />

He thinks as he watches the Azurill hops alongside him. The two finally seem to come on the crew member's quarters, with a grim warning made of seaweed hanging from the singing. &quot;Well, either there's some kids trying to scare people or there is a pokemon smart enough to spell this that doesn't want us here.&quot; He says to the Azurill. They press on a little more and seem to find some of the specific doors leading to different member's quarters. He is about to head for one of the doors when there is a massive crash behind him and he sees a Dhelmise all covered in seaweed menacingly sitting there. He slams his hands over his ears in pain as it lets out its Metal Sound. &quot;Fuck!&quot; His curse is drowned out by the noise. When it finally dies down Big glares at the anchor and steps in front of the Azurill. &quot;Stay back little guy, we'll handle this.&quot; He says and throws out the ghost ball holding his own Ghost pokemon to face down the Ghost/Grass opponent. <i>Hotstuff would be too disadvantaged in the environment, and Elsa has a type weakness just as big as her type advantage.</i> He reasons in his head as his Sableye Mysteria appears. &quot;Oh I see. This one thinks he's spooky.&quot; She lets out a creepy witch laugh. &quot;Let me show 'em a real ghost pokemon.&quot; The hairs on the back of Big's neck stand up at the laugh but he shakes it off. &quot;Ok Mysteria, give em a Night Shade and then follow up with astonish and shadow sneak to keep it on its toes.&quot; The ghost types claws already crackle with the ghostly electricity as it prepares the attack.</span></div>

<span style="color: #808080">The Dhelmise in front of you is unnaturally large, the heavy anchor it possesses likely having belonged to a massive warship of some sort way back when. Even the corridor feels almost too small for its size, but that does not prevent it from turning hostile quickly...<br />
<br />
Sensing the danger, you decide to fight back - however, your only seemingly viable partner is your newly-acquired Sableye, Mysteria. Amused at the prospect of engaing a fellow ghost, the jewel demon seems raring to go, and fires off several shadow tendrils at her new enemy.<br />
Dhelmise, in turn, remains static, anchor reared back as if ready to strike, but without so much as attempting to dodge the Night Shade. Darkness envelops it, but when it dissipates, it's as if barely any damage was inflicted. It can't be a good sign...<br />
<br />
And then, it moves.<br />
<br />
The full weight of Dhelmise's gigantic rusty anchor is hurled forward, like a steel torpedo fired off a ghostly submarine. The <b>Anchor Shot</b> finds its mark, smashing Mysteria in the chest with frightneing force and sending her flying against the door that you had just come through. Your partner struggles to get back up and fight back with her Astonish... but falls forward on her face once again, completely unconscious. It's a one-hit KO... what kind of strength does this Dhelmise have?!<br />
<br />
After a moment of tension, when it appears that the ghostly seaweed will turn its attention to <i>you</i>, Dhelmise instead rushes to the door and shatters it open, fleeing to the back of the ship where you are, at least for now, unable to follow.<br />
<br />
Despite this setback, and now knowing you are not alone on this ship, all that remains is for you to make a decision... Do you press onwards and explore the crewmember's quarters, where Dhelmise clearly didn't want you to go, or will you go for another approach? After all, the only thing you need is a little memento from the ship... is it worth incurring in the wrath of such a fearsome foe?</span></div>

<span style="color: #808080">To say that the atmosphere in this neighbourhood is unsettling is an understatement. There is a dizzying mixture of scents in the air, alcohol and tobacco and Arceus knows what else; definitely not the kind of place you’re used to or make a point of revisiting in the future… but still, something keeps you going. Is it a morbid curiosity to see how deep the rabbit hole goes, a latent lust for rewards, or simply kind-hearted concern over the idea of injured Pokemon?...<br />
<br />
Finding Black Velvet Bar proved easy – all you had to do was follow the man. Now, standing in front of the door, you have to wonder what makes this particular joint so special. It’s one of the smaller, less crowded bars in the street; the neon sign above it has seen better days, with many of the red lamps that shape the letters flickering repeatedly, on the verge of going out completely; even the bouncer at the door lacks that all-important air of intimidation, standing about as tall as you but considerably skinnier, with a scrawny unkempt beard that looks more pathetic than imposing.<br />
<br />
“Hey, if you’re just gonna stare, f*** off,” he suddenly barks. Despite not looking the part, he does have a sharp tongue.<br />
<br />
Someone suddenly walks up behind you, bumping into you as if you’re not even there, and keeps walking straight towards the entrance. The customer shares a few whispered words and a laugh with the foul-mouthed bouncer, places a handful of coins in the man’s hand and goes through the door into the Bar. The bouncer stares greedily at the money, stuffs it away in his back pocket and suddenly notices you’re still looking.<br />
<br />
“Hey moth**f***er, the f*** you still doing there? If you ain’t here to drink or do business, scram!!”<br />
<br />
Quite the departure from the man you met before – he might’ve been shady, yes, but he had some manners. Do you still want to go through with this?...</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: gray"><span style="font-size: 12px">The Black Velvet Bar turned out to be the bar Shady Guy had disappeared into. Aiden looked it over, unimpressed by its size, its state, and its bouncer. Well, it wasn't like Shady Guy was big on cash, if his efforts to recruit some random-ass, sober guy was any indication.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, if you're just gonna stare, fuck off,&quot; the bouncer barked and Aiden shot him a wary look before going back to considering the bar. Literally looked like it had seen better days. Did <i>anyone</i> actually come here without a specific reason? He doubted it. It was probably some special meeting place for whatever Shady Guy was involved in.<br />
<br />
He was knocked out of his thoughts when someone ran into him on their way past. As he grabbed at his shoulder, Aiden watched the person walk up to the bouncer, say something, laugh, and then drop a few coins to the bouncer before heading in. Well then. If he needed to bribe the guy to get in, he was probably out of luck. Not that he was <i>surprised</i>, but he wasn't exactly gonna go digging into his <i>own</i> funds for this kind of thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey motherfucker, the fuck you still doing there? If you ain't here to drink or do business, scram!&quot;<br />
<br />
Aiden rolled his eyes as he turned away from the bar, still keeping at least part of his attention on the bouncer in case the guy decided to go after him; he seemed like the type. Shady Guy's offer wasn't worth the effort, though, in his opinion. Not for some vague suggestions of a reward. <i>Maybe</i> not even if he'd offered an <i>actual</i> reward either, but that was more because Aiden didn't exactly want to end up having to get his brother to bail him out. <i>That</i> would be embarrassing.</span></span></div>

<span style="color: rgb(128, 128, 128)"><b>Biggggg5</b>:<br />
</span><br />
<span style="color: #808080">The Dhelmise in front of you is unnaturally large, the heavy anchor it possesses likely having belonged to a massive warship of some sort way back when. Even the corridor feels almost too small for its size, but that does not prevent it from turning hostile quickly...<br />
<br />
Sensing the danger, you decide to fight back - however, your only seemingly viable partner is your newly-acquired Sableye, Mysteria. Amused at the prospect of engaing a fellow ghost, the jewel demon seems raring to go, and fires off several shadow tendrils at her new enemy.<br />
Dhelmise, in turn, remains static, anchor reared back as if ready to strike, but without so much as attempting to dodge the Night Shade. Darkness envelops it, but when it dissipates, it's as if barely any damage was inflicted. It can't be a good sign...<br />
<br />
And then, it moves.<br />
<br />
The full weight of Dhelmise's gigantic rusty anchor is hurled forward, like a steel torpedo fired off a ghostly submarine. The <b>Anchor Shot</b> finds its mark, smashing Mysteria in the chest with frightneing force and sending her flying against the door that you had just come through. Your partner struggles to get back up and fight back with her Astonish... but falls forward on her face once again, completely unconscious. It's a one-hit KO... what kind of strength does this Dhelmise have?!<br />
<br />
After a moment of tension, when it appears that the ghostly seaweed will turn its attention to <i>you</i>, Dhelmise instead rushes to the door and shatters it open, fleeing to the back of the ship where you are, at least for now, unable to follow.<br />
<br />
Despite this setback, and now knowing you are not alone on this ship, all that remains is for you to make a decision... Do you press onwards and explore the crewmember's quarters, where Dhelmise clearly didn't want you to go, or will you go for another approach? After all, the only thing you need is a little memento from the ship... is it worth incurring in the wrath of such a fearsome foe?</span>

<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: #808080">Sizing the Dhelmise up Big notices it is a bit larger than the sizes the pokedex might suggest but he is still somewhat confident that Mysteria can handle it, though not quite as confident as she was. Firing off her Night Shade, as the attack impacts with little effect her confidence turns to confusion while Big's turns into fear. &quot;Get out of there!&quot; Big yells but she was already in the process of starting her Astonish when she is blasted against the door. She doesn't get up. Big turns to the Dhelmise with another pokeball ready to defend himself but the giant anchor pokemon seems to leave, at least for the moment. With it gone Big allows himself only a moment to let out a sigh before digging into his pack for a Revive. He runs over to Mysteria and cracks the small crystal in half, it then dissolves into sparkles which the Sableye inhales. Her eyes flash back to consciousness and she immediately asks. &quot;What the hell was that?&quot; Big just nods, not knowing what she had said and sits for a moment to think. <br />
<br />
After a couple moments, he stands up and turns to face Mysteria and reaches into his pockets to let out the rest of his pokemon. Hotstuff, Geddy, Elsa, Vegeta, and Alucard all appear from their various kinds of pokeballs. &quot;What's going on?&quot; Hotstuff asks, the most off-put by their watery surroundings but also by the fact that they had all been summoned for a task at once. &quot;More importantly, what happened to you?&quot; Alucard asks Mysteria with a chuckle. &quot;Yeah, the Witch hasn't looked this roughed up since, well ever.&quot; Vegeta somewhat sneers. &quot;Mysteria was just defeated in one shot by a Dhelmise that seems to be haunting this shipwreck.&quot; The pokemon all look somewhat surprised at that. &quot;One shot?&quot; Elsa asks, with a twinge of fear in her voice. &quot;Oof, that must've been a big one eh?&quot; Geddy comments. Big nods. &quot;But we need to find something from the ship to take back to prove... Well I'm not sure what we are proving but we are gonna shove it in the face of that lifeguard.&quot; Alucard and Vegeta chuckle approvingly at that with Hotstuff holding back a grin. &quot;The rumors say that the wreck is haunted so the best way to prove we've been here is to bring back the ghost. Are you all in?&quot; The pokemon all nod with mostly grins around. However, Mysteria hasn't said anything yet. Big kneels down in front of her, knowing her pride is probably hurt. &quot;You don't have to face this thing again if you want to rest.&quot; She looks back up at him and her mouth reforms into a grin. &quot;If you didn't want me to get back in the ring you should have left me fainted. Let's... Rectify this...&quot; She chuckles. Big smiles back and stands back up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then. It's going to take everyone to bring this thing down. Hotstuff, Geddy? Elsa? You all remember the Snowdown.&quot; The three pokemon nod. &quot;We are going to tackle this in a similar way. I'm going to tell everyone their moves to use so that the second we see it you don't have to wait for my orders.&quot; Everyone nods once again. &quot;Hotstuff, You are the strongest right now.&quot; Vegeta coughs. Big continues ignoring him. &quot;And you have the best type advantage against most of its moves. So you are going to go in and get in its face with<b> Fire Fang</b> and don't let go. You have to take the hits that no one else can.&quot; The blue charmeleon nods and his tail flame flares up a bit. He turns to Geddy. &quot;Geddy your first priority is to hit it with <b>thunder wave</b>. If we can get it paralyzed then we'll be that much closer to catching it, afterwards hit it with <b>charge beams</b> to build up that boost.&quot; The tynamo nods as well. &quot;Sure thing eh.&quot; Big looks down to Elsa. &quot;Elsa, you have the offensive typing so you are gonna stay back and hit it with I<b>ce Beams</b>.&quot; She nods and her nose twitches in a smile. &quot;Alucard?&quot; &quot;Yes???&quot; The zubat drags out his response with a grin. &quot;Like Geddy, your first job is going to hit it with <b>Supersonic</b>.&quot; &quot;I do hope that's not all you're going to have me do.&quot; &quot;No once it's confused I'll let you have your fun with some <b>Bite</b> attacks.&quot; The zubat grins. &quot;Good.&quot; Big rounds on Vegeta while digging into his bag. &quot;Vegeta. I have good news and bad news. Good news is this.&quot; He pulls out the Very Hot Cross Bun from the holidays. &quot;This will teach you a new move that you will get to use against the Dhelmise.&quot; &quot;And what's the catch?&quot; Vegeta hasn't taken the treat yet and gives Big one of his displeased looks. &quot;The bad news is that you have to start out using <b>growl </b>to try and get its attack down, then you can use <b>Crossfire</b>.&quot; The Chespin sighs and and holds out his paw to take the bun. He eats it to learn the move Crossfire as Big gets back to Mysteria. &quot;We need to keep it one place and touchable to you need to start off with <b>Mean look</b> and then <b>Foresight</b>, then you can dig into it all you want.&quot; She simply nods and goes back to examining her clawed fingers. Big's eyes then land on the Azurill. &quot;You don't have to fight if you dont want to, you can stay next to me out of danger. But if you want to help you can try to use <b>charm </b>and <b>tail whip</b> to keep its stats lowered too.&quot; He offers to the young pokemon. &quot;Okay, we all know the plan. Let's go after this thing and take it down!&quot; He says and the pokemon give a small cheer as they head off in search.</span></div>

<div style="margin-left: 20px">You politely listen through the passionate sales-pitch, reacting in all the appropriate places despite being a little dumbfounded you didn’t immediately recognize the Aqua Ball (though, truth be told, you aren’t terribly bothered given the opportunity for a new collectible).<br />
<br />
Upon the clerk’s completion, you take your turn to speak, going through what he offered and making your decisions on purchases. For each item you decide on, he takes it and scans and bags it, occasionally making a comment, like answering the question you pose within your choosing TMs. “Waterfalls? No, there aren’t really any ‘round these parts, at least above ground here at the coast - s’why we didn’t order more o’ those.”<br />
<br />
Smiling at your interactions with your new friend, the clerk finishes ringing up and bagging your purchase as you do the math. “Aye, we’ll accept credit cards,” he answers your question, lifting a card reader from underneath the counter and sliding it across for you to use. “And yep, $6,305 ‘ll be your total.”<br />
<br />
You complete the transaction, earning a smile with the accompanying bag of goodies. It quickly turns into a thoughtful frown at your question of Hank and his brother. “Aye, those two’ll gab for ages if ya let ‘em. Can’t right say what ol’ Hank meant about that though.” The sound of a door opening comes from behind you, and the cashier’s gaze shifts towards it. “Seems you got the perfect time t’ ask him though. Oi, Hank!” he calls out. Turning to the sound, you do in fact see Hank leaving the ‘Employee’s only’ quarters, a latched metal case tucked under his arm. “What did ya mean when ya told the lass she might get somethin’ extra?”<br />
<br />
Hank looks confused for a moment before he spots you and understanding crosses his face. “Oh, just an attempt to drum up some business for you on a slow day.”<br />
<br />
“Making promises in my stead again, are you, Hank?” Another man follows Hank out from the back, hobbling out on a pair of crutches. Though he looks a decade or so younger than Hank, between the complexion and the wild hair pulled back in ponytail there is a very clear family resemblance. This could only be his brother.<br />
<br />
“No,” Hank retorts with a grin, “just mindful of my kind-hearted younger brother, welcoming any customer he might get.”<br />
<br />
“Just ‘cause you aren’t wrong doesn’t mean you still should.” Hank’s brother rolls his eyes and extends a hand towards you, balancing on his other crutch. “Just ignore him. I take it you are the woman he convinced to help him out? M’name is Frank Thatcher, pleasure is mine. And yes, I’m really called Frank when he is Hank. Wasn’t one of my better decisions, but it’s still better than my given name. Francis,” he adds as an aside, scrunching his nose in distaste.<br />
<br />
“I still say it’s a pity Edmund couldn’t find a nickname to match,” Hank chortles. “Would’a made the three of us quite a trio. Our other brother,” he clarifies to you.<br />
<br />
“Would’ve been confusing as hell, more like.” Frank shakes his head in exasperation. “Well, I don’t know what my brother’s promised you, but if you’re planning on going to help him out, I might actually have something for you. As my thanks for helping him; I’d’ve gone myself if it weren’t for this,” he says, lifting a crutch, before heading back to the back wall leaving you and Hank to follow. He points out some

scuba gear for Hank to pull off the wall, and soon it is passed to you. “That’s Devon brand dive gear. Good quality stuff, that. Don’t know for sure if you’ll need it or not, but it and whatever wetsuit you see that you like and that fits is on me, like I said, for being willing to have my brother’s back when I’m not going to be able to.”<br />
<br />
“And there’s my sap of a brother,” Hank grins, dodging out of the way when Frank bats a crutch at him. “Well miss, like Frank said, pick out whatever suit you like, and then I’ll lead you to the boat we’ll be taking.”<br />
<br />
<i>(I’m ending it here so you can react to things before we continue onward. Like I implied, the wetsuit to go with the Devon Scuba Gear can be whatever design you want. Let your creativity guide you. Also, if you’ve any questions for Hank over anything, now would be the time to ask them to be answered in the walk to the boat.)</i>&#8203;</div></span><br />

<div style="margin-left: 20px">Enthusiasm turns quickly to terror as the task and its stakes begin to dawn on you. A battle is all that stands between you and your desired tutor – and you have no idea if you might find another should you lose. There’s a quiver at your wrists that almost causes you to calm yourself, but nerves grip you tight and you succumb to the fears seizing your mind. You don’t want to battle, but do you really have a choice? Very reluctantly, you place Meringue onto the ground before you, praying for victory.<br />
<br />
You don’t issue any commands to your Togepi, which causes the Slowking to let out a low <i>’Hmmmmm…’</i> off to your side. There is little time to ponder what that might mean, though, as the Abra moves into action.<br />
<br />
Never leaving its floating position across the clearing from you, the Abra rises into a standing pose, arms thrown out to each side. A pink psychic glow envelops the limbs as the Abra’s eyes glow brightly behind its closed eyelids. The glow enveloping each arm flashes once, brightly… and things start to get weird.<br />
<br />
The psychic energy gathering around the Abra’s arms zips outward at a rapid pace, growing and conjoining into a shimmering dome surrounding this impromptu battlefield, separating all of you from the outside world. Not completely opaque, you can still see outside of this dome, but everything outside is tinted pink to such a degree you can barely pick out other colors. Finished growing above you, the dome continues to wrap around, winding through the grass beneath your feet until meeting up in the space between Meringue and the Abra. The instant this <b>Psychic Terrain</b> settles, it flashes once, sending a pulse surging through its interior. You all gathered inside feel it, and even though your suppressor bracelets stay locked around your wrists, you still feel a tingle of your power escape them, amped up as if you were just plugged into a psychic super-battery.<br />
<br />
Terrain established, the Abra slumps forward slightly from the effort. It quickly hides any sign of weakness, though, straightening as psychic energy crackles and sparks across its fingers. It raises its hands out to the side once more, this time clapping them together before it. A <b>Psy</b>chic <b>Wave</b> ripples outwards from the clasped paws, heading quickly towards Meringue.<br />
<br />
You only have a few seconds to think up a plan. <b>What will you do?</b>&#8203;</div></span></div>

<div style="margin-left: 20px"><span style="color: gray">You politely listen through the passionate sales-pitch, reacting in all the appropriate places despite being a little dumbfounded you didn’t immediately recognize the Aqua Ball (though, truth be told, you aren’t terribly bothered given the opportunity for a new collectible).<br />
<span style="color: gray"><br />
Upon the clerk’s completion, you take your turn to speak, going through what he offered and making your decisions on purchases. For each item you decide on, he takes it and scans and bags it, occasionally making a comment, like answering the question you pose within your choosing TMs. “Waterfalls? No, there aren’t really any ‘round these parts, at least above ground here at the coast - s’why we didn’t order more o’ those.”<br />
<br />
Smiling at your interactions with your new friend, the clerk finishes ringing up and bagging your purchase as you do the math. “Aye, we’ll accept credit cards,” he answers your question, lifting a card reader from underneath the counter and sliding it across for you to use. “And yep, $6,305 ‘ll be your total.”<br />
<br />
You complete the transaction, earning a smile with the accompanying bag of goodies. It quickly turns into a thoughtful frown at your question of Hank and his brother. “Aye, those two’ll gab for ages if ya let ‘em. Can’t right say what ol’ Hank meant about that though.” The sound of a door opening comes from behind you, and the cashier’s gaze shifts towards it. “Seems you got the perfect time t’ ask him though. Oi, Hank!” he calls out. Turning to the sound, you do in fact see Hank leaving the ‘Employee’s only’ quarters, a latched metal case tucked under his arm. “What did ya mean when ya told the lass she might get somethin’ extra?”<br />
<br />
Hank looks confused for a moment before he spots you and understanding crosses his face. “Oh, just an attempt to drum up some business for you on a slow day.”<br />
<br />
“Making promises in my stead again, are you, Hank?” Another man follows Hank out from the back, hobbling out on a pair of crutches. Though he looks a decade or so younger than Hank, between the complexion and the wild hair pulled back in ponytail there is a very clear family resemblance. This could only be his brother.<br />
<br />
“No,” Hank retorts with a grin, “just mindful of my kind-hearted younger brother, welcoming any customer he might get.”<br />
<br />
“Just ‘cause you aren’t wrong doesn’t mean you still should.” Hank’s brother rolls his eyes and extends a hand towards you, balancing on his other crutch. “Just ignore him. I take it you are the woman he convinced to help him out? M’name is Frank Thatcher, pleasure is mine. And yes, I’m really called Frank when he is Hank. Wasn’t one of my better decisions, but it’s still better than my given name. Francis,” he adds as an aside, scrunching his nose in distaste.<br />
<br />
“I still say it’s a pity Edmund couldn’t find a nickname to match,” Hank chortles. “Would’a made the three of us quite a trio. Our other brother,” he clarifies to you.<br />
<br />
“Would’ve been confusing as hell, more like.” Frank shakes his head in exasperation. “Well, I don’t know what my brother’s promised you, but if you’re planning on going to help him out, I might actually have something for you. As my thanks for helping him; I’d’ve gone myself if it weren’t for this,” he says, lifting a crutch, before heading back to the back wall leaving you and Hank to follow. He points out some

scuba gear for Hank to pull off the wall, and soon it is passed to you. “That’s Devon brand dive gear. Good quality stuff, that. Don’t know for sure if you’ll need it or not, but it and whatever wetsuit you see that you like and that fits is on me, like I said, for being willing to have my brother’s back when I’m not going to be able to.”<br />
<br />
“And there’s my sap of a brother,” Hank grins, dodging out of the way when Frank bats a crutch at him. “Well miss, like Frank said, pick out whatever suit you like, and then I’ll lead you to the boat we’ll be taking.”<br />
<br />
<i>(I’m ending it here so you can react to things before we continue onward. Like I implied, the wetsuit to go with the Devon Scuba Gear can be whatever design you want. Let your creativity guide you. Also, if you’ve any questions for Hank over anything, now would be the time to ask them to be answered in the walk to the boat.)</i></span></span>&#8203;</div>

</blockquote><span style="color: gray">The ‘lass’ had a very hard time to stifle her laughter as she listened over the banter between Hank and his brother, who introduced himself as Frank. Seemed like that little ‘extra something’ from the fish hut owner wasn’t planned over at all, but he still ended up offering Mélina some diving gear for helping his teasing brother out in his place.<br />
<br />
“I completely forgot about scuba gear!” the woman slapped her palm on her forehead. “Without it, those Dive technical machines wouldn’t be as useful.” With both hands, she picked up the Devon Scuba Gear from Hank’s. “Thank you so much! I’ll make sure I do my best to help out. Before we go though, I better pick up the suit, too!”<br />
<br />
She walked over the racks of wetsuits, and first thing she looked for was for the sizes. She jumped for joy as she found out plus sizes were available! “It’s easier to shop here than at normal stores,” she chuckled to herself, low-key praising the fishing hut’s wares. Rubbing her chin, and feeling a little pressured of making her choice quickly, she decided to ask for some expert opinion. Plucking out two Pokéballs - one white with red outlines, another black and gold with a ruby button - and released their residents.<br />
<br />
“Corsola, meet some of my friends!” the girl gently dropped the pink Pokémon in front of them. “The Pikachu is Starlette, and the Feebas is Lucette! Both of them have a thing for clothes and fashion.” The Pokémon all greeted each other happily, although the shy coral Pokémon was a little hesitant. “Can you two help me out? I’m getting a wetsuit… and I don’t feel like taking forever choosing which one.”<br />
<br />
Knowing her trainer’s habits, Starlette nodded with a slightly mocking look, but immediately started to work through the different wetsuits along with Lucette. After inspecting them all followed by a little debate with each other - including Corsola, probably asking for her own opinion or perhaps insight on which colors work best underwater - they settled the choice on a Milotic-inspired suit: mostly colored dark blue with a black diamond scale pattern reminiscent to the Tender Pokémon’s tail, although a few random ‘scales’ and the long sleeves sported a dark pink hue, again reflecting on the serpent’s tail, but also on its hair-like fins. The trainer went in the changing room to test it, and lo and behold, it was a perfect fit!<br />
<br />
“I think I know who had the most say in that choice,” Mélina grinned in the Feebas’ direction. “I approve though! I’m definitely picking this one. Thanks girls!”<br />
<br />
All the Pokémon celebrated a little while the trainer went back in the cabin change back to her normal clothes. After she got out, she called back the Cosplay Pikachu in her ball, leaving Lucette out, to her confusion.<br />
<br />
“Oh! I actually still need you for a few more things!” the woman started to explain the moment she noticed her expression. “We’ll be going out at sea soon, so along with Corsola, you’ll make a good team to work in the water!”<br />
<br />
The Feebas’ eyes looked down on the floor, her fins discouragingly flopped on it.<br />
<br />
“Awwwwww no, don’t be sad,” Mélina rubbed the fish’s head. “I know you don’t know that many moves at the moment. That’s why I just bought a few things for you to help!”<br />
<br />
The fish suddenly perked up and Corsola looked over in awe, as her trainer pulled out discs from her shopping bag.<br />
<br />
“That’s right - more moves for you! I… admittedly have no idea how these work,” she embarrassingly smiled, “but I’ll figure it out!”<br />
<br />
After some poking around and trial and error, Mélina managed to use a <b>TM Whirlpool</b> by popping the discs out of their case and on top of Lucette’s head. After a little cheer for solving how to do it, the trainer proceeded to use other technical machines on the Feebas: <b>Surf, Dive, and Scald</b>.<br />
<br />
“I’m not quite done yet! I got a few things for you too, Corsola!”<br />
<br />
While the pink pokémon shuffled in delight, Mélina puts aside the second Whirlpool technical machine and one bottle of Fresh Water. She then took her backpack off her back, stuffed Devon diving device, the wetsuit and the shopping bag with the other items in there, then pulled out a pink-colored disc along with a blue, teardrop-shaped necklace.<br />
<br />
“I don’t have any regrets keeping these, even though I didn’t have any use of them before,” she giggled, not wondering one bit why she’s a bit of a hoarder. “It’ll be probably useful for you today against Mareanie, especially that TM. I heard it’s a bit powerful and it’s likely going out of your comfort zone, but I think you’ll be able to pull it off just fine. And if it doesn’t work out, that’ll be fine! Your water-based moves will be stronger with the Mystic Water.”<br />
<br />
As Mélina was stared at with Corsola’s shining eyes, she used on her the <b>TM Whirlpool</b> and the <b><a href="http://forums.upnetwork.net/showpost.php?p=814647&amp;postcount=11" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.upnetwork.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D814647%26postcount%3D11&amp;hash=a1d6f1fe62e24452016148a3fcd03086" rel="nofollow noopener">TM Psychic</a></b> she pulled out, then placed the <b>Mystic Water</b> around her last coral branch. Finally, she gave her the <b>Fresh Water</b> to drink, which would hopefully help her grow her branches, or at least give her a little energy boost for any outcomes of their investigation.<br />
<br />
“There, that should do it.” She looked over Hank, who was likely chatting with Frank some more or simply watching what she was doing. “I think we’re all set up and ready to go now!”<br />
<br />
With a nod and some quick goodbyes to Frank and the clerk, the ex-QA consultant and her Pokémon walked on the docks, the harbormaster leading the way towards his boat. As there was not much going on, and they would probably be too busy while sailing, Mélina took the opportunity to ask the old man some questions.<br />
<br />
“Say, how was the area where the Corsola lived before the Mareanie outbreak happened? I hope it hasn’t been too damaged… Have you seen for yourself their attacks? I wonder if something was off about them by any chance, besides their aggressiveness, that could maybe give us a clue on what’s going on. All I know is that the one we fought against was pretty determined on getting Corsola here, even if she only had one healthy branch left and had two trained Pokémon against it. And...”<br />
<br />
She hesitated asking the last couple of questions, as they were a little bit more personal, but her curiosity couldn’t help to ask anyways. “Say, I’m sorry if these goes a little bit too personal, and I won’t take it badly if you don’t want to answer them, but... I’m wondering what your older brother… Edmund I think? Well, what is he doing at the moment? I would’ve thought all three of you would work together. And… why is Frank in crutches? I hope whatever happened to him wasn’t too bad...”</span><br />

</span><br />
<div style="margin-left: 20px"><span style="color: gray">Enthusiasm turns quickly to terror as the task and its stakes begin to dawn on you. A battle is all that stands between you and your desired tutor – and you have no idea if you might find another should you lose. There’s a quiver at your wrists that almost causes you to calm yourself, but nerves grip you tight and you succumb to the fears seizing your mind. You don’t want to battle, but do you really have a choice? Very reluctantly, you place Meringue onto the ground before you, praying for victory.<br />
<span style="color: gray"><br />
You don’t issue any commands to your Togepi, which causes the Slowking to let out a low <i>’Hmmmmm…’</i> off to your side. There is little time to ponder what that might mean, though, as the Abra moves into action.<br />
<br />
Never leaving its floating position across the clearing from you, the Abra rises into a standing pose, arms thrown out to each side. A pink psychic glow envelops the limbs as the Abra’s eyes glow brightly behind its closed eyelids. The glow enveloping each arm flashes once, brightly… and things start to get weird.<br />
<br />
The psychic energy gathering around the Abra’s arms zips outward at a rapid pace, growing and conjoining into a shimmering dome surrounding this impromptu battlefield, separating all of you from the outside world. Not completely opaque, you can still see outside of this dome, but everything outside is tinted pink to such a degree you can barely pick out other colors. Finished growing above you, the dome continues to wrap around, winding through the grass beneath your feet until meeting up in the space between Meringue and the Abra. The instant this <b>Psychic Terrain</b> settles, it flashes once, sending a pulse surging through its interior. You all gathered inside feel it, and even though your suppressor bracelets stay locked around your wrists, you still feel a tingle of your power escape them, amped up as if you were just plugged into a psychic super-battery.<br />
<br />
Terrain established, the Abra slumps forward slightly from the effort. It quickly hides any sign of weakness, though, straightening as psychic energy crackles and sparks across its fingers. It raises its hands out to the side once more, this time clapping them together before it. A <b>Psy</b>chic <b>Wave</b> ripples outwards from the clasped paws, heading quickly towards Meringue.<br />
<br />
You only have a few seconds to think up a plan. <b>What will you do?</b></span></span>&#8203;</div>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: grey"><br />
Wait, was the battlefield… transforming? A hazy dome of flowing pink waves? It was like nothing he had seen before. The moment his bracelets began acting up, he knew this technique had something to do with the slowking’s psychic powers. A fancy, enhanced arena for his first battle… Makoto would have felt excitement if the pressure wasn’t oozing right out of his suppressor bracelets. He lost himself in his surroundings…<br />
<br />
Wait, did that abra just stand straight up? And it too was overflowing with power! Makoto gulped. Why didn’t he think of a third option? Couldn’t they have just had a group lesson? Maybe they could have done that if he had thought of it <i>sooner</i>!<br />
<br />
And now the abra was making hand gestures. He was sure it was charging up an attack. An attack that must not land. It could knock Meringue out in one hit if he was unlucky! Well, unluckier than he already was. He needed a plan. But before that, he needed some time.<br />
<br />
“Quick, Protect!” he called out to Meringue. The togepi’s eyes widened upon seeing the incoming attack; Makoto didn’t need to tell him twice to use that move. He immediately formed a barrier around him, trying to shield himself from the Psywave.<br />
<br />
Even if Meringue survives this attack, Makoto would have his work cut out for him here. He would need some way to level the playing field. He couldn’t think of anything to halt the abra’s offense. But maybe he just needed some good fortune. Thus, his next command: “Use Metronome afterward.”</span></div>

On second thought, screw it. You have no reason, and certainly no obligation, to go through with this if it involves dealing with that kind of people and throwing in some of our own cash to get things done. Other than the vague promise of a reward, you decide risking losing a kidney (or both) to the black market isn't worth the hassle.<br />
<br />
But as you turn to leave, someone seems to have quite a different opinion.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will go in there and see this through if you want to live&quot;, whispers a voice in your ear.<br />
<br />
You never saw her coming. Standing immediately in front of you, so close in fact that her lips are directly next to your ear, is a woman in her thirties with blonde hair in a ponytail and dressed as inconspicuously as possible. Although not overtly shady like the man before, you have no doubt that her choice of wardrobe - a completely unadorned dark gray shirt with matching pants - is intended to draw as little attention to her presence as possible. But it's the fact that she managed to sneak up on you without making a sound that truly gives her a scary vibe. That, and the the fact that she has no concept of personal space, if her proximity to you - and the fact that she's rather forcefully grabbing your arm - is any indication.<br />
<br />
&quot;He tried to rope you in, didn't he? You stood there and listened, and that's as good as a signed contract to that guy,&quot; she continues to whisper without letting go. &quot;If you don't show, he'll hunt you down and kill you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The certainty in her words and the ice-cold delivery make you shiver. Who the hell is this woman, and what is she on about?!<br />
<br />
&quot;Take this money and give it to the doorman,&quot; she instructs you as you feel the touch of metal in your right palm. &quot;You'll find a USB drive and a cellphone on your left pocket too. Call the only number on the contact list once you're inside and I'll explain everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, she finally lets you go and walks by you, disappearing down the street without ever turning to look back. Your hand instinctively reaches for your left pocket to find that indeed, both items have somehow been slipped in without you noticing. On your right hand is the money given to you by the woman, $500 Pokedollars meant for the bouncer...<br />
<br />
There's nobody around to force you into a decision, now that you think about it. You are your own man. So... what will it be?<br />
<br />

<span style="color: #808080">If the earlier display of strength is anything to go by, this Dhelmise is unlike anything you've ever faced, at least one-on-one. Realizing this, you call out your entire crew, believing each of your Pokemon can add something to the fight that you are determined to go through with. With that in mind you issue instructions to each of your party members, hoping they will put it all into motion like well-oiled parts of a complex clockwork. It remains to be seen how your team measures up to a foe who vastly outlevels them all...<br />
<br />
Giving chase to Dhelmise, you run back to the room where you previously were, heart pumping in anticipation of the impending struggle. But... the enemy is nowhere in sight! Ghost in nature as it may be, there is no way it could conceal its massive anchor, which can only mean one thing: Dhelmise escaped towards the sunken half of the ship, where you can't follow... is it really worth the trouble of chasing down still?<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Azu! Azurill!!&quot;</i><br />
<br />
You hadn't noticed before, but Azurill hasn't followed the rest of the party. Instead the baby Pokemon stayed behind in the crewman's quarters corridor, and is calling out to you - merely a child's cries for attention, or is it trying to show you something else?<br />
<br />
With no alternative at the moment, you return to where you first met Dhelmise, to find that Azurill has managed to open one of the crewmembers' rooms' door. It hops up and down excitedly, clearly proud of its work, but peering inside, not much seems to be worth your attention...<br />
<br />
It's a completely unremarkable chamber as far as design goes. There's a bed on the right corner, sheets covered in salt and seaweed (this one not haunted, fortunately); there is a wardrobe with a lock on the door, the kind of lock that has no key but is instead opened by a three-digit code; and a small desk on the far wall with a moldy-looking diary on top.<br />
<br />
Is any of this worth your time? Will you linger in this bedroom or look for another way to give chase to Dhelmise?<br />

The party heads after the Dhelmise in hopes of taking it down, but after a short chase, it seems to have already disappeared. &quot;Well, that was anticlimactic.&quot; Alucard prattles off landing on Big's shoulder. &quot;It is a ghost pokemon, it can probably phase through walls and turn invisible easily, at least as one that high level.&quot; Big rubs his chin. They follow all the way to where the rest of the ship is underwater. Big begins to think of his next step when his thoughts are interrupted by the Azurill. He looks and sees that he has opened one of the doors they were headed to before they were interrupted by the ghost. &quot;Good job little guy.&quot; Hotstuff gives a nod to the Azurill, as Big nods in agreement and looks into the room. &quot;Hmm. this diary is probably proof enough.&quot; He reasons, looking around at the rest of the room as he goes to pick it up. His eyes lock on the combination lock to the wardrobe. &quot;Hmm, I wonder if the code might be in this diary.&quot; He goes to look. &quot;If not maybe Mysteria can faze through with her ghostliness or Vegeta can simply break the lock. But let me try to find the code first.&quot; He looks at his party. &quot;Other than that, everyone stay ready, this may be the very thing Dhelmise was guarding, and it won't be happy to find us here if that's the case.&quot; The pokemon all nod and keep lookout and remain on edge for the ghost/grass pokemon. &quot;eith after we get in or if we can't get into the wardrobe then we'll try to get out, no sense in getting you guys more hurt than you need to.&quot; Vegeta and Mysteria look dissapointed but with the adrenaline of the initial encounter wearing off, Big has decided to go with a more cautious approach.</span></div>

After glancing around the seemingly unremarkable room, you decide to give it a chance and step inside to investigate further. After all, Azurill did go to the trouble of getting open for you. Besides, that diary on the table might sufficient evidence to convince Sen that you made it inside, so should you run any unnecessary risks?...<br />
<br />
Not only is the diary noteworthy enough to grab your attention, there is also the matter of the locked wardrobe. Although hard for a human to open it by force, a Pokemon should have no trouble, but you might not risk damaging whatever's inside, and it'd be difficult for a ghost to retrieve the contents even if it could pass through the door at will.<br />
<br />
As you weigh your options, you start reading through the diary, only to find that page after page has been irreparably damaged by the salt and humidity of the cabin, yellowed sheets of paper turned unreadable. Except for the very last one, it seems, as the water hasn't reached it yet!<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;March 24</i><br />
<br />
<i>To think this was how things would turn out.</i><br />
<i>I've kept this silly diary as a log book of sorts, in my equally silly dreams of becoming captain one day. Now, it's just a way to hope I'm remembered by someone one day, if I'm lucky enough that anyone ever reads this...</i><br />
<i>Early this morning, the Fortune was attacked by a monster, and the hull has been damaged beyond repair. We're sinking, and every life boat we had has been taken by the passengers - at least we kept them safe. The crew... we won't make it.</i><br />
<i>Jason from the Engine Room said he saw the monster with his own eyes - &quot;the biggest freaking Dhelmise in the world&quot;, he said. &quot;The thing had the anchor of bloody Black Horn&quot;, he was shouting... After the hole it made in the ship, I'm inclined to believe him. We should've known it was a stupid idea to have the S.S. Fortune painted like a Wailord, it was asking for trouble sailing this route.</i><br />
<i>I always thought &quot;going down with the ship&quot; was a running joke in our business. Guess I was wrong... I won't even be home for my precious little girl's birthday in two days. I hope she'll remember me growing up.</i><br />
<i>Dhelmise will likely linger around, claim the rusty husk of this ship as its prize after we all drown. I can only pray that nobody else runs into that monster - we tried everything to fight it off, but we could neither capture something that large nor beat something that strong. If you're reading this... run.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
<br />
Taking another look around, nothing else seems to be worth your attention. You take a second glance at the <b>1x Crewman's Diary</b>, wondering if you should just take it and leave it at that. No doubt it'll be all the proof you need to show that smug lifeguard that you were right about Azurill...<br />
<br />
What will you do?</div>

I can only pray that nobody else runs into that monster - we tried everything to fight it off, but we could neither capture something that large nor beat something that strong. If you're reading this... run.&quot;</i></span>&#8203;</div><span style="color: #808080"><br />
<br />
Taking another look around, nothing else seems to be worth your attention. You take a second glance at the <b>1x Crewman's Diary</b>, wondering if you should just take it and leave it at that. No doubt it'll be all the proof you need to show that smug lifeguard that you were right about Azurill...<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: #808080">Big swallows as he reads through the only readable part of the diary. He looks back to his party who a look back expectantly. &quot;Sooo... It looks like the Dhelmise is what took down this ship in the first place...&quot; He says with a hint of singsong. Most of the pokemon's looks go from curious to a healthy amount of worry, while Vegeta just gets more excited. &quot;So, I don't know that we are <i>quite</i> at the level to take it on when it beat the entire crew of this ship, their pokemon, and sunk the ship itself. So we are just gonna leave and only fight it if we absolutely have to. Like right now.&quot; He ignores the wardrobe, nods to the pokemon and begins to make their way back towards the entrance. Hotstuff leads the way with Vegeta muttering at his side. &quot;You aren't too dissapointed are ya <i>Prince</i>?&quot; The fire pokemon teases slightly. &quot;Can it lizard. Our trainer is a coward and I have every right to be butthurt about it.&quot; &quot;Naw come on. You know you shouldn't talk about him like that, he's only looking out for us.&quot; &quot;I have every goddamn right! I should decide what I can and can't handle. Not some human.&quot; Hotstuff sighs. &quot;Well you may well get your chance. We aren't out of here just yet.&quot; Vegeta responds by giving a final &quot;Hmph&quot; and crossing his arms as they plod through the damp shipwreck. Big only heard half of the conversation but could guess the rest and lets out a sigh as well.</span></div>
