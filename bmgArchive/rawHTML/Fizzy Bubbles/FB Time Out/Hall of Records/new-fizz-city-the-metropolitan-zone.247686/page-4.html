The battle finally having turned in his favour, Vegeta is more than ready to show off the results of all those push-ups, sit-ups and plenty of juice. Azurill, too, is eager to help despite his stature, and the fact that he is clearly aware of the colossal gap in power between himself and all the other players on the field.<br />
<br />
Gastrodon slithers forward, visibly in pain but forced into battling until the end by the overpowering seaweed that controls it. Its slow progress is, however, halted to a stop thanks to a Bubblebeam barrage courtesy of your baby companion, who plays his role to perfection!<br />
<br />
Spreading each of his arms to the side, Vegeta begins to absorb sunlight as he charges his ultimate attack. The Grass-Type is determined to prove to you, Gastrodon, Azurill and anyone else watching, that they aren’t dealing with the average Chespin anymore! He, Vegeta, has finally become… the Legendary Quilladin!<br />
<br />
Azurill keeps doing his best to keep Gastrodon away, but eventually, his bubbles start forming slower and popping easier, and the sea slug resumes its slow trek towards Vegeta looking to Body Slam him a second time. But as it comes within mere inches of your partner, the Quilladin brings his arms forward and lets loose a massive beam of concentrated sunlight!<br />
<br />
The gigantic wave of energy washes over Gastrodon, the sheer energy of the move causing it to disintegrate into water particles and the seaweed to slither back into the water, away from harm! However, the beam also pierces a massive hole on the ship’s already-broken hull!<br />
<br />
Water begins pouring in, flooding the floor of the dining hall. Everything suddenly shakes around you, and you quickly realize what’s about to happen – this half of the ship is going to sink too!<br />
<br />
Azurill hops over to where Gastrodon disintegrated, and points with his tail to something the slug left behind. Glowing with a beautiful azure light, a crystal rests on the floor, no doubt the source of the shine you had spotted earlier when Gastrodon was reforming. There’s no mistake about it: it’s a <b>1x Waterium Z</b>!<br />
<br />
The ground beneath your feet suddenly begins to crack, wooden planks cracking as water continues to flood the room. You should move quickly!!<br />
<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: #808080">Big watches as the Gastrodon is held back by the bubblebeam as Vegeta charges his final attack. He begins to sweat some as the Gastrodon begins to power through the attack and gain ground towards Vegeta. Big is about to cry out when Vegeta finally releases his beam with his own yell, sending the laser blowing away the Water/Ground type and blasting a hole in the ship itself. &quot;HahaHA!&quot; He cries out with a grin. &quot;Did you see THAT? I blew a fucking hole straight through the ship.&quot; He brags. &quot;Yeah great job!&quot; Big says just before the first rumble hits them. &quot;Oh, really great job...&quot; Big mutters. &quot;Time to go everyone!&quot; Big recalls everyone but Geddy back into their pokeballs. &quot;Geddy, I need you to keep an eye out for the Dhelmise since you are the most mobile.&quot; Geddy just nods chillly as the Azurill gets Big's attention. His eyes widen. &quot;Woah, is that what I think it is?&quot; He quickly runs to grab the Waterium Z. &quot;That's a nice find.&quot; He mutters looking back at the Azurill. He quickly secures the Waterium Z and the Journal in his backpack. He nods to the Azurill who he assumes will hop on his tail again to travel back to the beach before hopping into the water himself to begin the long swim back with Geddy hovering just above the water. &quot;I don't see anything yet eh.&quot; The small electric pokemon comments. &quot;Yeah, maybe the dhelmise will actually prefer it this way if it lives underwater.&quot; Big agrees. &quot;I dunno how the authorities will take it though...&quot;</span></div>

You reason that, even though the perpetrator escaped, there is no way he can move about freely without being spotted in the hallway. To that effect, you send Rhyperior out to keep guard over the main hallway intersection where the South and West paths cross, while you keep watch over the North and East ones. Your partner is obedient, but you can tell the meagre task of “watching” might feel underwhelming for such a powerful creature.<br />
<br />
For some ten minutes, nothing happens. Until you begin to hear steps approaching! Turning out hoping to spot the criminal, you instead find Terrence coming out of the North Generator room looking bored out of his mind.<br />
<br />
“There, all fixed. But it’s funny – aren’t <i>you</i> supposed to be a repairman? I thought you’d be able to fix these a lot faster than – Hey!”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, he points to the East side of Hallway WE. Lights flicker, and eventually go out! Terrence curses and starts running towards the East Generator, and you follow suite. The door slides open in much the same manner, and the East generator is every bit as noisy – and fully functioning – as the North one. He then turns right and enter the smaller room…<br />
<br />
“Shit! He hit sub-generator 4! But how?!”<br />
<br />
This time, Terrence doesn’t need to point. You can see the cut marks on the cables much like what happened at generator 2. But how could the perpetrator pass you by when you were keeping such tight surveillance over the main halls? Is it moving around some <i>other</i> way? Should you have been more careful in your assessment of the crime scene?...</span>

<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: #808080">Hugo recalls Rhyperior and bends down examining the damaged cable. <br />
<br />
“It’s back to four,” Hugo said partially to Terrance, partially to himself. “There definitely seems to be a pattern. Two then four. Two then six. Two then eight. Two then back to four. If it strikes again, and the pattern holds up, it should hit two and then six again. It hits, then reverses. Then hits somewhere else, then reverses back to two. Almost like…an…alternating…current.”<br />
<br />
Wait a minute. Hugo’s electrical knowledge was amateur at best and with each moment, he was risking outing himself as a fraud, but perhaps he just stumbled upon something. <br />
<br />
He was getting increasingly frustrated for sure, but if nothing got past him or Rhyperior from outside the generators, perhaps what was causing the problem was coming from…inside the generator. <br />
<br />
How could that be possible? Inside the generator? What was he thinking? Not only would the culprit have to be able to travel via electric current, but it would have to be something capable of and willing to screw with the heads of people working here.<br />
<br />
But hadn’t he heard of a Pokemon that was notorious for doing this once before?<br />
<br />
“Is it possible,” Hugo said to Terrance, “that the main generators are somehow connected? This may sound crazy, but hear me out. I’m thinking it may be possible that whoever…or whatever…is damaging these cables is doing so not from the outside, but from the inside. It’s bouncing back and forth from subgenerator two to all the other even numbered subgenerators and back again on an AC. And each time it hits its new destination, it ruins the cable and takes off again. Almost like it’s playing some kind of trick on everyone. There is a Pokemon that I’ve heard of that I think would meet all of the criteria we’re dealing with here. Able to buzz around on an electric current and live in machines. Known for practical jokes. It’s not totally severing the cables because then it would be trapped, but it’s just doing enough damage to irritate everyone else. But what was its name?”<br />
<br />
Hugo racked his brain.<br />
<br />
“Rotom!” he shouted, the name dawning on him. “What do you think, Terrence? Has anyone considered this?”</span></div>

<b><span style="color: #808080"><b>OkikuMew</b>:<br />
</span></b><br />
<span style="color: rgb(128, 128, 128)">Hank smiles as you finish your preparations, and looks especially excited once you let out Catalina. The pink Minior hovers overhead, and the fisherman looks on in awe.</span><br />
<span style="color: #808080"><br />
“That’s a darn weird Pokemon you got there! Never seen a rock that could fly! Well, as long as there’s a brain underneath all that stone, we shoud be good right?” he says with a loud chuckle.<br />
<br />
Hank helps you aboard and, with the push of his massive foot, forces the Tank into the water before starting up the old, rusty engine. It takes three attempts, but it finally roars back to life, and off you go towards the ravaged Corsola reef!<br />
<br />
“Lucky for us the weather’s holding up eh?” he shouts over the noise of the almost century-old engine at work. “We can keep heading North for a bit longer, but then we’ll have to make a detour! The coral bed has a higher inclination up ahead and the water’s shallower, it can pierce a hole clean through the Tank hull!”<br />
<br />
The journey’s uneventful, and just as Hank said, the boat tilts starboard after a while, slightly shifting course. As it does, Hank points to the left and shouts again.<br />
“See? Water changes colour over there, see how it’s a redder? Coral all the sea bed over there, the Mareanie haven’t reached this far yet!” he laughs as the boat keeps going. “Frank and Edmund used to say there was treasure buried under all that coral, but it was forbidden to search for it because we’d have to destroy the coral to reach it, and besides, no ship could sail close enough to the spot without sinking anyway!”<br />
<br />
It takes a while longer for anything to happen. Fortunately, the Hank Tank holds its own remarkably well on high seas, contrary to what its appearance might have suggested. But just as you begin to wonder if you could afford to relax a little, Hank shouts one more time, only now, there’s alarm in his voice.<br />
<br />
“TIDAL WAVE UP AHEAD!!”<br />
<br />
True enough, Catalina confirms it. In the distance, a massive wave begins to form, and is heading straight for the Hank Tank!<br />
<br />
“How the hell is that even possible? There ain’t even a breeze blowing! Not a sign of bad weather! So how?!”<br />
<br />
Intriguing as though the reason may be, theirs is a very real problem coming your way at high speed and with possible catastrophic effects… is there anything you can do before the wave arrives?!</span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: #808080">The Kalosian trainer was a little surprised at first of Hank's excitable expression after sending out Catalina, but on second thought, she figured that Minior are a rare sight to see in Fizzytopia. After all, if she recalled correctly, Catalina is the very first of its kind to be captured in this region.<br />
<br />
“That’s a darn weird Pokemon you got there! Never seen a rock that could fly!” Hank commented, laughing. “Well, as long as there’s a brain underneath all that stone, we should be good right?”<br />
<br />
“I don't know much about Catalina or Minior in general as it's not been long since I have it,” Mélina admitted, “but of the little that I know, it's a curious and smart flying cookie!”<br />
<br />
After a bit of a struggle, the engine of Hank's the Tank finally started to run… quite loudly. Enough that while sailing, the girl barely made up of the sailor's small talk about the nice, clear weather and the directions the boat has to take. At least though, the boat moved through the waves quite well despite its age, and nothing of note happened during the trip. On the way, they took small detour around a spot of surviving coral reef, not yet reached by Mareanie. Corsola let out a little cheer, happy to see at least part of her home still standing.<br />
<br />
“Frank and Edmund used to say there was treasure buried under all that coral,” Hank informed, as much as he could over the growling motor, “but it was forbidden to search for it because we’d have to destroy the coral to reach it, and besides, no ship could sail close enough to the spot without sinking anyway!”<br />
<br />
“Treasure under the coral…” Mélina mumbled to herself, pensive. “Why do I have the feeling that the Mareanie… no, that wouldn't be possible… would it?” Pausing, she shook her head. “A bit Farfetch'd...”<br />
<br />
Brushing off the theory that crossed the woman's mind, the Hank Tank crew continued in their path towards the main coral site. Mélina took the time to check on Lucette in the water and spot Catalina's position through her binoculars. While sitting down and giving a comforting hug to Corsola, Mélina sighed. It seemed like everything was fine. She closed her eyes for a moment, trying to ignore the cacophonous boat, while relaxing a bit and taking in the feel of the waves and the smell of the salty sea…<br />
<br />
“TIDAL WAVE UP AHEAD!!”<br />
<br />
The trainer’s bubble burst so suddenly after Hank’s yell, she barely kept her balance on her seat. After looking around frantically while her heart raced, she spotted the gigantic wave, moving directly towards the boat! Scared how water could reach that high above sea level, Catalina quickly flew back to its trainer in a panic, chattering in clings and clangs definitely faster than its usual cheery tone.<br />
<br />
“How the hell is that even possible?” the seasoned harbormaster tried to reason. “There ain’t even a breeze blowing! Not a sign of bad weather! So how?!”<br />
<br />
Still chocked, Mélina couldn't mutter an answer, although she shared Hank's reasoning. Her Minior pang noises louder, shaking her out of her silence.<br />
<br />
“W-we gotta do something.”<br />
<br />
Her mind rushed in thousands of kilometers an hour (or would it be knots in this case?) to analyze the situation and figure out how to get out of it. She looked at the boat, then at its owner, then at the wall of water coming at them. She estimated there was no way the Tank could outrun it, so an encounter of some kind with it would be inevitable. Surely the vehicle wouldn't survive a hit from it, or have the maneuverability to be able to ride safely under the wave.<br />
<br />
“Ride the wave…” she mumbled again, but soon followed by an exclamation, “Wait! That's it! Corsola quick, in the water with Lucette!” the sentient coral immediately obliged, jumping out of her trainer’s hands and overboard, joining the Feebas. “Lucette, counter the wave with one of your own with <b>Surf</b>! If that doesn't stop it, Corsola and Lucette, make <b>Whirlpools</b> right in front of it!” She then looked over her Meteor Pokémon, “I suggest you fly up so you don’t get caught in the wave. You don’t want to catch any water… and we might need some backup if the worse happens.”<br />

<i>((Apologies if I misread your post but I couldn’t make out a concrete action from your character in your last reply.))</i><br />
<br />
<br />
You don’t like this one bit, but if it’s any consolation, at least it seems you’ve run into the “good guys” in this unbelievable mess. “C” wants you to infiltrate whatever Shady Guy’s plan is, but doesn’t know how to get you inside. You, on the other hand, do know how to get inside but don’t really want to follow the man’s instructions… And in this dilemma, you end up mostly standing around scanning the Black Velvet from one side to the other, attempting to spot Shady Guy somewhere in the crowd.<br />
<br />
“Good evening.”<br />
<br />
A voice, deep and intimidating, speaks up behind you. You quickly turn around… and see a black tie staring back at you. It takes you a couple of seconds to make sense of the situation and realize you have to look <i>up</i> to see the man’s face. An absolutely massive man, with bronze-like skin, sharply dressed with a black suit and tie and sporting shades indoors, looks down at you with an expression that is quite a ways away from friendly.<br />
<br />
Bars and discos in general don’t have to be your thing for you to know that, when a man dressed as security approaches you with “good evening”, he means the opposite.<br />
<br />
“Are you lost buddy? You seem like you need some pointers: over there is where you dance,” he points with a finger as big as a sausage, “over there is where you drink, and back there is where I’ll throw you if you keep standing in the way of paying customers and making strange phone calls.”<br />
<br />
Clearly you’re being watched by some very zealous security. One more false step and things might end up badly for you… [/COLOR]

</blockquote><span style="color: gray"><span style="font-size: 12px">You know, in all his thoughts about how he was walking into a sketchy situation, he hadn't exactly considered that he could look shady in turn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good evening,&quot; a deep, intimidating voice said from behind him. Aiden flinched in surprise and spun to see...a black tie? Oh, shit. He looked up into the <i>massive</i> bouncer's sunglasses and not-exactly-friendly expression with a hopefully-not-too-sheepish expression. &quot;Are you lost buddy? You seem like you need some pointers: over there is where you dance&quot;--he pointed at the dancefloor--&quot;over there is where you drink, and back there is where I'll throw you if you keep standing in the way of paying customers and making strange phone calls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right. Gotcha,&quot; Aiden said, edging towards the bar. &quot;Was just making sure I had a ride back. I'm just gonna go--&quot; He gestured at the bar and then turned to head there, beginning to stew at his situation. Caught between a fucking rock and a hard place and it wasn't even really his fault! Though at the rate this was going, he might as well just leap straight in with both feet.<br />
<br />
Sliding into a seat at the bar, he shook his head at himself and impatiently tried to catch the bartender's attention. While he <i>was</i> planning to order the goddamn Bloody Marill, he <i>still</i> shouldn't be reckless, no matter how frustrated and irritated he was. He was getting into some shady shit here and he didn't doubt that things would only get more dangerous from here on out. If he wanted to make it out alive and in one piece, he had to keep his wits about him and <i>not</i> draw too much attention to himself.</span></span></div>

<br />
You realize it’s best to make a run for it; the part of the ship that remained above-water is on its way to join the other half at the bottom of the ocean, courtesy of Vegeta’s powerful – if reckless – Solar Beam. No doubt it got the job done however, as the Gastrodon no longer reforms and you are left with a nifty reward for your efforts, a water Z-Crystal.<br />
<br />
All that will be meaningless, however, if you allow yourself to go down with the ship. Your team safely recalled, except for your scout Geddy and the Azurill that does not belong to you, you rush back into the water as fast as you can, hoping to avoid death by drowning as you somehow managed to avoid death by Dhelmise. Speaking of whom…<br />
<br />
As you begin to swim away from the S.S. Fortune wreckage, something wraps around your leg. For a moment you panic, expecting to be pulled down into a watery grave by the vengeful spirit, only to realize that the seaweed enveloping your limb aren’t exerting any force at all. Instead, the sentient algae use the physical connection to send a silent message directly into your brain.<br />
<br />
<i>”I will be waiting, human. Waiting for you at your full potential.”</i><br />
<br />
With that, the seaweed gently releases its grasp, allowing you to go. Directly behind you, the S.S. Fortune collapses into the depths, and way up ahead, surfers and swimmers look on in morbid curiosity. Azurill following close behind, employing the same technique as before, and with Geddy hovering overhead, the three of you swim your way back to shore, under the intense stares of everyone around you.<br />
<br />
“Did ya see that?!”<br />
<br />
“He could’ve died with that stunt!”<br />
<br />
“Who the hell goes surfing near a shipwreck?”<br />
<br />
“I’ll say it again though – some balls on that one!”<br />
<br />
The swim back to the beach is even more exhausting than when you left for the S.S. Fortune. Azurill, fortunately, behaves perfectly, as if he’d been doing this for ages – all trace of fear or apprehension long gone, the baby Pokemon is now one with the water it swims on, like he has always belonged there. And that is, in and of itself, a victory.<br />
<br />
“Not bad!” says a familiar voice up ahead. As you get out of the water, you run into Sean, the lifeguard, who looks at you with a smug grin and his arms crossed. “So you taught that useless balloon how to swim. Big deal, he was gonna learn anyway. But do you have <i>proof</i> of having been to the shipwreck, or did you just blow it up and came running back?[/i]<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>OkikuMew</b>:<br />
<br />
You know you have to act quickly, because that wave isn’t going to let up, and there is no way the Hank Tank can survive such a blow. It’s fortunate, then, that you are accompanied by Lucette – who despite her diminutive size boasts considerable latent strength.<br />
<br />
Courageously, the little Feebas swims ahead, followed closely by your new companion, who is visibly impressed by your resourcefulness in the face of adversity. Lucette’s eyes glow, and the ocean responds: undulation begins to form ahead, against the natural current, and soon a second tidal wave is marching towards the first. Lucette’s lacks the size and momentum to stop the oncoming tsunami, however, and your confidence falters briefly. It is then that a third wave forms immediately behind Lucette’s, doubling her own in size. Puzzled – Corsola doesn’t know Surf, after all – you look over at Hank, who grins proudly. It is then that you see a white bird emerge from underwater, a large pelican whose eyes glow similarly to Lucette’s.<br />
<br />
“Of all the times for Awilda to find her guts, eh? The lass just evolved!”<br />
<br />
The Pelipper’s own Surf adds to yours, and together the waves crash into the oncoming mass of water, slowing it down considerably while seawater splashes all over, as if it had suddenly started raining. Finally, to ensure no harm befalls the boat, Corsola summons a Whirlpool that disrupts the rest of the wave, effectively nullifying the threat just in time!<br />
<br />
<i>*Lucette has gained 3 Levels!*</i><br />
<br />
<i>*Corsola has gained 3 levels!*</i><br />
<br />
“WOOHOO! Way to go girls!” Hank looks pumped, but maybe that’s just the way he shows his relief. It’s hard to dislike such a genuine guy, even if he doesn’t come across as particularly bright. “Now what the hell was that about? It was a bigger wave than any Surf I’ve ever seen…”<br />
<br />
As you regain composure and sit back down, Hank’s expression shifts to a dead serious look. His eyes are locked on the water around the Tank.<br />
<br />
“Sons of bitches…”<br />
<br />
One after another, small specks of pink and white begin to surface. At first, they seem like small pebbles… but then you recognize them for what they really are. Corsola fragments.<br />
<br />
The agitated sea must have kicked up the remains of hundreds of dead Corsola, which surround both the ship and your water-bound companions, who look visibly distressed by the significance of this event. Hank, too, looks distraught, despite his usual good humour.<br />
<br />
And then it starts.<br />
<br />
It begins slowly, almost unnoticeably, tiny knocks on the Tank’s hull. But the knocks grow stronger, louder, and the ship begins to wobble slightly. Finally, you spot them: light blue tentacles with purple spikes emerge from each side of the Tank, and before you know it, dozens of Mareanie attempt to climb aboard. It’s like something straight out of a horror movie.<br />
<br />
What can you do?!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>King Ghidorah</b>:<br />
<br />
Terrence hears out your reasoning as the two of you lean over the sliced cable. It seems you discovered a pattern – perhaps <i>the</i> pattern – and possibly even the identity of the one responsible.<br />
<br />
As you utter Rotom’s name, a smile comes across Terrence’s lips – a strange smile that you can’t quite decipher, but possible born out of relief that you just solved the riddle.<br />
<br />
“Yes, the main generators are connected electrically, all of them are. A Rotom, you say?” he muses, playing out the scenario in his head. “That makes sense actually! You might have just solved our problem!”<br />
<br />
He gets up and heads for the door, beckoning you to follow him. A slight, welcome breeze fills the otherwise stifled generator room.<br />
<br />
“We shouldn’t waste more time; your reasoning seems solid and it may just be the answer Bud was looking for.” He seems to be in a hurry to relay your findings to the Plant’s chief, possibly because it’s been so long since anyone came up with a reasonable explanation. He leaves the partially-severed cable unattended for now, but he’ll probably get back to it later.<br />
<br />
“Come one, let’s get going! When we get to Bud, want me to tell him what we found, or d you wanna handle it? You know, with his temper and all.”<br />
<br />
He stands by the automatic door, preventing it from closing so you can get a move on. He looks at you expectantly, smiling; this seems to be a big break for the Plant’s future, if you’re right in your assumption, and clearly Terrence is in a hurry to tell all of this to Bud.<br />
<br />
What will you do?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Myahoo</b>:<br />
<br />
As you reluctantly – almost forcibly – approach the counter, the woman handling the bar smiles at you with an expression that is less the usual shopkeeper’s welcoming face and more a knowing grin.<br />
<br />
“Hello handsome. Whatcha having?”<br />
<br />
It’s as if you don’t even have to answer. The second you finish uttering that last syllable, a glass filled with a dark-red fluid comes sliding across the wooden surface and into your hand. You pick it up with extreme reluctance, wondering if you actually have to gobble down the fluid, only to find there’s a small piece of paper stuck to the bottom of the glass.<br />
<br />
<i>032847</i><br />
<br />
“You’re a cute one,” says the barwoman all of a sudden. “You should come around the back so we can get… better acquainted.”<br />
<br />
Because <i>of course</i> things had to be as shady as possible, and more so at every turn. She walks out from behind the counter and motions for you to follow her, and the two of you walk behind the bar where a cabaret stage used to be set up. Now stripped of all props, all that remains is the stage itself – basically an elevated wooden platform – and a long black curtain, reaching from the ceiling to the floor, which served to separate the stage from the backstage area. The barwoman then leans close and whispers in your ear.<br />
<br />
“Brave boy. Go ahead and join the <i>real</i> fun.”<br />
<br />
You pass through the curtain to find nothing but a wall with a single locked door, and a number pad to the right. Clearly it’s an electronic lock system, and you’re expected to go inside.<br />
<br />
Will you though? Any last-minute preparations? Should you risk a call to “C” at this moment?...</span></div>

<b>King Ghidorah</b>:<br />
<br />
Terrence hears out your reasoning as the two of you lean over the sliced cable. It seems you discovered a pattern – perhaps <i>the</i> pattern – and possibly even the identity of the one responsible.<br />
<br />
As you utter Rotom’s name, a smile comes across Terrence’s lips – a strange smile that you can’t quite decipher, but possible born out of relief that you just solved the riddle.<br />
<br />
“Yes, the main generators are connected electrically, all of them are. A Rotom, you say?” he muses, playing out the scenario in his head. “That makes sense actually! You might have just solved our problem!”<br />
<br />
He gets up and heads for the door, beckoning you to follow him. A slight, welcome breeze fills the otherwise stifled generator room.<br />
<br />
“We shouldn’t waste more time; your reasoning seems solid and it may just be the answer Bud was looking for.” He seems to be in a hurry to relay your findings to the Plant’s chief, possibly because it’s been so long since anyone came up with a reasonable explanation. He leaves the partially-severed cable unattended for now, but he’ll probably get back to it later.<br />
<br />
“Come one, let’s get going! When we get to Bud, want me to tell him what we found, or d you wanna handle it? You know, with his temper and all.”<br />
<br />
He stands by the automatic door, preventing it from closing so you can get a move on. He looks at you expectantly, smiling; this seems to be a big break for the Plant’s future, if you’re right in your assumption, and clearly Terrence is in a hurry to tell all of this to Bud.<br />
<br />
What will you do?<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: #808080">In a sense, Hugo was relieved. It seemed he had finally solved the problem which not only would result in a possible reward, but also would be to the benefit of all the New Fizz City citizens.<br />
<br />
And yet...something felt off. Perhaps it was Terrance’s smile which seemed to be hiding some ulterior motive. Perhaps it was the fact that he accepted it so simply without providing any context. Were their Rotom around? Had this been a problem before?<br />
<br />
And perhaps it was because he was so eager to rush off and tell Bud the news, so much so that he hadn’t even bothered to fix the cable.<br />
<br />
But then again, Terrance seemed like a stand up guy. To this point he hadn’t given Hugo much reason NOT to trust him. <br />
<br />
“You know, Terrance, I’m glad you think we’ve solved the problem. But isn’t Bud going to want ys to prove that it’s actually right? I mean I’ve spoken with him before and he can be a little...uh...passionate about these things. Don’t you think he is going to want verification?”<br />
<br />
But what did Hugo know? This was all fake it until you make it. Could this even be verified?<br />
<br />
“But then again, you certainly know Bud better than I do. If you think this is the right thing to do, then let’s do it. We’ll go together but I’ll let you do the explaining, and I’ll jump in when needed. You seem to have a better grasp on him than I do.<br />
<br />
But one more thing, I hope he realizes I don’t work for free.”</span></div>

You realize it’s best to make a run for it; the part of the ship that remained above-water is on its way to join the other half at the bottom of the ocean, courtesy of Vegeta’s powerful – if reckless – Solar Beam. No doubt it got the job done however, as the Gastrodon no longer reforms and you are left with a nifty reward for your efforts, a water Z-Crystal.<br />
<br />
All that will be meaningless, however, if you allow yourself to go down with the ship. Your team safely recalled, except for your scout Geddy and the Azurill that does not belong to you, you rush back into the water as fast as you can, hoping to avoid death by drowning as you somehow managed to avoid death by Dhelmise. Speaking of whom…<br />
<br />
As you begin to swim away from the S.S. Fortune wreckage, something wraps around your leg. For a moment you panic, expecting to be pulled down into a watery grave by the vengeful spirit, only to realize that the seaweed enveloping your limb aren’t exerting any force at all. Instead, the sentient algae use the physical connection to send a silent message directly into your brain.<br />
<br />
<i>”I will be waiting, human. Waiting for you at your full potential.”</i><br />
<br />
With that, the seaweed gently releases its grasp, allowing you to go. Directly behind you, the S.S. Fortune collapses into the depths, and way up ahead, surfers and swimmers look on in morbid curiosity. Azurill following close behind, employing the same technique as before, and with Geddy hovering overhead, the three of you swim your way back to shore, under the intense stares of everyone around you.<br />
<br />
“Did ya see that?!”<br />
<br />
“He could’ve died with that stunt!”<br />
<br />
“Who the hell goes surfing near a shipwreck?”<br />
<br />
“I’ll say it again though – some balls on that one!”<br />
<br />
The swim back to the beach is even more exhausting than when you left for the S.S. Fortune. Azurill, fortunately, behaves perfectly, as if he’d been doing this for ages – all trace of fear or apprehension long gone, the baby Pokemon is now one with the water it swims on, like he has always belonged there. And that is, in and of itself, a victory.<br />
<br />
“Not bad!” says a familiar voice up ahead. As you get out of the water, you run into Sean, the lifeguard, who looks at you with a smug grin and his arms crossed. “So you taught that useless balloon how to swim. Big deal, he was gonna learn anyway. But do you have <i>proof</i> of having been to the shipwreck, or did you just blow it up and came running back?</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: #808080">With several quick strokes, Big puts a good bit of distance between himself and the crumbling wreckage of the ship. As he treads water to turn and watch the boat sink. He lets a sigh out which catches in his throat when he feels something wrap around his leg, which would be scary enough without the sense of purpose it seems to have. He barely keeps enough presence of mind to stay afloat as the Dhelmise imparts its last message. His face then changes from one of fear to a determined one. He thinks back as best as he can: <i>I... We will be ready</i>. He does his best to convey this before his leg is released. With a slightly renewed vigor he starts back towards the beach once again. As he does he takes slight appreciation that Vegeta was in his Dusk Ball, as he would already be insufferable with the new evolution and massive attack to win the fight, his head doesn't need to be made any bigger by the impressed comments of the other surfers. He gets out of the water and is once again about to bring up to the Azurill the idea of the blue pokemon joining him on his journey but is interrupted by the voice that kicked off this whole adventure. He turns to Sean with a blank face as the annoying lifeguard casts doubt on their trip. &quot;Well, despite the fact that accidentally causing the shipwreck to sink already proves that we made it there and back, which was the entire point if you remember, we did manage to grab a few souvenirs.&quot; He goes into his bag and with a smug look that would rival Vegeta's he presents the diary from the ship.</span></div>

You end up deciding to follow Terrence, in order to relay the good news to Bud. Hurriedly, the two of you make it along Hallway WE and turn right to the South Hallway. Terrence then points to a nearby door – this one not automatic, but rather an old-fashioned key-locked one.<br />
<br />
“Bud takes his privacy seriously, sliding doors aren’t his kinda thing,” Terrence explains with a smile.<br />
<br />
He knocks twice and nothing happens, then twice more.<br />
<br />
“THE HELL DO YA WANT?!”<br />
<br />
You see the handle spinning and the door opens. Bud has his usual expression, the yellow jumpsuit and the goggles on his forehead, but you can’t quite feel the oppressive aura of sheer, unadulterated rage as you did before. The beast must have calmed down somewhat.<br />
<br />
“YOU BETTER NOT BE WASTING MY TIME TERRENCE! OUT WITH IT,” he shouts as he unceremoniously turns his back to you and returns to his seat. His office is a dry-as-bones room with nothing but a desk, a chair and a bunch of dossiers resting on a nearby bookshelf. Not a single photograph, painting or decoration to liven up the cubicle.<br />
<br />
“Well Bud – I mean boss -, you’ll be happy to know the repairman seems to have cracked the case!” Terrence delivers in a cheerful voice. Bud doesn’t reply, merely raising an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
“We pieced together that the culprit has to be a Pokemon that can’t be seen, yet moves around freely inside the Plant. The only way for it to do that was to move <i>through</i> the electrical current connecting the generators,” Terrence continues, “and the only Pokemon capable of doing that – in our bright repairman’s own words – is a Rotom!”<br />
<br />
Silence follows, Bud staring straight at you with bulging vessels pulsing in his neck. He gets up, shifts his gaze to Terrence and speaks in a tone incomparably lower to his usual one – a shift you can’t quite explain, but that makes you <i>more</i> uneasy than his usual screaming.<br />
<br />
“Leave us Terrence.”<br />
<br />
The other man too seems taken aback by Bud’s reaction, but obeys nonetheless. He steps back out and closes the door behind him, excusing himself.<br />
<br />
“R-right. I’ll go fix that severed cable then. See ya later.”<br />
<br />
Now alone in the office with you, Bud walks over to the door and locks it, then turns back to you with a livid expression.<br />
<br />
“DO I LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT TO YOU?!” The delivery chills you to the bone.<br />
<br />
“SHOW ME PROOF! <i>SHOW ME HOW A F**CKING ROTOM CAN <b>CUT CABLES LIKE IT’S HOLDING A FREAKING KNIFE</b> </i>AND I’LL RETIRE AND GIVE YOU THE DAMN POWER PLANT!!!”<br />
<br />
Through his world-shaking fury, you can’t deny he has a point. Your Rotom theory might hold up as far as moving about unseen is concerned, but the Ghost-Type shouldn’t be able to slice open cables. If anything, short-circuiting or overloading the generators might fall more in line with its expected MO. It's not the right solution...<br />
<br />
“YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE TERRENCE IS RIGHT! MAYBE I’M TOO OLD FOR THIS S**T, MAYBE I SHOULD GO HOME AND GIVE UP THE PLANT! MAYBE I’M NOT CUT OUT FOR THIS ANYMORE,” he continues on a vicious tirade, “AND MAYBE F**KING ROTOM CAN EVOLVE AND CUT CABLES NOW!!!!”<br />
<br />
He returns to his seat and slams his massive fists on the table, consumed by rage.<br />
<br />
“I DON’T KNOW WHY I BOTHER WITH ANYONE ELSE! TERRENCE IS THE ONLY ONE I CAN F**KING TRUST AROUND HERE ANYMORE! THE ONLY ONE WHO SHOWS UP ON TIME FOR WORK ANYMORE, THE FIRST ONE ON THE SCENE WHENEVER SOMETHING GOES TO S**T, THE ONLY ONE AROUND BESIDES ME WHO KNOWS HOW TO HANDLE GODDAMN CABLE!!!”<br />
<br />
He drops his head on the desk, exhausted from his own anger.<br />
<br />
“His cousin Owens wouldn’t have died in that freak accident if he was on duty that day; everything works out when he’s around,” he finally says, almost a whisper. “You should go. Hell… I should go.”<br />
<br />
Defeated, broken, Bud doesn’t say another word, but you realize that’s your cue for leaving and not coming back. With that said… will you?<br />
<br />
</span><br />
<b><span style="color: #808080">Biggggg5:</span></b><br />
<span style="color: #808080"><br />
Proudly, you show Sean the crewman’s diary, definitive proof of your successful journey to the S.S. Fortune. The lifeguard takes the book from your hands and turns it around in his hands, inspecting the cover before opening it.<br />
<br />
“A wet book. Lovely as souvenirs go, not sure it’s much in the way of proof though,” he smugly retorts before finally taking a glance at the pages themselves. “Convenient that only a single page is readable; forging dozens of diary entries to make it realistic would’ve taken you a lot longer, right?”<br />
<br />
He tosses the book on the sandy ground, not even bothering to feign interest.<br />
<br />
“Shoddy piece of work. Not to mention, you didn’t need to blow up half the ship so you wouldn’t have to actually enter it – that’s public property damage and you’re probably gonna go to jail for it. If you were too scared to face the ghost that lives over there, you should’ve just said it,” he continues with a nauseating grin and his arms crossed. “Still, I guess you taught that coward how to swim, so you weren’t a complete waste of time. Come on Azurill, back to work. You’re not on vacation.”<br />
<br />
He turns around and prepares to leave, but Azurill doesn’t budge. Sean turns around and raises his voice in impatience.<br />
<br />
“I said now you worthless party balloon!”<br />
<br />
In response, the tiny Pokemon spits out a forceful stream of pressurized liquid, but not just regular water: it seems Azurill has learned <b>EM Muddy Water</b> during this journey!<br />
<br />
“Okay, that’s enough. If you won’t do as I say, I’ll just have to show you your new friend isn’t half as the man I am!” Irritated, Sean retrieves a Dive Ball from the pocket of his swimming trunks and sends out a <b>Binacle</b>. “You! Time to settle this! If you wanna talk shit about me behind my back and turn Azurill against me, you’re gonna have to prove you deserve him more than I do! He’ll see you for the fraud you are!”<br />
<br />
Well, there’s no backing down from this… It’s Sean and his Binacle vs you and <b>Level 16 Male Azurill with EMs Camouflage and Muddy Water</b>! Time to show him once and for all! </span></div>

<br />
He knocks twice and nothing happens, then twice more.<br />
<br />
“THE HELL DO YA WANT?!”<br />
<br />
You see the handle spinning and the door opens. Bud has his usual expression, the yellow jumpsuit and the goggles on his forehead, but you can’t quite feel the oppressive aura of sheer, unadulterated rage as you did before. The beast must have calmed down somewhat.<br />
<br />
“YOU BETTER NOT BE WASTING MY TIME TERRENCE! OUT WITH IT,” he shouts as he unceremoniously turns his back to you and returns to his seat. His office is a dry-as-bones room with nothing but a desk, a chair and a bunch of dossiers resting on a nearby bookshelf. Not a single photograph, painting or decoration to liven up the cubicle.<br />
<br />
“Well Bud – I mean boss -, you’ll be happy to know the repairman seems to have cracked the case!” Terrence delivers in a cheerful voice. Bud doesn’t reply, merely raising an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
“We pieced together that the culprit has to be a Pokemon that can’t be seen, yet moves around freely inside the Plant. The only way for it to do that was to move <i>through</i> the electrical current connecting the generators,” Terrence continues, “and the only Pokemon capable of doing that – in our bright repairman’s own words – is a Rotom!”<br />
<br />
Silence follows, Bud staring straight at you with bulging vessels pulsing in his neck. He gets up, shifts his gaze to Terrence and speaks in a tone incomparably lower to his usual one – a shift you can’t quite explain, but that makes you <i>more</i> uneasy than his usual screaming.<br />
<br />
“Leave us Terrence.”<br />
<br />
The other man too seems taken aback by Bud’s reaction, but obeys nonetheless. He steps back out and closes the door behind him, excusing himself.<br />
<br />
“R-right. I’ll go fix that severed cable then. See ya later.”<br />
<br />
Now alone in the office with you, Bud walks over to the door and locks it, then turns back to you with a livid expression.<br />
<br />
“DO I LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT TO YOU?!” The delivery chills you to the bone.<br />
<br />
“SHOW ME PROOF! <i>SHOW ME HOW A F**CKING ROTOM CAN <b>CUT CABLES LIKE IT’S HOLDING A FREAKING KNIFE</b> </i>AND I’LL RETIRE AND GIVE YOU THE DAMN POWER PLANT!!!”<br />
<br />
Through his world-shaking fury, you can’t deny he has a point. Your Rotom theory might hold up as far as moving about unseen is concerned, but the Ghost-Type shouldn’t be able to slice open cables. If anything, short-circuiting or overloading the generators might fall more in line with its expected MO. It's not the right solution...<br />
<br />
“YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE TERRENCE IS RIGHT! MAYBE I’M TOO OLD FOR THIS S**T, MAYBE I SHOULD GO HOME AND GIVE UP THE PLANT! MAYBE I’M NOT CUT OUT FOR THIS ANYMORE,” he continues on a vicious tirade, “AND MAYBE F**KING ROTOM CAN EVOLVE AND CUT CABLES NOW!!!!”<br />
<br />
He returns to his seat and slams his massive fists on the table, consumed by rage.<br />
<br />
“I DON’T KNOW WHY I BOTHER WITH ANYONE ELSE! TERRENCE IS THE ONLY ONE I CAN F**KING TRUST AROUND HERE ANYMORE! THE ONLY ONE WHO SHOWS UP ON TIME FOR WORK ANYMORE, THE FIRST ONE ON THE SCENE WHENEVER SOMETHING GOES TO S**T, THE ONLY ONE AROUND BESIDES ME WHO KNOWS HOW TO HANDLE GODDAMN CABLE!!!”<br />
<br />
He drops his head on the desk, exhausted from his own anger.<br />
<br />
“His cousin Owens wouldn’t have died in that freak accident if he was on duty that day; everything works out when he’s around,” he finally says, almost a whisper. “You should go. Hell… I should go.”<br />
<br />
Defeated, broken, Bud doesn’t say another word, but you realize that’s your cue for leaving and not coming back. With that said… will you?</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: #808080">Nobody likes to be screamed at, so Hugo quietly heard Bud out and turned to leave. But just before he hits the door, he stops. People like this never learn if everyone just sits back and takes the abuse. Sure, most people at the plant couldn’t speak up because they’d risk their jobs and their livelihood. But Hugo, what did he have to lose? Not much. What could he do? Hit you? Maybe, but then he’d risk a lawsuit. He turned back to face Bud.<br />
<br />
“You know what? You’re right. You probably should go. I’ve seen people like you all my life. You scream and you belittle and you insult and you think you can get away with treating people like garbage because you’re allegedly good at your job. Because you keep the plant running. And I’m sure that’s no easy task, but I’d be willing to bet there are plenty of people who could do it without being a jackass like you. I’m not saying that person is me, but maybe you need to take a look in the mirror.”<br />
<br />
Hugo was surprised even at himself, but he wasn’t going to stop because it felt so good to let this idiot have it.<br />
<br />
“You talk about how much you value Terrance and how great he is and how he’s the only one you can rely on, and yet you scream at him like he’s a child. Even though it was HE who lost a family member in the accident. And who do you think is responsible for that, Bud? Who decided not to have security checkpoints on the doors to the generators or to have a surveillance system in place so you could easily see what’s happening here rather than literally pulling people off the street to clean up the mess after the fact? I’m sure you feel terrible about the accident and I sympathize for you, but it’s time to take some accountability and maybe get off your ass and help out instead of kicking and screaming.”<br />
<br />
Yikes. This could get bad. But hey, no turning back now.<br />
<br />
“So maybe it’s not a Rotom. But I’d bet my life it’s a Pokemon of some kind. And I’m going to go find what it is. You can either help or not. Or you can have me escorted out. But if you do that, you’re going to have to start all over again. Your choice.”</span></div>

Triggered by the man's complete lack of respect, you fire back at Bud giving him a piece of your mind. He looks absolutely stunned, as if nobody else has ever actually answered him like that... but there's more to it, you realize. It's not just the fact that you said something, but <i>something you said.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Security checkpoints, surveillance cameras... I never wanted any of that, because I had... It can't be...&quot;<br />
<br />
As if possessed by something, he storms out of the room, unintentionally pushing you aside as he passes by. Then, stopping briefly, he looks over his shoulder and shouts (because of course he does).<br />
<br />
&quot;WELL DON'T JUST STAND THERE YOU OPINIONATED SMARTASS!&quot;<br />
<br />
It seems something important has just crossed Bud's mind, and clearly you had a hand in it, even if you're not sure what it was. You figure you might as well follow him, and discover that, for a man his size and age, the Power Plant owner runs surprisingly fast. He makes his way towards Hallway WE and towards the room from whence you'd just come, past the West Main Generator and into sub-generator 8's chamber. There you find Terrence leaning over the damaged cable, dutifully applying non-conductive electrical tape over the sliced portion of the plastic casing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Bud, what brings you... oh, you're still here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Terrence looks at you over his shoulder, looking genuinely surprised to see you here. Did he... <i>expect</i> you to have been fired? He gets hastily, dropping the tape he was holding and something else - a small piece of paper, it seems from a distance - falls from the back pocket of his uniform. he walks over to the two of you and greets you with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, did his theory hold up? Should we start scanning the wiring from a wild Rotom?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bud, it seems, isn't listening. His eyes scan the room, but you can tell he's not looking at neither the generator nor the cables.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHY IS THERE A BREEZE IN THIS ROOM?&quot; he bellows. You'd noticed it too, <a href="https://forums.bulbagarden.net/index.php?threads/new-fizz-city-the-metropolitan-zone.247686/page-4#post-6544826" class="link link--internal" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fforums.bulbagarden.net%2Findex.php%3Fthreads%2Fnew-fizz-city-the-metropolitan-zone.247686%2Fpage-4%23post-6544826&amp;hash=6cc43e43111f1bca9fef8cc1fcdcc833" rel="nofollow noopener">the slight, welcome breeze in the room</a> earlier, but paid it no mind. To Bud, however, it seems to matter a great deal.<br />
<br />
&quot;THERE ARE NO WINDOWS HERE! THESE ARE SOUNDPROOF, ISOLATED ROOMS! HOW CAN THERE BE WIND INSIDE A POWER PLANT?&quot;<br />
<br />
He paces around, annoyed and intrigued, until his eyes land on something in the wall behind the sub-generator. He walks over to it and turns to Terrence.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHY IS THE AIR VENT GRILL UNSCREWED?!&quot;<br />
<br />
He's right. The grill is tilted, allowing access to the air duct, but only a small critter would be able to move around inside. Terrence merely shrugs, but you tell your self you should've scanned the room in detail, rather than just the cable, and you would've probably noticed it too. Then again, you didn't have a lot of time to look around, now that you think about it, because Terrence was in an awful hurry to relay your findings to Bud...<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll have a word with the maintenance guys. The screws have probably gone rusty again,&quot; Terrence replies. &quot;I'm sorry I overlooked it, as if we didn't have enough things malfunctioning already. I'll get to it right away.&quot;<br />
<br />
Terrence turns to leave and call maintenance, until...<br />
<br />
&quot;THERE IS NO RUST HERE,&quot; barks Bud, but the other man doesn't listen and leaves the room. How <i>could</i> he not listen to a shout like that, though?...<br />
<br />
You're left alone with Bud in the sub-generator room, and the old man is red with fury again. The silence is growing uncomfortable. What will you do?</span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: #808080">Hugo felt silly. He clearly should have been paying closer attention. He totally missed the breeze. But then again, he would have never thought the check the vents. Why shouldn’t the room have ventilation? Either way, he knew he wasn’t seeing the forest for the trees and needed to be more vigilant. He knew something seemed off about Terrence, and now he felt validated. Such a rush to get out of the room after the Rotom idea. Was he setting Hugo up? He must’ve known that wasn’t the right answer, and he knew that Bud would know that wasn’t the right answer and Bud would have gotten rid of Hugo on the spot. And then when he saw Hugo come back into the room with Bud, he seemed to have gotten very nervous. Like he was surprised.<br />
<br />
Did Terrence have something to do with all these problems? He must have. But why? What reason could he possibly….his cousin. His cousin was killed in an accident at the plant. Was it avoidable? Possibly. Hugo didn’t know all the specifics. But was Terrence out to seek revenge on the plant? And Bud? Causing a massive outage would destroy the reputations of both Bud and the plant, which is something that appears to be very near and dear to Bud’s heart (or lack thereof). <br />
<br />
But Hugo wasn’t sure yet. And making such a giant accusation could and likely would be problematic. He needed to approach the situation with great caution.<br />
<br />
“The vent,” he finally said, speaking to Bud who was still seething. “They must connect to all the rooms, right? That would mean that something could access each of the subgenerators without having to cross through the main hallways. In theory, it could climb out of the vent, ruin the wiring, cause the outage, and climb back in without anyone being the wiser. Especially considering the location. Right behind the machine. Would make a quick slash-and-dash. It could wait until it knew the coast was clear, and then while everyone was so focused on fixing the outage, it could sneak unnoticed through the vents, into the next room, and ruin another subgenerator. Or if they aren’t interconnected, it could hide in the vent until someone had a chance to move it. It’s a tight space, sure, but there are definitely things that could fit through there.”<br />
<br />
Hugo walks toward the vent, and touches the metal grate. It moves, slightly loose in its casing since it isn’t screwed in and secure.<br />
“But it would need to actually climb out of the vents and past the grate. Is it possible that whatever is doing this is somehow able to dislodge the screwed in gate on its own then replace it each time unnoticed on its own? I suppose it’s possible, but it’s very unlikely. Somebody has loosened the grates, Bud, so whatever is in there can get out. And then they’re putting the grates back on before anyone notices. This looks like an inside job, and it would have to be someone who is responsible for fixing the outages. Someone who would be…first on the scene. Someone you probably wouldn’t expect.” Hugo gave Bud a knowing look, making a clear implication without flat out making any accusations.<br />
Hugo bent down and picked up the piece of paper that slipped from Terrence’s uniform in his hurry.<br />
<br />
“Terrence dropped this before he ran out,” Hugo explained, examining the paper.</span></div>

<b>Myahoo</b>:<br />
<br />
As you reluctantly – almost forcibly – approach the counter, the woman handling the bar smiles at you with an expression that is less the usual shopkeeper’s welcoming face and more a knowing grin.<br />
<br />
“Hello handsome. Whatcha having?”<br />
<br />
It’s as if you don’t even have to answer. The second you finish uttering that last syllable, a glass filled with a dark-red fluid comes sliding across the wooden surface and into your hand. You pick it up with extreme reluctance, wondering if you actually have to gobble down the fluid, only to find there’s a small piece of paper stuck to the bottom of the glass.<br />
<br />
<i>032847</i><br />
<br />
“You’re a cute one,” says the barwoman all of a sudden. “You should come around the back so we can get… better acquainted.”<br />
<br />
Because <i>of course</i> things had to be as shady as possible, and more so at every turn. She walks out from behind the counter and motions for you to follow her, and the two of you walk behind the bar where a cabaret stage used to be set up. Now stripped of all props, all that remains is the stage itself – basically an elevated wooden platform – and a long black curtain, reaching from the ceiling to the floor, which served to separate the stage from the backstage area. The barwoman then leans close and whispers in your ear.<br />
<br />
“Brave boy. Go ahead and join the <i>real</i> fun.”<br />
<br />
You pass through the curtain to find nothing but a wall with a single locked door, and a number pad to the right. Clearly it’s an electronic lock system, and you’re expected to go inside.<br />
<br />
Will you though? Any last-minute preparations? Should you risk a call to “C” at this moment?...[/COLOR]

</blockquote><span style="color: gray"><span style="font-size: 12px">The bartender grinned knowingly as he sat down. Clearly, she was in on it too. As he probably should've expected. Because bartenders knew <i>everything</i> in their areas. &quot;Hello handsome. Whatcha having?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aiden barely finished getting the drink's name out before she was sliding a glass full of dark red liquid down the bar to him. Well, that was step one completed. He stared sullenly into the drink, briefly wondering if he had to actually drink it and grimacing at the thought, but the edge of something white caught his eye. Under the glass...? He pulled out a small piece of paper with a series of numbers written on it. He blinked at it and immediately set to work memorizing it. If he was <i>any</i> kind of savvy, this set of numbers was gonna be useful.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're a cute one,&quot; the bartender suddenly said, pulling him out of his thoughts. He blinked at her and then smiled awkwardly when he realized what she'd said. Flirting? He didn't think she was <i>that</i> interested. &quot;You should come around the back so we can get...better acquainted.&quot; <i>Ooooh</i>, of course. Aiden fought down the flush that wanted to rise to his cheeks at the insinuation, his discomfort, and his urge to groan and facepalm at how...obviously shady this whole thing was. Like, <i>really</i>, could you <i>get</i> any more obvious?<br />
<br />
Still, when she walked out from behind the counter and motioned for him to follow her, he slid off his seat and slunk after her. She led him to the unused cabaret stage and then leaned close to whisper, &quot;Brave boy. Go ahead and join the <i>real</i> fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
He took a quick step back from her with a wary look and then ducked behind the curtain, where he rubbed at his ear as he considered the single door and number pad. He shot a brief text to Mike, updating him on the situation (<i>Heading thru a shady ass door. #OEZBAT. Wish me luck.</i>) and ignoring his brother's increasingly-worried texts, before stepping up to the number pad. Aiden took a deep breath to brace himself and then put in the number he was given. 03 28 47. No turning back now.</span></span></div>

As much as it pains you – and above all, Bud – to admit it, there might be more to Terrence than meets the eye. In fact, you’re willing to bet that he might be directly implicated in the ongoing issues, and not just as a fixer…<br />
<br />
Bud shakes his head as you speak, but does not interrupt. When you finish, too, he remains silent, absent-mindedly looking at the air vent for a while until he finally speaks up, in a noticeably lower tone than his usual roaring.<br />
<br />
“He <i>is</i> always the first on the scene. He makes sure of it. For the longest time I took that as a sign of unparalleled dedication, but now…” He pulls out an old rusty screwdriver from one of the pockets of his bright yellow uniform and begins to slowly, almost mechanically, put the grill back in place. “Terrence said nothing when his cousin fried to death handling a damaged cable back then; he continued doing his job as he always had, and never even raised his voice to me once, despite knowing I delayed calling in the routine maintenance guys because I didn’t wanna pay them. But looking back, yeah, something did change. He became insistent, almost paranoid, about handling everything, every problem, every potential flaw in the systems. Maybe he blamed himself too, or maybe he just completely lost faith in me that day.”<br />
<br />
When Bud finishes putting the grid back in place, he walks up to you and glances at the note left behind by Terrence as he hurried out of the room.<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: #808080">“Well, you might want to avoid using terms like “fried to death” when talking about someone’s relative dying in a horrific accident. A little empathy, you know, goes along way.”<br />
<br />
Hugo examined the scrap of paper.<br />
<br />
“But if there’s ever been a smoking gun, it’s right here in our hands. It’s the pattern, or rather, the plan for the outages. Look. Y equals 1. Plug in 1 and you get “2 &gt; 2 &gt; 2 &gt; 4 &gt; 2 &gt; 6”. This more or less follows the pattern of how the outages have been going. Always #2, then an even numbered subgenerator, then back to 2 again, and then the next even number generator and so on and so forth. Terrence felt – or acted like he felt – these were all occurring at random, so for him to have this in his backpocket the whole time, predicting how this would progress, is a pretty clear sign that he’s involved in whatever is going on here.”<br />
<br />
Hugo pulled a Pokeball from his waist and in a flash of light, Rhyperior materialized in the room with them again. The hulking Rock Pokemon glared at Bud, clearly looking for some excitement.<br />
<br />
“Alright, alright, calm down,” Hugo said, trying to soothe his Pokemon before it began an unnecessary rampage.<br />
<br />
“He’s here for an insurance policy. We have to go and confront Terrence about this, Bud. He was at subgenerator 4. #2 will be hit again, and then number #6, and this is going to continue forever unless we do something about it. And Terrence seems like a good person at heart, but clearly he’s dealing with some pretty heavy emotions and then lying about his behavior. Who knows how he will react? We need to be prepared and protect ourselves.”<br />
<br />
Hugo began to walk toward the door with Rhyperior lumbering behind him. He looked back to Bud.<br />
<br />

Proudly, you show Sean the crewman’s diary, definitive proof of your successful journey to the S.S. Fortune. The lifeguard takes the book from your hands and turns it around in his hands, inspecting the cover before opening it.<br />
<br />
“A wet book. Lovely as souvenirs go, not sure it’s much in the way of proof though,” he smugly retorts before finally taking a glance at the pages themselves. “Convenient that only a single page is readable; forging dozens of diary entries to make it realistic would’ve taken you a lot longer, right?”<br />
<br />
He tosses the book on the sandy ground, not even bothering to feign interest.<br />
<br />
“Shoddy piece of work. Not to mention, you didn’t need to blow up half the ship so you wouldn’t have to actually enter it – that’s public property damage and you’re probably gonna go to jail for it. If you were too scared to face the ghost that lives over there, you should’ve just said it,” he continues with a nauseating grin and his arms crossed. “Still, I guess you taught that coward how to swim, so you weren’t a complete waste of time. Come on Azurill, back to work. You’re not on vacation.”<br />
<br />
He turns around and prepares to leave, but Azurill doesn’t budge. Sean turns around and raises his voice in impatience.<br />
<br />
“I said now you worthless party balloon!”<br />
<br />
In response, the tiny Pokemon spits out a forceful stream of pressurized liquid, but not just regular water: it seems Azurill has learned <b>EM Muddy Water</b> during this journey!<br />
<br />
“Okay, that’s enough. If you won’t do as I say, I’ll just have to show you your new friend isn’t half as the man I am!” Irritated, Sean retrieves a Dive Ball from the pocket of his swimming trunks and sends out a <b>Binacle</b>. “You! Time to settle this! If you wanna talk shit about me behind my back and turn Azurill against me, you’re gonna have to prove you deserve him more than I do! He’ll see you for the fraud you are!”<br />
<br />
Well, there’s no backing down from this… It’s Sean and his Binacle vs you and <b>Level 16 Male Azurill with EMs Camouflage and Muddy Water</b>! Time to show him once and for all! </span>

</blockquote><span style="color: #808080">Big's face does not drop from his polite grin as the lifeguard disregards his proof. &quot;Yes because I would go all the way out there, blow it up and fake a journal with no materials because I clearly had time to do so after teaching an Azurill to swim and go out there and back because I was just afraid of a ghost. That ghost was simply a strong ghost pokemon, by the way, a Dhelmise to be specific.&quot; He says. He is internally nervous but immediately relieved when the Azurill doesn't go with the rude man. But he lets out a laugh when the Azurill sprays the lifeguard with muddy water. &quot;It seems the little guy has gotten smart enough to know that he doesn't have to take your verbal abuse.&quot; He crosses his arms as the lifeguard loses his temper and begins shouting as he sends out his Binacle to do battle. Big just sighs. &quot;Fine. But just know while either my Tynamo or Quilladin could easily defeat your water pokemon, I will prove a point about positive reinforcement if Azurill is willing to battle with me.&quot; The little blue pokemon nods at Big and the pair face down their opponents.<br />
<br />
Big's mind immediately goes into hyper-strategy mode. <i>At face level this seems like a pretty neutral matchup, both of the main types on each of our pokemon only do neutral damage on each other. The biggest thing to worry about is it's shell smash, we will have to finish this sooner rather than later.</i> He scratches his chin and lets out a gasp when he remembers when they first boarded the ship and he had scanned the small pokemon with his pokedex. &quot;Alright Azurill let's start this off by proving once and for all you aren't scared of the water anymore!&quot; He calls out. &quot;When you get in there use Camouflage and follow up with Bubblebeam!&quot; He pauses. &quot;If you please.&quot;</span></div>

<br />
Unsurprisingly, the door unlocks once you input the code on the paper. Cliché as it all might seem, there is no turning back now, and none of this seems staged: it’s actually happening, and you’re in the thick of it.<br />
<br />
The bartender gives you a playful pat on the shoulder, encouraging you to go inside, before returning to her post handing out drinks; all in a day’s work for her, it seems. The opened door reveals a downwards metal staircase, leading to the bar’s basement no doubt. Curiously, there seems to be a lot of noise coming from down there, which explains the heavy door to block out the sounds. Hesitantly, you walk down the stairs… to find that Black Velvet’s basement is <i>several times larger</i> than the ground floor!<br />
<br />
The sight before your eyes is both unsettling and not entirely unexpected. The basement is dimly lit, with a scarce number of lamps hanging from the ceiling; some twenty people are gathered in a circle, shouting all manner of orders and obscenities. Every now and then, you see blue flashes of light emanating from the center of the circle, which cause the crowd to cheer even louder. It doesn’t take you too long to realize what’s happening, even from where you’re standing now, but the voice behind you confirms it anyway.<br />
<br />
“Enjoying our little tournament?”<br />
<br />
You’ve heard this voice before. Turning around, you see the shady man from the alley walking up to stand beside you, smiling with pride.<br />
<br />
“Took you long enough to make up your damn mind,” he continues. “Come on, stop being a wuss, take a look for yourself.”<br />
<br />
He grabs you by the arm and approach the crowd; seeing the man, they step aside to let you get closer to the action, but you kind of wish they didn’t, because the display is sickening: a Politoed and a Machoke stand at the center of the makeshift battleground, both looking on the brink of passing out. Each of them has a collar, which periodically discharges a current of blue electricity, causing each Pokemon to cry in pain before resuming the fight. One thing you notice is that the collars stop discharging while the Pokemon battle, but quickly shock the users if they remain idle for too long…<br />
<br />
“Now, let’s talk business.”<br />
<br />
Shady Guy steps away from the crowd and waits for you to rejoin him before finally explaining everything to you. The eagerness with which he speaks, visibly more at ease here than he was on the street, shows how desperate he is to find someone reliable …<br />
<br />
“What we do here is battling in its purest form. People who gather here do so because they want to see Pokemon fight with everything they got, and what we do is provide the optimal conditions for those glorious battles. The quality, the <i>heart</i> of fighting here is miles ahead of what you’ll find anywhere else, even in the Indigo Plateau. Why? Because we figured out what makes Pokemon fight at their full potential.”<br />
<br />
He guides you to a door on the wall away from the action, and lets you in. A small makeshift infirmary has been set up, but it’s a shoddy reconstruction of an actual Pokemon Center.<br />
<br />
“Pokemon fight with all their power when the stakes are highest. And nothing is as powerful an incentive as pain. So what we do is develop those little collars, which… encourage Pokemon not to stop fighting until they win. You’ll be amazed once you see how much more fierce and relentless they become once the collar is on – they fight like gods! But the downside is, of course, lingering injuries from repeated discharges. An unfortunate consequence that we have been able to resolve in here, but the more often Pokemon come here to fight, the more injuries pile up, and we’ve been unable to provide optimal treatment to our clients. Which is… problematic.”<br />
<br />
He also walks inside the infirmary and closes the door behind him, clearly wanting to talk to you in private now.<br />
<br />
“Our business model is thriving, but it’s not ideal yet. Our battle-loving clients are encouraged to bring their own Pokemon for maximum enjoyment; since we have only developed electric shock collars for now, we advise our clients not to bring Ground Pokemon, of course, and suggest Water and Flying ones for maximum effect. And while they provide the Pokemon and the money, we provide the collars, the arena and medical treatment in turn. So you can imagine the catastrophic consequences of not being able to heal our clients’ Pokemon, especially those of our regulars, our best paying customers. This is where you come in.”<br />
<br />
He exits the infirmary and leads you to another room nearby. This one he makes no effort to conceal, instead triumphantly opening the door to let you inside. There’s a small desk with a laptop on the wall to your left, with cables connecting it to a large machine on the wall directly in front of you. Stored in several dozens of slots of this wall-sized mechanism are collars like the ones you saw earlier.<br />
<br />
“Here is where we program and charge the collars. The laptop is used to regulate voltage and discharge frequency of every collar, and it’s connected to this machine which you can look at as a giant charging dock” he says, before closing the door behind him like before. His tone then lowers once again. “Either our medical equipment is outdated, or the collars are in some way defective and discharging more than we program them to. I don’t know why, but clients’ Pokemon are accumulating more injuries than we can fix. I don’t really care what you choose to do, but I hope you can help us out. Of course, you’ll be rewarded.”<br />
<br />
He finally exits the room and leaves you with a final request.<br />
<br />
“Take a look around if you want. I’ll be back in, say… ten minutes to hear your answer.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Biggggg5</b>:<br />
<br />
Sean lets out a laugh when he sees you’re actually going through with this using <i>Azurill</i>. Clearly, the mere thought amuses him, as if he's already won even though the battle hasn't even begun yet.<br />
<br />
“Oh wow, you’re actually going through with this! When I’m done with you, Azurill is going to realize you’re nothing but a show-off who’s willing to endanger a Baby Pokemon just to prove a point!”<br />
<br />
Undeterred, Azurill dutifully jumps in the water, proving he is now completely comfortable in the liquid element. He then easily uses Camouflage to blend in with the seawater, mildly adjusting his already blue coloration to match the surroundings.<br />
<br />
“You’re really good at hiding, I see; every bit as good as you are forging evidence,” Sean taunts. “Binacle, jump in the water too and wait for that Bubble Beam.”<br />
<br />
The Rock-Type’s two heads nod simultaneously, and the barnacle follows Azurill into the water. It resurfaces quickly and simply bides its time, unable to locate the floating critter. But sure enough, the ordered Bubble Beam is fired, and that’s exactly what Sean was waiting for. The attack strikes Binacle, but hardly enough to knock it out, and now the opponent knows exactly where Azurill is hiding!<br />
<br />
“Over there! Now, <b>Shell Smash</b> and <b>Slash</b> him up!”<br />
<br />
What you feared does indeed happen, despite your preparations: Binacle shatters its own rock base and, with blistering speed, swims across the water towards the source of the bubbles, successfully slashing away at the half-concealed Azurill and dealing terrifying damage with its <i>Tough Claws</i>!<br />
<br />
“Hah! Had enough yet, show-off?”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>King Ghidorah</b>:<br />
<br />
Despite his distraught expression, you can tell Bud is listening. He has already arrived at the exact same conclusion as you, but maybe he needed to hear it from somewhere else to validate it. When you send out your Rhyperior to show you mean business, however, you catch the slightest hint of a smile forming on the old man’s tired face.<br />
<br />
“No way around it, is there?” he says almost in a whisper, before returning to his usual self. “ALRIGHT THEN, TIME TO PUT AN END TO THIS!”<br />
<br />
He reaches inside his yellow uniform and retrieves an Ultra Ball, which he tosses to the ground next to your Rhyperior. From inside, in a flash of light… a second Rhyperior materializes!<br />
<br />
“YOU HAVE GOOD TASTE IN COMPANIONS, REPAIRMAN! WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR THEN? TIME TO HEAR WHAT TERRENCE HAS TO SAY!!”<br />
<br />
Bud’s Rhyperior growls at yours, instinctively craving confrontation to determine the alpha male. Still, it remains obedient, and follows his Trainer out of the room when Bud follows you. The man may be noisy and very rough around the edges, but you can tell Bud cares about this Plant a lot and, at his heart, he means no harm to Terrence… but getting to the bottom of this is his only priority right now, and he knows the truth is closer than ever.<br />
<br />
Following the pattern, you return to sub-generator 2 as fast as you can, followed by the two lumbering rhinos, who keep growling at one another without coming to blows, fortunately. When the door to the generator slides open, sure enough… there’s Terrence.<br />
<br />
“Hey! Uh… what… what’s this about?”<br />
<br />
Visibly distressed at the sight of two Rhyperior staring him down, Terrence – who is leaning over a cable – instinctively cralws along the floor until his back is against the generator, which has already switched off. But this time around, you catch a glimpse of something else: the ventilation grid is on the floor, and something small and red nimbly moves into the duct, vanishing from sight shortly thereafter. Terrence picks up on your discovery, and is quick to explain.<br />
<br />
“The-the cuprit fled just as I was about to catch it, you two startled it!” he says hastily. “But… but I know where it’s gonna hit next! You guys should hurry to generator 7 to catch it, I’ll fix this one and catch up as soon as I can!”<br />

</span><br />
<div style="margin-left: 20px"><span style="color: gray">It is often said that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Choosing to end your self-imposed exile from the Fizzytopia region proper was one such step. Choosing to venture out into this new landscape to see it firsthand another, and choosing the city recently dubbed New Fizz as one of the first locations yet a third. Yes, all journeys begin with a single step. It occurs though, in hindsight, that in this specific instance such a step might have been better taken flown. Or by bus, at the very least.<br />
<span style="color: gray"><br />
You’d read, in the bit you’d read, that New Fizz was one of if not the largest city on the mainland of Fizzytopia - only perhaps the once-Goldenridge City could compare in size. New Fizz stretched for miles, using every inch that lay between the sea to the west and the craggy hillsides to the east. It was on the edge of this natural border that you found the Power Plant so crucial for Wattson’s evolution. It was on this edge that you took your first – literal – steps down into the city.<br />
<br />
It had been several hours, by now, since you had been dropped off in the thick of the mid-day heat. Much of the time was taken by Wattson’s training and the impromptu celebration that followed, though more than enough has been spent on this trek. It hasn’t been challenging, per say, for someone such as yourself, but… Well, tedium is certainly a word that could be attributed to the restlessness that itches under your skin. It also hasn’t helped that in all the time, crossing from rocky hills to sleepy suburbs and into the stone jungle itself, you’ve seen a scarce few people out and about. Oh, traffic’s as bad as ever for a large city, but it seems no one has taken to the sidewalks as you have. There are no joggers, no dog-walkers, no teens loitering or skating around. It could be because of the heat (no less overwhelmingly muggy for all it had dimmed in intensity) or the hour (rapidly approaching sunset, the sky awash with orange hues), you suppose, but something niggles in the back of your mind.<br />
<br />
Some like to think that a bit of healthy paranoia is a good trait to exhibit. Keeping ‘CONSTANT VIGILANCE!’ even became a meme for a time, due to a popular novel series, after all. Only you, in truth, could say whether you have reached that point of attentiveness. Surely though, if you stand a little straighter, if you keep just a bit more alert to your surroundings, to the alleys you pass… well, no one could really blame you. Certainly not, when the vigilance proves vindicated.<br />
<br />
Checking your map of the city, you find that you’ve only got a few more blocks until your goal, or at least until the plaza you’re headed towards. You aren’t quite sure what you expected of New Fizz City, to be honest, but it hasn’t seemed so bad thus far. For all you feel on edge, the city hasn’t, at the very least, felt like Bedlam Ridge, like an anarchic mess of gang warfare and looting. So, that’s going for it, you suppose.<br />
<br />
That is, of course, the exact moment you hear something. <br />
<br />
Under the din of the city, it takes you a few seconds to parse the noise, but soon enough you find it unmistakable: the sounds of a struggle. A woman shouts, very faint as if muffled, from an alleyway straight ahead. Before you can react, there’s a soft flash of light from the same alley entrance and the sounds fall away, leaving only the distant honking of car horns.<br />
<br />
Your journey has begun. What shall your next step be?</span></span>&#8203;</div>

</blockquote><span style="color: gray">The trek into the city was a journey longer than he had thought. It felt like he had been walking in the heat of the day for almost months. And yet, not a single stroller passed by. No joggers, amblers or children. Cars were noticeable, the familiar congestion of the city coming into view as Lucas finally reached the city, but the sidewalks were as empty as ever. Perhaps for the best, Lucas smirked to himself. No one in my way.<br />
<br />
And yet, a creeping sensation ran through his mind. It was as if something wasn’t right but Lucas attributed to a mere heat stroke. It was probably best to keep himself hydrated. <a href="https://forums.serebii.net/threads/pok%C3%A9mart-records.39532/page-555#post-18323254" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fforums.serebii.net%2Fthreads%2Fpok%25C3%25A9mart-records.39532%2Fpage-555%23post-18323254&amp;hash=601b7f90da9bebc01f73d5b92f8356f1" rel="nofollow noopener">And so he pulled out a water bottle to cool himself a bit (2/10)</a>. (And not a moment too soon as he worried he might be turning mad, or one-eyed for some reason)<br />
<br />
Lucas single-mindedly headed into the direction of the plaza. He kept a vigilant eye on his surroundings but with so few people around, he let his mind wander as he glanced over his map for directions and took swift steps. So far, the city seemed to have been all right. He had kept a safe distance from the outside world for months, out of concern for the safety of his Pokémon, who ridiculed him in return for his overbearing worry. Bedlam Ridge was anarchic, still was, but New Fizz City was a pleasant, sunny haven so far. He wondered what the plaza was going to be like.<br />
<br />
The moment didn’t last very long though. He crumbled up the map and shoved it back in backpack as he moved when the sound of a struggle came from nearby. Lucas couldn’t put his finger on what it was but the faint sound of a muffled woman’s scream came through. A drop of sweat ran across his forehead and down his cheek. He listened closely for some more when a sudden flash of light erupted from the nearby alley. The Pokémon on Lucas’ belt stirred uncomfortably, Doom especially as the Absol seemed to be sensing some sort of impending Doom. (Unlikely though, Lucas realised as Absol’s have a sense for natural disasters and not any threat. He recognised his Pokémon’s agitation was just his own.)<br />
<br />
The noise disappeared and the familiar sounds of traffic exploded back in his ear. With his Pokémon urging him to inspect, Lucas zipped down towards the alley, if only to ensure no one was in trouble it would be enough. His Pokémon he kept on his belt, though he was sure at least one of them – Ize in all likelihood – would come out of their Pokéball if danger was even a small possibility.</span></div>

You know you have to act quickly, because that wave isn’t going to let up, and there is no way the Hank Tank can survive such a blow. It’s fortunate, then, that you are accompanied by Lucette – who despite her diminutive size boasts considerable latent strength.<br />
<br />
Courageously, the little Feebas swims ahead, followed closely by your new companion, who is visibly impressed by your resourcefulness in the face of adversity. Lucette’s eyes glow, and the ocean responds: undulation begins to form ahead, against the natural current, and soon a second tidal wave is marching towards the first. Lucette’s lacks the size and momentum to stop the oncoming tsunami, however, and your confidence falters briefly. It is then that a third wave forms immediately behind Lucette’s, doubling her own in size. Puzzled – Corsola doesn’t know Surf, after all – you look over at Hank, who grins proudly. It is then that you see a white bird emerge from underwater, a large pelican whose eyes glow similarly to Lucette’s.<br />
<br />
“Of all the times for Awilda to find her guts, eh? The lass just evolved!”<br />
<br />
The Pelipper’s own Surf adds to yours, and together the waves crash into the oncoming mass of water, slowing it down considerably while seawater splashes all over, as if it had suddenly started raining. Finally, to ensure no harm befalls the boat, Corsola summons a Whirlpool that disrupts the rest of the wave, effectively nullifying the threat just in time!<br />
<br />
<i>*Lucette has gained 3 Levels!*</i><br />
<br />
<i>*Corsola has gained 3 levels!*</i><br />
<br />
“WOOHOO! Way to go girls!” Hank looks pumped, but maybe that’s just the way he shows his relief. It’s hard to dislike such a genuine guy, even if he doesn’t come across as particularly bright. “Now what the hell was that about? It was a bigger wave than any Surf I’ve ever seen…”<br />
<br />
As you regain composure and sit back down, Hank’s expression shifts to a dead serious look. His eyes are locked on the water around the Tank.<br />
<br />
“Sons of bitches…”<br />
<br />
One after another, small specks of pink and white begin to surface. At first, they seem like small pebbles… but then you recognize them for what they really are. Corsola fragments.<br />
<br />
The agitated sea must have kicked up the remains of hundreds of dead Corsola, which surround both the ship and your water-bound companions, who look visibly distressed by the significance of this event. Hank, too, looks distraught, despite his usual good humour.<br />
<br />
And then it starts.<br />
<br />
It begins slowly, almost unnoticeably, tiny knocks on the Tank’s hull. But the knocks grow stronger, louder, and the ship begins to wobble slightly. Finally, you spot them: light blue tentacles with purple spikes emerge from each side of the Tank, and before you know it, dozens of Mareanie attempt to climb aboard. It’s like something straight out of a horror movie.<br />
<br />
What can you do?!</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: rgb(128, 128, 128)">As Lucette summoned her wave, Mélina bit on her bottom lip, realizing that it wasn't as big as she hoped, at least enough to rival the upcoming tsunami that would cause a catastrophe to the Hank Tank crew. To almost everyone's surprise though, another, bigger wave formed behind the Feebas’. The trainer and Corsola looked at each other in confusion, the latter giving an innocent look as if saying “It wasn't me I swear”. Looking around, they see a Pelliper gone out of the water, its eyes glowing in the same way Lucette’s were.<br />
<br />
“Of all the times for Awilda to find her guts, eh?” Hank laughed. “The lass just evolved!”<br />
<br />
“Oh. ….Ooooh!” Mélina exclaimed, as the realisation the Pelliper was Hank’s Awilda helping them dawned on her.<br />
<br />
Her wave combined with the Feebas’, it smashed into the opposite one, creating an explosion of swishing sea water. While the threatening one was reduced in size considerably, it was still present and heading towards the boat. Right on cue, Corsola circled around the area to create a Whirlpool, sucking in and effectively dissipating the rest of what was left of it.<br />
<br />
As Hank cheered loudly and Catalina descended back to the boat, Mélina collapsed back on her seat and sighed heavily. She wanted to cheer too, but felt too overwhelmed at the moment and needed a breather, as the adrenaline wore off and the thought the wave that could’ve been very dangerous finally fully sank into her mind. She lifted up and tilted her head though as she heard the sailor muttering:<br />
<br />
“Sons of bitches…”<br />
<br />
Curious, she looked in the same direction as his. The stirring of the sea caused things that were stuck to the bottom to surface. Only small pieces came out at first, looking like scraps or pebbles, but as the amount and the size of those pieces grew, it was obvious they were no mere “pebbles”.<br />
<br />
They were… coral. White and pink coral. Pieces of disembodied Corsola.<br />
<br />
Mélina quietly whispered “Oh fuck.” as she covered her opened mouth in horror.<br />
<br />
Nothing on this scene though broke her heart more than seeing her still-living Corsola, surrounded by the remnants of her kin. The poor Pokémon swam around frantically to each body, shaking and yelling at them to wake up, crying more and more after each one. A few of them had a slightly different treatment, as she also gently rubbed their remains and nudged her forehead on them. Her trainer couldn’t help but let out a stream of tears of her own as she figured those were Corsola’s friends or even family. Lucette, being the only one nearby, did her best to follow and comfort her, but knew she could only do so much.<br />
<br />
The tragedy was then slightly disturbed by a noise: a light knock on the boat’s hull. It was nothing distressing at first; everyone figured it was a random rock that hit on the Tank and promptly dismissed it. However, after a few moments, the thumps increased, both in strength and frequency.<br />
<br />
“W-what’s going on?” Drying her tears with one hand, Mélina held tight on her seat with the other and worrily looked around the ship, as the banging and shaking of the boat was now impossible to ignore.<br />
<br />
As if taking the trainer’s question as a cue, blue and purple tentacles emerged all around the Tank, then slowly started to crawl into the boat...<br />
<br />
The Mareanie were coming.<br />
<br />
“What the f-” the woman sharply yelped and recoiled as one of the squishy spiky appendages slapped a bit too close to comfort. “Get out, get out! Get, OUT!” she reflexively picked up the closest object to her, an oar, and swung at a Meareanie’s limb.<br />
<br />
“Guys, help!” she yelled out to her Pokémon. “Get them off the boat!”<br />
<br />
While Catalina flew itself closer to her and Lucette made a mad dash towards the boat, the Corsola was frozen into place, shaking, fear taking hold of her at the sight of her crazed predators.<br />
<br />
“Corsola, please! We need all the help we can get! We all need to do something; <i>you</i> need to do something!”<br />
<br />
Not wanting to lose any more time, Mélina grinded the gears in her mind again as quickly as possible, while doing her best swatting a few more dangly Brutal Star arms. They need to get removed, before they damage the boat… or worse.<br />
<br />
“Lucette, <b>Hypnose</b> as many as you can! Corsola...” the trainer paused, staring at her Coral Pokémon, mixing sadness, worry, empathy and trust all into one look, “use the <b>Psychic</b> powers I taught you earlier to remove those still awake! And finally, Catalina, <b>Stealthily</b> put some <b>Rocks</b> all around the boat so it’s harder for them to come back!” After another pause she corrected herself: “Just uh, don’t put some in the front of the boat! We… might need that part clear to get away,” she slightly smiled sheepishly at Hank.<br />
<br />
As the Feebas and Minior positioned themselves, Corsola looked around her, still staying where she was. She watched once again the waves moving the carcasses of her clan, hollowed out by the Mareanie. She then looked over her new trainer, surrounded by them, but fighting them out as much as she could despite the number disadvantage. She also glanced at her teammates, going head on towards the danger. After a few moments of thought, her eyes turned into a scowl.<br />
<br />
It was time for her to get dangerous, herself.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
====================================================<br />

<br />
Corsola went from Lv.14 to Lv.17!<br />
<br />
Lucette went from Lv.23 to Lv.26!</div>

Sean lets out a laugh when he sees you’re actually going through with this using <i>Azurill</i>. Clearly, the mere thought amuses him, as if he's already won even though the battle hasn't even begun yet.<br />
<br />
“Oh wow, you’re actually going through with this! When I’m done with you, Azurill is going to realize you’re nothing but a show-off who’s willing to endanger a Baby Pokemon just to prove a point!”<br />
<br />
Undeterred, Azurill dutifully jumps in the water, proving he is now completely comfortable in the liquid element. He then easily uses Camouflage to blend in with the seawater, mildly adjusting his already blue coloration to match the surroundings.<br />
<br />
“You’re really good at hiding, I see; every bit as good as you are forging evidence,” Sean taunts. “Binacle, jump in the water too and wait for that Bubble Beam.”<br />
<br />
The Rock-Type’s two heads nod simultaneously, and the barnacle follows Azurill into the water. It resurfaces quickly and simply bides its time, unable to locate the floating critter. But sure enough, the ordered Bubble Beam is fired, and that’s exactly what Sean was waiting for. The attack strikes Binacle, but hardly enough to knock it out, and now the opponent knows exactly where Azurill is hiding!<br />
<br />
“Over there! Now, <b>Shell Smash</b> and <b>Slash</b> him up!”<br />
<br />
What you feared does indeed happen, despite your preparations: Binacle shatters its own rock base and, with blistering speed, swims across the water towards the source of the bubbles, successfully slashing away at the half-concealed Azurill and dealing terrifying damage with its <i>Tough Claws</i>!<br />
<br />
“Hah! Had enough yet, show-off?”</span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: #808080">Big is fairly confident with his strategy, but battling with a wild pokemon would prove to be a difficult task. He knew the Azurill's moves, it's ability, the average stats for the species etc. However, even though they battled together once before he would need practice to know the timing of Azurill's movements and how they would flow together. Not to mention the non-natural moves the lifeguard could have taught the Binacle. Even then he had confidence that he had the tools to win the battle. The confidence was heavily shaken when the Binacle opens up with a Shell Smash comboed into a Slash attack as he winces hard at the blow. Big also judges based on the damage dealt that the Binacle was also blessed with the Tough Claws ability, making its physical blows even more impressive. <i>The little guy definitely can't take many more of those. I thought that the water type might help defensively but he must be too smart for that.</i> He glares back at the lifeguard following the comment. &quot;We're still standing so we'll keep fighting, right Azurill?&quot; The now-water type nods his head though he has a nasty scratch now. Big considers his strategy carefully, before deciding on:&quot;Azurill give it your best Charm! Then follow up with water gun and bubble beam, make sure to use both to keep moving and keep your distance as well as attacking, just like we learned.&quot; <i>The Charm should help mitigate the Shell Smash. Unless there are any moves he's been taught his only options should be unoptimal water moves or now regular strength normal moves. I don't know if he will risk shell smash again or if he even can with the rock gone, but if he does he will open up his defenses more which will only be good for us.</i></span></div>

<b>King Ghidorah</b>:<br />
<br />
Despite his distraught expression, you can tell Bud is listening. He has already arrived at the exact same conclusion as you, but maybe he needed to hear it from somewhere else to validate it. When you send out your Rhyperior to show you mean business, however, you catch the slightest hint of a smile forming on the old man’s tired face.<br />
<br />
“No way around it, is there?” he says almost in a whisper, before returning to his usual self. “ALRIGHT THEN, TIME TO PUT AN END TO THIS!”<br />
<br />
He reaches inside his yellow uniform and retrieves an Ultra Ball, which he tosses to the ground next to your Rhyperior. From inside, in a flash of light… a second Rhyperior materializes!<br />
<br />
“YOU HAVE GOOD TASTE IN COMPANIONS, REPAIRMAN! WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR THEN? TIME TO HEAR WHAT TERRENCE HAS TO SAY!!”<br />
<br />
Bud’s Rhyperior growls at yours, instinctively craving confrontation to determine the alpha male. Still, it remains obedient, and follows his Trainer out of the room when Bud follows you. The man may be noisy and very rough around the edges, but you can tell Bud cares about this Plant a lot and, at his heart, he means no harm to Terrence… but getting to the bottom of this is his only priority right now, and he knows the truth is closer than ever.<br />
<br />
Following the pattern, you return to sub-generator 2 as fast as you can, followed by the two lumbering rhinos, who keep growling at one another without coming to blows, fortunately. When the door to the generator slides open, sure enough… there’s Terrence.<br />
<br />
“Hey! Uh… what… what’s this about?”<br />
<br />
Visibly distressed at the sight of two Rhyperior staring him down, Terrence – who is leaning over a cable – instinctively cralws along the floor until his back is against the generator, which has already switched off. But this time around, you catch a glimpse of something else: the ventilation grid is on the floor, and something small and red nimbly moves into the duct, vanishing from sight shortly thereafter. Terrence picks up on your discovery, and is quick to explain.<br />
<br />
“The-the cuprit fled just as I was about to catch it, you two startled it!” he says hastily. “But… but I know where it’s gonna hit next! You guys should hurry to generator 7 to catch it, I’ll fix this one and catch up as soon as I can!”</span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: #808080">”We’re not going anywhere. Not yet,” Hugo said. He felt pity for Terrence, knowing how difficult it can be to lose someone close to you. But he knew the best case scenario was that he was grief stricken and worst case was that he was overtly malicious, and was involved in potentially causing catastrophe. Sure, causing an outage would be disastrous for both Bud and the plant as a whole’s reputations, but the ramifications could be deadly. What if the hospitals lost power? Or the traffic signals? Or the air traffic control towers? People’s lives could literally be at stake. So while Hugo did feel bad for Terrence, he also knew he needed to be stopped. <br />
<br />
He could see the fear in Terrence’s eyes. But then again, who wouldn’t be afraid with an intuitive repairman, an enraged foreman and two hulking rock rhinos looming over you? <br />
<br />
“The jig is up, Terrence,” Hugo began to explain. “You’ve been careful, but sooner or later, you knew you were going to slip up somehow.” Hugo brandished the paper with the puzzle on it. “You dropped this. And then it all started to come together. We know you’re behind this, or at the very least, deeply involved. You know what’s been doing this all along, and you’ve been enabling it to happen.”<br />
<br />
Hugo looked to the loose grate. “I saw something go through the vent. It was red. And you helped it get away. What was it? You need to tell us. Now.”<br />
<br />
The firmness in his voice caused Rhyperior to react and began to grumble, and roar. Hugo patted the Drill Pokemon on the chest to calm it. <br />
<br />
“Not yet. Not yet. We’re going to give Terrence a chance to explain himself. What’s going on here, Terrence? What went into the vent? Is 7 really the next target, or are you just trying to throw us off so you can escape? If we’re going to go anywhere, we’re <i>all</i> going. Together. You included. So tell me, what’s going on?”</span></div>
