<span style="font-size: 15px">The Greater Fizzby Metropolitan Zone</span></b><br />
<br />
<b><i>~Please initially post in Gray~</i></b><br />
<br />
Newly renamed after the turmoil that gripped the region had settled, New Fizz City shines as a beacon of the region’s new future. Sprawling for miles across the land and stretching up into the sky, New Fizz City is truly the pinnacle of a metropolis. In this city that never sleeps, there’s so much to do and see you’d be hard-pressed to have a boring time.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b>Downtown – The Business &amp; Entertainment Districts</b></span>&#8203;</div><br />
<b>The Municipal Plaza:</b> Located right at the heart of the city, the Municipal Plaza holds many of the buildings necessary for a city to run, among them the main Municipal Building – home to the Mayor of New Fizz City, Jules Brown – and the central police headquarters. Additionally, at the center of the plaza is the Fizzygarden Park, a popular gathering point among trainers and tourists alike. Like much of the city urban Pokémon are common, though in the Park a much larger variety is also found.<br />
<br />
<b>High Street</b>: Coming off of the Municipal Plaza, High Street is the best place to shop in the entire city. Lined with stores as far as the eye can see, if you’re looking for something you can bet that someplace here has it. Even if you don’t have a goal in mind, something is sure to catch your attention when strolling down High Street. Typically, trainer owned Pokémon are more common than any wild ones on High Street, though there’s always a chance you might find a stray creature down one of the many alleys that branch off from the street. <br />
<br />
<b>Knowledge Square</b>: On the edge between the suburbs and downtown, Knowledge Square exists as the premier gathering point of academics and anyone interested in learning something new. Across the several blocks of Knowledge Square several popular museums exist, including the famed Fizzby Metropolitan Art Museum. If books are more your cup of tea, then you might rather visit the New Fizz Public Library – one of the largest libraries in the region – or possibly tour the University of Fizzy Bubbles. Lastly, at the heart of Knowledge Square sits the Pokémon Research Centre, where several famous professors and academics gather to share studies and give lectures. If you’re lucky, some might even be looking for some research help. <br />
<br />
<b>The Unofficial NFC Gym</b>: Though no official gym circuit exists in the region, that has not stopped trainers of all strengths from gathering at the Unofficial NFC Gym. With tourneys going on all the time, if battles are what you’re looking for, this is the place to be. Wild Pokémon aren’t terribly common around the gym, though if one is found you can bet it is one looking to get stronger.<br />
<br />
<b>Nightlife Row</b>: Living up to its name, Nightlife Row is the place to be – and party at – when the sky grows dark. In the day, however, Nightlife Row tends to house a much different and generally seedier clientele. Be careful if on your own, because you never know what kind of deals might be going down in Nightlife Row. <br />
<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 12px"><b>The Harbor District</b></span>&#8203;</div><br />
<b>Fizzby Harbor</b>: A main port of trade in the region, Fizzby Harbor always has a few ships docked at any given time. Most are here for business, but if you ask around you might just find a captain or two willing to take some extra crew members aboard for jobs or for a sightseeing tour (just watch out for the <i>SS. Finneon</i>; it has a habit of getting lost even on simple three hour tours!). <br />
<br />
<b>Fishing Cove</b>: At the junction between the harbor and beach lies a small out of the way cove. The locals and visitors alike swear that this might just be the holy grail of fishing sites, leading to its name: Fishing Cove. If you want a calm area to just fish and relax, this is the place for you. And don’t forget to record your catches! The fish hut nestled back in the cove is always giving out prizes for the biggest or best catch of the day.<br />
<br />
<b>Bubbling Beach</b>: The main tourist draw of the harbor district, Bubbling Beach’s undersea vents leave the waters bubbly, but not chaotic enough that swimming becomes impossible. Popular among families, the Bubbling Beach Boardwalk is also generally busy, but with ever changing attractions and events, there’s always a reason to come back. Like much of the harbor, water-types and other Pokémon who love the sea tend to congregate.<br />
<br />
<b>Treasure Island</b>: Located a few miles off the harbor’s coast, Treasure Island has become something of a legend amongst both NFC’s residents and the visiting sailors. On the surface, items frequently wash up with the tide. Legends say though of a great treasure hidden somewhere in the caves beneath. No one’s found it yet, but if you’re lucky enough, the legends about this island might just be right. Another thing of note about the island is its high leveled Pokémon of varying species, unusually so for the city. Some think this lends to the treasure theory, though others just think the Pokémon here are of a tougher breed than those in the city.<br />
<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 12px"><b>New Fizz City Outskirts</b></span>&#8203;</div><br />
<b>Fizzitopian Power Plant</b>: Situated on the far outskirts of the city, the Fizzitopian Power Plant provides power not only for New Fizz City but much of the surrounding areas. Operated by skilled technicians and a loyal and well-kept troop of Voltorb and Electrode, this Power Plant is happy to say that it hasn’t had an outage in over fifty years. Many electric Pokémon are found here, mooching off the excess electricity and sometimes even pitching in themselves. Additionally, certain Pokémon needing electromagnetic influence to evolve have been recently reported to do so on and near the Power Plant grounds.<br />
<br />
<b>The Fizzby Railyard</b>: The centralized hub for all railway activity on this side of the region, the Fizzby Railyard does on land what the Harbor does for the sea. Though all tracks are kept clear of Pokémon for the safety of everyone, many steel-types still like to hang around the yard wherever they can. <br />
<br />
<b>Bullarum Industrial Complex</b>: Situated with the Harbor on one side and the Railyard on the other, the Bullarum Industrial Complex is in the perfect place for shipping and trading. Styled after the Virbank Complex in Unova, the Bullarum Complex specializes in oil refinery and distribution, though warehousing is an equally important part of the Complex’s business. Much like the Railyard, steel-types tend to gather here though fire-types and poison-types are also common. Additionally, ice-types love to gather at the cold-storage warehouses scattered around the complex.</span>&#8203;</div></div>

Guess i'm lucky I have the advantage in this are eh?&quot; &quot;Come on Geddy you know I have no idea what you are talking about. I can't understand you just yet.&quot; &quot;That's not my fault man, you were the one that set up that arbitrary rule.&quot; The tynamo abruptly breaks the fourth wall. &quot;Why don't you sing us a song then, maybe it'll attract the pokemon we are looking for.&quot; Big continues his trudge up and down the beach, keeping an eye out on the water for wild pokemon as the Tynamo begins to sing to the two of them:<br />

However, you and Geddy are searching for something completely different, not rest and relaxation at all but rather your next thrilling adventure. Is this the place to find it though?....<br />
<br />
Geddy's singing seems to yield very little fruit as far as luring Pokemon is concerned. Rather, it seems to send them away, somewhat like a living Black Flute... For quite a while, all you can see are people and their Pokemon enjoying their vacation, and nothing seems to happen, much to your dismay.<br />

The sudden cries of a nearby woman shake away all trace of monotony. Desperate, she waves her arms by the shore, looking over at a young boy who seems to have been dragged by a sudden shift in the sea currents!<br />

Not a minute later, a young lifeguard in his late thirties, with short brown hair and dressed in a red jacket comes running over with his Pokemon in tow. He quickly assesses the situation, then issues his instructions to his partner, a small

&quot;Azurill, let's get ready to do this! Get in the water and use your tail buoy to rescue the kid!&quot;<br />
<br />
The blue Pokemon approaches the edge of the sea... and stops, unable to take another step. Visibly terrified, Azurill runs back to the lifeguard, who rolls his eyes and takes matters into his own hands. He rushes in the water, swims over to the boy and after a while, safely brings him to shore, much to his mother's relief. But despite his success, the lifeguard looks positively livid as he walks away from the reunited family.<br />

&quot;You are <i>useless</i>! Absolutely worthless,&quot; he berates the Azurill. &quot;What good are you to a lifeguard if you're afraid of the sea?! I swear, I should've let you go a long time ago! I'm <i>this</i> close to giving up on you entirely!&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Azurill starts crying, and the lifeguard covers his face with his hands in sheer exasperation. Will you keep moving in search of your own adventure, or should you intervene here?...</span></div>

However, you and Geddy are searching for something completely different, not rest and relaxation at all but rather your next thrilling adventure. Is this the place to find it though?....<br />
<br />
Geddy's singing seems to yield very little fruit as far as luring Pokemon is concerned. Rather, it seems to send them away, somewhat like a living Black Flute... For quite a while, all you can see are people and their Pokemon enjoying their vacation, and nothing seems to happen, much to your dismay.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;HELP! Anybody please help!! My son... my son is going to drown! He can't make it back! Please, anyone!!&quot;</i><br />
<br />
The sudden cries of a nearby woman shake away all trace of monotony. Desperate, she waves her arms by the shore, looking over at a young boy who seems to have been dragged by a sudden shift in the sea currents!<br />
<br />
Not a minute later, a young lifeguard in his late thirties, with short brown hair and dressed in a red jacket comes running over with his Pokemon in tow. He quickly assesses the situation, then issues his instructions to his partner, a small

</blockquote><span style="color: #808080">As Geddy's song winds down and he's about to start another one (despite the fact it seems to be having the opposite effect) when he suddenly hears a cry for help. He looks to the source and hears that someone's drowning. His first instinct is to call for a lifeguard or even start to head out himself but before he can move the lifeguard on duty seems to be on top of the situation. He watches as he tries to get his Azuril to go out to save the drowning child but the water pokemon seems too scared. After the lifeguard goes out to save the kid himself he comes back and begins to berate the small pokemon. Loudly. Big runs over to the pair going &quot;Hey hey hey!&quot; He wants to put himself between the man and his pokemon but decides against it. &quot;What are you yelling at the little guy for? He's just a little one, not even a water type yet. You aren't going to make him <i>less </i>scared of the water like that. That's no way to treat any pokemon.&quot; He says going off more than he meant to but doubles down. &quot;You never threaten or wish that you had released your pokemon. It's just mean.&quot; He crosses his arms and waits for a response from the lifeguard. Geddy in the meantime hovers down close to the fairy pokemon in attempts to cheer the small pokemon up. &quot;Hey there, you alright?&quot; The electric type asks. &quot;I got songs to cheer you up if you want.&quot;</span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: gray"><span style="font-size: 12px">Aiden wandered down the streets of New Fizz, turning the events of last week over and over in his head. Had he done something wrong when he'd hatched the Aerodactyl? Or could it tell that he had <i>no</i> experience whatsoever with the whole Trainer thing and decided to go find someone else? There were animals that could do that, he remembered reading somewhere, so he wouldn't be <i>entirely</i> surprised if that was the reason. Still, that Aerodactyl was supposed to be <i>his</i> first Pokémon. His <i>starter</i>. After the huge setback with the Casino and coins, that was his <i>one</i> chance to get a starter and he <i>blew</i> it. Somehow.<br />
<br />
Which...was why he was heading in the general direction of New Fizz's Library. Hopefully, there was someone there who could help him figure out what he'd done wrong or what he could do better the next time he got another chance at a Pokémon. <i>If</i> he got another chance at a Pokémon.<br />
<br />
He blew out a breath and tilted his head up to stare at the sky. Maybe he should just follow Mike's example and just give up on it. There was a <i>reason</i> their parents hadn't let them do the whole Trainer thing, though he was still inclined to think they were just overreacting. He'd checked the statistics and, while there was a nonzero chance of people dying, it wasn't exactly <i>common</i>.<br />
<br />
He shook his head and dropped his gaze back to his surroundings. No. He'd already hacked into an official Trainer's account and probably broken the law. Actually, correction: with the whole looting-the-Casino thing, he had <i>definitely</i> broken the law. While he <i>could</i> back out--no one had come after him for either of his law-breaking stunts--he wasn't going to. He'd hoped and wished and <i>dreamed</i> of doing the Trainer thing for <i>years</i>; after everything he'd <i>already</i> done, he was <i>going</i> to see this through. Though, he wasn't exactly looking forward to the bad end, if he got caught.<br />
<br />
Speaking of bad ends, the street he was walking down didn't...look right. He glanced around and winced. Yeah, it looked like he'd ended up in a bad neighborhood. But, backtracking probably wasn't a good idea...<br />
<br />
He grimaced and ducked his head. Hopefully, he didn't run into any trouble...</span></span></div>

<span style="color: #808080">Today was a peculiarly hot day it felt. Lucas used his sleeve to wipe the sweat on his brow. It didn’t help that there was so little shade and he was high-flying atop his Salamence. The sun beamed down harshly, but luckily for him his target came into sight. Lucas had kept a steady absence from Fizzytopia since the revolution. He was fearful of what had become of it and sheltered himself on his island, training his Pokémon in the meantime. Sal was one such result of the training. The monolithic dragon, along with others, had became anxious about leaving the island and exploring the world for themselves. While Lucas had lent his aid in the rebuilding, he had preferred to shy away from the land, recounting Bedlam City and its weekly news reports all too well.<br />
<br />
“Down there Sal,” he ordered. The Salamence roared obediently. She was more than happy about having had the chance to spread her wings a bit more. True, Lucas would for the first time approach one of the new cities, but he was gong to try and remain on the outskirts before slowly moving deeper. Besides, he had one last goal to attain before he was ready.<br />
<br />
Sal skidded in a low flight across the ground, slowing down but not stopping. Lucas had promised her some freedom, she wasn’t planning to give him the chance to stop her. Lucas understood though, but only smirked at it. He steadied himself and jumped off once they were low enough to the ground. Lucas settled into a short jog to balance himself, then slowed, stopped and turned back to wave at his Salemance who ascended back to the skies for some flight. Her dark figure would remain in sight as much as she could.<br />
<br />
He was here, the Power Plant station. According to some of the books he had managed to obtain, there were specific evolutionary tricks for some Pokémon. <a href="http://forums.upnetwork.net/showpost.php?p=809219&amp;postcount=265" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.upnetwork.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D809219%26postcount%3D265&amp;hash=d23330d7c9fd07459056ee8d7a01e022" rel="nofollow noopener">He had only recently come across one for Faust his Dusclops. Well, his Dusknoir now.</a> Lucas didn’t understood how an item could affect a Pokémon during trading, but he had decided to research some more himself, obtaining a few books on Pokémon studies. While he didn’t necessarily understand all of the scientific jargon, he grasped enough to understand how certain specialised evolutions work. Specifically, that rumours surrounding Magneton were true. What’s more, Lucas had a gut instinct that the gossip surrounding the power plant and its electromagnetic environment might aid him. He had, to a minor extent, detailed the plan to Wattson, his Magneton.<br />
<br />
Lucas called forth his Pokémon; the Magneton and an Absol named Doom. Immediately on exiting its Pokéball, Wattson entered a whining hum. Lucas sighed and wanted to ask it to shut up but knew it wouldn’t help much. Ever since Wattson was a Magnemite it had certain ‘sensitivity’ issues with regards to electronic devices. Whenever an electrical apparatus was near, it would enter a screeching wail, as if the electromagnetic hum was affecting it. An overreaction for sure, but with all Lucas had read, he had a suspicion there might have been more to it. No doubt Wattson already sensed the electromagnetic influx emanating from the power plant. Now he just had to figure out how he could use those waves to fully stabilise the Pokémon. He reckoned a good-old-fashioned battle might be the best way to go about it, considering most Pokémon evolved from training regularly and levelling up. This was where Doom the Absol came in. <a href="http://forums.upnetwork.net/showpost.php?p=804466&amp;postcount=38" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.upnetwork.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D804466%26postcount%3D38&amp;hash=5dd4c0ab98ca8ff15eebc798f606d324" rel="nofollow noopener">Last time the two battled, Doom easily overcame the Magneton with his speed and critical hits.</a> Now though…<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
The battle took a while, though that ended up mostly being due to the fact that Wattson wasn’t putting in as much effort to aim, and Doom was taking his time avoiding attacks rather than getting a hit in of his own.<br />
<br />
“Come on Wattson,” Lucas cheered his Pokémon on. “We’ve talked about this. Now, <b>Lock-On</b>.” A smell sense of fear reflected off of the Absol’s eyes as he realised what was about to happen. Immediately, it sped into a direct attack towards the Magneton and delivered a critical <b>Night Slash</b>, though not one that would have knocked it out. “Too little too late Doom,” his trainer nearly boasted, “now Wattson, as we practiced, <b>Zap Cannon</b>!”<br />
<br />
“Mag-ne-ton,” it obeyed and all six magnets pointed forward and inward, concentrating a large electrical orb in the centre. Doom tried to speed off to avoid the incoming attack but the Magneton’s three eyes had already locked on their target. The orb was released, and while slow-moving, struck the area exactly where Wattson anticipated its opponent to be. Doom’s hair frizzled and his body twitched as paralysis from the attack settled in. He collapsed on the floor and Lucas ended the battle, giving the victory to Wattson. That wasn’t the only reason though. Lucas saw how the residual electricity from the Zap Cannon lingered and arched around Wattson’s three centres. The electromagnetic waves from the power plant were already affecting him and his electrical power supply.<br />
<br />
Wattson erupted in a bright glow. His body flattened out as the three separate bodies were mashed together into one; one large elliptic centre and two smaller orbs on the sides. By the time its new body was formed, the glow dissipated and a new form was present

, one that didn’t feel the tug of electromagnetism so much or whinged about it. Lucas pulled out his Pokédex.<br />

Magnezone, the Magnet Area Pokémon. The three units generate magnetism. Sometimes the magnetism emitted by Magnezone is too strong, making them attract each other so they cannot move. A group tried to use scientific means to make Magnezone evolve, but their efforts ended in failure. It uses radar to monitor its territory. Intruders are quickly disposed of with a hyper beam. As it zooms through the sky, this Pokémon seems to be receiving signals of unknown origin, while transmitting signals of unknown purpose. There have been many mistaken reports of UFO sightings when Magnezone flies through the night sky. There are still people who believe that this Pokémon came from outer space.

</blockquote>There was a lot more data on the new Pokémon, too much to take in all at once, and so Lucas continued fiddling with the buttons as he looked through as much data as he could, his interest rekindled with each new titbit of info. His Pokémon joined his side, licking their wounds and trying to peek over his shoulder to look at the Pokédex themselves. Lucas had brought food with him for lunch, and it slowly became clear to everyone but their trainer that they wanted to have their meal. Lucas remained ignorant for a while until he caved and laid out the small banquet he had promised. The meal was also brought as a small celebration feast for if Wattson would evolve. After passing the congratulations and finishing up their lunch, they packed their belongings, and the Pokémon retreated into their Pokéball for some rest. All safe for Sal, who was the only one on his current team who didn’t come down for a meal, and had remained airborne all this time. Lucas couldn’t spot her anywhere in the sky, but he trusted she would find him later towards the end of the day.<br />
<br />
Lucas stared into the distance, from the outskirts into the city centre. He wasn’t sure what the city was like. He was both curious and slightly fearful of discovering it though. Gently, he made his first tentative steps from the <b>Fizzytopian Power Plant</b> in the direction of <b>Municipal Plaza</b>, carefully vigilant of his surroundings.</span></div>

<b>New Fizz City<br />
The Greater Fizzby Metropolitan Zone<br />
<br />
~Please initially post in Gray~</b><br />
<br />
Newly renamed after the turmoil that gripped the region had settled, New Fizz City shines as a beacon of the region’s new future. Sprawling for miles across the land and stretching up into the sky, New Fizz City is truly the pinnacle of a metropolis. In this city that never sleeps, there’s so much to do and see you’d be hard-pressed to have a boring time.<br />
<br />
<b>The Municipal Plaza:</b> Located right at the heart of the city, the Municipal Plaza holds many of the buildings necessary for a city to run, among them the main Municipal Building – home to the Mayor of New Fizz City, Jules Brown – and the central police headquarters. Additionally, at the center of the plaza is the Fizzygarden Park, a popular gathering point among trainers and tourists alike. Like much of the city urban Pokémon are common, though in the Park a much larger variety is also found.

</blockquote>Makoto stood before the metallic gate to Fizzygarden Park, carrying Meringue in his arms. He had arrived at the right place, but was this where he wanted to begin searching for a mentor? Certain pokemon had psychic powers, but they were still pokemon. A human, on the other hand, could give him much clearer advice. Maybe that should be his first option.<br />
<br />
But how would he know who is a psychic and who isn't? Sabrina may have had those fancy glowing bracelets, but it wasn't like she had an eye tattooed on her forehead. And how would people react to him? He began to imagine the scenarios...<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;E-Excuse me...&quot; Makoto asked a stranger, &quot;Do you know anyone with... psychic powers in this city?&quot;<br />
<br />
A man with big biceps and black sunglasses stared at him like he was some strange meat puppet, so Makoto got out of his hair without a word.<br />
<br />
He tried the next person he could find. &quot;Do you... know any places where I can find a psychic?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, it's Haru's loser kid.&quot; This teen's buzz cut and pointy chin drew from Makoto's memories. Just his luck: he happened to run to that heckler from another dojo. &quot;Wanna know where it is? It's five miles past get lost.&quot; He sauntered off and Makoto waited for someone else to ask.<br />
<br />
Before he could ask the third hypothetical local, she clutched her precious Pichu between her pearl-adorned arms and fled.</i><br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
No longer lost in his thoughts, Makoto shook off his spaced-out stare and reached his decision. &quot;...Let's look for a pokemon,&quot; he said as he headed into the park. Meringue responded with the slightest of nods.<br />
<br />
The map didn't do the park justice. The green shape and blue splotches intended to represent Fizzygarden Park undersold just how lush this giant garden was. It vaguely reminded him of Route 202 back home, but nothing there compared to this park's cloud-like shrubs, its vibrant blossoms, and the verdant branches dancing above.<br />
<br />
Makoto could only admire the greenery for a moment before remembering what his objective was. He had to search high and low for his prospective psychic-type mentor. He may have to raise and evolve them too, but finding them was step one. And he had to do it by himself. With just his togepi. A pokemon that could claim victory with his mysterious powers... mysterious powers untested in battle. And he still looked so small and vulnerable!<br />
<br />
He lightly gripped the tiny, tranquil pokemon for comfort, hoping his choice won't somehow go horribly wrong, and continued onward...</span></div>

<br />
<div style="margin-left: 20px">It is often said that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Choosing to end your self-imposed exile from the Fizzytopia region proper was one such step. Choosing to venture out into this new landscape to see it firsthand another, and choosing the city recently dubbed New Fizz as one of the first locations yet a third. Yes, all journeys begin with a single step. It occurs though, in hindsight, that in this specific instance such a step might have been better taken flown. Or by bus, at the very least.<br />
<br />
You’d read, in the bit you’d read, that New Fizz was one of if not the largest city on the mainland of Fizzytopia - only perhaps the once-Goldenridge City could compare in size. New Fizz stretched for miles, using every inch that lay between the sea to the west and the craggy hillsides to the east. It was on the edge of this natural border that you found the Power Plant so crucial for Wattson’s evolution. It was on this edge that you took your first – literal – steps down into the city.<br />
<br />
It had been several hours, by now, since you had been dropped off in the thick of the mid-day heat. Much of the time was taken by Wattson’s training and the impromptu celebration that followed, though more than enough has been spent on this trek. It hasn’t been challenging, per say, for someone such as yourself, but… Well, tedium is certainly a word that could be attributed to the restlessness that itches under your skin. It also hasn’t helped that in all the time, crossing from rocky hills to sleepy suburbs and into the stone jungle itself, you’ve seen a scarce few people out and about. Oh, traffic’s as bad as ever for a large city, but it seems no one has taken to the sidewalks as you have. There are no joggers, no dog-walkers, no teens loitering or skating around. It could be because of the heat (no less overwhelmingly muggy for all it had dimmed in intensity) or the hour (rapidly approaching sunset, the sky awash with orange hues), you suppose, but something niggles in the back of your mind.<br />
<br />
Some like to think that a bit of healthy paranoia is a good trait to exhibit. Keeping ‘CONSTANT VIGILANCE!’ even became a meme for a time, due to a popular novel series, after all. Only you, in truth, could say whether you have reached that point of attentiveness. Surely though, if you stand a little straighter, if you keep just a bit more alert to your surroundings, to the alleys you pass… well, no one could really blame you. Certainly not, when the vigilance proves vindicated.<br />
<br />
Checking your map of the city, you find that you’ve only got a few more blocks until your goal, or at least until the plaza you’re headed towards. You aren’t quite sure what you expected of New Fizz City, to be honest, but it hasn’t seemed so bad thus far. For all you feel on edge, the city hasn’t, at the very least, felt like Bedlam Ridge, like an anarchic mess of gang warfare and looting. So, that’s going for it, you suppose.<br />
<br />
That is, of course, the exact moment you hear something. <br />
<br />
Under the din of the city, it takes you a few seconds to parse the noise, but soon enough you find it unmistakable: the sounds of a struggle. A woman shouts, very faint as if muffled, from an alleyway straight ahead. Before you can react, there’s a soft flash of light from the same alley entrance and the sounds fall away, leaving only the distant honking of car horns.<br />
<br />
Your journey has begun. What shall your next step be?&#8203;</div><br />
<a href="https://forums.bulbagarden.net/index.php?goto/post&amp;id=6426518#post-6426518" class="link link--internal" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fforums.bulbagarden.net%2Findex.php%3Fgoto%2Fpost%26id%3D6426518%23post-6426518&amp;hash=94be5447c8a25f28847195df61ba64ed" rel="nofollow noopener"><b>Severus Snope:</b></a><br />
<br />
<div style="margin-left: 20px">It is truly a lovely day to visit the Fizzygarden Park. Greenery dots the land as far as the eye can see – an oasis of color, of <i>life</i>, against the desert of buildings stretching up from the horizons. A gentle breeze wafts past, causing the blossoming gardens of daffodils and tulips to dance as the sun shining high above gifts its warm rays to all below. If there were ever a day to just stop a smell the roses and relax, this were it.<br />
<br />
In that regard, it is a shame you are here with a goal in mind.<br />
<br />
It is that very goal that propels you forward, past the gates and into the park proper. You need a mentor for your fledgling psionic powers, and for all a human psychic would help in the long-term, a Psychic-type is much less risky to approach. That in mind you move further into the park, eyes peeled for any hint of your quarry… whatever that might ultimately be.<br />
<br />
You do, eventually, make it off the main pathways to begin your search in earnest, though not without more than a bit of difficulty. It’s almost a shame that asking around for a human mentor is a bad idea. There’s certainly enough out walking around today. More, actually, than you’d kind of expected to be here, even for a park of this size. The reason for that soon becomes apparent as you crest a grassy hill, giving you the perfect overlook of a carnival set up right in the park.<br />
<br />
Housed in what must during the colder months be an ice rink, the carnival contains everything you’d really expect of one. There’s many game stalls scattered around, all complete with obnoxiously large plush prizes of Pikachu, Eevee, and Jigglypuff hanging from the supports. In one area, a Machamp and muscular strongman alternate attempts to show up the other, strumming up business at a ring-the-bell strength game; while in another kids aim Remoraid-shaped water pistols at Mr. Mime face cutouts in a shoot-the-clown booth. There’s even cycling above it all a Poke-ball themed Ferris wheel. Perhaps what stands out the most to you, though, is the Musharna. <br />
<br />
Down alongside a ring toss game, you see the small shape of a floating Musharna, eyes bright red and glowing, as it forms images in its dream mist to the amusement of a small horde of children. You try to make out the images, though at this distance you can’t see much more than what seems to be a white-bearded wizard stirring up magic, but might also be a Mankey wearing a powdered wig. It’s honestly very hard to tell.<br />
<br />
For a long moment you zone out, inner debate clouding your mind. On the one hand, that is the first Psychic-type you’ve seen, and a strong one at that. On the other, Musharna are more known for their skill at dream manipulation than at any psychic abilities like your own. In either case, the decision seems to make itself when you see a woman dressed in a very well-fitting suit steps up alongside the Psychic Pokémon. As she begins performing for the kids with the Psychic-type as her assistant, it becomes obvious she is the Musharna’s trainer, and a magician to boot. (That just is all the more disappointing; when are magicians ever actually psychic?) For a single instant you perk back up, thinking you’ve seen an Abra. That would be the perfect Pokémon to look for! Alas, it proves to only be a trick of the dream mist.<br />
<br />
You suppose you could go poke around the carnival some, though it does seem to be full more of people than Pokémon, or at least any you could catch. You’ve also only just begun your search, barely scratching the surface of what this park has to offer. There's countless places to head towards, such as a pond you can faintly see peeking out from behind the start of a grove of trees. Could be promising; certainly fewer people at any rate.<br />
<br />
The choice is yours. Where would you like to go?&#8203;</div></span></div>

</span><br />
<div style="margin-left: 20px"><span style="color: gray">It is truly a lovely day to visit the Fizzygarden Park. Greenery dots the land as far as the eye can see – an oasis of color, of <i>life</i>, against the desert of buildings stretching up from the horizons. A gentle breeze wafts past, causing the blossoming gardens of daffodils and tulips to dance as the sun shining high above gifts its warm rays to all below. If there were ever a day to just stop a smell the roses and relax, this were it.<br />
<span style="color: gray"><br />
In that regard, it is a shame you are here with a goal in mind.<br />
<br />
It is that very goal that propels you forward, past the gates and into the park proper. You need a mentor for your fledgling psionic powers, and for all a human psychic would help in the long-term, a Psychic-type is much less risky to approach. That in mind you move further into the park, eyes peeled for any hint of your quarry… whatever that might ultimately be.<br />
<br />
You do, eventually, make it off the main pathways to begin your search in earnest, though not without more than a bit of difficulty. It’s almost a shame that asking around for a human mentor is a bad idea. There’s certainly enough out walking around today. More, actually, than you’d kind of expected to be here, even for a park of this size. The reason for that soon becomes apparent as you crest a grassy hill, giving you the perfect overlook of a carnival set up right in the park.<br />
<br />
Housed in what must during the colder months be an ice rink, the carnival contains everything you’d really expect of one. There’s many game stalls scattered around, all complete with obnoxiously large plush prizes of Pikachu, Eevee, and Jigglypuff hanging from the supports. In one area, a Machamp and muscular strongman alternate attempts to show up the other, strumming up business at a ring-the-bell strength game; while in another kids aim Remoraid-shaped water pistols at Mr. Mime face cutouts in a shoot-the-clown booth. There’s even cycling above it all a Poke-ball themed Ferris wheel. Perhaps what stands out the most to you, though, is the Musharna. <br />
<br />
Down alongside a ring toss game, you see the small shape of a floating Musharna, eyes bright red and glowing, as it forms images in its dream mist to the amusement of a small horde of children. You try to make out the images, though at this distance you can’t see much more than what seems to be a white-bearded wizard stirring up magic, but might also be a Mankey wearing a powdered wig. It’s honestly very hard to tell.<br />
<br />
For a long moment you zone out, inner debate clouding your mind. On the one hand, that is the first Psychic-type you’ve seen, and a strong one at that. On the other, Musharna are more known for their skill at dream manipulation than at any psychic abilities like your own. In either case, the decision seems to make itself when you see a woman dressed in a very well-fitting suit steps up alongside the Psychic Pokémon. As she begins performing for the kids with the Psychic-type as her assistant, it becomes obvious she is the Musharna’s trainer, and a magician to boot. (That just is all the more disappointing; when are magicians ever actually psychic?) For a single instant you perk back up, thinking you’ve seen an Abra. That would be the perfect Pokémon to look for! Alas, it proves to only be a trick of the dream mist.<br />
<br />
You suppose you could go poke around the carnival some, though it does seem to be full more of people than Pokémon, or at least any you could catch. You’ve also only just begun your search, barely scratching the surface of what this park has to offer. There's countless places to head towards, such as a pond you can faintly see peeking out from behind the start of a grove of trees. Could be promising; certainly fewer people at any rate.<br />
<br />
The choice is yours. Where would you like to go?</span></span>&#8203;</div>

</blockquote><span style="color: #808080">A carnival? Makoto certainly wasn't expecting this. It looked like fun, too! A Ferris wheel, performers, giant plushies?!<br />
<br />
&quot;...I must stay focused,&quot; he told himself. He began toward the pond, but not before looking over the carnival once more. The place seemed so enticing, so joyous, so magical! Literally! The magician and musharna seemed so skilled in illusions and sleights of hand.<br />
<br />
Now Makoto knew his next destination. After his search, he could drop by the carnival if it was still running. But what if it was closed by then? What if it was the last day? Even if it wasn't, what if the magician was gone? They just might have a chance of having some insight to share... if he could work up the courage to ask.<br />
<br />
...No time to waste! Makoto was set to get this search done as soon as possible! Cover all the ground! At the speed of sound, even! He began to bolt toward the pond... only to nearly drop the resting Meringue. He settled on a brisk walk instead.</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: gray"><b><span style="color: gray">Biggggg5</span></b><span style="color: gray">: </span>The lifeguard’s eyebrow rises while he hears you berate him for his antics. Arms crossed, head tilted slightly, his posture is anything but friendly, but when you’re done, his reply comes as somewhat surprising.<br />
<br />
“<i>My</i> Pokemon? That Azurill isn’t <i>my</i> Pokemon. It’s just a stray,” he clarifies, visibly annoyed by your intromission. “I found it a couple of weeks ago, probably broke off from its pack by mistake. I took it in and have been trying to turn it into a proper lifeguard, but lo and behold, it’s afraid of the damn water.”<br />
<br />
The lifeguard walks closer to the edge of the water and looks to the distance, then turns back to you with a faint grin.<br />
<br />
“Not that you asked, but my name’s Sean. I’m the only lifeguard in this entire beach, so don’t censor me for needing a bit of help. But tell you what – if you think you can do better, by all means,” he says with poorly hidden sarcasm. “I’ll give you… twenty four hours to get Azurill to lose its fear of water. See that half-sunken cruise ship in the distance? It’s been there for over ten years, nobody bothered removing the wreckage... If you can get Azurill over there and bring something back as proof, I’ll acknowledge the error of my ways. Well… I’ll meet you here tomorrow at this hour, smartass. Cheers!”<br />
<br />
In the blink of an eye, Sean has left, and you’re left alone with a very scared Azurill who can’t even stare at you properly without trembling in fear. So… now what?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>myahoo</b>: Somehow, lost in your thoughts of failure and future, you’ve wound up in a… pretty shady part of New Fizz, to say the least. This neighbourhood doesn’t seem like the kind of place that would have a library, and the few people you walk by don’t really look like the kind of people you’d <i>ask</i> about a library either. So with that, you do the only non-suspicious thing you can do, which is keep walking like you’re exactly where you intend to be.<br />
<br />
<br />
The air is heavy with a mixture of familiar and foreign scents: alcohol, tobacco smoke, and definitely some other substances you can’t identify. Small buildings with bright neon signs above the doors might seem appealing to a different kind of crowd, but you instinctively want to stay as far away from them as possible. The fact that those neon lamps are the only thing providing lighting to the Nightlife Row only serves to make everything more uncomfortable, and you find yourself wishing you’d postponed this walk until morning.<br />
<br />
“Hey kid,” a voice calls out. To you, of course, as much as you’d like to pretend it was addressing someone else. “Yeah, you. Come over here. Say, you look like a kid with a sound head on your shoulders; more than I can say for the drunken pieces of crap around here…”<br />
<br />
You turn to see a man in his thirties, dressed in a brown trench coat that covers most of his body; he has black hair and thin frame glasses, and the only way he could look any more suspicious was if he was wearing a fedora. And yet, for some reason, you keep listening.<br />
<br />
“Know anything about Pokemon? Most kids your age do. I could use a little help, you see,” he continues. His voice is calm and strangely melodious, despite his appearance. “I run a… business nearby. A business that requires healthy Pokemon. Unfortunately, a lot of them have been turning up injured, and I could use someone willing to nurse them back to health. And before you ask, no, a Pokemon Center is not really an option.”<br />
<br />
He holds out his hand for what you assume is a handshake, but you soon realize he’s actually handing you a small pouch of <b>1x Stardust (worth $1000)</b>.<br />
<br />
“Well? Whaddya say?...”</span></div>

&quot;Hey kid.&quot;<br />

&quot;Yeah, you. Come over here.&quot;<br />

Shady Guy held out a hand, with something--probably money--tucked into his palm. &quot;Well? Whaddya say?&quot;<br />

Aiden tucked his hands back into his pockets and tried to listen for anyone approaching him from behind. &quot;I know...some things about Pokémon,&quot; he admitted cautiously.

<span style="color: gray"><b><span style="color: gray">Biggggg5</span></b><span style="color: gray">: </span>The lifeguard’s eyebrow rises while he hears you berate him for his antics. Arms crossed, head tilted slightly, his posture is anything but friendly, but when you’re done, his reply comes as somewhat surprising.<br />
<br />
“<i>My</i> Pokemon? That Azurill isn’t <i>my</i> Pokemon. It’s just a stray,” he clarifies, visibly annoyed by your intromission. “I found it a couple of weeks ago, probably broke off from its pack by mistake. I took it in and have been trying to turn it into a proper lifeguard, but lo and behold, it’s afraid of the damn water.”<br />
<br />
The lifeguard walks closer to the edge of the water and looks to the distance, then turns back to you with a faint grin.<br />
<br />
“Not that you asked, but my name’s Sean. I’m the only lifeguard in this entire beach, so don’t censor me for needing a bit of help. But tell you what – if you think you can do better, by all means,” he says with poorly hidden sarcasm. “I’ll give you… twenty four hours to get Azurill to lose its fear of water. See that half-sunken cruise ship in the distance? It’s been there for over ten years, nobody bothered removing the wreckage... If you can get Azurill over there and bring something back as proof, I’ll acknowledge the error of my ways. Well… I’ll meet you here tomorrow at this hour, smartass. Cheers!”<br />
<br />
In the blink of an eye, Sean has left, and you’re left alone with a very scared Azurill who can’t even stare at you properly without trembling in fear. So… now what?</span>

<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: #808080">Big pants some after finishing his rant, and as he braces himself to be yelled back at he finds the lifeguard, while undertandably miffed, much less yelly than he anticipated. <i>It's not even his pokemon? That just makes it worse! And maybe a little crazy, who tries to tell wild pokemon to do things?</i> As the lifeguard finishes talking and issues his challenge Big responds in kind. &quot;Fine <i>Sean</i>! We will, just to prove you wrong!&quot; He says with confidance. As the lifegraurd turns away Big sticks out his tongue and does the eyelid-pull taunt to the much more physically fit lifeguard that could very possibly beat him up if he caught Big doing this. After Sean was long gone Big turns down to look at the little Azurill. He pulls out his pokedex to double check some facts, about it. &quot;Hmm, like i thought, while Marill's pokedex entires specifically call attention to the tail being able to float, none of Azurill's do, focusing on it being rubbery and full of nutrients, that must be why it isn't as confident in the water along with it not having the water type yet.&quot; He says muttering to himself quietly but loud enough Geddy is still able to hear him. &quot;Any ideas then?&quot; The electric type asks. &quot;Hmm maybe one, Elsa big sisterly nature may be good to help encourage it, along with bissibly making some icy platforms to help us along. He takes out the Premier Ball that holds his ice pokemon and lets the Swinub out. After a quick explanation to the Ice pokemon her usual uneasiness is quickly conqured by her wanting to help the tyke. &quot;Hey little guy,&quot; she says softly as she catiously approaches. &quot;We are hear to help you learn to not be afraid.&quot; Big continues and undresses to his swim trunks. He wades a few feet into the water and turns back. &quot;Ok Elsa, now try to encourage it to see if it can just make it out to me to start with.&quot;</span></div>

The man looks at you with the annoyed stare of someone who likes doesn’t appreciate getting another question for an answer, but after a moment of uncomfortable silence, he finally replies.<br />
<br />
“… if all I needed were Potions, I’d go and buy them myself. The injuries I want taken care of are more… severe than something an over-the-counter prescription can solve,” he says in a low voice. “Besides, someone would take notice if I kept ordering Pokemon medication the conventional way.”<br />
<br />
He stops, retrieves a small brown fedora from the confines of his trench coat – because of course he does – and puts it on, preparing to leave.<br />
<br />
“If you want a little extra something for your efforts, fixing the <i>cause</i> of these repeated injuries would be appreciated,” he concludes. “I pay handsomely for a job well done. <b>Black Velvet Bar</b>, ask the nice lady at the counter for a <i>Bloody Marill</i> if you’re interested. But listen: once you’re in, you’re in for good.”<br />
<br />
With that, the nameless businessman walks away, almost disappearing from sight before entering one of the clubs on the left side of the street. It’s not like you’re alone in the street, but for some reason, nobody pays the shadily-dressed man any mind at all – probably because everyone has their own agenda in this dark, vice-ridden alley. And it seems as if you’ve just been roped into some pretty shady business of your own… If you choose to take the bait, anyway.<br />
<br />
You can feel the weight of the Stardust pouch in your pocket… Where do you go from here?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Biggggg5</b>:<br />
Determined to see this through, if only to prove Sean wrong, you call on Elsa to aid you in the endeavour.<br />
<br />
The sea ahead is vast, but the goal set by Sean doesn’t seem that impossibly far away: you can easily spot the wreckage from where you stand, a massive cruise ship snapped in half and partially devoured by the ocean, likely having sailed too close to shore and crashed into the rocky seafloor. However, for any creature afraid of water, <i>any</i> distance is insurmountable. That’s what you’re dead-set on changing!<br />
<br />
You get into the water, only a short distance away from the beach, and try to urge Azurill to do the same. You try to sound as gentle as possible, but even then, the blue critter won’t budge. It looks at the sea positively terrified, then shifts its gaze to you, envious of the fact that you can walk inside water like Sean, whereas its only hope is to stay afloat. No thank you.<br />
<br />
Quickly realizing that Azurill won’t follow you just like that, your Swinub acts accordingly: Else inhales deeply, then breathes out a flurry of Powder Snow that creates a small ice platform just above the water. The piglet encourages Azurill to step forward which, after a long moment of hesitation… it does!<br />
<br />
Filled with determination (knowing it won’t have to actually get in the water this way, which kind of defeats the point…) the blue Pokemon bounces as high as it can using its tail, and lands perfectly on the frozen floor of the platform…. But then starts sliding along it, out of control, before falling off the edge and straight into the water, right next to you!<br />
<br />
Azurill flails about powerlessly, dominated by panic, unable to do anything, and slowly starts to sink. The water is still shallow where you stand, but as you watch the scene unfold right in front of you, you can’t help but wonder…<br />
<br />
Should you intervene and pull Azurill out of the water, or wait and see if it can manage on its own?</span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: #808080">Big wades out into the water just a bit and nods over to Elsa on the shore. She nods back and with her powder snow creates a smallish, but still large enough ice platfrom for Azurill to be comfortable. &quot;Go on little one, that should keep you nice and dry and let you get used to being surrounded with the water.&quot; The swinub encourages softly. However the azurill launches itself onto the ice. &quot;Wait don't bou-&quot; Geddy shouts from Big's shoulder where the electric pokemon is hovering just as the small blue pokemon takes off. Azurill, however, lands fairly safely in the center of the ice platform and there is a sigh of relief, prematurely as Azurill slides off into the water next to Big and begins to panicand sink, seemingly depite its supposedly bouyent tail ball. Big considers for a split second, <i>There's a couple ideas here, I could just let it go and figure it out, I know a few friends who learned to swim by being tossed into the deep end, and a pokemon should have even better instincts about it.</i> He then sighs and begins to reach down for it. <i>I want it to trust me too though, especially if I want to even consider asking it to fight for me down the road.</i> He reaches under the flailing tiny pokemon and lifts his hands to make another platfrom. He doesn't lift Azurill completely out of the water but just enough so that it wont panic, but still leaving it's feet in the water. &quot;See, I got you, the water won't hurt you while I'm watching. Heck, I bet one day you'll be the one telling the water what to do.&quot; He tries to reassure the small pokemon that will one day become a water pokemon.</span></div>

<span style="color: #808080">You contemplate the scenario for a bit, pondering on what to do. While Azurill can’t sink completely, on account of its tail, only its buoy remains visible, with the rest of its body completely underwater…<br />
<br />
Tough love is always a viable teaching strategy, the kind of Spartan training that has bred some of the greatest warriors in history. However, tossing a relative newborn into the deep end watching it figure everything out on its own also takes a particularly hardened heart, and you can’t bring yourself to fully commit to that approach…<br />
<br />
Opting instead to help Azurill to gain its trust, you pull it partially out of the water, much to its relief, and create a makeshift platform of your own with your hands to support it. The small critter takes a while to regain its bearings, breathing rapidly out of fear before slowly settling down. Then, looking around, you can tell it remains apprehensive of its surroundings, but after a while its eyes fall on its own tail. Azurill looks at it for a long while, and then, as if a metaphorical lightbulb just went off, it lets out an excited cry – it seems it has <i>just</i> realized the whole purpose behind the buoy attached to its own body!<br />
<br />

The man looks at you with the annoyed stare of someone who likes doesn’t appreciate getting another question for an answer, but after a moment of uncomfortable silence, he finally replies.<br />
<br />
“… if all I needed were Potions, I’d go and buy them myself. The injuries I want taken care of are more… severe than something an over-the-counter prescription can solve,” he says in a low voice. “Besides, someone would take notice if I kept ordering Pokemon medication the conventional way.”<br />
<br />
He stops, retrieves a small brown fedora from the confines of his trench coat – because of course he does – and puts it on, preparing to leave.<br />
<br />
“If you want a little extra something for your efforts, fixing the <i>cause</i> of these repeated injuries would be appreciated,” he concludes. “I pay handsomely for a job well done. <b>Black Velvet Bar</b>, ask the nice lady at the counter for a <i>Bloody Marill</i> if you’re interested. But listen: once you’re in, you’re in for good.”<br />
<br />
With that, the nameless businessman walks away, almost disappearing from sight before entering one of the clubs on the left side of the street. It’s not like you’re alone in the street, but for some reason, nobody pays the shadily-dressed man any mind at all – probably because everyone has their own agenda in this dark, vice-ridden alley. And it seems as if you’ve just been roped into some pretty shady business of your own… If you choose to take the bait, anyway.<br />
<br />
You can feel the weight of the Stardust pouch in your pocket… Where do you go from here?</span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: gray">Aiden determinedly held the guy's stare, trying to look casual as he waited for a response.<br />
<br />
&quot;...if all I needed were Potions, I'd go and buy them myself,&quot; Shady Guy ended up saying. &quot;The injuries I want taken care of are more...severe than something an over-the-counter prescription can solve. Besides, someone would take notice if I kept ordering Pokémon medication the conventional way.&quot;<br />
<br />
...that...didn't...sound like the guy was super deep into shady things? Aiden would've assumed the guy'd have his own supplier if medicine was something he needed in unusually large numbers. <i>And</i> underlings or at least a method of avoiding suspicion if he needed to buy them 'conventionally.'<br />
<br />
Shady Guy pulled out a fedora and set it on his head. &quot;If you want a little extra something for your efforts, fixing the cause of these repeated injuries would be appreciated,&quot; he said. &quot;I pay handsomely for a job well done. Black Velvet Bar. Ask the nice lady at the counter for a Bloody Marill if you're interested. But listen: once you're in, you're in for good.&quot;<br />
<br />
That said, Shady Guy walked away and entered one of the bars on the left. Aiden glanced around. It didn't really <i>look</i> like anyone had paid them much mind, but you never knew. Aiden started walking again, turning the proposal(s?) over in his head. Nurse some Pokémon back to full health in exchange for...huh, the guy hadn't actually said. Well, he <i>definitely</i> wasn't doing <i>that</i> then. The other offer was to get to the source of the injuries and stop the injuries from happening in exchange for some questionable reward. Because that was <i>so</i> confidence-inducing.<br />
<br />
Aiden rolled his eyes to himself, but morbidly decided to wander towards the Black Velvet Bar anyway. For information-gathering purposes. Mostly because he was, admittedly, curious as to what the Shady Guy was up to with respect to the Pokémon and why they were getting injured. He was <i>definitely</i> not ordering the Bloody Marill, though. He hadn't even taken the guy's <i>hand</i>, no <i>way</i> was he getting solidly involved.</span></span></div>

<span style="color: #808080">You contemplate the scenario for a bit, pondering on what to do. While Azurill can’t sink completely, on account of its tail, only its buoy remains visible, with the rest of its body completely underwater…<br />
<br />
Tough love is always a viable teaching strategy, the kind of Spartan training that has bred some of the greatest warriors in history. However, tossing a relative newborn into the deep end watching it figure everything out on its own also takes a particularly hardened heart, and you can’t bring yourself to fully commit to that approach…<br />
<br />
Opting instead to help Azurill to gain its trust, you pull it partially out of the water, much to its relief, and create a makeshift platform of your own with your hands to support it. The small critter takes a while to regain its bearings, breathing rapidly out of fear before slowly settling down. Then, looking around, you can tell it remains apprehensive of its surroundings, but after a while its eyes fall on its own tail. Azurill looks at it for a long while, and then, as if a metaphorical lightbulb just went off, it lets out an excited cry – it seems it has <i>just</i> realized the whole purpose behind the buoy attached to its own body!<br />
<br />
With renewed confidence, it leaps from your hands to the top of the buoy tail, where it lands safely and remains afloat. It looks at you with a large grin, thankful for your help and determined to show Sean it <i>can</i> not only lose its fear of water, but actually learn how to swim!<br />
<br />
You remember Sean’s challenge – to reach the sunken ship up ahead, retrieve an item from inside and make it back – and look at Azurill, wondering if it can make it all the way, despite seeming more comfortable in the water now. The critter seems to be at a bit of a loss too – it can remain afloat, but how is it supposed to <i>move</i> across the water?<br />
<br />
While the first obstacle seems to have been overcome, now comes the challenge of traversing the sea towards the ship’s broken husk – while it’s a relatively small distance away from shore, Azurill can’t be expected to make the distance all on its own.<br />
<br />
Well… any ideas?</span>

<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: #808080">Big slightly regrets his posture as he remains hunched over the small blue pokemon as it gets used to the water. His back and legs start to ache as the flailing slowly stops and the Azurill finally calms down and realizes that the water isn't going to hurt it. It also apparently comes to the conclusion of what evolution granted its species the tail for and finds that the tail does in fact float and hops onto it. With the azurill safe enough on its tail Big straightens back up and cracks his back and neck from sitting in the position for so long. After recovering he grins down at Azurill. &quot;See! I told you you could do it.&quot; He grins. However he immedietly notices that despite now being able to float, it lacks the means to use it to travel. &quot;Hmm, you won't get too far just by doing that though. And it doesn't look like your legs are long enough to paddle from up on your tail.&quot; He thinks for a second. &quot;Well, I bet eventually you can learn to wade and swim using your legs along with your tail. I bet that's what most azurill do, but I don't know if we have time for you to learn and build the muscle for that in a day. But here's an idea.&quot; He nods. &quot;All azurill, even newborns have a few moves like water gun and bubble. Maybe you can use those to propel yourself.&quot; He remembers a moment in a recent video game he recently played that inspired the idea. &quot;First you'll have to know where you are going first because you'll be facing backwards. And you will have to learn your balance with bubble being for slower and water gun being for faster, but I will be here to help if you fall off your tail.&quot; He offers reassuringly.</span></div>

<div style="margin-left: 20px"><span style="color: gray">Tempted as you are, your goal comes first. You worry you might be missing an opportunity, worse-case scenarios flitting through your mind. You force yourself not to worry too much though; it just means you need to move quicker! Perhaps not too quickly though, after a near stumble almost sends your Togepi sunny-side up. You slow your pace to a brisk walk across the grass, but it seems luck is not on your side today. As you almost reach the pond, a tug on your ankle is the only warning you have before you tip forward, the grassy ground nearing all too quickly. With the thought of Meringue almost coming to harm still on your mind, you twist your torso about, trying to keep him from becoming scrambled. The impact of your back against the ground knocks the wind from you, and only seconds after you feel the back of your head make an impact of its own. Everything goes dark.<br />
<span style="color: gray"><br />
Through the haze of unconsciousness, you feel a prod on your face. First one cheek, then the other, and then finally your nose as hearing returns to you. The chittering of your Togepi enters your ears, and its odd, you think; there seems to be a strain to the normally serene Meringue’s voice. Slowly, you blink open your eyes to a pink sky, and almost immediately close them again with a groan as you finally feel the dull throbbing of your head. It hurts, to be sure, though thankfully there was enough spongey grass to cushion you from any lasting harm. <br />
<br />
Reaching a hand up to rub at the area, you re-open your eyes, again seeing the pink tinge to the sky, as if the sun was beginning to set. It takes you a moment to realize why that seems weird: during the last moments you remember the sky was a bright, midday blue. Had… Had you really been out that long?<br />
<br />
Before you can follow that train of thought for too long, Meringue gives another prod to your face, harder this time. You give a questioning glance down your chest at him, only to receive an immediate answer in the form of hot, humid breath fanning across your face.<br />
<br />
You slowly tilt your head back, pain forgotten. Pink fills your vision, brighter and closer than the that of the sky, along with one tan, rounded muzzle. Leisurely, the mouth opens, letting out another exhale of fishy breath with an accompanying “Sllllloooooowwwwww…”<br />
<br />
On the bright side, that answers one question. You were at least out long enough for a

<div style="margin-left: 20px"><span style="color: gray">As you answer his question, describing the circumstances that led to your new acquaintances, Hank’s expression darkens, and he lets out a sigh. “That’s what I was afraid was the case,” he mumbles under his breath. Still, when you continue on and offer your help, a shadow of a smile returns to his face. “Why, that is mighty kind of you, miss. Both in your offer and in protecting that little gal.” He nods to the Corsola, who shrinks back just a tad. “Yes, though, you could say that there’s something the matter. The problem is I don’t know what yet.”<br />
<span style="color: gray"><br />
Hank raises a hand, pointing out beyond the coast, where through the foaming tide you can see the colorful outlines of a coral reef. “Y’see, we’ve got a pretty sizable population of Corsola out there on the reef. Depending on who you ask either their ancestors of ages past made the reef or the reef lured them to live here, but the important thing is they have come to live here. And, unsurprisingly, so has a group of Mareanie. For as long as I’ve been here, the two species have never exactly gotten along easily,” he grimaces, “but recently it’s been something else. The Mareanie have become overly aggressive, and not just to their normal prey – they’ve gotten so bad I’ve been getting reports of them even attacking harbor-bound vessels. That’s why I’m out here, I’m taking a ship out to see if I can get to the bottom of this.”<br />
<br />
Eyeing you, he rubs his chin thoughtfully, but quickly nods, coming to some decision. “I’ve always thought battle was the best way to glean someone’s character. If you’re offering, my ship has enough room for one more. As I said though, I do need to stop and see my brother before I head out. Meet me just inside the Fish Hut in say, ten minutes or so and I could lead you to where I’m docked. In the meantime,” he finishes with a little smirk and glance down to your feet, “if there’s anything you’d need to take care of, feel free.” Still grinning, Hank tips his hat slightly with a nod before turning and striding away towards the hut in the distance.<br />
<br />
Instinctively looking to where Hank’s gaze had been, you see the Corsola having apparently grown a shy streak now that all the adrenaline has worn off. The Coral Pokémon looks down to the sand awkwardly, unsure of what exactly to do now that she’s not in danger. She glances up once to your hand where the Heal Ball had been, hurriedly turning her eyes back to the sand with a squeak when she sees you watching.<br />
<br />
Hank did say you had a few minutes before heading out. Would you like to do something?<br />
<br />

<span style="color: #808080">To say that the atmosphere in this neighbourhood is unsettling is an understatement. There is a dizzying mixture of scents in the air, alcohol and tobacco and Arceus knows what else; definitely not the kind of place you’re used to or make a point of revisiting in the future… but still, something keeps you going. Is it a morbid curiosity to see how deep the rabbit hole goes, a latent lust for rewards, or simply kind-hearted concern over the idea of injured Pokemon?...<br />
<br />
Finding Black Velvet Bar proved easy – all you had to do was follow the man. Now, standing in front of the door, you have to wonder what makes this particular joint so special. It’s one of the smaller, less crowded bars in the street; the neon sign above it has seen better days, with many of the red lamps that shape the letters flickering repeatedly, on the verge of going out completely; even the bouncer at the door lacks that all-important air of intimidation, standing about as tall as you but considerably skinnier, with a scrawny unkempt beard that looks more pathetic than imposing.<br />
<br />
“Hey, if you’re just gonna stare, f*** off,” he suddenly barks. Despite not looking the part, he does have a sharp tongue.<br />
<br />
Someone suddenly walks up behind you, bumping into you as if you’re not even there, and keeps walking straight towards the entrance. The customer shares a few whispered words and a laugh with the foul-mouthed bouncer, places a handful of coins in the man’s hand and goes through the door into the Bar. The bouncer stares greedily at the money, stuffs it away in his back pocket and suddenly notices you’re still looking.<br />
<br />
“Hey moth**f***er, the f*** you still doing there? If you ain’t here to drink or do business, scram!!”<br />
<br />
Quite the departure from the man you met before – he might’ve been shady, yes, but he had some manners. Do you still want to go through with this?...</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgb(128, 128, 128)"><br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Biggggg5</b>:</span><br />
<span style="color: #808080">As it turns out, there <i>is</i> a way of getting Azurill to move! The newborn takes a while to comprehend your plan, but once it tries out a Water Gun, it screams in excitement to find itself moving across the sea on its bubbly tail! Overwhelmed with happiness, it keeps blowing out water, causing it to gain much more speed than you would’ve liked, forcing you to give chase swimming. And after a while, the two of you are traversing the water side-by-side with little difficulty, much to Azurill’s delight. Great planning!<br />
<br />
The journey towards the sunken ship isn’t terribly long, but ends up taking a lot more out of you than it does Azurill (who, despite its fears, is much more conditioned for water travel than any human). Midway, you run into other swimmers and surfers, and can’t help but overhear their conversations.<br />
<br />
“Hey, look at that one!”<br />
<br />
“He’s not seriously going to?...”<br />
<br />
“Guy’s crazy! Did nobody tell him that ship’s cursed?!”<br />
<br />
“Daaamn dude, you got some Ultra Balls, that’s for sure!”<br />
<br />
Deciding to pay them no mind – you <i>do</i> have a point to prove to that lifeguard, after all – the two of you keep going, determined to reach the broken hull of the cruise ship. Schools of Finneon swim merrily below you, while flocks of Wingull fly overhead; and after a bit longer of strenuous swimming (and effortless Water Gun-blowing), you finally arrive at your destination.<br />
<br />
Up ahead is the rusty, half-sunken husk of the once glorious S.S. Fortune, as you can tell by the engraving on the hull that is yet to fade away completely. In its heyday, the ship must have been a wondrous sight to behold, designed and painted to resemble a Wailord in every aspect. Now, it is no more than a heap of rusted iron sticking out like a sore thumb in the otherwise idyllic scenario of Bubbling Beach. And nobody is even sure why the S.S. Fortune sank to begin with…<br />
<br />
Finding a way inside the actual vessel doesn’t prove too hard – there is a massive breach right in the middle of the ship, likely where it snapped in half; the front of the ship has since stuck out of the water like an iron tower, while the back half rests mostly in the depths of the ocean. Swimming through that gap towards the interior of the cruise ship is relatively easy, but for some reason, it seems nobody else – not even kids, who love to explore this kind of mysterious places – has ventured this far. Why is that?...<br />
<br />
Once you make your way inside and climb out of the water onto solid ground, you find yourself in what must’ve been the ship’s grand hall. Broken glass chandeliers hang from the mouldy ceiling, half-crumbled wooden tables and chairs are scattered all over the place, a once-priceless piano missing two legs rests against the wall it must’ve crashed when the hull cracked… This was no doubt where guests gathered to eat and socialize during the evenings.<br />
<br />
You exchange a glance with Azurill, and find all trace of its previous excitement gone, replaced by a look of concern and apprehension. And now that you think about it, something has been bothering you too since you got out of the water – not just the sight of devastation before you, but something more. As if an ominous, lingering presence rests in the halls of this ship, staring at you from the shadows…<br />
<br />
Trying to push these thoughts aside, you focus on your goal – retrieve something from the ship to prove to Sean that you made it here. A wooden fragment from one these tables is hardly convincing proof, you reason, meaning you must find something which undeniably belonged to the S.S. Fortune and which <i>hasn’t</i> been destroyed by water or the passing of time. Not an easy task…<br />
<br />
Your eyes catch sight of what appears to have been a plant of the ship on a nearby wall, but saltwater has ruined most of it. All you can make out is that you are right in the middle of the ship; the engine room, kitchen, workers’ quarters and other “utility” divisions are located in the front of the ship (the one sticking mostly out of the water), while the Captain’s Cabin, guests’ rooms, casino and other entertainment areas are in the back of the ship, the one left mostly underwater after the disaster.<br />
<br />
Azurill presses itself against your leg, scared and on the verge of crying. Still, for better or worse, <b>you are now accompanied by a Level 14 Male Azurill with EM Camouflage</b>…<br />
<br />
Well, what will you do next?<br />

<div style="margin-left: 20px"><span style="color: gray">As you answer his question, describing the circumstances that led to your new acquaintances, Hank’s expression darkens, and he lets out a sigh. “That’s what I was afraid was the case,” he mumbles under his breath. Still, when you continue on and offer your help, a shadow of a smile returns to his face. “Why, that is mighty kind of you, miss. Both in your offer and in protecting that little gal.” He nods to the Corsola, who shrinks back just a tad. “Yes, though, you could say that there’s something the matter. The problem is I don’t know what yet.”<br />
<span style="color: gray"><br />
Hank raises a hand, pointing out beyond the coast, where through the foaming tide you can see the colorful outlines of a coral reef. “Y’see, we’ve got a pretty sizable population of Corsola out there on the reef. Depending on who you ask either their ancestors of ages past made the reef or the reef lured them to live here, but the important thing is they have come to live here. And, unsurprisingly, so has a group of Mareanie. For as long as I’ve been here, the two species have never exactly gotten along easily,” he grimaces, “but recently it’s been something else. The Mareanie have become overly aggressive, and not just to their normal prey – they’ve gotten so bad I’ve been getting reports of them even attacking harbor-bound vessels. That’s why I’m out here, I’m taking a ship out to see if I can get to the bottom of this.”<br />
<br />
Eyeing you, he rubs his chin thoughtfully, but quickly nods, coming to some decision. “I’ve always thought battle was the best way to glean someone’s character. If you’re offering, my ship has enough room for one more. As I said though, I do need to stop and see my brother before I head out. Meet me just inside the Fish Hut in say, ten minutes or so and I could lead you to where I’m docked. In the meantime,” he finishes with a little smirk and glance down to your feet, “if there’s anything you’d need to take care of, feel free.” Still grinning, Hank tips his hat slightly with a nod before turning and striding away towards the hut in the distance.<br />
<br />
Instinctively looking to where Hank’s gaze had been, you see the Corsola having apparently grown a shy streak now that all the adrenaline has worn off. The Coral Pokémon looks down to the sand awkwardly, unsure of what exactly to do now that she’s not in danger. She glances up once to your hand where the Heal Ball had been, hurriedly turning her eyes back to the sand with a squeak when she sees you watching.<br />
<br />
Hank did say you had a few minutes before heading out. Would you like to do something?<br />
<br />

</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: gray"><span style="color: gray">With a sad look in his eyes, Hank explained that indeed, the Corsola was related to his worries: Their population of the reef took a drastic decline as of late, since the Mareanie became aggressive for no apparent reason, ravaging their prey, and even to the point of attacking boats that weren't even in their territory - they were at the harbor! His plan was to go off and find the source of the issue.<br />
<br />
After some thought, the big guy offered Mélina to join him in his investigation - after all, he had room for one extra crew member.<br />
<br />
&quot;O-of course I'll be glad to join you!&quot; the trainer chipped in. &quot;I mean, I did offer my help earlier, especially if it meant helping Corsola, so it would be kinda silly of me to say no at this point!&quot;<br />
<br />
After Hank gave her a small rendez-vous at the fishing hut and left to do business with his brother, Mélina looked down at the present coral Pokémon at her feet. Seemed like all the excitement and fear died down from her, and made her twice as shy as she was - even towards Mélina, to whom felt like she was opening up to. The trainer tilted her head, trying to read the pink creature's mannerisms. Although it was just for a fraction of a second, she noticed that she had been looking at her hand - the one that held the Heal Ball - but then quickly and coyly stared at the ground as soon as she noticed the trainer looking at her. Mélina’s eyes widened as she remembered what they were about to do a few minutes ago… and how the situation has changed.<br />
<br />
Her teeth cringed together as she wondered what to do, knowing she had limited time. Should she capture that Corsola or not? Earlier, it was simply a question to keep her safe, away from the Mareanie while it was distracted. But now that the danger was gone, that reason had lost meaning…. Or has it? The real, big danger seem to be still ahead, not only for her, but for colony as a whole. In her state, in the long run, it wouldn’t be safe for her at all to stick around. So it was no wonder that the one-branch Corsola still wanted to stick around. And in all honesty, despite the adrenaline of the emergency situation wearing off, Mélina still felt attachment to her, and didn’t feel on going back on her words.<br />
<br />
“...You still want to join me and my friends, don’t you?” the Kalosian finally spoke, very softly as she bent her knees to be more at her eye level. “I can understand you. You’re still tired of those Mareanie attacking you, scared that they’ll get you for good next time… you just want someone that will let you rest and protect you. Am I right?”<br />
<br />
“Sol..?” the Coral Pokémon shyly turned her attention to the human, although her body still not quite facing her.<br />
<br />
“Still not quite sure, huh?” Mélina gave a worried yet gentle smile. “It must be a big change for you, being with a trainer I mean. Living in the reef where you probably could’ve lived your whole life, but things are pretty bad as it is now… You may not know it, but you make me think of me a lot.”<br />
<br />
“Cor?” she suddenly tilted her body in curiosity, barely able to keep balance.<br />
<br />
“Well, I went through a lot too,” she nervously let out a small small chuckle, “I became a Pokémon trainer recently, to get out of one big rough patch, myself. Definitely different life than what I had. But… I don’t regret it. I feel more comfortable, more free. It wasn’t easy, but I had help from so many friends.” Mélina pulled out her <a href="http://”http://www.serebiiforums.com/showthread.php?39532-Pok%E9mart-Records&amp;p=17622446#post17622446”" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2F%E2%80%9Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.serebiiforums.com%2Fshowthread.php%3F39532-Pok%25E9mart-Records%26p%3D17622446%23post17622446%E2%80%9D&amp;hash=e1cce42abf7ed7043e70502efa3e2df0" rel="nofollow noopener">Heal Ball</a> again, and presented it on her palm, in front of the Corsola. “Would you like to be friends with me? With us?” She flashed a an honest, broad smile. “We can help each other out.”<br />
<br />
The pink Pokémon stared at the Pokéball, just like last time. But this time, she anxiously shook and shivered around, thinking thoroughly about the decision, and meditating on the woman’s words. Then after a few moments, the Corsola closed her eyes, took a deep breath…<br />
<br />
and with a light movement, she pushed the button of the Pokémon receptacle, and it reacted quickly by slipping off Mélina’s hand, swooping down the Corsola in a flash, then dropped on the sandy beach. As the button lit red, the Heal Ball shook once, twice, thrice…<br />
<br />
<i>Click</i><br />
<br />
Mélina’s face beamed and her feet uncontrollably lifted one after another in a little happy dance. It didn’t last long though, as she bent down to pick up the Pokéball and immediately released her new friend right into her arms.<br />
<br />
“Hey, welcome to the team! Hope you like your ball!”<br />
<br />
“Cooooooooorsola~” she cooed, although unsurely as she surely isn’t used to the sudden attention - especially the hug.<br />
<br />
“I guess the next step would be to name you, isn’t it?” Mélina’s grin hinted a bit of embarrassment. “Well... we’ll have plenty of time to think about it together later. Don’t know if you understood the big guy Hank earlier, but we’re going to check what’s going on at your home and sea- er, pun not intended - if we can do something about it. You have seen what’s going on there already firsthand, so maybe you can help us?”<br />
<br />
“Cooooor...” the Pokémon shivered in fear, not wanting to meet up with Mareanie again.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, we’ll make sure you’ll be safe and sound during the whole trip. Just point things out when you notice something that we might need to know. But for now, we have to meet up with the guy, and fast!”<br />
<br />
With her newfound Pokémon in her hands, Mélina made a mad dash (well, as much of a “dash” her out-of-shape body can muster) to Hank’s brother’s fishing hut, hoping she didn’t take too much time and he wasn’t waiting for her too much. If not, maybe she could check out inside that “fishy” cabin, just out of curiosity...</span></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px">OOC: I hope I haven't overstepped on things in terms of the capture; I know usually you gotta wait for the updater's confirmation but I assumed that what you said was a confirmation of sorts to at least give me the freedom how the capture happens... if there's a problem, please tell me and I'll correct it!</span></div>
