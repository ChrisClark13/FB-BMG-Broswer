Chespin vaguely reminds me of Nuzleaf, which is Grass and Dark, and from what I've heard, Fennekin could potentially be part Psychic. So if that's true, then a match between the two could go either way.&quot; As Coselle called him strange, far from being offended, Keith chuckled. &quot;It's been said,&quot; he replied simply as their drinks arrived. Coselle handed Keith his drink, which lasted all of three seconds before the Poison-type trainer casually drained his glass in one go. Keith then noticed Coselle casually dangling the Rawst Berry that came with her shake over Keith's mouth. Moving his head slightly, Keith took the berry between his teeth and ate it as Coselle remarked on how Marion liked Froakie, and believed that it would evolve into a scholarly Pokemon.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm guessing you don't think so,&quot; Keith remarked as Coselle gave a short laugh following that statement. &quot;What do you think Froakie will be like when it's fully evolved, then? I can picture Chespin looking kinda like this Sandslash/Sceptile combination sort of thing. And Fennekin, I can easily imagine it looking something like Ninetales when fully evolved,&quot; he added, thinking to himself that had he never heard of or seen a Vulpix, he would think Fennekin was supposed to evolve into Ninetales.</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px">Marion couldn't help feeling concern for Duke's Seviper as he mentioned her odd behavioral change. Normally, mellowing out would be considered a good thing, but this sudden change on a Pokémon that was once so fiery seemed so strange, that one couldn't help but wonder if something is amiss. &quot;The frustrating thing is that I honestly don't have a clue. Physically, she's as healthy as she can be; very much in her prime. I think it started shortly after Seath was brought home. I feel her a bit distant and lost in thought now, and though I have a gut feeling of what it could be, I'm not quite sure what i can do about it. But I'll figure something out.&quot; He said, before moving on to talk a bit more about his Larvesta since Marion had asked about his name. <br />
<br />
&quot;His name? That would be Solaire. Fitting, isn't it? Quite a personality too. You could say he brings a bit more light to the whole squad. A bit quirky too. I've always found it curious how he stares at the rising sun every single morning, raising his little forelegs as if wanting to hug it. Simply adorable. His body's too hot to the touch though, it's almost like touching fire. I feel he's just too young to control it yet. I'm taking special precautions around him lest he ends up burning my entire base. To be honest, I'm a bit unsure about how to raise such a rare Pokémon. Not so much as with Kerrigan, with whom I'm literally completely in the blind, but the info out there is still kinda limited, and the rules of raising dragons don't quite apply to him. I only hope I don't make too many mistakes, but hey, you did awesome with August, so I guess this can't turn out so bad for me too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Back to the conversation regarding Durandal and August, Balmund had offered her to take custody of the little Dratini, though she surprisingly rejected the offer. Though she knew from first hand experience just how much August needed to really meet her soon, she also admitted that Seath also needed his Father, and a good environment in which to grow in. It seemed so unfair that they couldn't raise them together. &quot;Well goodness girl, at this rate I'll be forced to move in to your place in order to settle this issue once and for all. I would be okay with that.&quot; He laughed trying to lighten the mood, though a big part of him honestly meant what he said, and he made no effort to deny it. &quot;Well how about this? There's a a Pokémon only Tree Grove around these parts, and I'd say Durandal, August and Seath deserve a family vacation together, just the three of them, until their heart's content. Hm?&quot;</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><b>Keith, Coselle, Okiku, Blaze, Cele, Hyrem, Connor, Alice</b>: ((I'll wait for the others to respond for now.))<br />
<br />
<b>Marion, Duke</b>: Marion nods knowingly the moment Duke mentions that Orchrist's odd behavior began when Seath was brought home. &quot;She is in her prime, yes... I imagine this would be around the time that she would be looking for a mate and having babies of her own if she were in the wild, correct?&quot; The ghostly trainer pauses. &quot;Y'know, now that I think about it... August was acting similarly before she met Duran. She's always been calm, so the change was a bit more subtle, but it was definitely there. It was... a sort of quiet longing. I never really knew what to do about it at the time, but looking back on it, I think that may have been the explanation.&quot; Marion smirks playfully. &quot;Hey, Duke... between you and me, d'you think Sothe is ready to be a dad yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marion is fascinated by the description of Solaire, Duke's brand new Larvesta. &quot;That does sound adorable... Almost like he sees the sun as a parent or something. Very sweet.&quot; Duke then describes how he is taking special care around this baby so as to prevent fires from breaking out in his base, and with such scarce information out on this rare Pokemon, it has been difficult at times to figure out what was best for the fiery bug-type. Marion blushes a bit at his praise for her training of Dragonite, giggling a bit. &quot;Thanks... Well, I'm no expert in any type other than ghost. Even so, I do have some experience with fire types. I found Aislyn in the wild, so she already had some control over her internal body temperature when I found her, but Gwyn was another story. He has a constant flame going as part of his anatomy, so one always has to be careful when giving him hugs. I had to teach him early to mind his flame, since if he accidentally scraped something with it, it could easily start a fire. He can control the flame better now than when he was younger, but perhaps if he met Solaire, he might be able to help him learn how to regulate his internal fires. If nothing else, the two might get along.&quot; Marion laughs a bit. &quot;Of course, I really can't take much credit for his internal control; it was something he learned largely on his own with time. The same may be true for Solaire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All of our Pokemon under one roof... It'd be hectic and crazy for sure, but also a lot of fun... Personally, I like the idea, too.&quot; Marion grins at the thought. &quot;That said... I would want to talk about it with my Pokemon first before even considering such a big move. It's their home too, after all.&quot; Duke then suggests that if Marion will not take Seath, that August come to the Tree Grove and reunite with Durandal and Seath there. Marion's eyes light up at the idea, and she claps her hands together, grinning widely. &quot;That's a perfect idea! The Tree Grove is a beautiful area, and I'm certain that August would love it there... Of course, she'd go to the damn Toxic Marsh if it meant seeing her baby.&quot; Marion smiles. &quot;I can send her over there first thing tomorrow morning, if you'd like. Oh, she'll be so happy!! Do you think I should surprise her?&quot; Marion nearly bearhugs Duke in her excitement, though being such a petit young woman, the bearhug is more of a Teddiursahug. &quot;This is such a great idea! It means so much to me and August.&quot;</span></div>

She then playfully wonders if Sothe would be ready to be a dad yet, forcing a chuckle out of him. &quot;Sothe doesn't seem to be ready of taking care of even a Skitty, much less fathering a child. He messes around too much. That said, I know they try. They try <b>a lot</b>. It's just nothing ever happens. If I had to put my finger on it, I'd say that's what caused her to grow more bitter and aggressive towards him with each passing month. I have a feeling she blames him for it, though the problem might not be with him alone...&quot;<br />
<br />
Back on the topic of Solaire, Marion shares once having similar issues with her own Litwick, which permanently went on about with a lit candle fire on his head. The fiery Ghost-type had managed to learn ow to control with time, and chances are, all that Solaire needed was a bit of maturity to handle it himself too. That being said, it would be nice if both got to meet each other, and Duke too had the feeling that they might become fast friends. A jovial and rash Larvesta, and a silent Litwick with a knack for shadow mimicry ... it should be an interesting pairing, no doubt. &quot;Yeah, I can see it already. Gwyn and Solaire, sharing their souls with each other as they kindle a bonfire. I'm sure Solaire will learn a lot form him, though who knows, the experience might be mutual~&quot;<br />
<br />
Further down the line of conversation, even if Duke originally meant his comment of moving in as somewhat of a joke for caution's sake, Marion too seems to like the idea, and Duke nods with a curious grin as she remarks commenting it with his Pokémon. Sakura would probably utterly loathe even the thought of sharing the same roof as Chris, but for the most part he could see their entire squads getting along very well. It would be one crazy and fun mix up for sure. She also seems really excited about Duke's idea of having August, Durandal and Seath meet up at the Tree Grove, and he was glad too for he knew how much it meant for them all. She hugs Duke in excitement with a strong teddybear hug, and he holds her likewise, flashing his teeth in a wide smile as they separated. Happiness and excitement was such a contagious thing, and his own mixed with hers produced a grin on his face the likes that are sure to leave permanent marked wrinkles several years down the road. &quot;You're welcome.&quot; He said, before joking a bit more. &quot;Though you know, you sure we gon' manage to even wake up early after tonight? For them, I wouldn't mind a few extra bloated bags below my eye sockets if it means their happiness however. Lets make this a surprise for them, it's gonna really make their day, I bet!&quot;</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px">Marion laughs at Duke's assessment of his Sceptile's capabilities as a father (or lack thereof), and goes on to explain that despite the fact that Sothe and Orchrist were constantly attempting to satiate their carnal appetites, a child had not yet resulted from the union. The frustration from this lack of success seemed to be making Chris more and more irritated toward Sothe, who she blamed for the repeated failures, though Duke suspected that the blame did not lay entirely with Sothe. Marion thinks for a moment before responding; &quot;It may be that they need to be taken to that Breeding Centre where we took August and Duran when they were ready to conceive... Granted, we made that decision on the basis that they needed an indestructible, dragon-proof room for their lovemaking, which only the Centre could provide...&quot; Marion chuckles a bit. &quot;I am told that Pokemon in captivity have difficulty breeding when compared to their wild counterparts. You raised Orchrist from an egg, correct? I mean, the Centre does all sorts of Pokemon fertility treatments, which can be helpful... but, of course, they have massive restrictions on which Pokemon can breed. The attendants have to be certain that the parents are experienced and well-trained enough to have a baby, and I'm sure you remember how intense they were when scrutinizing August and Durandal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm. I bet the two of them could go on grand adventures together, as well...&quot; Marion dreams of Gwyn and Solaire making their way through golden castles, fiery ruins and venomous swamps. Both creatures were vaguely torchlike, which made them perfect companions for exploring. Duke comments that Solaire would have a lot to learn from Gwyn, but that the little Litwick may learn a thing or two from Solaire, as well. &quot;Learning is always a two-way street, isn't it? Solaire may be young, but I imagine Gwyn would have a lot to learn from his point of view.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marion's happiness seems to spread to Duke, who flashes her a smile as they finally separate from their embrace. When Duke mentions waking up early, Marion feigns confusion. &quot;Waking up...? Wait, we're going to sleep tonight? I didn't think that would be a possibility at this point...&quot; Marion smirks with a hint of fire in her gaze; though she was not the type to act overly and heavily seductive, the slight hints and soft implications in her smile and her posture spoke volumes. She chuckles a bit, brushing some stray hair from her face back behind her shoulders. &quot;I don't mind sacrificing my beauty sleep, either. They deserve a nice surprise. August is an early riser, so I know she will be awake and alert, even if I'm dragging myself to the Tree Grove, haha~&quot; Marion realizes at the end of her laugh that her throat is feeling rather dry and scratching; with all the dancing and excitement that had been going on, she hadn't bothered to even think of rehydrating.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say, Duke... Would you like me to get you something to drink from the bar? I have to admit, I'm feeling rather parched...&quot;</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px">&quot;I remember,&quot; Duke said as Marion to the time both August and Durandal had been taken to the Breeding Center. Perhaps she was right, and a visit to the centre could help out with their fertility issues. That said, Sothe has indeed been slacking off lately, almost deliberately. It was almost like he had made up his mind that he wasn't getting any stronger than he already was, and in turn, that indeed made him a poor companion for Chris. Perhaps her frustrations weren't unjustified, though if that was the case, Duke did have to question his own ability to bring out the best on his Sceptile. &quot;Who knows? Maybe a miracle will happen~&quot;<br />
<br />
Marion then later ups Duke's joke about managing to fend off sleep in the morning by feigning ignorance at the idea of even going to sleep in the first place, the look on her eyes and her smile making a slight seductive implication which begged the rhetorical question of 'Why wouldn't you?' A classy form of a nudge, nudge and a wink, wink. Duke chuckles as she does, the mischievous look on his face implying an understanding of the words behind her gestures. She then asks if he would like her to get him a drink, a question which instantly made him aware of his own thirst. <br />
<br />
&quot;Me too. By all means, let me get them for you.&quot; He got up at once. Like calling shotgun, he knew by habit that standing up first meant he got to do the deed. &quot;What would you want me to get for you? A classic Manhattan? Or perhaps a Rusty Nail, which a little birdie once told you love so much? Or perhaps, something completely different?&quot;</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px">&quot;A miracle, huh...&quot; Marion chuckles a bit, though she can sense that behind Duke's joking tone, there was genuine concern over the situation. After all, getting Sothe motivated to train to Lv.100, particularly when the result would be his inevitable fatherhood, was not a likely scenario given what she imagined to be his current state of mind. From Minerva's description of him, Marion pictured Sothe as a quintessential bachelor of sorts; certainly not a bad sort of fellow, but very much in the mindset of a free Sceptile, unburdened by the chains of responsibility. Children would probably look more like shackles than miracles to him, but Marion withheld judgment. For all she knew, there may be a part of Sothe that did want to become a father... Perhaps he would develop those desires with time.<br />
<br />
Duke catches on quickly to the hidden meaning behind her comments, but finds himself recognizing his own thirst when she mentions wanting a drink. Ever the gentlemen, he offers to get them for her instead; Marion smiles at the act of chivalry, immediately thanking the dragon tamer. At the mention of the Rusty Nail, an odd mixture of delight and curiosity sparks in her eyes. &quot;Actually, I would like a Rusty Nail, please... That little birdie of yours is no liar.&quot; Marion is intrigued by the bit of knowledge Duke had about her. It had been such a long time since she had ordered her favorite drink, and her last had been in the Bar, many months ago... She was surprised that Duke would remember that little detail about her, but clearly impressed. &quot;Tell them light on the Drambuie, though... Don't want it too sweet.&quot; Marion smirks. &quot;I like it with a bit of a bite.&quot;</span></div>

He heads for the bar, not too far from Coselle and the rest of the group were at, though in the moment, he wasn't paying direct attention to anyone else around him. He calls out for the bartender before making his order. &quot;A Rusty Nail please. Go light on the Drambuie. I'd also like a Cuba Libre. Make it two parts Rum Añejo, one part Lemon Soda, and one part Coke.&quot; Though Duke loved all kinds of drinks, he had a habit of starting off a night with one (or two!) effervescent Cuba Libres, mixed half and half and paked with that extra bit of punch resulting from aged rum. He remained apparently calm as he waited for his drinks, though the constant tapping of his foot against the floor revealed an eagerness to return as soon as possible.</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px">Balmund gives Marion a smirk of his own, quickly catching on to the double entendre in Marion's drink order and noting both meanings... one for the drink, and one for later. Deciding on a delectable-sounding Cuba Libre for himself, he gives his order to the Bartender, who gives him a knowing glance, looking briefly toward the lavender-haired lady waiting on the couch and back at him; a bit of a nonverbal pat on the back, before immediately starting on the drinks. Though the capable Bartender moves efficiently when mixing the drinks, Duke cannot help but feel impatient, wanting to get back to Marion as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Marion sinks into the couch, taking a deep breath in an attempt to process all that had happened to her in the evening thus far. As she removes a comb from her bag and begins brushing her now messy, static-laden hair back into its tame, stylized former self, the questions, which had been drowned out by the music and heat of the moment, were slowly beginning to resurface. Were she and Duke... <i>dating</i>? Was that even the right term? How would her Pokemon react to such news? Hell, how would <i>Orchrist</i> react? The worst she could expect from her own team was Coselle's constant taunting and teasing, as was her right as Marion's sister... but Orchrist was a different story. Minerva had explained after their evening at Duke's Secret Base that Orchrist referred to her trainer as &quot;Daddy,&quot; which Minerva had, through fits of cackling, labeled as &quot;de-ci-ded-ly Freud-i-an&quot;. Marion thought it oddly sweet, but also knew how utterly livid Orchrist would be upon finding out that she had to share &quot;Daddy's&quot; attention with somebody else... Not good.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, Marion shrugs off these thoughts, deciding to leave them for another time. Why waste the night worrying? Better to live in the moment, to let the morning decide her fate. The night was young, and beautifully enigmatic, concealing the secrets of all who join in her revelry. For now, better to focus on getting her hair back in order, even though she knew, more than likely, the strands would still be flying every which way by the end of the night...</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px">As Duke waited for his drinks to be ready, slight specks of doubt started to dot his mind. He had come to meet someone before, many years ago, not too long before he even started journeying far and wide. Back then, he had thought it to be a perfect match. A golden-haired girl with emerald eyes with whom he could share in literally everything. Ah, but young Chris did not think it so, and so, many &quot;accidents&quot; started happening, brought forth by the Seviper's intense feeling of jealousy. As kind hearted as one person could possibly be, it was just a matter of time before one starts having enough. Arguments started popping up ever more often, and Chris seemed to always be at their core. When the time came, he was forced to choose, and his choice broke his heart. Its been a constant struggle ever since. How far did he intended go on with this? Maybe, this wouldn't be a reenactment if his last failure. He wasn't young and inexperienced anymore. He was a seasoned trainer, and Chris too had matured somewhat over the years. Marion had also experience dealing with otherwise rather uncontrollable Pokémon. Maybe this time, it was really meant to be?<br />
<br />
His line of thought is cutoff as both drinks made it to the table. Duke smiles, sliding his payment across the table and adding a generous tip to the skilled bartender. The man simply responds with a nod, his facial expression in a way nonverbally saying &quot;Go get her already, tiger.&quot; Turning around, he walks back to the couch, handing Marion her drink before taking seat with his own. He looks at her for a solid second before commenting. &quot;You look nice.&quot; Not like she didn't before, far from it, but he recognized the effort she put into grooming herself. He takes a long sip off his drink before moving on. &quot;Say Marion, I'm curious, how's Cosie like? Is she your only sibling? What about your family?&quot; He sought to strike conversation, seeking to know more about her. He knew however that talking about family could be a double-edge sword, and was ready to brush it off at a moment's notice. Family is, after all, a very close and sensitive thing, but he cared to know about hers just as much as he cared about his own. What better moment to bring it up than now, while the alcohol is just starting to run through one's body, loosening up those otherwise impossibly tight emotional locks?</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px">Marion carefully takes her drink, sipping so as to savor the taste while Duke compliments her on her appearance. &quot;Heh, thanks,&quot; she says with a bit of color on her cheeks, blushing at the compliment. &quot;You do, too,&quot; she adds, admiring his black ensemble. Out of curiosity, the dragon tamer decides to ask Marion about her family, starting with this sibling of hers that Duke had not yet had the chance to meet. Marion pauses a moment, thinking of how to appropriately convey her sister's personality to Duke without giving away her true identity. &quot;Technically, she's my half-sister, but we're so close that we call each other sisters. We even look alike, except that she has darker hair and dresses with a much more gothic sensibility. She's... well, eccentric, but the same could be said about me, couldn't it?&quot; Marion laughs a bit. &quot;She went to university to study literature. She's a far better writer than I could ever hope to be, much as I love to read. She's the black sheep of our family in that she prefers dark type Pokemon over ghost-types. I think she just likes having the advantage, but that's the type of person she is. Outgoing, competitive, sadistic, dripping with sarcasm... but she's my sister.&quot; Marion shrugs. &quot;I'm sure you'll meet her sometime. She tends to hang around Keith quite a bit, so if you ever decide to visit him, she will likely be there, as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marion pauses for a moment, looking at her drink with a wistful expression. &quot;I must have told you that this drink reminds me of my grandfather, yeah? I have to admit... I miss him and Nana an awful lot. They passed away when I was very little, but I remember them nonetheless. My parents abandoned me at their doorstep, I am told they have passed away, as well... To be honest, Cosie is really the only family I've got, other than my Pokemon. She made sure that I always had the best nannies to raise me. They played with me all the time and taught me all sorts of interesting things about the world.&quot; Marion happily thinks back to the Haunter and Gengar who served as her guardians, but leaves the little detail of their species out of the description. &quot;I think I'm lucky, though. I have plenty of wonderful friends around me who fill my life with joy. That's all I need, really... My sister, my Pokemon and my friends.&quot; Marion grins, realizing that her sips have built up such that half of her drink is already gone. &quot;What about you, Duke? What's your family like?&quot;</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px">Duke periodically nods as he attentively listens to Marion's description of Coselle. Though only half-sisters, they were still pretty close and alike. Though like all siblings, also very unique. Outgoing, sadistic, competitive and dripping with sarcasm ... Balmund wouldn't necessarily call them bad habits, though he could easily picture others having a problem with that. Nonetheless, she was Marion's sister, and thus, one would just have to accept her the way she is. Duke was sure he would meet her well enough soon.<br />
<br />
Pausing for a moment, Marion goes on to talk about her own parents, or rather lack thereof as they left her abandoned at her grandparents's doorstep. It was them who in turn took the role of Mom and Dad, though unfortunately died when she was still very young, being instead raised by her nannies. Her growing up must've been tough, Duke figured. He couldn't comprehend what would prompt a parent to abandon his child. Why bring them to the world in the first place if one's not going to take responsibility for their life? But at the very least Marion too had many beautiful memories throughout her life, and was now happily surrounded by her sister, her Pokémon, and her friends. As expected, she then asks Duke about his own. <br />
<br />
&quot;Family means everything to me.&quot; Duke started off. &quot;Where I come from, it's a cultural thing to put blood above friends. I grew up thinking like this, and the feeling was enforced by my parents. Sure, they made a lot of mistakes, but in general, they always sought out for my best interests and made many sacrifices to ensure that we were well taken care of, and most importantly, loved. I'm sure I told you about my Dad. A very clean, intelligent and organized man. A doctor with exceptional treatment towards people, though he was perhaps a bit too old fashioned and harsh with us at times, but I greatly respected him for being a man of principles and values. My mother was very young and immature when I was born, barely eighteen as a matter of fact. She had the roughest time with me than with any of my siblings. We get along very well though. I see her like one of my best friends and confidants. Heh, she's aged very well too. People would often confuse her for my older sister, or worse, if you know what I mean. She too is a Dragon Tamer, and a very good one. People had often compared her skill to the current leader, Claire, if that serves as any indication. It's been a long time since I've seen them. Seeing both her and Angel, her Dragonair, in action, was a thing to behold. I miss them very much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never talked to you about this, but I have several siblings. I'm the eldest of us four. There's my brother, Edwin, with whom I'm very close. We would do a lot of stupid things back then. Skate, backyard wrestling, assorted pranks, picking fights at school, you name it. We dared for even worse when we got older, though only as long as we had each other to back us up. He's grown very distant lately though. Our curent goals and interests are just... different.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I also have two younger sisters. Theresa's the rebellious one. She never really managed to fit in, and moved out of home as soon as she possibly could. She still calls me every now and then though, so its good to hear she's doing well, even if she's probably going to get herself into some huge problem the way she's living her life right now. And lastly, there's Lucy, the 'spoiled brat', though she's adorable and full of life. I guess I like her so much because I can relate her to a certain team member of mine.&quot; He chuckled. &quot;I'm sure you'd like them.&quot;</span></div>

<article class="message-body js-selectToQuote">
<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px">Marion happily and intently listens to Balmund describe his family, eager to learn more about his upbringing; after all, how one is raised has so much to do with the type of person one ultimately becomes. It was a topic she did not discuss often, though she found it fascinating; Minerva had raised the ghostly trainer to never, <i>ever</i> ask about family, and if Duke had not been the one to bring up the subject, Marion would have certainly stayed away from it. Even despite his apparent willingness to share these details with her, Minerva's insistence on the matter sat deep in Marion's mind, and left her hesitant to ask questions. Even in the case of her own parents, all Minerva would say by way of explanation was, &quot;They de-ci-ded you would be hap-pi-er with me and your grand-par-ents. You are hap-py, are you not?&quot; When Marion would say yes (as she always did), Minerva would invariably narrow her eyes and respond, &quot;Then that is all there is to say.&quot; Marion knew, even when she was little, that there was plenty left unsaid in Minerva's explanation, but though honesty was never one of Minerva's virtues, Marion knew better than to press the issue with her. <br />
<br />
Marion tries to picture each member of Duke's family in her mind as he describes them, and marvels at the strong bond and the deep respect he seems to have for each member, despite any potential arguments or differences. She did remember Duke describing his father when tending to Durandal's wounds after the battle with August; he had shown a great deal of expertise in treating his Salamence, attributing his skill to that of his father. Even in that exchange, Marion had sensed the deep reverence Duke had for him, even if he had the tendency to be rather strict. Though Duke implied every so often that he did not always follow the straight and narrow path himself, his father's influence was clearly present. He seemed like the type of person who did his absolute best to set a good example for his children, which was certainly deserving of admiration and respect. Balmund then mentions the age of his mother when he was born, and Marion cannot help but imagine herself having to take care of 6 year old at the age of 24. After visibly shuddering at the very thought of it, Marion decides that his mother deserves a hell of a lot of credit for raising a child at such a young age. She wonders if Duke takes after his mother... clearly, he had chosen her profession, but she imagined the similarities did not end there. If his mother was anything like him, then she imagined that she would get along with her just fine.<br />
<br />
Marion smiles at the thought of Edwin and Balmund being partners-in-crime as kids, growing up with the assurance that no matter what insanity either got themselves into, they could rely on the other to make their way out. Marion can sense a twinge of sadness as Duke explains that the two had grown apart recently; Marion resists the temptation to ask more about their drifting apart, instead allowing him to transition into his description of his two younger sisters. Though they earn the titles from Duke of &quot;rebel&quot; and &quot;spoiled brat&quot; respectively, there is a definite affection meant within those titles, despite their brutal honesty. Despite their faults, they were his sisters, and they had a special place in his heart, particularly Lucy given her resemblance to a certain spoiled brat of his own. Marion nods emphatically at Duke's assertion that she would like his family if she were to meet them. &quot;I would love to meet them all someday,&quot; Marion says enthusiastically. &quot;It sounds like you have a wonderful family. That's definitely not something to take for granted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marion sighs wistfully, before realizing as she puts her glass up to her mouth that her casual sipping has depleted her drink. She sets the empty glass down on a table beside them; though she could tolerate quite a bit of alcohol despite her size and weight, her cheeks do appear a bit more flush then before, a soft pink against her pale cheeks. &quot;Say, Duke... Who would you say are your friends around here in Fizzytopia? My guess is that we have a few in common... I mean, I know we're both friends with Hyrem, but I was curious who else you would consider a friend.&quot; Marion smiles. &quot;I've been pleasantly surprised at how easy it's been to make friends here, even despite the fact that I've been back from university for less than a year. Trainers here are really nice... They don't make me feel like a freak or anything like that.&quot; Marion laughs a bit, though there is a slight wince in Marion's expression when she says the word &quot;freak,&quot; as if it is a term she is intimately familiar with.</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px">Marion listens attentively to Duke talk about his family with great interest before exclaiming about how nice it would be to meet them. Having a nice family was definitely not something one could take for granted, and Duke was well aware of how lucky he was of being born into one. She sighs wistfully, taking the last few drops sitting at the bottom of her drink, hiding between the cracks of the still melting ice cubes, and Duke figured her thoughts were turning towards her own family. She then appropriately changes up the topic, asking now asking him about his friends. Just as much as &quot;who did you grow up with&quot; shapes you as a person, so does &quot;who do you hang out with&quot; apply. Marion thought that they might have more friends in common, Hyrem already being one of those, and was surprised at friendly the community seemed to be nice in general. At the very least, they didn't make her feel like a freak. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, aren't we <i>all</i> freaks anyways? People are weird, every single one of us. Not even Normal-types have anything 'normal' about them.&quot; Balmund chuckles, making light of Marion's last statement, though not without taking note of the change of tone in that one particular word. &quot;People can also be very mean though. But they can only hurt one as much as one allows them, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, friends, huh? You know, I think true friends are far and few between, but I have found this whole place to be home of many great souls. Many of my Pokémon were once owned by someone else, and you could say that's one things that connects us on a level above that of simple acquaintances. Well, Hyrem's definitely a friend we both share. I also think you know Stacey very well too. She's literally there every single time I have a major Pokébattle, and she even shares my interest in card games. Let's see, there's Stark, Sothe's original owner and caretaker of a Poochyena I once had who went by the name of Nailah. There's Shadow, a very gifted researcher who helped me a lot on my papers on Kerrigan. There's Jaime, a long time friend of mine, and self-proclaimed 'Dragon Slayer'. He showed up once at the Bar, remember? I could go on and on about the list of people I've met in here. They're all, in general, very nice folk. Some can't help watching their mouths, and some can't help fighting between themselves, but such is the nature of man, right?&quot; Balmund pauses for a second to take a long sip off his still unfinished drink, and takes a deep breath stepping up the current topic. It was a thought that was circling Duke's head for a while, and though he could guess what her feelings where through what her body said alone, he still needed conformation by word. For some reason, hearing it by word of mouth, was also important. &quot;Say, Marion? Here's a ... curious question. What kind of friend am I, to you?&quot;</span></div>

<article class="message-body js-selectToQuote">
<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px">Duke senses Marion's familiarity with being treated as an outcast, and lightheartedly comments that nearly everyone could be considered strange in some way. Even &quot;Normal&quot; types were anything but normal. The ghostly young woman has to agree with him on that point; from the mysterious Porygon line that called cyberspace its home to the amazing transformation capabilities of Ditto to the artistic capabilities of Smeargle, it was hard to call any normal type really and truly &quot;normal.&quot; If normal types couldn't be normal, how could Marion possibly expect herself to accomplish normality, either? Duke then adds that people do have the tendency to be cruel, but their cruelty only has as much power as the target will allow. Marion nods at this in agreement; it was easier said than done, of course, but there was a definite truth to that statement. It had taken a long time for Marion to realize that those who ridicule her were not worth her time or energy, though occasionally there was that one person whom she so desperately wished would see her for who she really was, and not just some weirdo. Thankfully, such an event had not happened in years... She was less and less inclined to pine after those who treated her poorly, and she imagined that was a good thing.<br />
<br />
The topic transitions to friends, and Duke supports Marion's viewpoint that there are a number of wonderful people hanging around FB. He mentions that he seems to share a special bond with those whom he trades Pokemon, and Marion immediately flashes to a trade, many months ago, between herself and Balmund; on that fateful day, the Scyther now known as Zelgius evolved upon being inducted into Balmund's team, and in turn, the ghostly trainer had obtained a Nincada of her very own. She had kept the name her trainer had rightfully given her, that of the beautiful Japanese cherry blossom, Sakura. It was not easy to let the Scyther that she had held onto and trained for many years go, and yet, even back then, she trusted Balmund, sensing his capabilities as a trainer. She had not been proven wrong. She imagined that Zelgius brought some of Marion's influence into Balmund's team, much as Sakura brought the fighting spirit of the dragons who surrounded her into Marion's team, despite having been with Balmund only for a short time. Marion had to agree with Duke; there was something about trading Pokemon that was almost sacred... as if one is giving a part of themselves away to another.<br />
<br />
Marion's face lights up at the mention of Stacey, an old friend from her days at the Mansion. &quot;Oh, Stacey... She and I go <i>way</i> back. I was so happy to see her again after so many years away from Fizzytopia. I am so impressed with how far she's come since we were both young. I don't think the Fizzytopian Government could be in better hands, personally; she is the one person I would trust, more than anyone, to take care of a situation and lead properly and fairly. I wish I could get to visit her more often, but she is always so busy... I imagine that's how it must be, given her position.&quot; Marion sighs wistfully, the expression on her face bittersweet; it is easy to see that she misses her old friend, but she encourages Duke to continue, wanting to hear more about his friends. Stark and Shadow are both familiar names to Marion; though she had not interacted with either trainer that often, she had heard from Minerva that Shadow was a very interesting trainer: pragmatic, practical and overly analytic, with a particularly amusing Chatot that Minerva insisted Marion would like. How Minerva knew about all this, Marion had no idea... but figured it was best not to ask. Marion pauses at first at the mention of a &quot;Jaime&quot; not quite picturing the fellow that Duke was talking about until he used the term &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot; and mentioned him being at the bar. &quot;Ooooh, right! The man with the Spheal! He seemed really nice, but I never really got the opportunity to speak with him. He's out travelling, isn't he? I would love to get to know him better when he gets back. Seemed like a really interesting guy.&quot; Duke then admits that he could go on and on about the people he has met in FB, but suffice to say that they were nice for the most part. Marion chuckles with recognition at the mention of certain trainers who just couldn't seem to stay out of trouble, starting fights and running their mouths... &quot;At least they make things interesting,&quot; Marion says with a bit of a laugh. &quot;I try to stay level-headed as much as I can, even when tempers are raging... I have learned from my younger days that nothing good ever comes from running your mouth, haha~'<br />
<br />
Balmund pauses for a moment, and Marion becomes aware of a sudden feeling of tension... The long drink he takes from his glass, the deep inhale, the pose he enters, as if bracing himself... Before he even asks the question, Marion anticipates that it would be an important one. Sure enough, he brings forth the topic that had been buzzing around both their heads, like a pesky fly that could not be swatted away, and asks Marion to be candid about what type of friend he would consider her to be. Resisting the urge to say &quot;Dragon Type,&quot; Marion deeply inhales herself, trying to gather her thoughts as quickly as she can so as not to leave Duke hanging for an answer. She knew that if she came on too strong, things could possibly end very badly for her... and yet, if she was not honest, she could potentially miss out on an amazing relationship. In that brief moment of breathing in, Marion decides to simply go for it, and let her heart dictate her speech.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're... different, from my other friends. I-In a good way, I mean.&quot; Not off to the best start, but Marion does her best not to be deterred, and presses on, her face already showing signs of blushing; &quot;I mean, I have quite a few friends here, and I care for them all very much, but... There was something about you that stood out to me from the beginning. It's hard to explain in words, but... You have... you have this aura about you that's... magnetic, I guess would be the term. I'm sure I'm not the first to tell you that.&quot; Marion laughs a bit, though clearly the laughter comes more from nerves than any attempt at humor. &quot;Did I ever tell you that Bedivere thinks that you are a real, honest-to-goodness Duke? He is <i>convinced</i>. No matter how hard I try, he insists that we should be paying you the taxes on our land in the Hidden Mansion since you are the Lord Balmund, Duke of Fizzytopia. I have had to intercept stray coins from ending up in your mailbox more than once.&quot; Though Marion chuckles at this seemingly unrelated story, there is a sense that the point was not brought up at random. &quot;Anyway... I ended up getting a bit annoyed with him the last time he did that, and I asked him, 'What on Earth makes you think that he's royalty?' He turned to me, and his smile was so strange... You know what he said?&quot; <br />
<br />
Marion attempts to recreate Bedivere's posh, velvet British accent as she quotes his words to her, though her accent breaks a bit at the end from the weight of the admission... Slowly, carefully, she repeats his response verbatim; &quot;Ah, but you love him. That makes him royalty to you, does it not?&quot; <br />
<br />
Marion blushes profusely, returning to her normal dialect. &quot;I tried to laugh it off, but his words stuck with me. They had a weight, a real resonance. They played over and over again in my head. Part of me... okay, more than part of me... I... I guess I..., well, I think there's truth to what he said.&quot; Marion exhales deeply after the words finally break through, out into the open. &quot;Actually... I know there is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Feeling more fragile than she ever has in her entire life, Marion cannot bear to meet Duke's gaze, for fear that what she saw in his eyes would destroy her. The admission had made her feel weak, powerless, and yet... she felt as if she had been set free, the feelings within her heart no longer so tightly locked away. She could only hope that she had not completely ruined an otherwise amazing night by her stumbling, awkward confession.</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px">Marion too takes a deep breath before answering Duke's question. Understandably, it was not an easy feat when answered in all honesty, emotions getting in the way as the mind tried to put everything into words. She explains she sees him as different than her other friends, though in a good way. There was something about Duke that she felt magnetic since the very beginning, and though Duke always had trouble getting used to such compliments, he could relate to the feeling very, very well. He exhales briefly through his nostrils as a light smile draws on his face as she too laughs, though her laugh was more out of pure nervousness. He remains quiet throughout however, not wanting to disturb the flow of her thoughts until the very end.<br />
<br />
Out of the blue, she starts talking about Bedivere, about how the regal Frillish honestly and truly thought Duke to be an wealthy Duke of Fizzytopia. Had it not been for Marion's intervention, Duke would've already received stray coins on his mail in tax money. At one point she had asked him why did he so persistently insist on Duke's status of royalty, and Bedivere's answer was one that had stuck with her; because she loves him. Though she had tried to laugh it off, she found that she couldn't as a great part of her found truth in them. <br />
<br />
As her confession made it through into the open, Marion exhales deeply, turning her gaze away unable to meet Duke's eyes. Having released those feelings, she seemed even more vulnerable and petit than before. It took a moment for Marion's confession to truly register in Duke's mind and heart. Words indeed have power, and they have the ability to strike a chord within oneself much more effectively than anything else when spoken. He wasn't shocked or anything ... thoughtful would be a better description. He hadn't planned ahead. Whatever her answer would've been, he did not know how to properly follow up. And that, one could argue, was a good thing. He decides to go with the moment, and let his heart dictate his words as they spring forth into his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know...&quot; He said, while his gaze wandering off into the distance. &quot;I remember when I first saw you. It's hard to explain, but I immediately felt pulled towards you. I don't know if <i>you</i> noticed the kind of magnetic power you have. Back then at the Bar, you must've been had like five different folks all trying to talk with you all at once, or at least I remember it that way, and I tried, to not just be another one of the bunch. Yet, I kept thinking, this girl's beyond my reach. Out of my league. So the day you accepted to come to my place, you could say I almost went bonkers with excitement. I think you're a beautiful person, in every sense of the word. I had fallen in love with the way you think. I had fallen in love with the way you look. I had fallen in love with the way you feel. And it hurt ... the thought that I would forever be, just a friend. But I was also okay with that ... Just meeting you alone is one of the better things that happened to me. Heh, now I'm feeling all small and squishy.&quot; His gaze turns again to meet hers, ready for whatever it is that he would find in her eyes. &quot;But I do mean all of that.&quot;</span></div>

<article class="message-body js-selectToQuote">
<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px">Having bared the fragile contents of her heart to Duke, the single, painful moment of silence threatens to drive Marion insane; the confession was sinking in to the one she loved, and there was no way she could take it back now that it had taken root within him. Duke gazes off into the distance, thinking of the right words to say, and Marion tries to prepare herself for whatever response she is met with... Then again, it seems as if Duke himself isn't quite aware of how his response will take shape. He speaks in the moment, letting his heart dictate his feelings. He recounts when they first met at the Bar, and remarks on Marion's own magnetic influence on others. It was true that she had found herself being surrounded by trainers, trying her best to move between conversations as each one presented their own topic of interest; she had thought that they were just being friendly and trying to welcome a brand new face, but perhaps there was some truth to what Balmund was saying. The dragon tamer recounts trying to stand out from the crowd that had gathered around her, all the while thinking that Marion was too popular, too sought after to be his... A rank above, and the distance between them was such that it would never truly be bridged. When Balmund extended the invitation for Marion to visit his Secret Base with August, she had thought that boundless energy and eagerness had to do with the match between their beloved dragons... That he would actually be excited for <i>her</i> presence at his Base had not occurred to her... perhaps because she did not want to give herself any false hope. He tells her that he thinks of her as a beautiful person, and admits to having fallen in love with all aspects of her being. <i>And it hurt...</i> A twinge of guilt aches within Marion's heart; she had been so afraid of being hurt herself, had hid her feelings so deeply inside that she had neglected to think of what Duke may be feeling; the thoughts she had experienced herself, of being nothing more than a friend... Why had she not admitted to her feelings sooner? Why did she let all those little anxieties and insecurities hold her back? Then again, she supposed that if she had tried before, it would not have been the right time, the right place... And in the relative dark seclusion of the club, where the music throbbed and pulsed like a heartbeat, somehow they both knew... this would be the time, and place. The moment they had constructed for themselves... it could not have been more perfect. Her cheeks pink with blush from the compliments and admiration, she felt about nine times more intoxicated than she actually was; she could almost feel the room spinning as Duke's words hit her like a drug. Complete and utter euphoria.<br />
<br />
When his eyes finally turn to meet hers, her gaze is completely naked; stripped of all concealment, her glittering affection shines through, unfiltered, bright. Still with that bit of mischief and playfulness, a little smirk forms underneath her bright eyes, a soft laugh echoing. At first, her voice is mock-logical, a farce of her usual personality, always analyzing the situation; &quot;Well, if you are in love with me, and I am in love with you...&quot; Her tone abruptly lightens, taking on a hint of seduction as she leans in closer; &quot;<i>Then what the Hell are we waiting for?</i>&quot;</span></div>

XD Unless myahoo reads this and gets inspiration from it now! XP))<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #cc0033"><b><u>Keith, Coselle, Marion, Okiku, Cele, Blaze, Hyrem, Connor, Alice:</u></b><br />
<br />
While Coselle and Keith talked to each other for a while, Okiku felt a bit dizzy, losing quite a chunk of the conversation. With the little part of her brain that can still think straight, she guessed that she was getting a bit drunk for the first time in her life. She knew what to do to help her sober up a bit: she ordered to the busy barman something to drink (with no alcohol) and to eat, which he went ahead to prepare her a glass Persim Berry lemonade and a plate of nachos. While he was doing that though, it was too late and Okiku completely lost it, starting to spur out random things she didn't even understand the meaning of them (and/or wasn't even conscious she was saying them), like &quot;finding a legend under a truck&quot;, &quot;<i>un couple de fantômes vivants dans la brasserie</i>&quot;, and &quot;disappearing at the same time as a Cerulean trainer notices you&quot;. Her strange rant ended though as she filled her gut with the lemonade and the nachos the barman gave to her in a timely manner, then she started to go back to normal.<br />
<br />
The first thing Okiku heard after being herself again is Coselle talking about the new Pokémon that was recently discovered. She would actually love to own a Fennekin and thought Marion would like Froakie, while Keith preferred Chespin so far. Okiku shook her head before speaking to clear her head as much as possible.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm interested into Fennekin myself. Not only that Pokémon's adorable, but I'm quite curious and hoping the on the truthfulness of the the theory where its final evolution becomes part-Psychic,&quot; she grinned. &quot;But I'll probably be fit to flip a table if it ends up being part fighting, yet again...&quot;</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Michael had been sitting at his table sipping hot tea for quite some time, watching and listening as many people flood in to the nightclub. At first he had resolved not to eavesdrop and let someone approach him if they could get past the rather intimidating demeanor his apparel gave off, but as time passed and not a single soul even seemed to notice him he became bored, and decided to listen in on the conversations around him, sipping his tea slowly every now and then so nobody would notice the movement of a quick gulp. He had gone through several mugs worth by this point, the bartender attentively bringing him more whenever he got low, causing him to frequently think 'Well at least I'm not invisible, I suppose.'<br />
<br />
Two conversations began to develop around him, one from a larger group of people, and one from two people he couldn't quite hear due to their slightly hushed tones. Obviously because of this he would choose to listen in to the group... but no, words spoken hushed are always more interesting than those shouted across a room. So he listened as intently as possible, able to make out very little. But he needed not to hear the words, for their body language was likely to away everything they were saying fairly obviously. After watching a series of blushes from the girl out of the corner of his eye followed by her leaning in towards the man Michael decided that this was most definitely not anything he really cared about, just another private moment in a nightclub.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Michael began to feel a little bad for the eavesdropping. How would he feel if someone had been listening in on his own private moment? With a shake of his head he rid his mind of the thought and signaled for one of the nightclub's staff. When the waitress arrived Michael lightly gestured towards the couple and whispered &quot;I've got their tabs.&quot; before slowly getting up and wandering over to the large group, deciding to make himself known.<br />
<br />
&quot;Room for one more?&quot;</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px">Marion's gaze now naked and glittering with affection, she smirks, ever slightly in a seductive and playful manner. She then poses the question to which Duke couldn't help smirking back in return. Indeed, if they both had such feelings for each other, what the hell where they waiting for? Why delay this any longer? Why waste time in amiable chit-chat when they both knew what each other wanted? As Marion leaned closer, so did he comply, without hesitation. Third time's the real charmer, they say, and from there the door opened for a lot more.
