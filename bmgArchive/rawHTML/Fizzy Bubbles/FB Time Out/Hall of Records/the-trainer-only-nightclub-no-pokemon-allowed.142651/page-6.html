<article class="message-body js-selectToQuote">
<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><b>Keith, Coselle, Marion, Okiku, Cele, Blaze, Hyrem, Connor, Alice, Michael</b>: Coselle smirks at Keith as he counters that the evolutions of Chespin and Fennekin could develop types that would balance out the disadvantage. &quot;Face it, darling... Even if they do end up with secondary types, at best it would make us even.&quot; Coselle cackles. &quot;Though, you wouldn't let a little thing like type disadvantage get you down, would you...? You've stood up to worse odds before, hehe~&quot; The dark-haired minx considers Keith's question about the future evolutions of Froakie, Chespin and Fennekin. Coselle pauses for a moment, and an almost unnaturally wide grin spreads across her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Froakie will become the godzilla-frog. It will be part fighting, yet breathe fire, and destroy entire cities with its might. From brainy intellectual to brawny superpower... Revenge of the nerds, if you will. Fennekin will evolve into a part-poison ninja fox with a mask and flaming shurikens. It will jump out of the shadows and assassinate people by simultaneously slitting their throats with a poison dagger and setting them on fire. As for Chespin...&quot; Coselle smirks. &quot;Its hat will transform from dorky-cute to hideously evil and eventually take control over its mind and it will become a part-ghost chipmunkzombie in its final evolution that craves braaaaaaains.&quot; Coselle cackles at her rather ridiculous predictions; Keith catches on rather quickly to the fact that this was probably Coselle's elaborate and indirect way of saying &quot;I have no idea&quot;.<br />
<br />
Turning to check on Okiku, Coselle begins feeling concerned for her new friend, as the alcohol's effects become steadily more apparent. The young lady makes the prudent decision of ordering chips and a non-alcoholic drink to counter her drunkenness, but Coselle keeps a careful eye on her as she begins speaking what seems to Coselle to be complete and utter nonsense; a bit of french that Coselle can only understand based on cognates and the fact that she had seen a few breweries in her time using the word &quot;brasserie&quot; to describe themselves... A couple of ghosts in the brewery? Was she possessed? All this talk of trucks and disappearing... Perhaps she was. Coselle is about to walk over to the trainer and ask if she's all right, but as her snack is served and she begins to eat, she seems to snap out of the strange rambling and return to normal. Eventually, she is coherent enough to respond to the conversation at hand, voicing her hope that Fennekin's evolution takes on a psychic secondary type.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am hoping for Fennekin's evolution to be part-dark myself,&quot; Coselle says with a smirk. &quot;Then again, psychic would make sense, given what little of its powers researchers have come across already. Heh, I would not be thrilled if it becomes part-fighting, myself... Such a graceful little creature seems ill-suited to the type, though the likes of Mienfoo and Mienshao are identified as fighting. Perhaps Fennekin would be a more graceful, agile fighter...?&quot;<br />
<br />
Coselle turns her head, distracted by an approaching trainer. Despite the aura created by his choice of clothing, he seems to be a nice enough fellow. Coselle grins at his introduction, motioning silently to an open chair near the group as if to indicate that there was indeed room for another. &quot;We are discussing the Pokemon that were recently discovered by researchers... Brand new starter Pokemon, they're saying. Have you heard about this?&quot; Coselle smirks. &quot;Picked out a favorite yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
<b>Marion, Duke</b>: Third time's the charm, indeed... Unable to hold back, this third joining of the pair of trainers certainly bordered on risque for even the dark, seductive setting they were in, if not completely crossing the line. In the heat of the moment, Marion has to stop herself from ripping off Duke's shirt, as if the thought suddenly occurs to her that they are still in <i>public</i>. Thinking quickly, she pulls away for a moment with a smile, her mind working quickly to remedy the situation. Not that she gave a shit about what others thought of her and her choices, but getting thrown out of the Nightclub in the midst of their passion was probably not the best way to spend an evening, for all of its future storytelling value. She remembers hearing that the proprietor of this particular Nightclub was particularly sensitive to the issue of drinking and driving, and in order to prevent patrons from driving home inebriated, he had recently built an addition to the second floor of the Nightclub which included some nice little rooms for individuals and couples to sleep off the booze before heading back to wherever they needed to be. Granted, Marion had walked to the Nightclub, but given that it was an off night, the bartender likely wouldn't mind giving her a key to one of the rooms. She decides to posit the idea to Balmund, with a bit of play-innocence;<br />
<br />
&quot;Say, Duke... Think we should ask the bartender for a key to one of the rooms upstairs? I have to admit, I'm feeling a bit too lightheaded to walk home...&quot; Marion smirks a bit, playing with strands of Balmund's hair as she asks the question.</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: #944D94"><span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Keith, Coselle, Marion, Okiku, Cele, Blaze, Hyrem, Connor, Alice, Michael:</u></b> Coselle reminded Keith that even if Chespin and Fennekin do gain secondary types to reverse the situation, best case scenario, they'd be evenly matched. &quot;True,&quot; admitted Keith. &quot;Still, it'd be better than nothing, right?&quot; He then listened to Coselle's decidedly bizarre predictions as to what their final evolutions would be like- it wasn't hard for him to catch on to the fact that this was more than likely her highly elaborate way of saying that she had no idea. Still, he found it very amusing to picture her ideas, like Chespin's hat turning into a hideous monstrosity that turned it into a zombie, and he especially liked the idea of Fennekin's type combination becoming Fire/Poison. They were certainly unique ideas, and he couldn't honestly say that he didn't like them.<br />
<br />
Coselle then resumed talking to Okiku, stating that she'd prefer to see Fennekin become a Dark-type. Given her preference for aforementioned type, Keith was not surprised in the slightest by this, and had to agree- from what he had heard of Fennekin, it appeared as though it was capable of some form of psychic power, so it wouldn't be too big a stretch to think it might turn out to be Fire/Psychic. As Coselle expressed a hope that Fennekin didn't turn out to be Fire/Fighting, however, Keith nodded vigorously. &quot;Oh, yes,&quot; he agreed. I'm noticing that a lot of Fire-type starter Pokemon these days turn out to be part Fighting. I mean, it's not a bad combination of types, but I can't really picture it for Fennekin. Not even when you consider Mienfoo and Mienshao, either. I just... I can't see it at all. Though Froakie becoming part Fighting, that doesn't seem that unreasonable. It seems to be pretty agile from what I've heard. They think it might be capable of moves like Quick Attack or Acrobatics, so I guess I could see that happening...&quot;</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray"><b>Keith, Coselle, Marion, Okiku, Cele, Blaze, Hyrem, Connor, Alice, Michael:</b> Accepting the invitational gesture by Coselle, Michael slouched into the nearby seat, downing a good portion of what was left of his tea immediately after doing so. The group had been discussing the recently discovered trio of starters, and speculation as to what types they may evolve into arose. Michael couldn't help but to smirk at some of the outlandish ideas. Having been asked what his favorite of the three was, he figured he'd at least give an answer. &quot;Honestly they all seem quite interesting to me, but Fennekin looks to be by far the most promising. Many canine species tend to have astonishing abilities, likely owing to their predatorial nature.&quot; Michael would have tried to hide his love of canines had it not been for the fact that he was sporting plastic Houndoom horns on his hood, so who would he be fooling?<br />
<br />
Switching away from the seriousness, Michael decided he may as well speculate as well, what harm could come of it, after all? &quot;Honestly though, the idea of an evil evolution to Chespin doesn't seem too outlandish. After all, have you ever seen a chipmunk that wasn't evil?&quot; And with that horrendous joke out of the way, he gulped down the last of his tea and set the mug aside, deciding to start on something a mite stronger if he was going to be actually socializing. &quot;Froakie evolving to be a fighter doesn't seem too out of the question either, though I think I could see it evolving into a steaming Steel type, picking up some moves like Scald and Mist. Wouldn't that be a riot?&quot; His new drink arrived almost immediately after the sentence, though he opted to simply play with the stirring straw for a moment as he pondered the last of the trio. &quot;Fennekin... I could see that going many different ways, many of which would make me quite happy, and a few of which, such as becoming a fighter, would have just the opposite effect. But I suppose only time and more research will tell.&quot; Sighing, Michael took a nice sip of his drink before rounding his thoughts off for the moment. &quot;In all honesty, I'm just waiting on more interesting discoveries. We all know that when new discoveries are made they come in droves, and honestly, I'm sure there will be plenty of increasingly more shocking discoveries in the not too distant future.&quot;</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px">Lost in the heat of the moment, both Marion and Duke had a hard time to pull away from each other before they made a public mess of themselves. Not that they really cared for their public reputation, but it wouldn't sit well if they got kicked out for crossing the line (or two, or three!). Playing innocent, Marion suggests asking the bartender for a room upstairs, of course, to sure a safe trip back home next morning, or so the story goes.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's like you're reading my mind.&quot; Duke grinned playfully before leading her to the bar. There's a special kind of excitement that came forth in Duke when deliberately postponing (only a little bit) one's greatest desire, and this little but necessary distraction was just enough to further fuel the fire in him. Upon reaching the kind barman, Duke asks for some more drinks, a room upstairs, and their bill. He's genuinely surprised as he finds he tab to have already been covered by someone else, the realization that people were indeed watching them dawning upon himself. He wondered just who would be the kind soul who would do such a thing for them, and then his eyes caught sight of the rest. He easily recognized Hyrem. There was Keith who he vaguely knew, Okiku who he had interacted once in friendly battle, and Michael, with whom him he entrusted his beloved Kingdra in exchange for his Totodile. The other two women he didn't meet before,but he gathered the dark-haired one to be Marion's sister by the looks of it. Talk about timing. He wondered if they had been seen yet, and though a part of him wanted to greet them, he was now a man on a mission. He turns to Marion with a bit of a mischievous look on his face, as if non-verbally saying 'let's sneak away while we still can'. The others could definitely wait ... for a couple hours, at least.</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><b>Keith, Coselle, Marion, Okiku, Cele, Blaze, Hyrem, Connor, Alice, Michael:</b> Coselle chuckles a bit at Keith's assertion that Fennekin did not seem the type of Pokemon to evolve into a fighting type, even when considering lithe, elegant fighters like Mienshao. &quot;I certainly hope you are right. There are enough fire/fighting starters out there already. Water/fighting, however, is not quite so common... Perhaps a bit too much like Poliwrath, now that I think about it, but still... could be interesting for a starter. I am almost tempted to say that Froakie will be part Ice, now that I think about it...&quot; Coselle listens to Michael admit to his preference for Fennekin, noting the Houndoom horns on his head as he speaks of the astonishing abilities of canine-esque Pokemon. &quot;Mm, Fennekin is indeed quite popular, it seems... Watch it evolve into a horrifying blob of mangled, furry flesh. I would still want one, at least~!&quot;<br />
<br />
Horrendous though it was, Coselle still chuckles at the joke regarding evil squirrels. They were conniving little monsters, weren't they? Especially those demonic little Pachirisu... Either way, the newcomer to the conversation decides to elaborate on his own theories; Coselle's expression is somewhat mixed at the idea of Froakie being part steel. &quot;Hmmmm... A steampunk frog would certainly be intriguing if done correctly, especially given that he already has little spectacles, though didn't Empoleon already fill the niche for a water/steel starter? I suppose one more couldn't hurt...&quot; Coselle grimaces. &quot;Then again, I said that about Infernape, did I not? Ah, but I tend to prefer steel over fighting generally anyhow.&quot; Coselle seems to agree far more with Michael's opinion that there are many possibilities with Fennekin, and while some were exciting to think about, others (like <i>yet another</i> fire/fighting starter) were not so worthy of enthusiasm. Calling over the Bartender, Coselle decides to order some <a href="http://www.thedrunkenmoogle.com/tagged/heavy+rain+drink" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thedrunkenmoogle.com%2Ftagged%2Fheavy%2Brain%2Bdrink&amp;hash=cfb1c4dd9f42da91fbf0dd16f9eb2bb9" rel="nofollow noopener">Triptocaine</a> before turning to meet Michael's gaze. &quot;Say... I don't think I caught your name. They call me Coselle. Did I mention that I like your horns?&quot; Coselle smirks a bit. &quot;Dark types are my favorite, after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
<b>Duke, Marion</b>: Minds and hearts in sync, the two lovers agree to delay their passion for a brief moment in order to ensure their privacy, and Marion lets herself be gently led by Duke to the counter... a moment to catch their breath before delving in deeper. The barman gives Duke a knowing grin and no resistance as he hands the dragon tamer a key to one of the double beds upstairs, while commenting that their tab has been accounted for. As he mixes their drinks, Marion turns to Duke with a slightly confused expression before looking out at the bar patrons; who would have performed such a kindness for them? There were a number of trainers she did not know very well who happened to be gathered at the pub, eating, drinking and laughing; perhaps one of Balmund's friends had decided to foot the bill. Of course, Hyrem was around... and Keith... and... <i>Coselle??</i><br />
<br />
Under normal circumstances, Marion would have angrily marched over to her troublemaker of a sister, demanding an explanation for why she went against her promise not to come in; of course, Coselle pretends not to notice her younger sibling at the counter standing incredibly close to a man who happens to be requesting keys to a double bed, but the grin that spreads across her face at seemingly nothing betrays her impish delight at her sister's newfound romance. To admonish the dark-haired trickster now would be to ruin the moment, and quite frankly, Marion had other things on her mind. Though Balmund is tempted to socialize with the group of trainers, a greater temptation reigns in him as well, and he silently indicates that the two should slip off before being noticed and invited into conversation. Giving Balmund's arm a gentle squeeze, her eyes glittering with anticipation, she gently takes the lead herself, as the pair make their way up the stairs toward the bedroom, hearts pounding in their chests before the action even really begins. As the two quickly make their way inside and the door slams behind them in their haste, it is best to remind you, dear reader, that it is rude to spy on others behind closed doors. Best leave these two to their privacy, now, shall we?</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: #944D94"><span style="font-size: 9px"><b><u>Keith, Coselle, Marion, Okiku, Cele, Blaze, Hyrem, Connor, Alice, Michael:</u></b> Coselle expressed her hope that Keith's assertion that Fennekin did not look like Fighting-type material was correct, stating that far too many Fire-type starters ended up Fighting-types. She then remarked that if Froakie did indeed end up a Water/Fighting-type, it would be quite similar of a situation to Poliwrath, something Keith hadn't thought of. Still, she conceded it would be interesting to see in a starter. Then, Keith saw two people, obviously a couple, approach the bartender for a key to one of the upstairs rooms. Keith was somewhat astonished to see that this couple was none other than Marion and Balmund- he had no idea they were seeing each other. Granted, he barely knew Balmund that well. They've made trades in the past, and Keith had him babysit Severus, back before the PC restrictions were repealed, but that was more or less the extent of it. Then again, when August and Durandal had fallen in love, and had waged that battle in the Bar's parking lot, Marion and Balmund really seemed to hit it off... Then, with a jolt, Keith recalled that Coselle had said that Marion had wanted her to wait outside. He was worried for a second that Marion would notice Coselle's presence and try to drag her out of the Nightclub. To his relief, however, this did not occur, primarily because Marion seemed a little... preoccupied, shall we say, with Balmund. As they left, Keith glanced out at the vacant dance floor, then at Coselle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Coselle,&quot; Keith said, &quot;Now that I look at that dance floor out there, I think I see a problem with it... That problem being, you and I aren't on it,&quot; he grinned. &quot;What do you say?&quot;</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><i>Marion and Balmund...</i> Coselle thinks back to when she had visited the dragon tamer's Secret Base with Marion, back when she was still in her Banette form. Minerva had always sensed there was something there, much as Marion had tried to deny it. Of course, Minerva couldn't complain about Marion's love interest; Balmund seemed like a strong and capable trainer with a team full of interesting Pokemon, after all. Coselle can feel Keith jolt into the realization that if Marion catches Coselle on his lap instead of outside the Nightclub, there could be some problems. He instinctively seems to shield her from Marion's view, though the pale-haired young lady does not seem to even notice that her friend Keith is at the Pub, let alone her own sister. &quot;So, Mary's fallen for Durandal's trainer... Interesting match,&quot; Coselle whispers to Keith, cackling softly. &quot;I wonder how daddy's girl Orchrist is gonna react to <i>that</i> one...&quot; As Balmund and Marion make their way upstairs, Keith notices that the dance floor is now vacant and free of the threat of Marion discovering her sister and shooing her out of the Nightclub. Looking at the dance floor, then back to Coselle. She can guess what Keith is about to ask before he even begins to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, I would love to...&quot; Coselle laughs a bit. &quot;Of course, you will have to forgive me... I am nowhere near as graceful as my sister,&quot; Coselle smirks. &quot;I may end up falling flat on my face, but as long as you at least <i>try</i> to hold in your laughter, I should be okay.&quot; Coselle gets up off of Keith's lap and gently takes his hand. &quot;Lead on, my dear,&quot; she smirks.</span></div>

Naturally, he hoped it would work for Marion, though, of course. Not long after that, Keith noticed the now vacant dance floor, and invited Coselle out on it. She laughed a little as she accepted his offer, though warned him that she wasn't nearly as graceful as her sister, and might very well end up falling. As she took his hand, Keith led the way out to the dance floor. He wasn't exactly the most graceful guy on the dance floor himself, so if Coselle did end up falling, he wasn't about to laugh at her. As they reached the middle of the dance floor, the DJ had already started up a slower song. Still holding Coselle's hand, Keith gently placed his free arm around her waist as they began to dance.</span></span></div>

If the other patrons didn't know any better, they might guess that Coselle was a former mermaid who only recently was granted her wish for legs. Tone and rhythm-deaf, the seductively-dressed young woman steps on her supposed prince's toes a couple of times with a wince and an apologetic look in her eye, particularly given the heavy boots that she's wearing, though she laughs with each misstep and near trip that nearly leads to an injury of her own as she sways awkwardly, doing her best to match her partner and not appear a total fool. She had not danced in years... Hell, she had not been in a <i>body</i> in years, and the mechanics took some getting used to... Eventually, as the chorus swells, she begins to gain a bit more confidence. Her partner was not one to judge her, even if his toes would be a bit bruised at the end of the night, and even if she did not have the grace and talent of her sister, she had Keith to hold her steady, even when she threatened to wobble out of control. As the song progresses, though she still appears uncoordinated, she does slowly begin to catch on to Keith's rhythm, her close watch of him cluing her in to the beat her body should mimic. She moves a bit closer to him, given that the threat of stomping on his foot has lessened somewhat, admittedly enjoying the opportunity to be so close to Keith.</span></div>

Numerous times, she stepped on Keith's toes, and the heavy boots she was wearing didn't exactly help matters any. Though Keith was faring much better, he still wasn't exactly the most graceful dancer in the world. Every time Coselle stomped his toes, she would give him an apologetic look, to which he would invariably respond with a reassuring smile as he held her steady the whole time. As the song progressed, Coselle seemed to grow more confident, and started to slowly catch onto the rhythm. She started to move a bit closer to him once it became clear that the risk to Keith's feet was now somewhat diminished, and Keith's smile widened. He let Coselle move as close to him as she wanted to, as they continued to dance. Even if his feet were to take more beatings as a result, being so close to Coselle was worth it.</span></span></div>

As one woman introduced herself as Okiku, Hyrem was reminded about the battle they were about to have. &quot;Yeah, can't wait!&quot; he replied. &quot;I also can't wait to meet your Espeon, they're my favorite of the Eeveelutions!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then Alice introduced herself, and Hyrem got to shake hands with her. &quot;Nice to meet you too! You new in town?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Coselle also approaches Hyrem, and her soothing, yet creepy voice gets to him once again. &quot;Oh, yeah, small world, huh?&quot; he said as he clutched his arm without knowing he did. Something about Coselle ... she speaks so familiarly as if she knows some sort of intimate secret about the young trainer, some haunting experience that Hyrem wished would disappear from his mind, it was so traumatic...</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: #cc0033"><b><u>Okiku, Cele, Blaze, Hyrem, Connor, Alice, Michael:</u></b><br />
<br />
After continuing the conversation a bit about the newly discovered Pokémon (which Okiku didn't say anything, as although functional and able to listen, she's still intoxicated), a man with a Houndoom hoodie approached the group, wanting to join in the conversation. Okiku simply nodded at his arrival.<br />
<br />
Afterwards, after seeing her sister leave the dance floor with what seemed to be her love interest, Coselle invited her boyfriend to the now empty dance floor. Keith much obliged. Okiku waved her hand once as a polite 'go ahead' to them, not wanting to bother them during that moment... followed by a discreet sigh and a light shook of her head as the couple had their backs turned on her.<br />
<br />
She looked over the others, especially the houndoom guy, with interest but also nervousness. As much as she's shy, she cannot stand awkward silence. And for some reason, although it's completely opposite to her nature... she wanted to dance. Her drunkness however made her push to break the silence, opened her mouth to ask the man with the houndoom hoodie to dance... Only to spit out a garbled and slurred &quot;Hey&quot;. Her more sober side caught up to her, immediately shutting up her mouth and started sweating anxiously at what she has done, even if she stopped herself from doing worse. In her mind she wanted to slap her head repetitively while repeating ''Stupid, épaisse, baka!&quot;, but of course her common sense got the best of her with that thought.<br />
<br />
She opened her mouth again towards the guy with the hoodie to at least cover up her social fumble, but in the nick of time, Hyrem spoke to her, excited about the battle against her Espeon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah!&quot; she responded, shocked of the great timing, &quot;I can't wait for the battle too! It's going to be Himiko's first battle, so I can't wait to see how she'll do!&quot;<br />
<br />
Okiku smiled as he also mentions Espeon being his favorite Eevee Evolution.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is mine too, and I'm glad Himiko was more than happy to evolve into one! I like Umbreon too, which I also have! ...But speaking of Eeveeolutions, heard of that new one they discovered recently, that while, pink and blue one with ribbons and bows, that they called Sylveon? I have no idea what type she is, but she's the most adorable thing!&quot; she squee'd.<br />
<br />
She then looked back at the houndoom-hooded trainer, although still feeling horribly embarrassed with what she almost asked him, she felt bad that she didn't say anything after all and don't even know him. &quot;Say, you didn't introduce yourself! What's your name? I'm Okiku, and this is Hyrem.&quot;</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray"><b>Keith, Coselle, Marion, Okiku, Cele, Blaze, Hyrem, Connor, Alice, Michael:</b> Michael smirked as Coselle complimented his horns and proceeded to ask his name, only to quickly find himself unamused as she stood up and left for the dance floor with Keith, a gentleman Michael recognized from a few trades in the past. Michael shrugged it off, as there was alcohol involved, and being the newest one to join the group with very few people actually recognizing him, he was ‘greeted’ shortly thereafter by a younger girl who managed to stammer out the word “Hey.”<br />
<br />
“Heh. I guess I’m going to have to do some catchup, huh?” Michael joked, downing the remainder of his fairly full drink to prove he would. Luckily another person managed to jump into the conversation as he did this, giving him the moment he needed to order another drink to replace the now empty glass in his hand.<br />
<br />
Looking a little shaken, the same girl spoke up once more, asking Michael’s name and introducing herself and the guy who just spoke as Okiku and Hyrem, shocking Michael as he realized his social mistake.<br />
<br />
“The name’s Michael.” He proceeded to answer as nonchalantly as possible to hide his own embarrassment, pulling his hood down slightly over his eyes. “And don’t worry, I won’t bite. Not if you don’t anyway.” His mind drifted for a brief moment to the couple that had just left for the dance floor. There was something odd about the both of them, and he decided to keep them in the corner of his eye just in case his hunch was correct.</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: scarlet"><b><u>Blaze, Remilia:</u></b><br />
<br />
It was the night of the lunar eclipse(well, it was actually Thursday but I only got around to writing this now, so.....). Blaze was at the Night Club, having left like a shadow from the last time he was here. It was here that he learned that a Woobat might have been telepathically calling out to him through a Vampire Ball. He met Keith and Okiku for the first time however. But, this was going to be a different occasion. <br />
<br />
Blaze's Woobat, Remilia, had told him that he should be ready by 7:00 P.M., but ready for what he was not sure at all. He had only known her for a short while, but he knew immediately that she was one to tease and play with people, manipulating them to her every whim and desire. And being a Psychic Pokemon, Blaze only feared what would happen if she got stronger and could directly manipulate people with her mind. All sorts of bad things could happen. Then there was the fact that she was a vampire Woobat, and so he had to make sure that she didn't bleed him out when he was training her or anything of the sort. He was going to have to keep blood around to, since God forbid he have company over and she were to bite them...that would be most embarrassing and dangerous. From the one bite he had gotten, however, she never took too much blood, and he felt fine afterwards. He just hoped he would never turn into a vampire himself. <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite7" alt=":p" title="Stick Out Tongue    :p" data-shortname=":p" /> <br />
<br />
Blaze was currently looking into an empty shot glass that had once housed Scotch, since he was now in the habit of lying to be able to buy alcohol at places like this. He wasn't an alcoholic, yet, but he wondered if that day would come, especially now that he had a Pokemon who would probably drive him insane in the long run. As he looked in the glass, he noticed something reflected in the bottom of the glass, something small, blue, and very round and circular. He immediately noticed that it was a Woobat, and he knew it wouldn't be just any Woobat, but <i>his</i> Woobat. Fortunately she was still outside, and Blaze rushed out to try and shoo her away from the place, hoping that she wouldn't get in trouble. He bolted through the door, and ran outside to someplace where the owner would not be able to see them, and called Remilia over with his hand. <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing here? Don't you know this place is only for trainers!?&quot; &quot;Well, yes, I did. It is rather discriminatory for an owner of such a fine establishment such as this one to not allow Pokemon inside, especially with such a classy Pokemon like myself.&quot; &quot;Well, the rules are rules unfortunately.&quot; &quot;Oh, come on. You aren't telling me you forgot about our little rendezvous, didn't you?&quot; &quot;Rendezvous? You mean meeting you at seven?&quot; &quot;Yep, seven exactly.&quot; &quot;I was waiting at seven.&quot; &quot;No you weren't. You were here. We were supposed to meet now.&quot; Blaze took his Pokedex out and showed her the time. 9:13 P.M. &quot;Oops, got the wrong time don't I? I'm sorry Blazey-kun.&quot; &quot; 'Blazey-kun'?&quot; &quot;Yep. I think that is what I am going to call you from now on.&quot; &quot;Please don't. It's embarrassing.&quot; &quot;Embarrassing? That's the point!&quot; &quot;You are a pain.&quot; &quot;A pain? That's a little harsh.&quot; <br />
<br />
Remilia looked up now, and squealed with delight. &quot;Wait, Blaze, just one moment.&quot; She brought a suitcase with her, and Blaze was surprised that she was able to lift such a thing with her psychic powers. &quot;Please hold this for me for just one moment.&quot; Blaze grabbed it as she passed it to her, and opened it slightly to see what was inside. He found a dress, colored a faded pink. &quot;Clothes? Remilia, you can't wear clothes!&quot; &quot;Just one moment. Everything should be ready them.&quot; &quot;Ready for what?&quot; Remilia looked at him, and with a glance and a wink, he knew that she wanted to keep it a secret, only if for a little while.Blaze just patiently waited. <br />
<br />
A few minutes went by, and when Blaze looked down on his watch, he saw something eerie reflected in it. It was the moon, but it was a scarlet-red color, not unlike the color of blood. He got scared, thinking Remilia had the ability to change the color of the moon(she doesn't, but nothing was questioned as sane when it came to her), when she became wrapped in a deep red light. Despite the dark color, the light was strong enough that Blaze had to shield his eyes to it, and for a brief moment, he heard nothing. Everything was silent as the scarlet beacon lit and shone. &quot;I've been waiting, Blazey-kun, for a very long time. I wasn't waiting for a trainer who was strong. I wasn't waiting for one who was a great battler, or had 30 Pokemon, or who had gone through troubles but had a strong will because of it. I waited for a trainer who would accept me.......&quot; Blaze was confused for a moment, before the light stopped shining and life returned to this listless night. Blaze looked back up at the moon, still noticing how it was red, before he felt a hand tap his shoulder. He panicked that it was the owner, but suddenly, a female voice was heard. &quot;Blaze, can you hand me that suitcase? I kinda need it right now, since it's cold out. Blaze pushed the suitcase forwards, before it was gripped not by psychic powers, but by human hands. Soft human hands. Blaze looked up and saw a young girl, about his age, with red eyes and short light-blue hair. It barely came down to her shoulder, and Blaze was stunned for a moment. &quot;Is this...Remilia? Is this really her?&quot; That was of course before he was stunned by another fact. She was naked. &quot;AHHHHH I'm so sorry I didn't mean to I mean I couldn't help it but I wasn't staring!&quot; Remilia started to laugh at him, which made him more embarrassed. &quot;Just let me put some clothes on, then you can stare all you like. ;P&quot; &quot;I didn't say I wanted to stare!&quot; &quot;I'm only teasing. God, you are just so easy!&quot; <br />
<br />
Blaze quickly looked away and turned around, blushing as red as a tomato, and soon, Remilia had gotten dressed. &quot;You can turn around now. I'm decent.&quot; Blaze turned around, ans saw that Remilia had put on the clothes in the suitcase. The dress was indeed a faded pink color, and Blaze only guessed that was when she hunted and washed her clothes. There were red ribbons on the sleeves, and a red ribbon typing her waist. She had on a pink mob cap that was tied with a red ribbon with white stripes. Blaze was speechless. She was beautiful. &quot;So, are you going to take me inside, or what? Are we just going to stand out like like a couple of idiots?&quot; &quot;I guess we can take you inside....&quot; Blaze was nervous about this. She wasn't human, that much was for sure. Her red eyes essentially betrayed that fact, but Blaze was concerned if anything saw the whole, Woobat turning into vampire girl, incident. But, he cautiously brought her inside, and seeing as no one was especially suspicious, Remilia just trounced right in there. &quot;This place is so pretty! In a weird kind of tacky flashy way. I wonder why we need so many lights? Dancing is always done better when there is fewer lights on. There is a bar too? Blech! Alcohol tastes like urine to me. Please tell me you don't drink Blaze.&quot; &quot;Uhhh...I don't drink.&quot; Remilia looked at him with a face that saw right through his lie, and said, &quot;You need to learn to lie a little bit better. It's poor taste to lie and be caught easily.&quot; &quot;It's in poor taste to lie period.&quot; &quot;Then why did you?&quot; &quot;Ummm....welll....I guess ummm.....&quot; &quot;Were you afraid of not having my approval? Trust me, whether you drink or not is none of MY concern. After tonight I'll say if you are worthy of keeping me. Now, let's go to a table. I need some tea.&quot; Remilia gripped Blaze by the hand and dragged him to one of the tables by the side. A waiter came over and looked at her, before looking at Blaze, before looking at her. &quot;Your eyes...are those contacts?&quot; &quot;Contacts? Oh dear no.&quot; &quot;Ohh...so you must be an albino. It explains why you are so pale.&quot; &quot;Yeah, an albino. Listen, can I have some thistle tea please? Preferably a teapot full, I need to get my dear friend over here out of his alcoholism.&quot; &quot;I'm not an alcoholic!&quot; &quot;Well, even so, a little alcohol is not good for you.&quot; &quot;Thistle tea? We might have some in the back....&quot; The waiter walked off in a hurry, probably a little scared by Remilia. &quot;Hey Blaze, can I see your arm?&quot; she whispered to me. &quot;My arm? Why?&quot; &quot;Cause I don't think the thistle tea they are going to have would be any good. I am going to need some flavoring.&quot; &quot;Flavoring!?&quot; &quot;I mean, you're not B blood, sure, but you will do just fine.&quot; &quot;Ummm....&quot; &quot;Oh, come on, please?&quot; she said, looking deep into his eyes and using the full effect of her CHARM on him, before he finally relented. &quot;Alright, just be quick about it. I don't want anyone seeing it.&quot; &quot;Aww, thank you Blazey-kun!&quot; The waiter came with the tea some time later, and again left in a hurry. She sipped the tea, before putting it back down. &quot;It's not bad. I'm impressed. I won't be needing your arm after all.&quot; <br />
<br />
Remilia and Blaze sipped the tea together, Blaze remarking on how the tea was pretty good to Remilia. &quot;Trust me, this tea really isn't that great. I have tea much better than this back home...well, best not to be thinking about stuff like that. We should get some people to come over here and talk to us. It would be nice to associate with people.&quot; Remilia stood up out of her chair, and swung her arms up into the air, while yelling &quot;HI EVERYONE!&quot; A swung arm slammed into Blaze's face, and fell straight to the ground, chair and all, groaning. &quot;Oh no! Blazey-kun! What happened!?&quot; &quot;You slammed your arm into my face, I thought I was dead for a minute there!&quot; &quot;Oh, oops. I am a <i>little</i> stronger than most people.&quot; Blaze got up and Remilia looked at his nose. &quot;Be thankful I hit you that way I did, it isn't broken.&quot; Blood was dripping out of is nose, and Remilia got a real wicked smile on her face. &quot;Let me clean that up for you.&quot; she says as she darts her face in, licking the nose with her tongue. The sheer daringness of it shocked him, but the feel of her tongue on his flesh...he jumped away quickly. &quot;No? Alright, let me get you a napkin.&quot; She threw one over to him, which he grabbed and put to his nose. &quot;Well, that should bring some people over.&quot; <br />
<br />
Blaze wondered if he was going to survive the night. </span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: #00FF00"><b>Hyrem, Okiku, Michael, Blaze, Remilia:</b> As Keith and Coselle left for the dance floor, a man with a jacket that had Houndoom horns on its hood approached the group, and Okiku attempted to show the initiative but blurted something out and was trying her best to cover it up. Hyrem had seen this and gracefully stalled for time by asking about Eeveelutions, a thing which the lady seemed grateful for. &quot;I don't know,&quot; said Hyrem as he had reservations about the new evolution for Eevee, &quot;I think I still prefer Espeon and a few other Eeveelutions above Sylveon, though if the rumors are true Sylveon's supposed to be a new type of Pokemon, I think they're calling it Light-type? That'd be cool, though I could also see it being a Flying-type.&quot; Then she introduced herself and Hyrem to the newcomer, who was revealed to be Michael. &quot;Heh, I don't bite either,&quot; Hyrem replied to Michael's comment, &quot;though I can't say the same for some of my Pokemon...&quot; he continued with some embarrassment. &quot;Anyway, nice to meet you, Michael!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then a girl's voice shouting &quot;HI EVERYONE!&quot; got Hyrem's attention, and he turned to see Blaze on the floor with a girl in a pink dress, only slightly older than Hyrem. He didn't exactly see what she did to Blaze when she leaned in close as he got up, though it totally made the older kid uncomfortable ... probably best left to the imagination, then. Hyrem did want to meet this mysterious friend of Blaze's, however, so he went over to check on his friend. &quot;Hey, Blaze, I saw what happened ... you okay? And who's she, a friend of yours?&quot; he asked with curiosity. If Sera were here, she'd <i>very</i> likely be sending red colors to Hyrem's mind as a warning about this girl, but since his Kirlia wasn't he was none the wiser...</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: scarlet"><b><u>Hyrem, Blaze, Remilia</u></b><br />
<br />
Blaze saw that Hyrem has seen when Remilia had accidentally(though Blaze was not truly sure that it was an accident that he go hit in the face like that), and when Hyrem came over and asked if Blaze was okay, Blaze was a little embarrassed. &quot;Yeah, Hyrem, actually it wasn't that bad. She did a number to my nose, but it is doing better now.&quot; Hyrem then asked who Remilia was, and to this, Blaze really did not have an answer to that. How was he going to explain it to Hyrem? That Remilia was really a Woobat but she can turn into a vampire girl whenever she wants? Hyrem would probably think he was crazy. Or maybe he would just believe him and be on with it. Blaze truly didn't know. But, it would not hurt to try. &quot;See, her name is Remilia, and she really is....PSWHMSPHW!&quot; Blaze said before Remilia put a hand over his mouth, covering it astutely with her small hand. She was strong alright, as blaze could not get his mouth open not matter how hard she tried. Remilia looked right into Hyrem's eyes with her red ones, and Blaze noticed they were like small rubies almost. They were...pretty. &quot;Yep, my name Remilia. Remilia Scarlet. It is quite nice to meet you Hyrem. I guess you could say I'm Blaze's friend, but for tonight, I think Blaze's date is more appropriate.&quot; Blaze began to yell out through her hand, before she finally relented and let him go. &quot;I never said I was your date!&quot; &quot;Well, we are together. We met for a rendezvous. We are having a good time. Aren't we not each others dates?&quot; &quot;NO! We are not involved romantically!&quot; Remilia looked kind of forlorn when he said that. &quot;Why is that? Do you not want to?&quot; Remilia looked up at Blaze with her FAKE TEARS, though Blaze did not know this, and Blaze looked away, guiltily. &quot;Well, I never said I didn't want to. I just don't think it is appropiate...&quot; &quot;Appropiate? That's a weird way of saying you don't like me.&quot; &quot;I never said that! I kinda...&quot; &quot;Kinda?&quot; &quot;Well, yes, I like you. You are crazy and a pain, but a sweet one at that.&quot; &quot;Aww! Thanks Blazey-kun! I was hoping it wasn't because of anything I did.&quot; Remilia went straight up to Hyrem then, her face beaming with happiness, before firmly clasping his hand in her own and shaking up and down. &quot;It is very nice to meet you. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, if you don't mind...&quot; she says as she yanks on Hyrem's arm. Blaze nearly died then of paleness, because he swore Hyrem's feet went off the ground when she did it. She brought the arm up to her mouth, and bit into it, sucking a little bit of Hyrem's blood before letting go. She didn't swallow, but merely turned around and motioned Blaze to give her the tea. He grabbed the teacup quickly and handed it to her, before she spit out the blood into the tea, and put it back onto the table. &quot;Pleh! That blood tasted nasty. Are you sure you are not anemic Hyrem? I've had the blood of an anemic kid before and it was terrible. You should probably try eating more meats.&quot; &quot;REMILIA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot; Blaze yelled. &quot;What Blaze? There is no need to be so loud all the time.&quot; &quot;You..you..you bit him!?&quot; &quot;Yeah, and I bit you the point?&quot; &quot;Well, won't we like turn into vampires or something?&quot; Remilia just looked at Blaze, before laughing her head off. &quot;No you dunce. In order to make new vampires you need to drain a human dry of blood. A small bite by a small girl like me won't cause you to turn into a vampire!&quot; She continued laughing, and Blaze walked over to Hyrem as Remila sat down. &quot;Sorry about that. She's a nice person, I think, but she takes...getting used to. She doesn't seem to have manners or a sense of social skills. It's almost like she is a kid.&quot; Remilia looked over and frowned. &quot;Come on you two, sit down, I'm sure we will have much to talk about! Hyrem, what Pokemon do you have as a trainer?&quot; </span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: darkslategrey"><span style="font-size: 9px"><b>Hyrem, Okiku, Michael, Blaze, Remilia, Jakken:</b> Michael couldn’t help but glare at this young girl as she shouted out to the entirety of the nightclub. Normally one of her kind would be hiding from attention, and for some reason she was drawing it to her. The trainer chuckled slightly as Hyrem noted that he did not bite either, and let out a rather snarky “Yes, well I can think of one person who does...”<br />
<br />
At that moment he noticed a younger trainer at the doorway, with a Zubat flitting above his head. The trainer seemed to be having trouble with the bouncers, who were only doing their job. Michael stood up immediately, turning to Okiku, as Hyrem was obviously entranced by this other girl, and stating “I’ll be right back.” as he made his way over to the bouncers and the boy there with them.<br />
<br />
The moment he arrived he noticed there was clearly something wrong with the trainer, and assumed his Zubat was a seeing eye dog of sorts. Not even bothering to explain anything to the bouncers, Michael grabbed the young boy by the arm and began dragging him into the nightclub, signaling for the Zubat to follow. As the bouncers protested he flashed a wad of cash beneath his sleeve, making sure not to let the Zubat sense it... he didn’t want anyone knowing he was playing the staff to his advantage.<br />
<br />
“The name’s Michael,” he explained to the trainer as he escorted him inside, “feel free to join me at the little group over there.” Raising a finger instead of his entire arm, to see how well he could see with his Zubat leading him about... and how useful he’d be in the coming hours.<br />
<br />
With that, Michael let the boy go, and before heading back to the group, he decided to grab a bottle off of the bar, only to catch the sight of Hyrem being bitten out of the corner of his eye. He quickly ripped the silver chain with a solid silver Zubat hanging from it off of his pant leg and rushed over as Blaze finished arguing with the girl, smacking the teacup full of blood to the ground and shoving the silver Zubat in the girl’s face. “I don’t know who you are, but I think you’ve made it plenty clear what you are, so I suggest you sit down and drink like everyone else here is doing or there’s going to be a serious problem.” And with that he shoved the bottle he had taken off of the bar into the girl’s hands. “Dark beer. High in iron. Should suit your tastes.” Just as he was about to walk away in a huff, he threw the silver chain at Blaze. “Keep your monster in line, will you?”<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath before planting himself firmly back into his seat, Michael knew his work was far from done as he glanced out at the couple dancing in the nightclub, and decided he needed a closer look at them to determine how harmful they could be. A quick glance around revealed Okiku to be the only girl in the area, other than the beast he had just dealt with, and plenty intoxicated to hopefully not realize why Michael was asking what he was as he spoke up to her. “Care for a dance?”</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: #BEA3D2"><span style="font-size: 9px"><b>Hyrem, Okiku, Michael, Blaze, Remilia, Jakken, Keith, Coselle</b>: Coselle rests her head on Keith's shoulder as they dance, swaying softly to the rhythm of the music that surrounds them. So close that she can feel his heart beat against her chest... Even though he was a quarter Gastly, he was still very much alive, and it was in moments like this where she was painfully reminded of the divide that still existed between them. Her own heart, a mere illusion, was too soft to even hear in the midst of all the noise, and Coselle wondered if it even made a sound at this point. But it was no use to dwell on these matters... better to live in the moment, and enjoy the time she had with the one she loved.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keith...&quot; Coselle begins, her eyes glistening with emotion, before the sudden, cheerful cry of a young woman startles Coselle into an alert position, her head lifting away from Keith's shoulder and in the direction of the noise. &quot;What the Hell was that?&quot; She starts, her expression shifting to that of concern. Her eyes focus in on blaze's date, who immediately gives Coselle a strange vibe. It wasn't just the red eyes and pale hair... No, there was decidedly something <i>odd</i> about this girl's aura that deserved investigating. Turning to her beloved, she gently squeezes his shoulders and gives him a flirtatious smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I'll be right back, okay?&quot; She gives him a wink before pulling away, walking quickly towards the Pub... Just in time to see a rather interesting scene. Hyrem, his arm covered in blood, which presumably was the substance that lightly traced Remilia's mouth. Indeed, the bite marks on Hyrem's arm matched the young lady's petite mouth... Which happened to be face to face with a solid silver Zubat, held close to her by an angry Michael. The Houndoom-horned trainer admonishes the vampiress, letting her know that if she continues to drink the blood of others, there will be some serious problems. He suggests dark beer for the young woman, which causes Coselle to shake her head. She couldn't picture a young lady like this one drinking Guinness... Though Marion's tastes in alcohol were rather masculine given her looks, so one never could tell. That said... were this lass to go after her own beloved's blood, she imagined that her fate would be far worse than having a silver Zubat waved in her face. Perhaps it would be best to keep an eye on her.<br />
<br />
As Michael tells Blaze to &quot;keep his monster in line&quot; before storming off in Okiku's direction, Coselle takes a careful look at the expression of each trainer present with her curious eyes, crossing her arms with a small smirk on her face. &quot;Anyone care to tell me what's going on,&quot; she asks as seriously as she can, though the slightest hint of amusement can be heard in Coselle's voice.</span></span></div>
