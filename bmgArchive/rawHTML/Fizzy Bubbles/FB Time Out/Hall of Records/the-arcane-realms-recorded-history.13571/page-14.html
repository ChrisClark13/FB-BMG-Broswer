<span style="color: limegreen">Although you were glad that Teddiursa had accepted your challenge for a battle, your Shroomish was far from feeling the same emotion as his face was sliced into. He tumbled backwards and the look of shock was replaced by anger at the premature hit. He looked up to you hoping you’d back him up but being realistic and far sterner than he’d like you reminded Fungi that he was in a battle and really he should expect assaults like that. Thinking over Fungi’s weakness’ you sought a way to overcome them; he was for instance quite a slow mover and maybe playing the defence game would be best. It doesn’t take you long to come up with a plan of action and Fungi now with his orders the two of you waited. Teddiursa waited too wondering what you were planning; it had seen you battle that fierce Beedrill and knew that you trained your Pokemon well. Although Fungi had taken the hit from its Scratch unknowingly didn’t bring down the bear’s guard, it knew not to underestimate its opponent. As both Pokemon stared each other down Teddy’s eyes glowed a deep red startling Fungi who didn’t know what to do anymore, unnerved by the <b>Leer</b>. Teddiursa ran forward and <b>Scratched</b> Fungi again making it begin to really hurt. Now with two sets of claw marks across its face Fungi angrily <b>Absorb</b>ed some health and energy back from the Teddy who winced in response. Both began their stare down again waiting for the other to make the next move.<br />

Wes stared intently at the two Pokémon – trying his best to see who was worse off. He clutched the empty Pokeball again, considering the “coolest” way to throw it when the time came.“Ok Fungi, I don’t know what moves you’ve got yet so let’s keep using Absorb”, he commanded reluctantly - he was hoping for a larger choice of moves - maybe Shroomish had other attacks... He pulled out his Pokedex, which was now more wisely placed in his pocket, and scanned the mushroom Pokémon. A page of comprehensive statistical numbers and information appeared in front of him. “This stuff can’t help me!” He said whilst franticly scrolling down, “Ah, moves...” According to the Pokedex, Fungi knew two attacks: Absorb and Seed Bomb. “Seed Bomb eh?” Wes was curios to try out this knew attack “Use Seed Bomb Fungi!”</span></span></div>

Running after the cheeky Banette Squirt and Cacnea in tow you finally catch up to it to find it finishing off your meal. You yell out at it and it turned to face you a grin on its zipper mouth as it took in your haggard appearance. You wonder how you could get even with the naughty Pokemon before you smirk as you come up with an idea. You offer it up a battle eager to blow off some steam and Banette resists the urge to laugh not at all threatened by your challenge. It floated around the statue that houses a version of itself and seemed to think over your proposal whilst playing with its hands. It seemed to grow serious for a moment, but only a moment before it floated out and stopping right in front of you face making you lean back uncomfortably. It tilted its head studying you and you feel like its eyes are boring into your soul before it floats away and nods its head sticking out its tongue and putting its hands on its arms. It seemed quite full of confidence that it would win. Raising its arms above its head the village around suddenly came to life and the buildings returned to their former glory, people milling around before it all melted back to the ruins that remained today. Banette grinned at you, it seems like it’s offered you a reward if you win this battle.</span></span>

Tim became determined to defeat this Banette. &quot;Screw the lunch! I want to see the village!&quot;, Tim declared. -GRUMBLE- Tim's stomach growled but Tim wasn't concerned with that now. Then it hit Tim, maybe he's not strong enough to face Banette. His face began to show doubt. Squirt noticed and was a bit pissed off by it. The Big Jaw pokemon, Totodile, then shot water at Tim to snap him out of his doubts. &quot;Gurgle!&quot; was all Tim could say with the water his his face. When Squirt ceased fire, Tim got on his feet. With his confidence back up knowing he's supported by his friend, Tim shouted with a determined tone, &quot;GO SQUIRT!

<b>Furrett</b> ~ Running through the varying emotions filling your soul you observe as each Pokemon takes their last stand hoping to take down the other. You feel immensely proud of how Omega had fared overcoming his fear to take on this challenge and never backing down; you make a resolution to reward Omega for all his hard work after this battle. Tearing your thoughts away from yourself you concentrate on the last leg of the battle and decide upon a final charge, an all out assault in the hopes Omega’s strength would pull through. Yelling your orders to Omega you will him on to victory, your Sentret empowered by your confidence in him. Omega turned back to battle and charged at Natu who leapt at Omega both unleashing their attacks at the same time leaving more welts on each other’s bodies. Natu leapt back and <b>Leer</b>ed at Omega hoping to get the upper edge before it finished him off but Omega surprised you both. Fueled by a need to prove himself Omega leapt straight through the un-nerving glare and slashed at the tiny bird two more times making it topple back and flop to the ground unconscious. <b>Level Up for Omega</b>. Omega tiredly turns back to you a proud smile on his furry little face at his victory. You grin back and yell in joy at your first ever victory together. Just as you finish off celebrating Omega looks over your shoulder suddenly a ghastly white as he hides behind you. Turning around you see what has him so spooked and are shocked to see a faint image of an old woman hovering over a small gravestone smiling at you.<br />
<br />
“That was a wonderful battle you man, I haven’t had the chance to see a battle like that in a long time,” she echoed in an eerie voice. Well you did come to the Graveyard to find ghosts, it appears you’ve found your first. </span> </span>

Thinking of team members, he dropped a pokeball from his belt to the ground releasing his Kecleon, Seldon. She had a ridiculous smile plastered across her face, and fidgeted frequently.<br />
<br />
“Keeeeeeh-cha!”<br />
<br />
Omega glanced over at the hyper-as-ever Seldon, shaking his head slowly, as if he were an adult judging a silly child.<br />
<br />
Then the astral woman appeared, hovering there above her choice gravestone. Potato shook inwardly, but was too prideful to let it show. Especially sinse he had come here for ghosts. It would be too embarising. Why was he being such a baby?<br />
<br />
&quot;I… I…. Thank you. It was mainly Omega, though. I didn’t have to do much… It was our first battle…” <br />
<br />
Potato looked down and kicked the ground with his left boot, unsure what to do. Seldon had either not noticed or didn’t care about the spirit, as he continued to restrain himself from bouncing all over the graveyard.</span></span></div>

<b>Concore</b> ~ Sitting down you’re drawn to the young girl sat next to you silently sobbing over the loss of something called Crystal. She hasn’t noticed your presence yet and Spector is in his own world splashing about in the fountain happily cooling off. You get up off your seat and kneel down in front of Caitlin and she stops crying to look up at you rubbing her brown eyes clear of tears. You ask her to tell you about Crystal and she tilts her head inquisitively still hiccupping every now and then as a stray tear falls from her eyes. You explain that you overheard her asking the boy if he had seen her and saw her upset and wanted to help. She fished about in her pocket and after a few second retrieved a photograph handing it to you. Within the picture is her dressed in yellow dungarees holding a small blue Wynaut close to her chest; both Pokemon and child look so happy to just be with one-another. It’s clear to see why she kept such a photo.<br />
<br />
“Crystal is my Wynaut. She was my first Pokemon, she’s my only Pokemon. I found an egg beneath the large oak tree just outside the town and took it home with me. After a while Crystal hatched and we’ve been together forever. She’s my best friend but … but ….” She says as emotions overcome her again and she cries a little more.<br />
<br />
“She’s gone. I woke up this morning and she wasn’t in her bed next to mine. I thought maybe she had gotten up early for breakfast but Daddy say’s he hadn’t seen her. I’ve been looking for her all morning and can’t find her anywhere. Daddy’s at work and can’t help me look. It’s not like her to just run off; she’s really shy around strangers. Maybe … maybe she doesn’t want to be my friend anymore…” Caitlin finished her wide eyes full of sorrow. You assure her that wouldn’t be the case since they had grown up together. You could tell from the photo that they were close. You ask if she’s searched everywhere and Caitlin nods before looking a little worried.<br />
<br />
“Well there is one place I haven’t looked but daddy says kids shouldn’t go there and Crystal wouldn’t go somewhere so scary,” she said biting her lip. “At the end of town there is this really long street that’s always dark. Daddy says bad people and bad Pokemon live there everyone knows to keep away. I haven’t looked there because I was scared but …” she says looking to you with hope. “You’re a grown up, you wouldn’t be scared of a dark street. Would you go there with me? You could keep me safe with your Pokemon,” she said looking around for a Pokemon that might be yours.</span></span>

<br />
<span style="color: LemonChiffon"><span style="font-size: 9px">“Wynaut, Wynaut, Wynaut, Wynaut,..” Verne racked his head, trying to visually the Pokémon, he had heard that name before but just couldn’t picture it, “Wyn-, Ah yes!, now I remember, I met a old man with one back in Lavaridge when I was travelling across the Hoenn region, good times” he recollected to himself, before snapping out of his daydream to realize where he was and what he was doing!, “Sorry about that, yes, your Wynaut, some Psychic Pokémon can get headaches, and can disappear for a couple of hours, many a time have I woken up to find Drowzee has been up at the crack of dawn and that he'd been out for a stroll, I think it’s a way for them to clear their heads, their mental abilities must be a strain on them” Verne explained, “I expect that’s what little old Crystal is up too, I can’t see her running off from someone who clearly loves her very much”.<br />
<br />
Verne agreed that he would help with Caitlin’s search, “Both Spector and me could do with the adventure, and this dark part of town sounds intriguing”. “If you’re ready Caitlin, we can set off right now?” he said standing to his feet. Although teary-eyed, Caitlin clearly had puzzled expression on her face. “O right, he’s over there” as Verne pointed to the fountain, he stuck two finger in his mouth and whistled towards the fountain.<br />
<br />
Spector, who was at this point floating on his back with his hand resting on his stomach in the fountain, heard the whistle, and recognised it as Verne's, he strained his head up out of the water out of curiosity, noticed Verne collecting his backpack to set off, and waded out of the fountain.</span></span></div>

<b>empoleon dynamite</b> ~ This battle had only just begun but both Pokemon were already showing the effects. Teddiursa was already injured and the few attacks it was receiving were sapping the last of its health. Fungi however had taken multiple hits and was looking worn. You seemed pensive as you pondered over what moves Fungi could use, well there were only 2 available to you so your choices were a little limited. Your pokedex scanned your Shroomish speaking in a dull monotonous tone as it listed his attacks strengths weaknesses level etc… Looking at the figures on the device made your head spin and you decide to put it away before you get a headache. You knew what attacks to use and gave Fungi his next orders as Teddiursa got its breath back. Fungi drew yet more energy and health from Teddiursa in another <b>Absorb</b> that healed a little more of his injuries and damaging the teddy in the process. Teddiursa sat down as its bottom lip wobbled and started to sob uncontrollably. This had both you and Fungi regretting your last move and Fungi winced, he knew it was a battle but he didn’t know it would upset the injured Ted than much. He approached the Teddiursa wondering whether apologising would be a good idea right now when the illusive Teddy leapt up and <b>Lick</b>ed Fungi across his face making him wince and stumble back. That was so gross and really stung but fortunately he didn’t seem to be paralysed. That crafty bear, it had caught you both with its <b>Fake Tears</b>. Fungi fuelled by anger produced a seed from the top of his head fuelling grass energy into it making it glow a bright green. Teddiursa looked apprehensive and backed up never seeing such an attack before. Fungi twist around and released his seed which flew straight at Teddiursa who tried to dodge but was caught on its side throwing it through the air as the seed exploded on contact. Once the dirt had fallen Teddiursa could be seen lying on the ground. It got back to its feet but wobbled unsteadily. It was covered in a large bruise and multiple scratches. It wouldn’t take much now to finish it off.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Pyschopath</b> ~ Although you looked close to winning this battle the repercussions had not escaped you. This battle had taken its toll on both Pokemon involved and both were nursing their own injuries but willing to fight to the finish. You eye Pachirisu with concern and guilt that ate away at you. You tell it that you do not wish to kill it or cause it any real permanent injuries. Pachirisu looked up at you believing what you said but still with an angry look across its face. Your promises to take of it fall on deaf ears as it turns its head away, this squirrel was a proud creature and losing the battle would wound its pride. You berate yourself for forgetting your food supply, you wouldn’t have gotten into this situation had you remembered. You have to finish off this battle and would deal with your guilt and remorse later. You ask Freeze to attack one last time if able. He nods his head and glows a deep red ready to <b>Counter</b> any attack. Pachirisu looked up and got to its feet holding onto the tree for support. It stumbled forward and sighed before giving a pitiful <b>Growl</b>. Freeze halted his charge and looked to you; it seemed that Pachirisu was out of energy to attack. With only one option left Freeze ran forward with the last of his energy and threw a nice right hook laced with ice energy at the squirrel that knocked it back down to the ground KOed. <b>Level up for Freeze</b>. You threw your Pokeball at the downed Pokemon watching as it converted its form to red light and promptly sucked it inside. It wobbled for a mere 2 seconds before a ‘ding’ sounded signifying capture. <b>Congratulations. You have captured a Level 05, Female Pachirisu</b>. Freeze walked over to you trying to gauge your reaction to your first ever victory and first ever capture. Pachirisu put up a great fight and would surely make a strong addition to your team. What you’re going to do next and question you really want answered was were you going to get along with your new team-mate? </span><br />

<b>RaunchyFad</b> ~ You looked aghast as Rocky lay asleep on the ground as the proud Purugly loomed over her. Okay. Now what were you going to do? You really needed to wake Rocky up and soon before Purugly struck again. Looking down at the Meowth before you, you ask it if it be willing to participate in the battle on Rocky’s behalf. The Meowth looked absolutely petrified at the thought of battling the fat cat and backed away trying to get to safe distance from both the cat and yourself who had obviously gone mad. Too tired to argue with the little kitty you glance over to Rocky who was still happily asleep. Maybe you could attack it yourself, but we all know what happened last time you got near that thing. You urge Rocky to wake up seeing as this was your only option now and sigh dejectedly as she remained slumbering. Purugly pulled back a meaty limb and swatted Rocky with it in a <b>Scratch</b> attack that made Rocky roll and hit the wall. It watched carefully as she came to a stop a wince on her face but still asleep. A large grin came across its fat face as stalked her getting close before throwing fast paced limbs in succession in a vicious <b>Fury Swipes</b> attack that had Rocky covered in nasty scratches. You felt like you were gonna lose that half-croissant you ate earlier as you saw your Pokemon brutalised by this bully. The assault seemed never ending and holding back tears you wonder how you were going to save your Pokemon from death as it would seem impossible right now. Suddenly you hear a screech and see Purugly pull back trying to claw at something on its head. Looking closely you could see Meowth clinging onto the fat cat for dear life having caused the distraction. It gulped but opened its mouth wide and bit down on Purugly’s neck making it howl in pain at the nasty attack to the soft area. All its bucking threw Meowth off onto the ground and in front of Rocky. It looked behind it to see your injured Pokemon and seemed angered before turning to face the behemoth approaching it with a furious look on its face. Meowth shaking quickly swiped its claws across the monsters face in a <b>Scratch</b> attack of its own that left a few small cuts. Purgly hissed in rage and Meowth shaking like a leaf was left wondering if it had signed its own death warrant. <br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Concore</b> ~ You listened to the girls sorrowful story as she tried to stop her tears to no avail. You wracked your brain for information on the Pokemon she mentioned, a Wynaut you had heard of them before. Suddenly as it hits you, you reminisce on the memory smiling at the good times you had. Brought back to reality by the girl’s confused look you smile gently at her and give a possible explanation for Wynaut’s disappearance relating back to experiences you had had with your own Psychic Pokemon. Caitlin sniffed and dried her tears on the sleeve of her top as she contemplated your words.<br />
<br />
“You really think that could be what happened?” she asked with a little hope lining her tone of voice. You nod your head and she perks up a little. “Maybe … maybe Crystal got lost when she went for a walk then and … she really does love me too?” she asked looking for you like you had the answer to that question. Not wanting to further damage the young girl’s already frazzled emotions you agree and she gives you her first smile which only widens when you agree to help her search for Crystal. You beckon over Spector who stops his lazy swimming to wade over to you both. Caitlin smiles at the Drowsee and says ‘Hello’ feeling more comfortable with another Psychic Pokemon trainer. <br />
<br />
“The street is at the far end of town over there,” she says pointing. “I’ll show you the way,” she said walking ahead while you and Spector follow behind. As you walk through the streets and near your destination you notice how quiet your surroundings become with less and less people milling around compared to the centre of town. You must have been walking for a good 30 minutes when Caitlin stops her gaze set on a dark street in the distance.<br />
<br />
“Its over there, we should be really careful. Daddy says I should never come here and I don’t want to but if Crystal is in there somewhere I have to be brave; and you’ll both protect me,” she says sounding confident of that last statement that had you a little worried.<br />
<br />
Taking point you enter the darkened street with Caitlin behind you and Spector bringing up the rear. You see that the few shops dotted here deal in rather weird and illegal produce and most are covered with thick bars and doors with slide-slots to only allow access to the right people. You walk past a pair of Raticate that hiss at you angrily with their rabid red eyes eying your flesh and a man sat outside a decrepit house grinning at you maliciously. Picking up the pace you hear a set of loud voices coming from inside a small warehouse. You think nothing of it but hear the mention of rare Pokemon and find your intrigue peaked. You motion for Caitlin to follow which she does keeping very close to you as walk down an alley to the back of the warehouse. Stopping outside a window you can hear several voices deep in conversation.<br />
<br />
“I found it wandering the streets this morning, pretty little thing isn’t it,” one voice said and you could almost feel the leer of his gaze from the tone alone.<br />
<br />
“It is a rare little sell you’ve found there, will fetch a good price at the Black Market for sure,” another said with admiration.<br />
<br />
“What can I say, I always get the best merchandise,” he says chuckling in a deep voice.<br />
A soft voice whines and is followed by the sound of a cane hitting flesh and a squeal of pain.<br />
<br />
“Stop whimpering, we’ll find you a nice owner soon enough,” the man says laughing.<br />
<br />
Whatever’s going on in there it doesn’t sound very legal, maybe you’ve stumbled on to what you were searching for but you have no idea of what is lurking inside that warehouse waiting for you.</span> <br />

<b>Furrett</b> ~ Hugging Sentret close to your body you congratulated him on his win and celebrated loudly in the silent Cemetery. With one free arm you manage to grasp an empty Pokeball from your bag and throw it at the downed Natu hoping to add a new member to your team. As the ball drew Natu inside you released your spunky Kecleon Seldon who grinned and gave a wild yell. You hear a soft ding and look over to your now full Pokeball; <b>congratulations you have captured a Level 05, Male Natu</b>. Upon seeing Omega’s change in demeanour you turn around to see the spectre of an old woman smiling at you and praising you for your well fought battle. You shake a little in fear, although you had come to the Cemetery to find ghosts this was not the kind you were thinking of. Finding your voice you thank her for her praise but put the victory down to your hardworking Sentret who, although a little nervous, smiled proudly. The old woman chuckled to herself and spoke again.<br />
<br />
“Your first battle will always be your most memorable and I thank you for sharing that with me young man. Both trainer and Pokemon work together to overcome the odds and you beat a tough opponent in Natu.” She said and you feel a little more at ease the more she talks to you, she seems to mean you no harm.<br />
<br />
“Natu has been alone in this Cemetery for a long time now, its good to see that he will finally have some company. You shouldn’t spend you entire life with the dead.” She said cryptically. <br />
<br />
“Could you possibly do this old woman a favour? Would you take Natu to the tomb at the centre of the Cemetery, he had some family there I know would want to say goodbye and I’m sure they would want to see his new trainer,” she said pointing in the direction of the tomb. </span><br />

<b>Music Box </b> ~ You can’t contain your excitement at seeing the mysterious village in all its glory, if only for a few seconds. Now you were more than determined to defeat this Banette if only to learn more about this village. Suddenly as it hits you, this Banette is not only an evolved Pokemon but seems quite old, it must be strong how were you going to win? Your face falls and doubt lines your features as you hesitate. Banette waits to see what you’ll do a small smile on its zipper mouth. Totodile wasn’t too pleased by your show of weakness and glared before shooting a jet of water at your face shocking you and making you choke. As the stream ended you felt somehow revitalised if not a little wet and leapt to your feet with renewed confidence. Alright now you were ready to battle and Banette seemed pleased by this. <br />
<br />
Shouting out your orders to Squirt who’s ears were ringing, he was close enough to hear you talk normally he focused on his ghostly opponent. Setting his gaze on Banette he gave it a vicious <b>Leer</b> that made Banette hesitate for a moment before leaping at it and swiping a claw … right though it! Squirt landed back on his feet and looked alarmed, his Scratch had no effect. Banette rolled its eyes at the amateur mistake and darted forward knocking into Squirt and pushing him back, fortunately he wasn’t holding anything so he didn’t lose an item with that <b>Knock Off</b>. Squirt feeling embarrassed by his previous mistake let loose a powerful stream of water that caught Banette flush on its side throwing it into and through the pedestal. Banette seemed shocked by the use of such a powerful move and grinned; maybe you weren’t such pushovers after all. It shook the water off and stretched its spectral muscles before its eyes glowed a deep purple and dark bolts of energy arced through the air smacking into Squirt with a crack and slamming him into the ground. That was a harsh <b>Nightshade</b> that left Squirt smarting. You were going to have to think of a good strategy to beat this experienced ghost.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Artifical Dragon</b> ~ You were finding a new admiration for this little Baltoy as you progressed deeper into battle. It certainly had some tricks and was keeping you both on your toes. An idea popped into your mind, what if you caught Baltoy, would it show you the way to one of these fabled villages? It was certainly an option worth considering. Igneous didn’t seem to share your sentiments of Baltoy and was getting frustrated with his lack of success so far. You had to think deeply over your next set of orders as Baltoy seemed to have a counter for everything. Since the little doll had managed to elude the smokescreen and counter the leer maybe straight tackles were your best option and noted how Igneous would be happier to just pummel his opponent. It did seem to lack finesse but what the hell it was worth a shot.<br />
<br />
With the orders to Tackle three times Igneous set to work straight away charging right for Baltoy as it once again <b>Hardened</b> lessening the blow, but taking the damage non-the-less. Baltoy spun around looking a little worn now, the repeated attacks were wearing it down. Igneous ran forth again and leapt for another <b>Tackle</b> to be met a <b>Rapid Spin</b> in return both attacks throwing each Pokemon into the air. Baltoy was the first to recover and its eyes glowed pink as it fired a wave of <b>Confusion</b> at Igneous that caught him during his charge for his last attack and made him stumble and fall to the sand. Both Pokemon are feeling the heat and are worn from repeated attacks from the other with Baltoy suffering energy depletion greater than Igneous. It was a question of who was going to give first. </span><br />

<b>Fishyfool</b> ~ Well you were right after all, you had made a mistake. Several of the orbs turned a dirty red colour signifying your errors and Volcape looked disappointed. Sighing you remind yourself that you were expecting this after all and there was not quicksand this time, that was a plus. Now to fix the mistakes and hopefully progress through to the next room. There weren’t too many errors and you were thankful for that and started to wrack your brains for the solution to this puzzle. Your first thought that was Fire obviously wasn’t meant to be on the Bug pedestal and removed it before placing it on the Steel Pedestal watching as it turned back to its clear vibrant red colour; that was a good sign. Now you knew that Ice was strong against dragon types but it wasn’t right for this puzzle, was there another weakness? Slapping yourself in the face you realise your mistake before pulling the Ice orb off and replacing it with the Dragon orb which turned a lovely royal blue. With the Ice orb in hand you placed it on the Flying pedestal and the orb returned to its cyan colour. So far so good! Now it seemed to all come together as you tied the strengths and weaknesses together. You placed the Fighting orb on the Rock Pedestal and saw from the corner of your eye that it turned back to its red-brown colour before placing the last orb, the Rock orb on the Bug pedestal all the dirty red colours removed. Turning back to the door you see the Normal orb change to a bright white colour as it locked in place. The Rock shield shook before cracks emerged throughout making it shatter and fall to the ground the Normal orb rolling out and landing by your feet. <br />

With your new route clear you walk on through this time in a passageway with tiny pink lights on the walls dancing too and fro. Volcape kept close to you unnerved by the dancing lights as you reached the next room, one that seemed to reach towards heaven; you couldn’t even see the ceiling! At the far end of the room lay another pedestal made of marble with a small chest sat atop adorned with pink and white stones. You can’t contain your excitement at finding the treasure you were searching for that you rush forward only to hit an energy barrier of some sort that throws you back onto the ground. You can see a plaque with writing on just before the barrier and still on the ground read what it says.<br />
<br />
“The final test waits<br />
For if you wish to obtain the treasure<br />
A guardian you must defeat,”<br />
<br />
As you finish reading the plaque a monotonous sound echoes behind you and you turn to see a creature floating right behind you. The Lunatone’s eye’s glow and it makes a whirring sound before charging at you making you dive out of the way. Now between you and the treasure it seems that Lunatone is the guardian you must defeat. </span><br />

<b>Kasai</b> ~ As the ranger winked at you and walked off into another room you look down to the sleeping Swinub in your arm, stroking its soft warm fur. You reminisce on the Piloswine at your own home and it doesn’t take you long to make a decision. Plucking a Pokeball from your bag you enlarge it and roll it in your hands for a moment. Swinub stirs from the movement and looks up to you before spotting the device in your hands. It seems to smile at you and at you offer of travelling with you nudges the ball with its nose, sucking the tiny pig inside. It doesn’t wobble at all and the red light on the centre fades to white. <b>Congratulations. You have captured a Level 04 Male Swinub</b>. Both Harumi and Phoebe seem delighted by the new addition to your team and you grin elated that it had chosen to you join you. The ranger walks back in with a cup of hot chocolate and marshmallows for you and spots the Pokeball in your hand and Swinub nowhere to be seen.<br />
<br />
Smiling he sat next you handing you a drink. “You take care of Swinub now, it’ll take a while for it to heal but then it’ll be up for training. Let you grow to be close friends like you have with you other Pokemon.” He said toasting you with his own cup. <br />
<br />
“You’re free to stay here as long as you like before you set off again. You trainers do like to travel so much, its inspiring,” he said chuckling.<br />
<br />
<i>With Swinub’s capture you’ve unlocked your rights to the Egg House and are hereby released from the Arcane Realm. Upon replying to this update you’re free to post in the mainstream zones (I know they’re currently un-manned but something is being worked out so fear not).

<b>Lemon~Lime</b> ~ With that attempt not working out quite like you planned you were going to have to think up a new strategy to beat this dark beastie. Scorpio was a little shaken by the frightening Sableye and the way it looked at him like dinner. Caught by a sudden idea you try to hide your grin and hope that this will pan out. You tell Scorpio to grab some gems on the wall where you were pointing and to follow you to the entrance of the mine where you’d be waiting. Throwing in a quick barb about the gremlin failing its job made it hiss in anger. It eyed up Scorpio pulling at the mine wall before flying out towards the exit. Although Sableye knew this mine very well it still seemed hesitant, what if that Gligar had spotted something it had missed. Not wanting to take a chance it ran after the pair of you and you grin at your success, now to see if the attack worked. You stood by the entrance of the mine in the light as Scorpio followed you. Sableye ran behind gaining on him and its eyes glowed a dark purple before bolts of energy shot forward and struck Scorpio making him yell and fall to the ground. Sableye ran up to Scorpio but slowed down as it approached the light, it had spent so long in darkness that the light scared it. It hissed and walked into the light its eyes dazzled by its brightness and Scorpio took its shot firing a wave of <b>Poison Stings</b> at it. Sableye cried out as it stumbled back into the darkness with barbs stuck in its skin. Daring to walk forward again it was met by another wave of <b>Poison Stings</b> that made it retreat again. It shuddered as poison began to seep into its body from the repeated attacks. Its gaze softened a little before it gave an almighty roar and leapt forward into the light dodging the last wave of barbs and striking Scorpio with a swift <b>Scratch</b>. Now both Pokemon were in the light and Sableye who was suffering from poison didn’t seem to care. It was going to any lengths to prevent you stealing any gems from the mine. </span></span></div>

&quot;I think I'll call you Memory,&quot; Kasai spoke softly, holding the Pokéball. She never knew how anything could fit inside. How amazing.<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Kasai replied to the ranger, sipping her drink. She thought about what had happened today. Certainly not what she had expected. Kasai had never noticed how cute swinub were, although she did remember when her father's piloswine was pregnant. That was certainly not expected. Baby swinub running all over the house... in her clothes, too. Kasai remembered the day at school when she found a swinub in her sweater. Everyone laughed so hard... Now, here she was, with her first caught Pokémon. How exciting it was for her.<br />
Kasai thanked the ranger once again and picked up her turquoise torchic. <i>I can't wait until she can use ember. Then I'll see what color her fire is!</i> Kasai thought. Phoebe followed close behind. With that, she left, the foursome headed on their way.</span></span></div>

<b>Pyschopath</b> ~ Although you looked close to winning this battle the repercussions had not escaped you. This battle had taken its toll on both Pokemon involved and both were nursing their own injuries but willing to fight to the finish. You eye Pachirisu with concern and guilt that ate away at you. You tell it that you do not wish to kill it or cause it any real permanent injuries. Pachirisu looked up at you believing what you said but still with an angry look across its face. Your promises to take of it fall on deaf ears as it turns its head away, this squirrel was a proud creature and losing the battle would wound its pride. You berate yourself for forgetting your food supply, you wouldn’t have gotten into this situation had you remembered. You have to finish off this battle and would deal with your guilt and remorse later. You ask Freeze to attack one last time if able. He nods his head and glows a deep red ready to <b>Counter</b> any attack. Pachirisu looked up and got to its feet holding onto the tree for support. It stumbled forward and sighed before giving a pitiful <b>Growl</b>. Freeze halted his charge and looked to you; it seemed that Pachirisu was out of energy to attack. With only one option left Freeze ran forward with the last of his energy and threw a nice right hook laced with ice energy at the squirrel that knocked it back down to the ground KOed. <b>Level up for Freeze</b>. You threw your Pokeball at the downed Pokemon watching as it converted its form to red light and promptly sucked it inside. It wobbled for a mere 2 seconds before a ‘ding’ sounded signifying capture. <b>Congratulations. You have captured a Level 05, Female Pachirisu</b>. Freeze walked over to you trying to gauge your reaction to your first ever victory and first ever capture. Pachirisu put up a great fight and would surely make a strong addition to your team. What you’re going to do next and question you really want answered was were you going to get along with your new team-mate? </span><br />

&quot;Freeze take a rest in your pokeball, you deserve it.

You will fit in amazingly.&quot; Tyson hadn't even noticed he was running, but when he did he did he knew he was far from the sight of the capture. <br />
<br />
&quot;I need to find a Pokemon Center and fast!&quot; The only thing that he had thought about all day had been food. Now the excitement of his first capture and the rush of finding a Pokemon Center had made him forget the hunger he was feeling. Tyson thought he was in the right direction as he thought he was going north.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shoot, I have no pokemon!&quot; Tyson was terrified of what could happen. Earlier he had Freeze to defend hin in case anything happened. Now he HAD Thunderfuzz but she was in too much pain to fight alongside Freeze. &quot;Wait, there is another!&quot; He had totally forgotten about his 3rd pokemon, which had been with him all along. &quot;Digga'&quot; Tyson's inner fire resparked and grew tenfold as his sense of safety returned to him.

<b><u>Mediville</u></b> (Please reply in <b>lemonchiffon</b>)<br />
<br />
<b>RaunchyFad</b> ~ You looked aghast as Rocky lay asleep on the ground as the proud Purugly loomed over her. Okay. Now what were you going to do? You really needed to wake Rocky up and soon before Purugly struck again. Looking down at the Meowth before you, you ask it if it be willing to participate in the battle on Rocky’s behalf. The Meowth looked absolutely petrified at the thought of battling the fat cat and backed away trying to get to safe distance from both the cat and yourself who had obviously gone mad. Too tired to argue with the little kitty you glance over to Rocky who was still happily asleep. Maybe you could attack it yourself, but we all know what happened last time you got near that thing. You urge Rocky to wake up seeing as this was your only option now and sigh dejectedly as she remained slumbering. Purugly pulled back a meaty limb and swatted Rocky with it in a <b>Scratch</b> attack that made Rocky roll and hit the wall. It watched carefully as she came to a stop a wince on her face but still asleep. A large grin came across its fat face as stalked her getting close before throwing fast paced limbs in succession in a vicious <b>Fury Swipes</b> attack that had Rocky covered in nasty scratches. You felt like you were gonna lose that half-croissant you ate earlier as you saw your Pokemon brutalised by this bully. The assault seemed never ending and holding back tears you wonder how you were going to save your Pokemon from death as it would seem impossible right now. Suddenly you hear a screech and see Purugly pull back trying to claw at something on its head. Looking closely you could see Meowth clinging onto the fat cat for dear life having caused the distraction. It gulped but opened its mouth wide and bit down on Purugly’s neck making it howl in pain at the nasty attack to the soft area. All its bucking threw Meowth off onto the ground and in front of Rocky. It looked behind it to see your injured Pokemon and seemed angered before turning to face the behemoth approaching it with a furious look on its face. Meowth shaking quickly swiped its claws across the monsters face in a <b>Scratch</b> attack of its own that left a few small cuts. Purgly hissed in rage and Meowth shaking like a leaf was left wondering if it had signed its own death warrant. </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: lemonchiffon"><span style="font-size: 9px">Paul stared hopelessly at the extremely one-sided battle that played out in front of his sleepy eyes. Things weren’t good, and the way they were going it looked like he would have to intervene. But how? He was in no position to start a brawl with an animal that was probably twice his weight. In fact, he was foolish to let Rocky battle the purugly in the first place, because quite obviously it was nearly quadruple her size. <br />
<br />
Nevertheless he lumbered to his feet. He figured that maybe if he was standing up the tiredness would go away and he could protect what was his. Instead he just felt like collapsing to the ground. He didn’t, though, but he did puke up his half-croissant and that handful of acorns he ate earlier. Acorns! That was the answer, found promptly in the acidic sludge that now covered Paul’s hand. He wiped his hand on the alley wall and quickly thought up a plan.<br />
<br />
The actions that followed would be considered very unorthodox among other trainers, and were probably very dangerous. What Paul did was try and jump over the purugly (he succeeded, but fell flat on his face in the process), crouch behind the stray meowth (who probably thought he was some sort of freak show), and finally snatch up his sleeping seedot and lay her on his lap. He tried to smile when he did this, but his facial expression turned out to be more of a worried grimace than anything else.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, keep scratchin’ him, li’l bobcat,” Paul slurred, keeping the grimace plastered on his face. He then opened his eyes as wide as he could, and growled at the purugly before turning around to lick and gnaw on his pokémon. Perhaps it was the negative affects of the hypnosis that caused Paul to act this way, but if he was lucky Rocky would wake up and the beatings he would get from the purugly would be minimal. Even so, he continuted to “eat” his pokémon, all the while hoping that for now the petrified meowth could hold its own.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: lightsteelblue"><b>Lemon~Lime</b> ~ With that attempt not working out quite like you planned you were going to have to think up a new strategy to beat this dark beastie. Scorpio was a little shaken by the frightening Sableye and the way it looked at him like dinner. Caught by a sudden idea you try to hide your grin and hope that this will pan out. You tell Scorpio to grab some gems on the wall where you were pointing and to follow you to the entrance of the mine where you’d be waiting. Throwing in a quick barb about the gremlin failing its job made it hiss in anger. It eyed up Scorpio pulling at the mine wall before flying out towards the exit. Although Sableye knew this mine very well it still seemed hesitant, what if that Gligar had spotted something it had missed. Not wanting to take a chance it ran after the pair of you and you grin at your success, now to see if the attack worked. You stood by the entrance of the mine in the light as Scorpio followed you. Sableye ran behind gaining on him and its eyes glowed a dark purple before bolts of energy shot forward and struck Scorpio making him yell and fall to the ground. Sableye ran up to Scorpio but slowed down as it approached the light, it had spent so long in darkness that the light scared it. It hissed and walked into the light its eyes dazzled by its brightness and Scorpio took its shot firing a wave of <b>Poison Stings</b> at it. Sableye cried out as it stumbled back into the darkness with barbs stuck in its skin. Daring to walk forward again it was met by another wave of <b>Poison Stings</b> that made it retreat again. It shuddered as poison began to seep into its body from the repeated attacks. Its gaze softened a little before it gave an almighty roar and leapt forward into the light dodging the last wave of barbs and striking Scorpio with a swift <b>Scratch</b>. Now both Pokemon were in the light and Sableye who was suffering from poison didn’t seem to care. It was going to any lengths to prevent you stealing any gems from the mine. </span></span>

Try to blind it even more! Then <b>Cross Poison</b> it away from you!&quot; Scorpio nodded, ready to attack, while Mike was tense in anticipation. <i>My first battle</i>, he thought. <i>Let's just hope it goes well</i>.</span></span></div>

<b>Pyschopath</b> ~ You hold back your excitement over your very first capture and with a reserved countenance pick up Pachirisu’s Pokeball. Returning Freeze to his Pokeball for a rest you ponder over names for your new team member. Deciding on the name Thunderfuzz you place her Pokeball with your others. Soon you charge off in one direction through the forest hoping to leave and find a Pokemon Centre, there had to be one around here right? Rushing forth with haste all thoughts of food gone from your mind you see a patch of light ahead and as you plunge into the brightness you find yourself in a clearing … but there were no buildings here. You sigh downtrodden; you really need to find something to heal your Pokemon. Just as you give up hope of finding your way out of this Forest and back into civilisation you notice a path in the distance with a sign next to it. Walking slowly up to it you can read from the distance you are that it leads out of the forest but there was something wrong, the path was blocked! In the middle of the path lay a snoozing Vileplume that seemed content to sleep right in your way. It filled up the entire path and there seemed no way around it with heave tree growth preventing passage around the creature. You would have to figure out a way past the flower or you’d be stuck here till it woke up. </span><br />

<br />
<b>RaunchyFad</b> </span>~ You’re soo weird … its awesome XD<br />
<span style="color: lemonchiffon">A reprieve was all that you needed as the trembling Meowth faced off against the much larger cat hoping to buy some time for Rocky to wake up. Managing to get to your feet you feel your stomach lurch and you lose that small amount of lunch you had earlier but grossly enough this gave you an idea. Whilst Meowth was distracting the Purugly you slip behind it making the cat turn to give you a confused look receiving a <b>Scratch</b> for its concern. It cried out and faced Purugly and with all its hatred let loose a loud <b>Growl</b> that startled the fat cat for a moment, enough to allow you to slip back with the slumbering Rocky in your arms. What you did next would be remembered by all participants in this battle; you started to gnaw on her flesh. Purugly and Meowth stare at you aghast at your behaviour. To even think you would consider eating your own Pokemon and at a time like this!! Even the Glameows had stopped there encouragement of Purugly to stare at you shaking their heads in disgust. Meowth seemed more worried about the prospect of working with a cannibal now that facing the behemoth before it and snapping out of its astonishment leapt up and sunk its teeth into Purugly’s leg in a harsh <b>Bite</b>. Purugly was snapped out too by the pain in its leg and roared as it tried to dislodge the little kitty. All this noise and the scratching feeling on her skin brought Rocky out of her sleep to find you trying to eat her. Her eyes widen and she leaps out of your grasp kicking you in the face for your behaviour, glaring daggers at you. You explain the situation somewhat dazed from the shot to the head and Rocky turns to see Meowth clinging onto Purugly. She did feel more injured than before but suddenly as Meowth flew off again Purugly shuddered as the tight vines wrapped in its fur drained some health which flew off in little bubbles hitting Rocky and restoring some of hers. She had forgotten about her Leech Seed, it was still there working its magic. Now it was 2 verses 1 and Purugly wasn’t looking so sure of itself anymore. Rocky looked over to you with a glare waiting for some orders with a look that said ‘do something useful for once in your life’. </span><br />

<b>Lemon~Lime</b> ~ Okay, so you had gotten the Sableye out into the light and it seemed to dazzle the gremlin for a moment but now it was so enraged that even the light wasn’t going to stop it from attacking. You needed a new strategy, keeping on the attack. Part of you realised that this was your first battle with Scorpio and so you were stoked but this creature was a hard hitter and wasn’t going to give up easily. Deciding on a defensive and then offensive manoeuvre you give your next commands to Scorpio. Flying just outside the mine he dug his claws into the nearby snow pile and threw a chunk into the face of Sableye in a modified <b>Sand Attack</b>, very innovative. Sableye furiously wiped at its face to remove the snow losing a little vision from the water now in its crystal-like eyes. It fired off another indigo <b>Nightshade</b> managed to just strike Scorpio on his side knocking him down. Scorpio was beginning to get tired from his repeated offense and was aching from the attacks he had received. Not one to back down though he pulled his claws across his face and they glowed with purple energy. Once he gathered enough energy, the acidic poison literally dripping off his claws hissing as it hit the floor, he made a slashing motion setting loose an X of poison energy that darted towards Sableye hitting it square on and throwing it back into the mine. It slowly got back to its feet wincing as the poison in its veins ate away at its body a little more. You seem to have the edge here, the question is can you keep it?</span></span></div>

<b>Artifical Dragon</b> ~ You were finding a new admiration for this little Baltoy as you progressed deeper into battle. It certainly had some tricks and was keeping you both on your toes. An idea popped into your mind, what if you caught Baltoy, would it show you the way to one of these fabled villages? It was certainly an option worth considering. Igneous didn’t seem to share your sentiments of Baltoy and was getting frustrated with his lack of success so far. You had to think deeply over your next set of orders as Baltoy seemed to have a counter for everything. Since the little doll had managed to elude the smokescreen and counter the leer maybe straight tackles were your best option and noted how Igneous would be happier to just pummel his opponent. It did seem to lack finesse but what the hell it was worth a shot.<br />
<br />
With the orders to Tackle three times Igneous set to work straight away charging right for Baltoy as it once again <b>Hardened</b> lessening the blow, but taking the damage non-the-less. Baltoy spun around looking a little worn now, the repeated attacks were wearing it down. Igneous ran forth again and leapt for another <b>Tackle</b> to be met a <b>Rapid Spin</b> in return both attacks throwing each Pokemon into the air. Baltoy was the first to recover and its eyes glowed pink as it fired a wave of <b>Confusion</b> at Igneous that caught him during his charge for his last attack and made him stumble and fall to the sand. Both Pokemon are feeling the heat and are worn from repeated attacks from the other with Baltoy suffering energy depletion greater than Igneous. It was a question of who was going to give first.</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">Gah, my procrastination on projects (totally not due to the fact that I paid for my World of Warcraft account) has come to kick me in the ass. Replies might become a bit difficult for me in the next week or so. D: But I have an hour this morning to do nothing (never thought I'd be so happy to be going to the doctor's office), so here's a reply. Also, get better soon Arc Angel. D:<br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorange">Alina watched Igneous pull himself out of the sand again. She walked over to him and gave him a pat on the head, praising him for his good work so far. It was obvious to see that he was getting tired, those Tackles did a number on both him and the Baltoy. Luckily, the Baltoy looked more worn than the Cyndaquil did. Alina didn't want to risk 3 more Tackles, since he might get hurt more, or even more tired due to the constant charging.<br />
<br />
Igneous shook the sand out of his fur and eyed the Baltoy angrily. Alina smiled as she stood up and walked out of the way as she thought of her next strategy. The three Tackles didn't work as well as she had hoped, but to be honest, nothing has worked well in this battle. To give Igneous a bit of a rest she decided to go with her defensive moves again. Maybe she would get lucky and they would work better this time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, buddy, you're doing great! Use a <b>Leer</b> first, then go with another <b>Tackle</b>! After that, use a <b>Smokescreen,</b>&quot; Alina ordered. She looked in her bag for something to perhaps help Igneous... a couple of TMs... a bunch of useless berries... nothing. She couldn't allow Igneous to make the Baltoy faint, however. She didn't have a revive, and she desperately wanted to find that lost village. After this battle, they would both need the rest...</span></span></div>

<b>empoleon dynamite</b> ~ This battle had only just begun but both Pokemon were already showing the effects. Teddiursa was already injured and the few attacks it was receiving were sapping the last of its health. Fungi however had taken multiple hits and was looking worn. You seemed pensive as you pondered over what moves Fungi could use, well there were only 2 available to you so your choices were a little limited. Your pokedex scanned your Shroomish speaking in a dull monotonous tone as it listed his attacks strengths weaknesses level etc… Looking at the figures on the device made your head spin and you decide to put it away before you get a headache. You knew what attacks to use and gave Fungi his next orders as Teddiursa got its breath back. Fungi drew yet more energy and health from Teddiursa in another <b>Absorb</b> that healed a little more of his injuries and damaging the teddy in the process. Teddiursa sat down as its bottom lip wobbled and started to sob uncontrollably. This had both you and Fungi regretting your last move and Fungi winced, he knew it was a battle but he didn’t know it would upset the injured Ted than much. He approached the Teddiursa wondering whether apologising would be a good idea right now when the illusive Teddy leapt up and <b>Lick</b>ed Fungi across his face making him wince and stumble back. That was so gross and really stung but fortunately he didn’t seem to be paralysed. That crafty bear, it had caught you both with its <b>Fake Tears</b>. Fungi fuelled by anger produced a seed from the top of his head fuelling grass energy into it making it glow a bright green. Teddiursa looked apprehensive and backed up never seeing such an attack before. Fungi twist around and released his seed which flew straight at Teddiursa who tried to dodge but was caught on its side throwing it through the air as the seed exploded on contact. Once the dirt had fallen Teddiursa could be seen lying on the ground. It got back to its feet but wobbled unsteadily. It was covered in a large bruise and multiple scratches. It wouldn’t take much now to finish it off.</span></span>

Wes looked at the Teddiursa, ‘<i>Wouldn’t take much to finish it off now...’</i> Fungii eagerly bounced on the spot – waiting for his trainer to make the next move. Wes clutched the empty <a href="http://bmgf.bulbagarden.net/showpost.php?p=565276&amp;postcount=1211" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fbmgf.bulbagarden.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D565276%26postcount%3D1211&amp;hash=9df2f221a936071660b9fba34a402585" rel="nofollow noopener">Pokeball</a>, <i>’It’s time to end this... I could keep battling but no doubt it’s gunna’ get dark soon...’</i> Wes knew from experience the Forest was a dangerous environment, he didn’t want to spend the night there. Holding the Pokeball tighter than ever, he braced himself; he couldn’t let things go wrong...“I’m sorry Fungii... You’ll have your battle soon” He tilted his head slightly and took aim at the small bear, “POKEBALL! GO!”</span></span></div>

<br />
<b>Fishyfool</b> ~ Well you were right after all, you had made a mistake. Several of the orbs turned a dirty red colour signifying your errors and Volcape looked disappointed. Sighing you remind yourself that you were expecting this after all and there was not quicksand this time, that was a plus. Now to fix the mistakes and hopefully progress through to the next room. There weren’t too many errors and you were thankful for that and started to wrack your brains for the solution to this puzzle. Your first thought that was Fire obviously wasn’t meant to be on the Bug pedestal and removed it before placing it on the Steel Pedestal watching as it turned back to its clear vibrant red colour; that was a good sign. Now you knew that Ice was strong against dragon types but it wasn’t right for this puzzle, was there another weakness? Slapping yourself in the face you realise your mistake before pulling the Ice orb off and replacing it with the Dragon orb which turned a lovely royal blue. With the Ice orb in hand you placed it on the Flying pedestal and the orb returned to its cyan colour. So far so good! Now it seemed to all come together as you tied the strengths and weaknesses together. You placed the Fighting orb on the Rock Pedestal and saw from the corner of your eye that it turned back to its red-brown colour before placing the last orb, the Rock orb on the Bug pedestal all the dirty red colours removed. Turning back to the door you see the Normal orb change to a bright white colour as it locked in place. The Rock shield shook before cracks emerged throughout making it shatter and fall to the ground the Normal orb rolling out and landing by your feet. <br />
<br />
With your new route clear you walk on through this time in a passageway with tiny pink lights on the walls dancing too and fro. Volcape kept close to you unnerved by the dancing lights as you reached the next room, one that seemed to reach towards heaven; you couldn’t even see the ceiling! At the far end of the room lay another pedestal made of marble with a small chest sat atop adorned with pink and white stones. You can’t contain your excitement at finding the treasure you were searching for that you rush forward only to hit an energy barrier of some sort that throws you back onto the ground. You can see a plaque with writing on just before the barrier and still on the ground read what it says.<br />
<br />
“The final test waits<br />
For if you wish to obtain the treasure<br />
A guardian you must defeat,”<br />
<br />
As you finish reading the plaque a monotonous sound echoes behind you and you turn to see a creature floating right behind you. The Lunatone’s eye’s glow and it makes a whirring sound before charging at you making you dive out of the way. Now between you and the treasure it seems that Lunatone is the guardian you must defeat. </span><br />
<br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: gold">With the waiting over, the shield covering shattered rather rambuctiously as Jamie and Volcape smiled at the new opening, and as the pair ran through, the thoughts running through his mind were of the treasure: Whether it were a brilliant gemstone of incalculable worth, a golden crown or sceptre, or merely just a load of coins, it would be worth the effort and peril, from the whole quicksand trap to this puzzle, Jamie knew that would be worth it, yet felt a sense of foreboding about him.<br />
<br />
Entering the new room, through the funny light show that would give any epileptic a bit of a fit, both monkeys gave a sudden gasp at the small chest adorned with pink and white stones, which Jamie thought about as he walked tentatively towards it and took into account as likely pearl and diamond. As he reached out for it in a manner equal to a glomp, Jamie went from ten to zero in half an inch and was sent sprawling on the ground, cursing his misfortune as he rose to see Volcape looking at the plaque below with a look of determined confusion. Reading it, Jamie realised at that point that there would be some major trouble nearby as he turned towards the sudden hum and dived to the ground as the assumed guardian charged at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I should've saw this moon guardian coming...&quot; Jamie sighed to himself as he stares at what he knew as a Lunatone, a Meteorite pokemon resembling less a moon and more a possessed banana with a beak and a pair of demonic red eyes that instilled fear into the minds of many a person. Volcape looked at the foe and took on a battle position, preparing to take on the heavyweight moon pokemon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Volcape, this is your first major test at battle, and I want you to be focused on the opponent. Start out by trying to intimidate him with a <b>leer</b>, before bringing the temperature up a little with your <b>ember</b> move, and be careful out there!&quot; Jamie ordered as his pulse raced faster than anything else he had remembered as the Chimchar prepared to fight the pokemon who had a type advantage against him in terms of defensive ability.</span></span></div>

<b>Pyschopath</b> ~ You hold back your excitement over your very first capture and with a reserved countenance pick up Pachirisu’s Pokeball. Returning Freeze to his Pokeball for a rest you ponder over names for your new team member. Deciding on the name Thunderfuzz you place her Pokeball with your others. Soon you charge off in one direction through the forest hoping to leave and find a Pokemon Centre, there had to be one around here right? Rushing forth with haste all thoughts of food gone from your mind you see a patch of light ahead and as you plunge into the brightness you find yourself in a clearing … but there were no buildings here. You sigh downtrodden; you really need to find something to heal your Pokemon. Just as you give up hope of finding your way out of this Forest and back into civilisation you notice a path in the distance with a sign next to it. Walking slowly up to it you can read from the distance you are that it leads out of the forest but there was something wrong, the path was blocked! In the middle of the path lay a snoozing Vileplume that seemed content to sleep right in your way. It filled up the entire path and there seemed no way around it with heave tree growth preventing passage around the creature. You would have to figure out a way past the flower or you’d be stuck here till it woke up. </span><br />

Alright, Let me check this thing out&quot; Tyson quickly pulled out his Pokedex then aimed the lens on the other side to the pokemon. After a few seconds of magical scanny awesomeness the robotic voice of the pokedex blurted out: &quot;Vileplume: The flower pokemon, when in danger it can scatter toxic spores and release noxious gases. &quot; Now there was a problem: if he were to wke it vileplume might react in self defence, yet if he were to wait there Thunderfuzz might die.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! Sneasels are the ninjas of the pokemon world, Freeze might be able to move it without waking it up.&quot; After digging through his pockets he found Freeze's ball. &quot;Come out quietly, Freeze just once.&quot; Freeze came out of his pokeball wearily yet strangely happy. &quot;Look here, we need to get to town yet this pokemon is in the way. What I want you to do is to move it without waking it up, you think you can do it?&quot; This question probably surprised Freeze since he gave Tyson a 'WTF! I work my butt off all day, help you catch a pokemon while taking some serious injuries and then you expect me to move a pokemon like six times my weight WITHOUT waking it! Are you crazy!' look. &quot;Well, can you!&quot; Freeze shrugged an 'I don't know' shrug. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, I was waiting to teach this to you later but desperate times call for desperate measures.&quot; Tyson looked through his backpack for a few seconds. &quot;Here&quot; Tyson held out his <a href="http://forums.upnetwork.net/viewtopic.php?p=229584#p229584" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.upnetwork.net%2Fviewtopic.php%3Fp%3D229584%23p229584&amp;hash=49501e557312896cbb253640679db574" rel="nofollow noopener"> IceBeamTM</a> as if though it was the Holy Grail. &quot;Learn this move, now!&quot;After inserting it into the pokedex, a bluish light coming from the pokedex hit Freeze.<br />

<br />
&quot;Look, TRY to move it if not go in the defensive and use<b> Ice Beam</b> then <b>Ice Punch</b> and if needed <b>Scratch </b>it.&quot; After a few seconds Freeze started to move close to the Vileplume. Everything must go well. Tyson thought.</span></span></div>

<b>Lemon~Lime</b> ~ Okay, so you had gotten the Sableye out into the light and it seemed to dazzle the gremlin for a moment but now it was so enraged that even the light wasn’t going to stop it from attacking. You needed a new strategy, keeping on the attack. Part of you realised that this was your first battle with Scorpio and so you were stoked but this creature was a hard hitter and wasn’t going to give up easily. Deciding on a defensive and then offensive manoeuvre you give your next commands to Scorpio. Flying just outside the mine he dug his claws into the nearby snow pile and threw a chunk into the face of Sableye in a modified <b>Sand Attack</b>, very innovative. Sableye furiously wiped at its face to remove the snow losing a little vision from the water now in its crystal-like eyes. It fired off another indigo <b>Nightshade</b> managed to just strike Scorpio on his side knocking him down. Scorpio was beginning to get tired from his repeated offense and was aching from the attacks he had received. Not one to back down though he pulled his claws across his face and they glowed with purple energy. Once he gathered enough energy, the acidic poison literally dripping off his claws hissing as it hit the floor, he made a slashing motion setting loose an X of poison energy that darted towards Sableye hitting it square on and throwing it back into the mine. It slowly got back to its feet wincing as the poison in its veins ate away at its body a little more. You seem to have the edge here, the question is can you keep it?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: lightsteelblue"><span style="font-size: 9px">The battle was going pretty good so far, but it was becoming clear that Scorpio couldn't take that many more attacks or give out a whole lot more either. That little demon was holding up pretty well, too. Mike tried to think up something, but his mind had run out of stock in the &quot;Bright Ideas&quot; aisle for now. He was going to have to use a stall tactic. &quot;Hey, Scorpio!&quot; he yelled. &quot;Keep hanging in there! <b>Three Sand Attacks</b> to its face, and try not to get hit! Keep it from retreating into the cave!&quot; As Scorpio wearily prepared to attack, Mike frantically searched his brain for a good strategy, hoping that Scorpio could hold up.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"> <br />

<b>empoleon dynamite</b> ~ The Teddiursa swayed on wobbly legs as it struggled to maintain its upright position, it certainly didn’t look too good. Clutching an empty Pokebll at your side you command Fungi to stand down, not wanting to continue the fight into the dead of night. Fungi reluctantly backed off and Teddiursa blinked in confusion. This was your moment; let’s hope it works out the way you planned. Throwing the red and white orb at the small teddy you watch as a look of recognition flickers over its face before it’s struck by the device. Time seems to stand still as the bear looks down at the orb before its body turns to red energy and it’s sucked inside. The ball locks shut but wobbles furiously and you wonder if you threw it at the right time. Holding your breath for fear the teddy may break free the ball suddenly stops wobbling and the light goes out. <b>Congratulations. You have captured a Level 06, Male Teddiursa</b>. You bend down to pick up your new team-mate enclosed in its capture device and smile. It had fought hard and really could have broken free of the Pokeball if it tried, but maybe … just maybe … it wanted to be with you. Now all that’s left is to leave the beautiful forest and continue your travels, there’s a big wide world there for you and your team to explore.</span><br />
<br />
<i> With Teddiursa’s capture you’ve unlocked your rights to the Egg House and are hereby released from the Arcane Realm. Upon replying to this update you’re free to post in the mainstream zones (I know they’re currently un-manned but something is being worked out so fear not).

<span style="color: limegreen"><b>Pyschopath</b> ~ Okay, now you weren’t expecting that to happen. You swear at the large grass Pokemon blocking your one path out of the forest and use your Pokedex to scan it. Hmm, releasing toxic spores if in danger, that’s not good. You needed to move it out of the way without waking it if possible, Thunderfuzz really needed to be healed and time was of the essence. Suddenly you come to a realisation that Sneasel are like ninja’s, stealthy and swift, maybe Freeze could help move the Vileplume without waking it; if he had enough energy to do so that is. Releasign Freeze from his Pokeball he seemed a little refreshed from the small rest and smiled at you, probably still on a high from his victory in battle. You ask him if he could move the Vileplume so you could all get into town and his smile soon falls off his face. Looking over at the large flower and comparing it with his size he looked back at you with a ‘wtf, you’re joking right?’ expression. You keep staring at him and he gets annoyed, not only did he work his furry little arse off to win your first battle now he was hefting heavy loads, this was soo unfair. He shrugs not thinking he could move it never alone without waking it. Deciding to appease Freeze with a TM, one that you had been saving for a while you flash the Ice Beam TM and Freeze’s eyes light up, that was one powerful attack. Placing it in your Pokedex it transferred the information over to Sneasel and he suddenly felt invigorated wanting to try out his new move now. Now with instructions to try and move the hefty flower but if struggling to attack Freeze set to work. <br />
<br />
Freeze stealthily made his way over to the Vileplume and getting underneath its side tried to roll it over grunting as he struggled to lift it. He was tired already and this was just taking the biscuit. He managed to lift it to waist height and was shaking at holding it like that, he wasn’t a muscular Pokemon and he wished right now that you had a fighting type with you. Managing to get it to shoulder height he gave a loud yell as he pushed it over onto its front and grinned. You slapped your face as the Vileplume shook and murmured to itself obviously woken by the loud yell and force of landing on its face. Freeze looked sheepish but leapt back and grinned, so that hadn’t worked, but this will. He charged up ice energy feeling his own diminish, damn this attack was draining. With all that he had he fired a small beam of ice energy that struck the rousing Vileplume pushing it further out of the way and encasing part of its side in ice. Wow, that sure was lucky. Now with a clear path you rush past grabbing your exhausted Sneasel in the process, time to find that Pokemon Centre.</span><br />

<b>Artifical Dragon</b> ~</span> I LOVE WoW, its addictive I know. I only wish I still had it *pout*<br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorange">Igneous had a knack of ending up deep in a sand dune and as he picked himself up once more you pat him on the head in praise. He was trying his hardest after all, that was all you could ask. Igneous was beginning to tire from the repeated offence and all the attacks he was taking were smarting something rotten. This Baltoy was a tough cookie and had no qualms about showing it; fortunately for you its offence seemed more draining than that of your Cyndaquil’s. Now then, time for a new battle plan since Tackle after Tackle after Tackle had merely worn Igneous down. Maybe a defensive approach would be best you surmise. Looking in your bag you can’t find anything that would assist your fiery echidna for the battle and sigh. Having to work with what Igneous had available to him to give him his next orders and watch as he set forth into action. You hoped not to KO the spinning toy in the hopes that once you caught it it would lead you to one of the fabled villages in this desert.<br />
<br />
Igneous slowly approached Baltoy trying to gauge what it would do next. He knew what he was ordered and merely waited for the right moment to strike. Baltoy stopped spinning to observe Igneous curiously only to receive a vicious <b>Leer</b> in return. Not waiting a second Igneous leapt forward and slammed into Baltoy hitting it hard and pushing it through the sand. Before it could recover and attack he spat out a cloud of <b>Smokescreen</b> that covered the sands. Baltoy could be heard whining within the cloud and a bright pink energy surrounded Igneous, the Cyndaquil fighting against it. Just as it looked like he was to be tossed … again the energy dissipated and Igneous fell harmlessly to the sand. It looks like Baltoy is losing energy fast; remember though Igneous is losing energy too with every move he makes and is panting hard from the exertion. Now would be the time to finish it off if you can find it within all the smoke. </span><br />

<b>Fishyfool</b> ~ A chest! A chest! The treasure you were searching for, at last! You tentatively approached the chest remembering what happened at every turn you’ve made here and walk smack bang into an energy barrier that knocked you onto your arse; Volcape just about missed being squished by your derriere. Typical! It’s never simple is it. Reading the plaque near the barrier itself you turn to face the guardian and sigh, you should’ve guessed that the guardian would be a moon Pokemon and that such Pokemon was staring down at you right now. Volcape didn’t seem the least bit intimidated by the floating moon Pokemon and moves to stand before it, ready to face this challenge. Lunatone cast its red eye upon the small fire monkey and nodded, accepting him as the challenger. This was your first battle together and against such a strong looking Pokemon, it would certainly be a test of your strength and strategy. Working through a battle plan you give your instructions to Volcape who nods his understanding. He faces the Lunatone and gives it a terrifying <b>Leer</b> just as Lunatone <b>Harden</b>s its already rock hard skin, but it became startled by the attack non-the-less. Taking the opportunity Volcape let loose a small fray of flames that struck Lunatone head on leaving small black marks in their wake. The fire attack snapped Lunatone out of its stupor and it floats forward with unthought-of speed and slammed into Volcape with a hard <b>Tackle</b> that sent him tumbling backwards. Though Lunatone had taken a head on attack its type kept it quite healthy and with its hardened skin that Tackle had done more damage. You were both going to have to be innovative to beat this guardian.</span> <br />

<span style="color: lightsteelblue">The battle seemed to be working in your favour which was very good, with Sableye poisoned and partially blinded. Scorpio was getting tired but was still pumped up and ready to dish out more damage to win his first ever battle. Wracking your brains for another battle strategy you find yourself coming up blank, this was a lot harder than you thought it would be. Deciding to stay on the defensive you order Scorpio to keep up with the snow-laden sand attacks whilst you thought of a good battle plan for next time. Scorpio nodded hoping that he could avoid any attacks thrown by the Sableye in the meantime and hoped you’d hurry and thinks of some good attacks to use ‘cause he could think of plenty. Digging his claws into the snow again he threw another blob of it Sableye who got smacked right in the head again as it was recovering from the poisons effects making it fall back. Pleased with how well that worked Scorpio did exactly the same again with another <b>Sand Attack</b> but Sableye almost sensing what was coming rolled out of the way causing the snow to fall harmlessly to the ground. Scorpio panicked tried again only to miss again as Sableye enraged charged at him wiping the snow from its eyes, sensing where the Gligar was from the noise he made and hit two consecutive <b>Scratch</b>es that left Scorpio reeling. Maybe using only defensive moves wasn’t such a good idea after all, although Scorpio had saved energy he took a good whack and was now bleeding across his belly looking sore and tired. Sableye cried out as the poison ate more of his health and collapsed to one knee. Sure the poison may finish it off but would it before Sableye finished off Scorpio? </span></span></div>

It would make a good addition to his team, but he wasn't expecting something like this. Scorpio was one of his closest friends, and the only thing familiar to him in this strange land.

Suddenly you come to a realisation that Sneasel are like ninja’s, stealthy and swift, maybe Freeze could help move the Vileplume without waking it; if he had enough energy to do so that is. Releasign Freeze from his Pokeball he seemed a little refreshed from the small rest and smiled at you, probably still on a high from his victory in battle. You ask him if he could move the Vileplume so you could all get into town and his smile soon falls off his face. Looking over at the large flower and comparing it with his size he looked back at you with a ‘wtf, you’re joking right?’ expression. You keep staring at him and he gets annoyed, not only did he work his furry little arse off to win your first battle now he was hefting heavy loads, this was soo unfair. He shrugs not thinking he could move it never alone without waking it. Deciding to appease Freeze with a TM, one that you had been saving for a while you flash the Ice Beam TM and Freeze’s eyes light up, that was one powerful attack. Placing it in your Pokedex it transferred the information over to Sneasel and he suddenly felt invigorated wanting to try out his new move now. Now with instructions to try and move the hefty flower but if struggling to attack Freeze set to work. <br />
<br />
Freeze stealthily made his way over to the Vileplume and getting underneath its side tried to roll it over grunting as he struggled to lift it. He was tired already and this was just taking the biscuit. He managed to lift it to waist height and was shaking at holding it like that, he wasn’t a muscular Pokemon and he wished right now that you had a fighting type with you. Managing to get it to shoulder height he gave a loud yell as he pushed it over onto its front and grinned. You slapped your face as the Vileplume shook and murmured to itself obviously woken by the loud yell and force of landing on its face. Freeze looked sheepish but leapt back and grinned, so that hadn’t worked, but this will. He charged up ice energy feeling his own diminish, damn this attack was draining. With all that he had he fired a small beam of ice energy that struck the rousing Vileplume pushing it further out of the way and encasing part of its side in ice. Wow, that sure was lucky. Now with a clear path you rush past grabbing your exhausted Sneasel in the process, time to find that Pokemon Centre.</span><br />

<span style="color: limegreen">&quot;Well, that was lucky.&quot; Tyson couldn't believe what had just happened. Freeze couldn't believe it either. &quot;I figured that Vileplume would fight back hard, yet it just stayed there. Now back to bussinees, there seems to be a road to a city here. Let's find the pokemon center.&quot; Tyson looked back at his pokemon, Freeze was injured, Thunderfuzz was in a lot of pain and Digga' was just there. Now he was glad to not have had food earlier, because if he did he would never have met Thunderfuzz. &quot;Now to find a pokemon center...&quot; </span></span></div>

<b>RaunchyFad</b> </span>~ You’re soo weird … its awesome XD<br />
<span style="color: lemonchiffon">A reprieve was all that you needed as the trembling Meowth faced off against the much larger cat hoping to buy some time for Rocky to wake up. Managing to get to your feet you feel your stomach lurch and you lose that small amount of lunch you had earlier but grossly enough this gave you an idea. Whilst Meowth was distracting the Purugly you slip behind it making the cat turn to give you a confused look receiving a <b>Scratch</b> for its concern. It cried out and faced Purugly and with all its hatred let loose a loud <b>Growl</b> that startled the fat cat for a moment, enough to allow you to slip back with the slumbering Rocky in your arms. What you did next would be remembered by all participants in this battle; you started to gnaw on her flesh. Purugly and Meowth stare at you aghast at your behaviour. To even think you would consider eating your own Pokemon and at a time like this!! Even the Glameows had stopped there encouragement of Purugly to stare at you shaking their heads in disgust. Meowth seemed more worried about the prospect of working with a cannibal now that facing the behemoth before it and snapping out of its astonishment leapt up and sunk its teeth into Purugly’s leg in a harsh <b>Bite</b>. Purugly was snapped out too by the pain in its leg and roared as it tried to dislodge the little kitty. All this noise and the scratching feeling on her skin brought Rocky out of her sleep to find you trying to eat her. Her eyes widen and she leaps out of your grasp kicking you in the face for your behaviour, glaring daggers at you. You explain the situation somewhat dazed from the shot to the head and Rocky turns to see Meowth clinging onto Purugly. She did feel more injured than before but suddenly as Meowth flew off again Purugly shuddered as the tight vines wrapped in its fur drained some health which flew off in little bubbles hitting Rocky and restoring some of hers. She had forgotten about her Leech Seed, it was still there working its magic. Now it was 2 verses 1 and Purugly wasn’t looking so sure of itself anymore. Rocky looked over to you with a glare waiting for some orders with a look that said ‘do something useful for once in your life’. </span></span>

<br />
<span style="color: lemonchiffon">As Rocky healed herself, Paul sighed in relief despite getting hit in the face again. Though pitting a tiny pokémon against a bear-sized cat was a stupid idea from the start, it all seemed to be turning around in the gang’s favor. Paul was especially happy that it was going to end soon since he couldn’t even remember why it started in the first place.<br />
<br />
“Heeey, not so tough now, eh moosey?” Paul teased, much to the embarrassment of his seedot who was coated in his pukey spit. Either way, despite her wounds and after-sleep grogginess, Rocky was ready to take on the purugly with help from the meowth who seemed to be doing a bit more damage than expected. Maybe if luck came about, the smell of vomit would simply turn the purugly away and Rocky wouldn’t have to fight at all.<br />
<br />
Even so, Paul barked out some commands while Rocky’s flavor lingered on his lips. She really was quite nutty, and even though Paul wasn’t REALLY eating her, he figured that if he ever became hungry enough she’d be mighty nice in a salad. A pang of guild went through his head as he thought of this. Ho hum.<br />
<br />
“Bide your time a bit, Rocky, and li’l bobcat, keep scratching and biting. It’s cool,” Paul stroked his beard twice before finishing up his battle plan. “And Rocky, man, when you’re done biding kick moosey in the head a few times, do, uh, whatsitcalled… those, yeah, quick attacks!” He then smiled, satisfied that he managed to remember Rocky’s attack name, then put up his dukes, just in case any of the cats wanted to bring him down. Perhaps the hypnosis’s effect hadn’t quite worn off yet.<br />
<br />
Rocky simply rolled her eyes and got ready to attack.</span></span></div>

<b>Music Box </b> ~ You can’t contain your excitement at seeing the mysterious village in all its glory, if only for a few seconds. Now you were more than determined to defeat this Banette if only to learn more about this village. Suddenly as it hits you, this Banette is not only an evolved Pokemon but seems quite old, it must be strong how were you going to win? Your face falls and doubt lines your features as you hesitate. Banette waits to see what you’ll do a small smile on its zipper mouth. Totodile wasn’t too pleased by your show of weakness and glared before shooting a jet of water at your face shocking you and making you choke. As the stream ended you felt somehow revitalised if not a little wet and leapt to your feet with renewed confidence. Alright now you were ready to battle and Banette seemed pleased by this. <br />
<br />
Shouting out your orders to Squirt who’s ears were ringing, he was close enough to hear you talk normally he focused on his ghostly opponent. Setting his gaze on Banette he gave it a vicious <b>Leer</b> that made Banette hesitate for a moment before leaping at it and swiping a claw … right though it! Squirt landed back on his feet and looked alarmed, his Scratch had no effect. Banette rolled its eyes at the amateur mistake and darted forward knocking into Squirt and pushing him back, fortunately he wasn’t holding anything so he didn’t lose an item with that <b>Knock Off</b>. Squirt feeling embarrassed by his previous mistake let loose a powerful stream of water that caught Banette flush on its side throwing it into and through the pedestal. Banette seemed shocked by the use of such a powerful move and grinned; maybe you weren’t such pushovers after all. It shook the water off and stretched its spectral muscles before its eyes glowed a deep purple and dark bolts of energy arced through the air smacking into Squirt with a crack and slamming him into the ground. That was a harsh <b>Nightshade</b> that left Squirt smarting. You were going to have to think of a good strategy to beat this experienced ghost.</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">Okay, just so nobody gets the wrong idea I made Squirt use Scratch on purpose. I'd figure I'd have myself make a stupid mistake for some comedy.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorange">*sweat drop* &quot;How could I forget about Squirt's scratch not being able to effect ghost types! ;_;&quot; exclaimed Tim as he sat in the sand swirling his finger in the sand feeling sorry for himself. Tim quickly got back to his feet and into the battle just in time to notice that Squirt's Hydro Pump hit. &quot;Hey Squirt!&quot; the Totodile turned his head to Tim to hear him out. &quot;It looks like we have to stick it out with just Hydro Pump! So Scratch wont work leer is almost as bad since Hydro Pump is special attack!&quot; Tim could tell that Squirt was wondering how Tim made a rookie mistake like Sratch on ghost when he seemed to know his attacks pretty well.&quot;A- Anyways, use <b>Hydro Pump</b> again since it's out only choice!&quot; Tim almost was ready to call upon Cacnea but then he quickly realized that Cacnea wasn't even his to battle with. &quot;Tototototototo!&quot; Squirt cried as he let loose his Hydro Pump at Banette. Tim kept on thinking to himself &quot;Loosing isn't an option here. My whole reason for even being here is at stake and this excursion would have been a waste of my time&quot; Tim turned to Cacnea,&quot;well, maybe not a total loss...&quot; &quot;Squirt, give Banette two more of your best <b>Hydro Pumps</b>! &quot;There has to be something I can use against Banette, but what?&quot; Tim thought as he just remembered something that could change the outcome of this battle. &quot;Brilliant!&quot; Tim said calmly and coolly.</span></span></div>
