Determined not to give up, your Snivy stares Solosis in its little eyes and <b>Leer</b>s at it, putting the psychic pokemon off guard. In retaliation, Solosis begins to glow, growing brighter and brighter before the light essentially explodes, the <b>Flash</b> dazzling poor Chris. Rubbing at his eyes, Chris stumbles around, his vision very much impaired at the moment. Nevertheless, he continues on, charging forward with his <b>Tackle</b>. The grass snake, pretty much randomly choosing where to charge due to the flash, keeps going forward, luckily managed to run into Solosis, sending the little green blob to the ground. Picking itself up, Solosis shoots out another <b>Psywave</b> at Chris, the psychic attack hitting, but thankfully it appears to be quite weak this time. Gritting his teeth, Chris leaps up into the air and bears down towards his opponent, the <b>Aerial Ace</b> giving him the abillity to see clearly. With a loud WHAM Chris hits Solosis fair and square on the head, pushing it into the ground. Gingerly picking itself up, Solosis sends out another <b>Psywave</b>. This time the attack was moderately strong, but it was enough to bring Chris to his knees. Both of the pokemon are showing signs that they are being pushed to their limits, maybe this battle won't last for too much longer?</span><br />

Determined not to give up, Chris begins to stare the Solosis down, <b>leer</b>ing at it, putting the Psychic Type off guard. But the cell is on to their tricks begins to glow, soon growing brighter and brighter before…&quot;Chris look away!&quot; but it was too late, the light eventually explodes! Flashing a bright that dazes the poor garden snake. He tries to open his eyes but it’s no use they are completely shut, he begins to rub at them as he stumbles around, but his vision is very much impaired.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don’t relieve on your eyes!&quot; the trainer shouts, &quot;you can listen to where he is!&quot;<br />
<br />
Blindly charging Chris luckily slams the Solosis to the ground, before it picks itself back up and retaliates with another much weaker <b>Psywave</b> that makes its mark.<br />
<br />
Gritting his teeth, Chris jumps into the air surrounded by a white light before bearing down on top of the Solosis. And with a loud WHAM Chris slams Solosis right on the head, digging him further into the ground. <br />
<br />
Panting Chris keeps his distance as he watched the Solosis slowly pick itself up and fire another of its <b>Psywave</b>s, this time though Chris was too tired to dodged and bears it, the attack was enough to bring him to his knees. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Chris, get up&quot; Ethan yells as the garden snake struggled to his feet.<br />
<br />
Not willing to give in and with a determined &quot;Sni!&quot; Ethan watches as a green aura began to surround his Snivy. To his wonder Ethan looks on astonished knowing all too well what that meant, Snivy's Overgrow ability had finally been activated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! This is it!&quot; Ethan smiles happily, &quot;Our ace in the hole, quickly Chris use <b>Light Screen</b> and <b>Calm</b>ly center your <b>Mind</b>&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
<i>Because we only have one shot at this…</i><br />
<br />
&quot;And fire an <b>Energy Ball</b>!&quot;<br />

A smile adorned your face as you slipped into the water. It was cool, but it was a nice cool, light and refreshing. Epy followed you in, entering the water in a less than eloquent way that you did, his entry into the water being accompanied by a big splash. You giggle as he regains his composure, before the pair of you begin to swim around. You can see a multitude of pokemon swimming underneath you, from the lumpy orange bodies of Magikarp slowly making their way through the water, to the swift Buizel zipping through the water. As you watched a school of Chinchou light up their antennae, giving the water around them a truly beautiful luminescent glow.<br />
<br />
As you watch, transfixed, you don't notice that Epy has decided to go off on his own. You little blue penguin notices a small pink pearl and dives down, wanting to bring you the pearl. However, what he doesn't realise, and doesn't until he actually grabs it, was that the pearl wasn't actually a pearl, but rather it was a Clamperl. A now very angry Clamperl who decides that the appropriate course of action is to clamp down as hard as it can on Epy's midsection. His cries of surprise and pain manage to distract you from the Chinchou spectacle, and you realise what Epy has gotten himself into.<br />

With Chris' Overgrow activating, you decide that it is finally time to go all out. Your grass snake throws his little arms forward, and you can just see a translucent light orange shield flash in front of him, just in time to reduce the impact of the <b>Psychic</b> that Solosis throws forth in desperation. Gritting his teeth, Chris takes a deep breath, and tries to <b>Calm</b> his <b>Mind</b>, going into an almost zen-like state. However, the Solosis suddenly shines white, the white glow overtaking Chris, <b>Snatch</b>ing away the benefits of his calmed mind. That was not good. Thinking that this is his last chance, Chris places his little hands together, a <b>Ball</b> of <b>Energy</b> forming between. Putting as much energy as he can into it, Chris throws his last chance attack forward, and it slams into Solosis' face, resulting in a large explosion. <br />
<br />
Holding your breath, you watch as the smoke dies down, and you see Solosis just managing to stand up, Chris faring slightly better. Deciding that now is your chance, you throw your Pokeball, which sucks it in. It shakes once, twice... and the red light dies down. <b>You have captured a Lv 4 Male Solosis. Congrats!</b> You walk over and pick up your new teammates ball, and as you do you notice that the little black band that previously sat on its head has fallen off. Maybe it could offer a clue as to who was in charge of the train explosion? After all it couldn't have been a coincidence that the train blew up and then Solosis with his little black band attacked you, especially considering that he had known moves that he definitely shouldn't have known.<br />
<br />
<i>What will you?</i><br />

Okay, you were self updating at the end of your reply when Talluz went and sucked the Slakoth's blood, and I am going to ignore this. If this happens again, then you will have to rewrite your reply. So keep that in mind. Also keep in mind that when battling you can use up to three moves, so please take advantage of this to make things go quicker for both you and me.<br />
</b><br />
Talluz hears your command to go after Slakoth and flies towards the sloth pokemon, fangs bared. Slakoth lazily looks at the Zubat gunning after it and lazily <b>Scratch</b>es at him with its claw. Unfortunatlely for Talluz, the scratch does hit him, temporarly sending the bat to the ground. Sending out an echo so that you can understand what is going on in the battle, Talluz decides to have another go at Slakoth. This time the Slakoth makes no effort to defend itself, which lets Talluz hooks his teeth into his opponent and suck some energy out of it, revitalising himself somewhat. Realising what just happened, Slakoth lets out a cute little roar and once again <b>Scratch</b>es Talluz. Talluz tries to flap out of the way, however his left wing gets hit by the sloth's claw. Letting out a little squeal of pain Talluz flaps his way back to you, waiting for new orders.<br />
<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: #00ff00"><span style="font-size: 9px">Talluz flew towards the Slakoth teeth bared to try and use leech life on it, but the Slakoth knocked him to the ground with its claws. The Zubat got back up and flew at it again, this time managing to dig his teeth into the Slakoth and sucking some of it’s blood. The Slakoth scratched at the Zubat again; hitting his left wing and making him give a small screech of pain. He then flapped his way back to Jakken with pain in his eyes, not wanting to go into another round, he looked at the scratch and looked at Jakken as if to say <i>&quot;Please, don't send me into another round...&quot;</i><br />
&quot;Don''t be a scaredy-cat Talluz. You aren't hurt that badly!&quot; Even after saying that, Jakken felt for the Poké Ball on his belt trying to figure out whether to send Shinkaron, his Eevee, out in place of Talluz, after all, Shinkaron's attacks are stronger than Talluz'. Deciding to get Talluz to fight for a little bit longer, Jakken told him &quot;One more round, all right? Just use a <b>Confusion</b> and two <b>Leech Lifes</b>, if you can't take any more after that, I'll send Shinkaron out in your place.&quot; Talluz glumly nodded in approval, he would have preferred if Jakken went ahead and sent Shinkaron out, but despite his feelings about it, he flew towards the Slakoth for an attack anyway.</span></span><br />

With Chris' Overgrow activating, you decide that it is finally time to go all out. Your grass snake throws his little arms forward, and you can just see a translucent light orange shield flash in front of him, just in time to reduce the impact of the <b>Psychic</b> that Solosis throws forth in desperation. Gritting his teeth, Chris takes a deep breath, and tries to <b>Calm</b> his <b>Mind</b>, going into an almost zen-like state. However, the Solosis suddenly shines white, the white glow overtaking Chris, <b>Snatch</b>ing away the benefits of his calmed mind. That was not good. Thinking that this is his last chance, Chris places his little hands together, a <b>Ball</b> of <b>Energy</b> forming between. Putting as much energy as he can into it, Chris throws his last chance attack forward, and it slams into Solosis' face, resulting in a large explosion. <br />
<br />
Holding your breath, you watch as the smoke dies down, and you see Solosis just managing to stand up, Chris faring slightly better. Deciding that now is your chance, you throw your Pokeball, which sucks it in. It shakes once, twice... and the red light dies down. <b>You have captured a Lv 4 Male Solosis. Congrats!</b> You walk over and pick up your new teammates ball, and as you do you notice that the little black band that previously sat on its head has fallen off. Maybe it could offer a clue as to who was in charge of the train explosion? After all it couldn't have been a coincidence that the train blew up and then Solosis with his little black band attacked you, especially considering that he had known moves that he definitely shouldn't have known.<br />
<br />
<i>What will you?</i><br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">OoC: I know that the adventure isn’t over yet and trust me when I say I don’t want it to end because I’m having way to much fun with it but I just wanted to say thank you for the Solosis!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: lemonchiffon">Quickly throwing his arms up Chris creates a translucent light orange shield flash in front of him just in time to protect himself from a desperate <b>Psychic</b> attack. Gritting his teeth from the impact, Chris begins to continue on with his orders by taking in a deep breath and tries to <b>Calm</b> his <b>Mind</b> soon going into an almost Zen-state.<br />
<br />
But before he could even reach Nirvana, the Solosis suddenly begins to shine white, overtaking the Snivy as well, quickly <b>snatch</b>ing away the benefits of his calmed mind.<br />
<br />
Thinking that this might have been his only chance, Chris places his little hands together, forming a small <b>Ball</b> of <b>Energy</b> between them, putting every ounce of energy he could muster and throws it resulting in a giant explosion!<br />
<br />
Holding his breath Ethan watches on as he waits for the smoke to die down, soon noticing that the Solosis that his Snivy had been fighting so hard this whole time was still capable of standing, he decided now was the time to the throw the ball, consuming it inside shaking…once, twice until finally -bing-<br />
<br />
The match had ended; the winner decided...Ethan ran over to his Snivy who was having trouble standing. With enough reason to, he had done a splendid job fighting, especially the last few seconds. Protecting himself from a desperate [Psychic] attack and pulling off an ever impressive [Energy Ball] even after getting his [Calm Mind] stolen.<br />
<br />
&quot;You did it!&quot; the trainer said grinning, holding and lifting the young snake up into his arms.<br />
<br />
A tear formed in the snake's eyes remembering...<br />
<br />
<i>How long has it been…<br />
Since I've seen you smile like that at me...<br />
You where a child when we first met…<br />
And I was barely a week old when we began to play in the back garden of the temple’s grounds<br />
I never blamed you for what you grew into and the way you decided to treat your fellow Pokemon...that was your families fault...I continued on to follow your beliefs and took anything and everything you threw my way just to make me stronger. I did it, all for you. And even though I rarely see it. The part of you I fell in love with, the part of you, that made you, you. It's moments like these that I'm glad to still be alive.</i><br />
<br />
..With a vine wrapped around Ethan, Snivy opened his eyes..<br />
<br />
&quot;What’s wrong?&quot; the boy inquired, &quot;you’re crying.&quot;<br />
<br />
To this the snake simply shook it's head before yawning, &quot;Right, you need your rest&quot; Ethan said grabbing a white ball with red lining from his belt and tapping it on the snake's head, retrieving it back inside. &quot;Rest, you deserve it.&quot;<br />
<br />
-Sighing- from relief, the man grabbed his stuff from the ground. But when he went over to recover the ball that contained his newly acquired teammate he noted a small black band that was wrapped around the Solosis's head at the begin of the fight had fallen off.<br />
<br />
It couldn’t have been a coincidence the man thought that he was attacked right after the train got targeted. Thinking that it may provide clues as to who might have been behind the bombing; he took it with him and began to continue where he left off. His destination, Medville.</span></span><br />

A smile adorned your face as you slipped into the water. It was cool, but it was a nice cool, light and refreshing. Epy followed you in, entering the water in a less than eloquent way that you did, his entry into the water being accompanied by a big splash. You giggle as he regains his composure, before the pair of you begin to swim around. You can see a multitude of pokemon swimming underneath you, from the lumpy orange bodies of Magikarp slowly making their way through the water, to the swift Buizel zipping through the water. As you watched a school of Chinchou light up their antennae, giving the water around them a truly beautiful luminescent glow.<br />
<br />
As you watch, transfixed, you don't notice that Epy has decided to go off on his own. You little blue penguin notices a small pink pearl and dives down, wanting to bring you the pearl. However, what he doesn't realise, and doesn't until he actually grabs it, was that the pearl wasn't actually a pearl, but rather it was a Clamperl. A now very angry Clamperl who decides that the appropriate course of action is to clamp down as hard as it can on Epy's midsection. His cries of surprise and pain manage to distract you from the Chinchou spectacle, and you realise what Epy has gotten himself into.<br />
<br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: deepskyblue">Quickly taking in a deep breath Liza dove and swam towards Epy and the Clampearl. Epy squealed in such pain making Liza quickly look around for anything she could use to help her piplup escape but all she saw around her were the mesmerizing pokemon and the underwater sea life that surrounded her. She glanced at some seaweed that gently flowed from left to right. Near the seaweed was a beautiful sea coral that glowed an illuminating and popping color of neon blue. For a second the enchanting scenery easily distracted her, it wasn’t until her piplup made another sound of excruciating pain that she was brought back to reality. Realizing she couldn’t use anything around her, Liza decided to grab Epy from his feet and tried to pull him away from the Clampearl. Seeing what his trainer was trying to do, Epy decided to use pound to disorientate the viscious Clampearl to try to break free.<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><span style="color: #FF0000">Alright, I will be taking over the Arcane Realm here to try to finish things up and get you all adventuring throughout FB. It's been a while since I've updated so bear with me as I shake off the cobwebs. From what I've read, this looks like it should go rather smoothly, so let's have some fun.</span></b><br />
<br />

<span style="color: lightsteelblue"><br />
<b><i><u>Green Zubat: Please reply in LightSteelBlue<br />

</u></i></b>Rose saunters on over to her opponent and starts to bat her eyes at the Swinub, hoping to <b>Attract</b> the furry pig thing. Unfortunately, though, it doesn't work, though you aren't sure if it is because of its gender or if the scalding chocolate stuck to it is serving as too much of a distraction. With a little squeal, Swinub charges forward, <b>Tackling</b> into Rose's face. Matching her opponent's squeal with her own, Rose lets out some <b>Poison Gas</b> as she falls backwards. The noxious gas wafts over to Swinub, who is unfortunate enough to inhale it. Coughing, the little pig suddenly charges forward again, <b>Tackling</b> into Rose once again. However, you notice that its movements are a lot more sluggish than they were before, suggesting that the poison has taken effect. Picking herself up, and a bit irate at the constant tackling, Rose spits forth an <b>Acid Spray</b>, the acid spraying all over her opponent. Letting out yet another squeal, Swinub opens its little mouth and starts to blowing, whipping up a <b>Powder Snow</b>, Rose being buffeted by the small particles of snow contained within. Both Rose and Swinub took some damage, but both are still raring to to go.<br />

However, you have shown what needs to be shown in that you understand how to roleplay in FB, so there is no reason to keep you in the Arcane Realm.

You pull and pull on Epy's legs almost feeling like you are about to rip them right off like those of a cooked turkey on a holiday. The clamperl's grip is amazingly strong. Still, Epy's concern and determination to get free along with your assistance gives the little penguin the right amount of motivation to <b>pound</b> it's fin down hard inside the mollusk's mouth. The two shells that surround the soft interior part as both you and Epy find yourselves drifting backward through the water. You can't be sure, but given the way a few bubbles are floating out of your little bird's mouth, you get the feeling that he is relieved. At least for a brief moment. <br />
<br />
You soon notice a shift in the flow of the water. Where once it was still and peaceful, it now has begun to flow ever so slightly. A quick glance to where the Clamperl was reveals it's two shells are opening and closing as it propels itself through the water around you both. Other aquatic life seem to start getting swept up in this new current as magikarp futilely flounder and the chinchou you noticed earlier are quickly making their way toward calmer water. It doesn't take long for you to realize that the clamperl is creating a <b>whirlpool</b> around you and Epy as you find yourself slowly getting sucked up by the spinning current. It is said that curiosity killed the cat, and right now it appears that cats might not be the only ones it gets given the fact that you are going to have to eventually take a breath of air. The question now is...<br />

You pull and pull on Epy's legs almost feeling like you are about to rip them right off like those of a cooked turkey on a holiday. The clamperl's grip is amazingly strong. Still, Epy's concern and determination to get free along with your assistance gives the little penguin the right amount of motivation to <b>pound</b> it's fin down hard inside the mollusk's mouth. The two shells that surround the soft interior part as both you and Epy find yourselves drifting backward through the water. You can't be sure, but given the way a few bubbles are floating out of your little bird's mouth, you get the feeling that he is relieved. At least for a brief moment. <br />
<br />
You soon notice a shift in the flow of the water. Where once it was still and peaceful, it now has begun to flow ever so slightly. A quick glance to where the Clamperl was reveals it's two shells are opening and closing as it propels itself through the water around you both. Other aquatic life seem to start getting swept up in this new current as magikarp futilely flounder and the chinchou you noticed earlier are quickly making their way toward calmer water. It doesn't take long for you to realize that the clamperl is creating a <b>whirlpool</b> around you and Epy as you find yourself slowly getting sucked up by the spinning current. It is said that curiosity killed the cat, and right now it appears that cats might not be the only ones it gets given the fact that you are going to have to eventually take a breath of air. The question now is...<br />
<br />
<i>What will you do?</i></span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: deepskyblue">With Epy now freed, the duo tried to swim up only to later realize the Clamperl had no intention of letting them go and quickly surrounded them both in a Whirlpool.<br />
<br />
Try as they might to fight, the shift in the water current wouldn't allow them and soon they began to be sucked in by the abyss. Liza struggled to keep her breath in, air bubbles escaping her lips all the while Epy watched over her helplessly and concerned for her well being. <br />
<br />
He tried to figure out something to do but the pressure seemed to have caught the smart Penguin off guard. Not being able to commune her thoughts Liza thought for a moment of a solution before placing her hand on the Piplup, bringing him back to reality and comforting him at the same time. <br />
<br />
Holding one hand to her mouth to conserve her air, she waved to her Pokémon with her other and moved it in a circular fashion, spinning some water in a mini whirlpool in the opposite direction the one around them was going. Understanding her plan her Pokémon nodded to her and dove into action. <br />
<br />
Liza’s plan was simple, cancel out the threat without putting any of the other wild life in harm’s way and buying them enough time so she could get some air.<br />

With the water spinning faster and faster around you, your plan goes into motion. Epy soon dives down into the spinning current paddling as best he can to get deep enough to unleash a whirlpool of his own. The little penguin redoubling his efforts in the ever strengthening current in order to help his partner in you. Besides, if he let you down now, who would give you all the pokemon news you require? Right? Resolved to succeed, he perseveres until he reaches the ocean floor where he puffs out his chest and unleashes a <b>Whirlpool</b> of his own from his mouth. At first you can't really feel any change as you find yourself still spinning along with the school of magikarp, but little by little things begin to calm down. Given how much effort Epy is putting into slowing the momentum of the water you are not surprised that your partner's whirlpool soon begins to overpower the efforts of the clamperl who seems to have disappeared from your line of sight. You feel your body is starting to tire from fighting to stay above water, but before your arms and legs get completely noodle-like the water manages to still itself. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, that isn't the end as you see the clamperl pop out of the water and into the air almost acrobatically. It's shell twisting and turning until it opens right at you allowing you to see the shiny pearl-like form inside. Suddenly a shot of water comes firing at you from inside the clamperl. The <b>Water Gun</b> seems like it is going to inevitably going to hit you right in the face when in the spur of a moment an unlucky magikarp flops out of the water in front of you and takes the full force of the blast. It's tail fin thwacking you in the forehead as the poor fish skips past you across the water several times until it finds itself laying on the beach <b>Splashing</b> around futilely.<br />
<br />
Upon looking back toward the clamperl you find that it has settled itself in a floating position on top of the water with it's shell open staring at you to see...<br />

Gasping for air Liza submerged from the water and for a moment all seemed right with the world as she looked up to the clear sky and shining sun, the Clamperl that had been terrorizing them suddenly jumped out of the water, it's pearl like inner body sparkling before firing off a <b>Water Gun</b> directly at her.<br />
<br />
Prepared to shield herself from the attack a Magikarp jumped in the way of the blast and thwacked her on the forehead, &quot;Argh!&quot; leaving a rather embarrassing red mark as the fish was left skidding along the water until it finally met the sand, <a href="https://24.media.tumblr.com/7143dff3f34a2dfb037fde1bb8f88d86/tumblr_mwmxi2VTCZ1rsc51fo1_500.gif" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2F24.media.tumblr.com%2F7143dff3f34a2dfb037fde1bb8f88d86%2Ftumblr_mwmxi2VTCZ1rsc51fo1_500.gif&amp;hash=499841bff7039f99f093ad47b12e2047" rel="nofollow noopener"><b>Splash</b>ing helplessly on the beach</a>.

But as she looked back the Clamperl that was now afloat on the water, shell open and looking right at her. This was a standoff and Liza had no &quot;Gun&quot; to fire. Epy was probably at the bottom of the ocean and her Pokeballs were left on the sandy shores along with her towel..<br />
<br />
Down below in the ocean floor Epy gave a sigh of relief as his trainer made her way above, he also began to swim up while a nagging feeling made him want to go faster.<br />

Mean while above...<br />
&quot;What is it you want?&quot; the girl said &quot;An apology?, well then I'm sorry my Piplup mistaked you for a pearl but why not take it as a compliment? pearls are rare and valuable things, beautiful even, so how about it, why not let bygone be bygones?&quot;<br />

Clamperl floats on the water listening to your apology. It's pearly face rather difficult to read given it's lack of expression. Although that might not be such a bad thing. At least it isn't attacking you. Or at least not yet if your mindset is glass half empty. Your thoughts quickly turn toward the Magikarp helplessly flopping around on the beach and you begin to wonder just how long it will last outside of water. <br />
<br />
A young boy and a young girl on the beach in swimsuits slowly, but carefully move toward the magikarp. Their eyes wide with excitement. <br />
<br />
&quot;Cool...! Look at that fish!&quot; the boy smiled creeping ever closer to the pokemon. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know...!&quot; squealed the girl, &quot;Do you think it's alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure it is,&quot; the boy replied as he reached out to try to touch the orange fish only to pull back just before he actually touched it, &quot;Maybe we should try to put it back in the water.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; the young girl agreed with a nod.<br />
<br />
The kids continue to watch the fish bounce up and down for a few seconds when finally the young boy speaks up and says, &quot;Well what are you waiting for? Put it back in the water.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me?!&quot; the young girl exclaimed astonished, &quot;I'm not touching that thing! You do it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way! I don't wanna!&quot; the boy shot back. Within seconds the pair are arguing and drawing the attention of other beach goers. It isn't until a tall, tan, well muscled young man in blue shorts and sunglasses approached them that they stopped.<br />
<br />
&quot;No need to fight little ones. There's a very simple solution to this. If you don't want to touch it we just need to capture it,&quot; the man smiled at the kids, &quot;Magikarp make for good eating. I'll just run and grab a couple things and before you know we will feast. Okay? Okay...? Don't worry, this is the humane thing to do. You don't want it to continue to suffer do you? Stay here and guard it for me okay?&quot; The man waited until he got a nod out of the kids before winking at them and making his way back up the beach to get his stuff.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Epy bursts out of the water and begins to tread next to you. The penguin's arrival causes the Clamperl to back off slightly and close it's shell a bit. It's cautious action does little to assuage you of it's intentions. It's possible that it is waiting to see what kind of move you will make or perhaps it is waiting for you to let your guard down. Either way you have a choice to make. Face off against the Clamperl or try to save the Magikarp from becoming a meal. Or perhaps even having a bite of it. The choice is yours.<br />
<br />
<i>What you will do next?</i></span><br />
<span style="color: #FF0000"><br />
@sweetbbydoll: I didn't mention anything last time because I feel you are doing very well. I still feel that way and really have no advice other than to say, just keep writing like you have been. If you have any questions about anything feel free to ask me.</span></span></div>

<span style="color: deepskyblue">Liza was steaming mad as she heard the lack of care for sea life the beach goers had. Not that she was an activist or was greatly knowledgeable in marine life but she knew common sense. Had she been any angrier, the water she waited in would of began to boil. <br />
<br />
With the appearance of her Piplup the young women turned around noticing the Clamperl, clamming up by hiding in its shell while she treaded closer to her little blue penguin, wrapping her arms around him, &quot;I'm sorry again&quot; she says to the Clamperl &quot;but there's something I have to do, and that's correct a mistake we both made. If you care anything about your fellow water types, you'll let me go. Because if it wasn't for our Whirlpools that Pokémon that’s about to become food would safely be at the bottom of the sea.&quot; <br />
<br />
Holding tight to Epy she whispered &quot;Agility&quot; before a white glow over took the water type &quot;and Surf us over to the shore&quot; <br />
<br />
All she needed to do was get to her bag, grab a poke ball and toss it toward the Magikarp...hope for the best and of course give those son of a ****** a piece of her mind.<br />

You make your apologies to the clamperl and take hold of Epy. It seems your words must have set Clamperl at ease as Epy manages to catch a wave without any repercussions in the form of an attack from clamperl. So at least that was one less dilemma for you to worry about. Now it was just a matter of taking care of the other matter at hand. Helping the magikarp that inadvertantly protected you from clamperl. Your anger burning at the notion of people making a meal out of the poor stranded Magikarp on the beach while Epy picks up even more speed. <br />
<br />
Upon reaching the beach you rush toward your bag and after a little digging find a pokeball that you throw toward the magikarp hoping for the best. Your eyes follow the arc of your pokeball with a hope of saving the magikarp only to see a hand reach out and catch the pokeball in midair. As you take in the scene a little better, you find that a well-toned shirtless young man had gotten in the way. It only takes a moment for you to realize that it is the same young man who had suggested eating the magikarp in the first place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh uhhh... No going and catching a pokemon that isn't yours. We found it first,&quot; the young man says with a smile. You can already tell that he is rather arrogant given the way that the cockiness in his voice, &quot;Now if you want to battle me for the right to capture this pokemon to keep I'm all for it. But I have to warn you, I won't go easy on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey mister I thought we were going to eat it?&quot; the young boy who was looking at the fish earlier asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was only kidding kiddo. A magikarp would be a huge boost to my team once I train it up enough to evolve it into a gyarados. Might even help me become an elite trainer someday. Besides, magikarp really aren't very good to eat. I know I said they were delicious, but I was only kidding,&quot; the arrogant trainer said to the child before tossing out a pokeball that opened in a flash of light that eventually formed into a Lotad. The lotad immediately let loose a mist to re-hydrate the magikarp and then turned back to its smiling trainer. The trainer smiled widely as he turned his attention back to you and Epy, &quot;My name is Tim and this is Corriente. We challenge you to a battle for this magikarp!&quot;<br />

You make your apologies to the clamperl and take hold of Epy. It seems your words must have set Clamperl at ease as Epy manages to catch a wave without any repercussions in the form of an attack from clamperl. So at least that was one less dilemma for you to worry about. Now it was just a matter of taking care of the other matter at hand. Helping the magikarp that inadvertantly protected you from clamperl. Your anger burning at the notion of people making a meal out of the poor stranded Magikarp on the beach while Epy picks up even more speed. <br />
<br />
Upon reaching the beach you rush toward your bag and after a little digging find a pokeball that you throw toward the magikarp hoping for the best. Your eyes follow the arc of your pokeball with a hope of saving the magikarp only to see a hand reach out and catch the pokeball in midair. As you take in the scene a little better, you find that a well-toned shirtless young man had gotten in the way. It only takes a moment for you to realize that it is the same young man who had suggested eating the magikarp in the first place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh uhhh... No going and catching a pokemon that isn't yours. We found it first,&quot; the young man says with a smile. You can already tell that he is rather arrogant given the way that the cockiness in his voice, &quot;Now if you want to battle me for the right to capture this pokemon to keep I'm all for it. But I have to warn you, I won't go easy on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey mister I thought we were going to eat it?&quot; the young boy who was looking at the fish earlier asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was only kidding kiddo. A magikarp would be a huge boost to my team once I train it up enough to evolve it into a gyarados. Might even help me become an elite trainer someday. Besides, magikarp really aren't very good to eat. I know I said they were delicious, but I was only kidding,&quot; the arrogant trainer said to the child before tossing out a pokeball that opened in a flash of light that eventually formed into a Lotad. The lotad immediately let loose a mist to re-hydrate the magikarp and then turned back to its smiling trainer. The trainer smiled widely as he turned his attention back to you and Epy, &quot;My name is Tim and this is Corriente. We challenge you to a battle for this magikarp!&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>What will you do?</i><br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: deepskyblue">Catching a wave from underneath him Epy began Surfing his trainer to the shore; looking back the trainer noticed that the Clampearl that they had been fighting up until now hadn’t done anything to stop them. With her black hair being pressed by the salty wind, Liza realized that maybe the Pokémon had truly heard the feelings behind her words, she smiled.<br />
<br />
Picking up speed Epy reached the sand much quicker than expected, the trainer struggling against the water. Her body felt heavy due to the whirlpool from earlier almost ripping her to shreds, but none the less she pushed through it. Grabbing her pack from the ground finding inside a Pokeball and quickly tossed it toward the flapping fish. She followed the arc of the ball with her dark eyes, it would have been a bull’s eye if it weren’t for the tanned man from earlier getting in her way and catching her ball.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! What’s the big idea-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh uhhh... No going and catching a Pokémon that isn't yours. We found it first,&quot; he said with a smile, his cockiness showing through his words, it was irritating. <br />
<br />
&quot;Except it isn’t yours!&quot; Liza yelled out. &quot;And techinically it found me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now if you want to battle me for the right to capture this Pokémon to keep I'm all for it. But I have to warn you, I won't go easy on you.&quot;<br />

We challenge you to a battle for this Magikarp!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha, you want to fight me? With that?&quot; the young women in her swimsuit said laughing at the notion of fighting a Pokémon with a Leaf for a head and a mustache for a face. &quot;Classic.&quot; she said wiping a tear that had formed in her eye, &quot;He suits your personality.&quot; She said in a more serious tone, &quot;I’ve no interest in that Pokémon, personally, but if you think I’ll let the likes of you have it, you’ve got another thing coming…the names Liza and this-&quot; she said as her Piplup brought himself in front of her, &quot;Is Epy, this will be a one on one match, winner gets the right to decide what to do with the Magikarp! Of course, it's ladies first!&quot; she said not waiting for a response from the other trainer &quot;Epy use Aerial Ace! While its disoriented use an Icy Wind, and then go into a Blizzard!&quot;</span></span><br />

&quot;Don't get too confident. We aren't going down that easily,&quot; Tim responded as Corriente narrowed his eyes. Clearly your taunts annoyed the other trainer given the way he furrowed his brow at your line about his personality being like that of a magikarp. Epy and Corriente step forward and square off as you give your commands to the little penguin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Corriente! Use<b> Leech Seed</b>! Then <b>Astonish</b> him! Finally let's close things out by <b>Absorb</b>ing some of that penguin's energy!&quot; Tim cried out to his partner.<br />
<br />
With their commands given, Epy and Corriente sprung into action. Epy moved first. Running at such a pace that he almost becomes invisible until suddenly he was gone. Corriente's eyes went wide as he looked to see where his opponent had went only to feel Epy slam into him from the side and knock him into a slide across the sand. Epy barely had a chance to set his feet when a seed hits him squarely in the chest. As your partner looks to see what happened to him vines burst forth from the seed and wrap themselves around Epy's body. Suddenly the vines glow red and Epy let's out a squeak as he feels his energy draining in the form of red spheres that fly from your penguin into the water plant. Meanwhile, Corriente has gotten to his feet and looks rather energized even after taking such a brutal hit from Epy.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you aren't even going to keep it, why are you even bothering to fight for it?&quot; Tim asked in between the attacks. Sure he was focused on the battle, but he just couldn't let go of the feeling that Liza was just being difficult for the sake of being difficult. After all, what did he do to her? &quot;What gives you the right to decide who trains what pokemon?&quot;<br />
<br />
Epy begins to take a deep breath in order to release a cold Icy Wind when he feels the lotad smash into him causing him to loose his breath before he could release his attack. It seems the vines wrapped around him are not only sapping his energy, but are also slowing him down a bit. Once more the vines on Epy glow red and you can see him slump slightly as he begins to loose even more energy to Corriente.<br />
<br />
You notice a crowd beginning to gather as people start cheering for each of your pokemon. Some for Epy, some for Corriente. It becomes quite obvious that most of the people don't care who wins or loses. They just want to see a good battle.<br />
<br />
Not ready to throw in the towel yet, Epy narrows his eyes and raises his wings as he takes another deep breath. This time he doesn't give the lotad a chance to attack as he summons an icy blast of cold air in the form of a Blizzard. Corriente can do nothing other than try to brave the chill as icicles begin to hang from his leafy top. The chilled water plant shakes uncontrollably as his eyes glow bright and a series of energy balls shoot forth from Epy into Corriente. Epy once more slumps only to stumble a bit as the vines on him glow red again as more energy floats from him into Corriente. <br />
<br />
Both pokemon are looking tough after just a few rounds. With super effective moves taking their toll on both sides. It is starting to look like this might not be a very long battle if things keep going this way.<br />
<br />
<i>What will you do?</i><br />
</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #FF0000">One minor thing that will help you in the future Wildstyle is to bold attacks when you issue them. This is both for roleplay and for Trainer battles. It helps updaters not miss a move. Other than that, you are doing great!</span></span></div>

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: deepskyblue">&quot;A Pokémon has the right, just as much as a Pokémon trainer has to choose who they want their partner to be, that's why!&quot; Liza responded. Though what she said believed it to be true, there was another reason she hoped to capture the Magikarp even though it wasn't her cup of tea, something she wasn't quite proud of...She needed to get out of the Arcane Realm to keep a promise that she and Ethan both had agreed on, he would conquer all the Gyms and she had vowed to earn one ribbon in every category of contests, it wasn't until both their dreams were fulfilled that they could be together. Beside the Magikarp saved her, &quot;You’re also one to talk; you wanted to eat this poor Magi!&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking at the battle unfold, both sides seemed pretty well even, Epy was getting pumped with a crowd having gathered to watch them, some rotting for him while others were rooting for the Lotad to win.<br />
<br />
Liza gritted her teeth; she needed to get Epy to lose the vines absorbing his energy, but how? that’s when it dawned on her <i>the water</i> it could work...&quot;Epy quick <b>Dive</b> into the water to try to get rid of the Leech Seed, then use an <b>Aqua Ring</b> to replenish yourself.

However, you have shown what needs to be shown in that you understand how to roleplay in FB, so there is no reason to keep you in the Arcane Realm. Remember to be careful of self updating and watch that you don't mix past and present tense when writing. Those are the only notes I can see to give you.

&quot;Oh for crying out loud grow up! People eat pokemon all the time!&quot; Tim countered with a tone of annoyance in his voice, &quot;Where do you think Miltank Steaks come from? Or slowpoke tails? Don't be naive! Besides, Magikarp are all scale and bone. Nothing worth eating. Unlike a basculin which are really tasty.&quot; The opposing trainer shook his head. and wondered just why he was bothering trying to explain to such a headstrong trainer. She had already stated that she wasn't going to let him have the Magikarp despite not wanting it. It seemed that the only way to get her to listen was to beat her and her piplup.<br />
<br />
Your mind wanders a bit as you think about leaving the Arcane Realm and joining your friend Ethan on a grand journey across the lands of Fizzy Bubbles. The prospect of becoming a great coordinator fresh in your mind. Perhaps after defeating this trainer you would leave the beach behind and follow your dreams, but for now there was a battle to finish.<br />
<br />
&quot;Corriente use <b>Surf</b> to keep them from diving, then <b>Astonish</b> the piplup, and finally <b>Absorb</b> more of it's energy,&quot; Tim called out to his partner confidently. <br />
<br />
Epy nodded at you and rushed into the water hoping to dive down and wash the vines that were draining his energy off. A large wave suddenly rose up in front of Epy as Corriente hurried into the ocean and summoned forth a small tsunami. Not to be done in so easily, Epy timed his dive perfectly slicing through the wave like a surfer and made his way underwater. The vines were making his swimming difficult to swim and while the idea was sound, the vines just were not going to let go. However, Epy used the opportunity to swim back up to the surface and strike the lotad from below. Corriente cried out more in surprise than in pain as the attack didn't really have the kind of power against a water type as it would another type. The lotad backed onto the edge of the tide letting his small feet dig in as he rushed forward to astonish Epy only to find the penguin summoning ring after ring of water around himself until he looked like the nucleus of an atom. Corriente's atack hit, but Epy was able to hold his own and then some. As the Lotad regains his stance he sees Epy quickly coming toward him only to find the bird disappear and reappear next to him while attacking hard in a critical spot. Corriente screamed in pain as he found himself launched into the air only to come down hard on the beach. <br />
<br />
&quot;Corriente!&quot; Tim shouted to his partner with a concerned voice. However, the water weed pokemon remained motionless. It seemed that the lotad was no longer able to battle. Tim's head dropped in disappointment as he pulled out his pokeball and recalled his lotad. &quot;You did great Corriente. Take a rest you deserve it.&quot; The trainer grunted and turned to you, &quot;Well it looks like you won. That piplup of yours is pretty tough. Although next time we meet I'm sure I'll be able to beat you. In fact I know I will.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim gathered up his belongings and began to walk away as the crowd started to disperse. After a few steps he held up his hand to wave and turned his head just enough to say, &quot;Take good care of that magikarp! You fought hard for it, so it would be a shame if you decided to mount it on a wall or something. Later...!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two children who had been poking at the fish before you made it to shore looked up at you expectedly with wide eyes before battering you with myriad of quick questions along the lines of, &quot;What are you going to call it? Are you going to evolve it? How come you don;t wear a swimsuit that matches your piplup? Where are you from? What are you going to do now? Do you think you could teach us how to catch pokemon? What kind of pokeball are you going to put it in?&quot; The questions continued on and on....<br />
<br />
<i>What will you do?</i></span><br />
<span style="color: #FF0000"><br />
-- Sweetbbydoll, you have been a fantastic updatee, and now upon your next reply if you make your first capture, I will be happy to let you leave the Arcane Realm to go into the FB Zones. You have impressed me with your writing ability and I know you’ll enjoy adventuring in one of the zones we have to offer you. I do apologize for dragging this out far longer than I should have. Just remember to follow the zone rules. You may contact the specific Zone Owner or any of the mods if you have any questions, they’ll be happy to help you. You also now have access to the Egg House upon your next reply assuming you capture the magikarp. If you do not make a capture, we can continue on the adventure here until you make a capture, but there is not much else for me to go over with you. Good Luck and have fun with the other aspects of FB!-- </span><br />

</blockquote><span style="color: deepskyblue"><span style="font-size: 9px">Liza watched as her strategy began to unfold, and though it had failed to release Epy from the choke hold of the Lotad’s Leech Seed, a sigh of relief escaped her lips as she saw Epy successfully managed to knock the Lotad out with an Aerial Ace.<br />
<br />
“Pip, pip, pip…!” the Piplup struggled to his feet arriving from the water onto the sands of the beach, looking a little exhausted from the whole day’s events.<br />
<br />
Liza ran over to him, her body still a little tired from the swimming session she and Epy had experienced and caught her little blue penguin before he landed on his bum.<br />
<br />
“You did it!” she squealed hugging him tight, “Pip, pip, pip!”<br />
<br />
The other trainer who was planning to capture the Magikarp for himself had already returned his fallen Pokémon back in his pokeball admitting defeat. With the battle over all the spectators returned to what they were doing before. Liza watched as the man that went by the name Tim collected his belongings and began to leave but not before some parting words of advice.<br />
<br />
“Take good care of that magikarp! You fought hard for it, so it would be a shame if you decided to mount it on a wall or something. Later...!”<br />
<br />
<i>Was that supposed to be some kind of compliment?</i> Liza couldn’t quite tell but with a shake of her head she simply let it go; she had won!<br />
<br />
Being so concerned with how Epy was doing, she quickly had forgotten the Magikarp who had bravely saved her from a direct Water Gun attack. She hurried over to it just as the two kids from early began barraging her with millions of questions…<br />
<br />
“What are you going to call it?”<br />
<br />
“Magi, short for Magikar-”<br />
<br />
“Are you going to evolve it?”<br />
<br />
“Probably, besides wanting to be a coordinator I want to be a Mega Pokémon Tamer-”<br />
<br />
“How come you don’t wear a swimsuit that matches your piplup?”<br />
<br />
“I never actually thought of tha-”<br />
<br />
“Where are you from?”<br />
<br />
“Cerulean City. A town famous for the most beautiful Gym Leader EVER!! Misty-”<br />
<br />
“What are you going to do now?”<br />
<br />
“Well I-”<br />
<br />
“Do you think you could teach us how to catch Pokémon?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t see why no-”<br />
<br />
“What kind of pokeball are you going to put it in?”<br />
<br />
“Uhhh...”<br />
<br />
The questions wouldn’t stop; Epy waddled over with its trainer’s bag and presented it to her. “Thank you sweety.” Liza said then reached inside her bag and retrieved a special <a href="http://bmgf.bulbagarden.net/f231/pokemart-8711/index183.html#post5105785" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fbmgf.bulbagarden.net%2Ff231%2Fpokemart-8711%2Findex183.html%23post5105785&amp;hash=df30585c2380f6fcf1d03b0d59f2fce8" rel="nofollow noopener">Premier Pokeball</a> she had been holding onto for such an occasion. <br />
<br />
She kneeled over with the Pokeball in hand next to the Splashing Magikarp, “I’m ever so thankful for you helping me in such a tight spot even though you probably didn’t mean to, never the less…I would like for you to join my team…” Liza then presented the ball to the Magikarp, “That is to say, if you want to…”<br />
<br />
A moment passed and though it was probably just Liza's imagination she could of sworn she saw the fish smile before splashing high enough to hit the button of the ball, a red light consuming the fish Pokémon safely inside, the kids watching gleefully as they witnessed someone capturing a Pokémon. When the process was complete Liza held her arm high with the Pokeball in palm and said, “I caught a Magikarp!!.”<br />
<br />
“Pip, pip, pip!” with Epy jumping into the frame, he wheezed a bit from some pain that Liza figured to have been caused by the battle underwater and above and figured it was high time they got to the Pokémon Center to treat him and their new friend.<br />
<br />
Liza looked out to the horizon, it sure had been a crazy day, but a memorable one at that...the sun was setting painting the sky in many beautiful colors, watching the sunset was always her favorite thing to do at the beach.<br />
<br />
She said goodbye to the kids that had been pestering her, and told them to be safe before making her way toward the Pokémon Center for some rest and relaxation. Liza and her Piplup walking away from the beach, with the days events still fresh in their minds and hearts of the famous isle known to all trainers of Fizzy Bubbles, the Arcane Realm.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"><br />

<span style="color: pink">Ooc: I'd like to thank Pikagod for starting my adventure off even though my first attempt of an intro was considered to be self updating...Stark, for so graciously taking over and writing such a interesting story with so many twists and turns that I didn't know where the hell I was going! I apologize if my PM's were annoying at all and as much as I loved the adventure I am glad it’s over, and though I would have liked continuing it, I have bigger fish to fry (see what I did there!?) I hope a time comes where you can be my updator again, and hopefully with the Derby drawing near it will be sooner rather than later. Thanks for the memories!</span></span></div>

Having captured your first wild pokemon you take a moment to reflect on all that has happened. It had been an interesting day to say the least, but now it was time to move on and explore the rest of the land of Fizzy Bubbles. After a quick stop at the Pokecenter, of course. After all, it wouldn't be right to set out on your journey without giving Epy a chance to heal up. Besides, your new <b><i><span style="color: #00FFFF">Level 5 Female Magikarp</span></i></b> might need a little check up as well since she got hit by that Water Gun and splashed around on the beach for so long. The Arcane Realm had been good to you, but now it was time to move on. This isn't just the end of the chapter. It is the beginning of a new story. Your story.</span><br />
<span style="color: #FF0000"><br />
I kind of forgot to let you know about the Magikarp. Thanks for reminding me about it. You can use this post or your last one for quoting to prove your capture when you go to the Egg House to request an egg for the first time. I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed your adventure and I have no doubt you will enjoy many more as you travel through FB. I believe Cascadia here is actively being updated. I also think there are a couple of zones still running over on serebii if you want to check those out. We will also be running a Gen VI event in the near future, so you might want to keep an eye open for that. I will try to remember to post a reminder both here and on serebii about it so that no one misses it. Thanks once again for being such a pleasure to update!</span><br />

<div class="bbWrapper"><div style="text-align: center"><b>The FB Training Zone</b>&#8203;</div><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px">Unlike other Fizzy Bubbles zones, this zone has been created for the sole purpose of introducing new members to RPing FB Style before venturing into current zones. It gives you a chance to familiarise yourselves with how we work and to experiment and expand upon your RPing skills before moving on. <br />
<br />
While the updates I provide here will be far from top quality due to time restraints, they will still provide enough information for you to formulate a decent response and to RP to your highest standard. While updates won't be top-notch, your replies should be as whether or not you're given the ok to leave this zone behind and enter regular zones will depend upon how you reply. You should always be striving to give your replies everything you can as that is what is expected in all FB Zones. Please remember that while FB has Gyms, Contest Halls, Bases, the Arcade, and various other activities as well as Time Out to help pass the time between updates, our primary purpose is role playing and while we don't always expect <i>lengthy</i> replies, we do expect a reasonable degree of <i>quality</i>. Replies don't have to be long to be good as some people are mistakenly inclined to believe.<br />
<br />
<b>Rules</b><br />
- No less than four (4) lines when replying, and by four lines I mean four complete lines of text. Not three or four words before hitting the enter key and writing another three or four words. Decent and articulate sentences are a must.<br />
- No chat speak. No abbreviations. No icons/smilies. Type properly or I'll ignore your post.<br />
- Please proofread posts. It's not only a great way to check for errors, it's also an excellent chance to see if you can expand upon/improve your reply before submitting.<br />
- ALWAYS quote your update by using the quote button in the bottom right-hand corner of the post. If you c/p and add Quote tags, your post will be ignored. Also, don't quote the entire post, only the update that has been written for you.<br />
- When using attacks for battle, please state clearly what you are ordering your Pokémon to do, and order no more than three attacks (offensive or defensive) per round of battle.<br />
- <i>Never</i> take it upon yourself to encounter or capture a Pokémon. The Pokémon you encounter is entirely up to the discretion of your updator. If you've read through the Updates &amp; Replies Thread you will find that there are several reasons for this rule being in place.<br />
- When in a battle situation, never, <i>ever</i> try to control the moves or reactions of your opponent Pokémon. It's <i>my</i> job to give you an adventure, it's <i>your</i> job to overcome any obstacles I put in your path. Be sure to give clear and precise instructions for the moves you want your Pokémon to use, but don't ever try to control the Pokémon you are battling. I'm hoping I'll never have to PM anyone about editing their reply because they've posted incorrectly. It's embarassing for you, and uncomfortable for me.<br />
- If your Pokémon has a nickname please don't expect me to know it straight off the bat. After a while I do become familiar with the teams of people I update but when you're new to me I'd appreciate it if you would refer to the Pokémon you have, not call them by name. For example, somebody says, <i>&quot;Blaze use Ember!&quot;</i> Ummm, who/what is Blaze? I know it's a Fire Type, but what is it? A Torchic, Charmander, Houndour??? I won't know unless you tell me.<br />
- I do ask that you keep a profile of your FB team in your signature which includes your Pokémon, their levels and genders. I do however understand that not everyone wants to do this so if you could, at the very least, post a link to your registration post I'd appreciate it greatly. If you do neither and I need some information about your Pokémon, there's a strong likelihood you'll be skipped.<br />
<br />
And lastly, I'm not expecting everyone to start off perfectly here. Mistakes are expected and I'm more than happy to offer pointers/advice when asked for it, as are many FB members. I'm lenient to a point, but if you've been informed about something that has been done wrong and continue to ignore the advice given to correct it, then you will be ignored. End of story.<br />
<br />
Now that formalities are out of the way, how about we get down to business? Below are a list of areas you may enter (only one area at a time), so all you need to do is decide where you would like to travel before making your introductory post.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 26px"><span style="color: paleturquoise"><b>The Arcane Realm</b></span></span>&#8203;</div><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: limegreen"><b><u>Forest of Adventure</u></b> (Please reply in LimeGreen)<br />
According to legend, no trainer can enter this enchanted forest without an adventure befalling them.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: lemonchiffon"><b><u>Mediville</u></b> (Please reply in LemonChiffon)<br />
This well-populated village and its surrounding farmlands contain many low-levelled wild Pokémon suitable for beginning trainers to practice against. Levels are only gained by Pokémon under level 10.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: silver"><b><u>The Graveyard</u></b> (Please reply in Silver)<br />
A haunting graveyard where the spirits of Pokémon have been put to rest. At night a thick fog hangs in the air while the restless spirits of those Pokémon with unfinished business rise from the grave, looking for closure that often never comes.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorange"><b><u>Desert of Illusion</u></b> (Please reply in DarkOrange)<br />
A vast desert, filled with all kinds of Pokémon. It is rumored that two special villages can be found here, but is this fantasy or reality?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: gold"><b><u>Ancient Tomb</u></b> (Please reply in Gold)<br />
An ancient maze supposedly containing the tombs of long-departed kings which is filled with treasure and danger. You will not be able to leave until you find an escape rope and you can't bring one with you.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: deepskyblue"><b><u>The Ocean of Mystery</u></b> (Please reply in DeepSkyBlue)<br />
An ocean with many mysteries that have yet to be solved. Only those with Water Type Pokémon can travel these seas, as whenever a ship has set sail, they have never again been seen. What has happened to these ships, their crew and passengers, is anyone's guess, but few are willing to take their chances by travelling out by boat.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: lightsteelblue"><b><u>Silverton Ranges</u></b> (Please reply in LightSteelBlue)<br />
A snow-capped mountain range where many wild Pokémon reside. Many old mines litter the mountainside from the days when silver was heavily mined, but due to the often below zero temperatures, they were eventually abandoned. Rumor has it however, that there are still many valuable ores hidden within the mountains.</span></span></div>
