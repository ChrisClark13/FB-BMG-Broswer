<br />
<b>Artifical Dragon</b> ~</span> I LOVE WoW, its addictive I know. I only wish I still had it *pout*<br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorange">Igneous had a knack of ending up deep in a sand dune and as he picked himself up once more you pat him on the head in praise. He was trying his hardest after all, that was all you could ask. Igneous was beginning to tire from the repeated offence and all the attacks he was taking were smarting something rotten. This Baltoy was a tough cookie and had no qualms about showing it; fortunately for you its offence seemed more draining than that of your Cyndaquil’s. Now then, time for a new battle plan since Tackle after Tackle after Tackle had merely worn Igneous down. Maybe a defensive approach would be best you surmise. Looking in your bag you can’t find anything that would assist your fiery echidna for the battle and sigh. Having to work with what Igneous had available to him to give him his next orders and watch as he set forth into action. You hoped not to KO the spinning toy in the hopes that once you caught it it would lead you to one of the fabled villages in this desert.<br />
<br />
Igneous slowly approached Baltoy trying to gauge what it would do next. He knew what he was ordered and merely waited for the right moment to strike. Baltoy stopped spinning to observe Igneous curiously only to receive a vicious <b>Leer</b> in return. Not waiting a second Igneous leapt forward and slammed into Baltoy hitting it hard and pushing it through the sand. Before it could recover and attack he spat out a cloud of <b>Smokescreen</b> that covered the sands. Baltoy could be heard whining within the cloud and a bright pink energy surrounded Igneous, the Cyndaquil fighting against it. Just as it looked like he was to be tossed … again the energy dissipated and Igneous fell harmlessly to the sand. It looks like Baltoy is losing energy fast; remember though Igneous is losing energy too with every move he makes and is panting hard from the exertion. Now would be the time to finish it off if you can find it within all the smoke.</span></span>

<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">OH, what race did you play as?! And what class-- Oh, update. Right.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorange">Finally, three consecutive attacks on the Baltoy that have worked successfully. Alina felt an overwhelming sense of pride for her little Cyndaquil, almost not noticing how badly hurt he was. She frowned a little bit, feeling guilty about not bringing a potion or something with her, but there was nothing she could do about that. Sighing she observed the Baltoy's current condition. The smoke still covered it up, making it impossible to find. She was surprised it hadn't Rapid Spinned the cloud of smoke away... it was a very good sign. It was just as worn out as Igneous was, so now would be the time to end this battle once and for all. She then started shuffling through her backpack to find the small red and white ball to catch Pokemon with. It was surprisingly difficult to find, since her backpack was so cluttered. Finally, she found a Pokeball and pulled it out, the sun reflecting off its shiny surface. Alina continued to play with the <a href="http://bmgf.bulbagarden.net/showpost.php?p=617280&amp;postcount=1348" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fbmgf.bulbagarden.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D617280%26postcount%3D1348&amp;hash=2b91a2a4914f18edf0c19e004cda78bd" rel="nofollow noopener">Pokeball</a> a bit by tossing it up in the air and catching it as she waited for smoke to clear so she could capture this little Baltoy. The wait for her was almost excruciating. Would she capture it on the first try, or would Igneous have to take a few more hits? She didn't think her Cyndaquil could take much more... the smoke started to clear slightly, but not fast enough. Damn it, now would be an excellent time for a random gust of wind to blow the rest of it away. None the less, she stood at ready, so she could throw the Pokeball at the Baltoy before it had a chance to do anything else.</span></span></div>

<b>RaunchyFad</b> ~</span> Weird is gooood =3 <br />
<br />
<span style="color: lemonchiffon">As the tables had now seemed to turn in your favour you felt your body relax a little more. Placing your tiny Seedot in harms way against such a gargantuan beast was foolish but with Meowth aiding you maybe, just maybe you could defeat the fat cat. Plucking up the courage, or more like stupidity you insult the Purugly who hisses at you eager to rip your throat out. It was in pain and feared losing the battle and to have you a pitiful excuse of a human throw barbs merely bruised its ego a little more. Rocky rolled her eyes at your behaviour and wondered if she beat the cat she could be leader and have the Glameow rip you apart for embarrassing her. Dropping her power hungry thoughts she awaited the next set of orders as Meowth took a <b>Quick Attack</b> from Purugly slamming it into the wall hard. Dragging your mind away from nut salads consisting of your Pokemon you stumble over your words as you try to get across your battle plan. With somewhat vague instructions (again!), Rocky begins her vengeance on the fat cat.<br />
<br />
Rocky calmed her body down and focused as she <b>Bide</b>ed her time, waiting for the right moment to strike. Meanwhile Meowth was picking itself back up from the hit it took and only just managed to dodge a meaty limbed-<b>Scratch</b> attack by rolling underneath. Meowth’s eyes widened noticing Rocky deep in concentration and ran over to stand in front of her. It remembered what attack this was and baited the Purugly over by throwing insults whilst softly quivering, it was gaining more confidence as the battle progressed it would seem. Purugly charged right for the two Pokemon and picked up speed. Meowth leapt out of the way with plenty of time left as Purugly slammed into Rocky with a <b>Quick Attack</b>. Rocky rolled back hitting the far end of the alley. Picking herself back up feeling terrible from all the attacks she had taken but fuelled by adrenaline and determination ran forward and leapt into Purugly the red energy spiking and smacking the fat cat with double the power pushing it right back and making it pant in pain. Meowth taking the opportunity leapt up and raked a claw down Purugly’s side leave small cuts in its wake. Purugly meowed in pain and got back to its feet as Rocky slammed into it with a <b>Quick Attack</b> of her own though which did less damage than her Bide, but still stung all the same. Meowth bit down on the injured flesh of the Purugly’s side making it whine and drop to its knees only to be smacked with yet another <b>Quick Attack</b> from Rocky. It was fast losing this battle now the double teaming was wearing it down very quickly. Roaring in defiance it disappeared from view, Meowth dropping off its mouth still open from its <b>Bite</b> attack. Suddenly the behemoth appeared next to Rocky and crashed into with dark energy that almost crushed the tiny seed Pokemon. Purugly was acting out of desperation and that <b>Faint Attack</b> had really hurt Rocky. Fortunately the Leed Seed sapped a little more health from Purugly that floated over and replenished Rocky a small amount. She looked battered now and would not take too many more hits. Purugly was looking just as injured and was on its last legs. Meowth was the healthiest of the bunch and moved to stand in front of Rocky in protection knowing this fact. The Glameow were all worriedly whispering amongst one another upon seeing their leader so weakened by a Seedot and a Meowth.</span> <br />
<br />

<br />
<b><span style="color: darkorange"><u>Desert of Illusion</u></span></b><span style="color: darkorange"> (Please reply in <b>darkorange</b>)<br />
<br />
<b>Music Box </b> ~</span> That’s alright. What you do with your character is up to you. <br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorange">Feeling rather silly for forgetting such an important aspect about Ghost Pokemon you play with sand next to you wishing the ground could just swallow you up. You drag yourself out of your misery long enough to see Squirt’s Hydro Pump hit home and feel a little better, at least that attack works. Squirt looks towards you and you suggest that since Hydro Pump is that only attack that will work that he sticks with that. You glance over to Cacnea who’s watching the battle with great interest and cheering on Squirt. You wonder for a moment if you could use it in battle before you realise that as a wild Pokemon it probably wouldn’t obey you anyway. You couldn’t afford to lose this battle, you came to see the villages and having found one your chance to see it in all its glory was at stake. If you did your time here would have been a waste … well maybe not entirely as you glance at the little cactus that seemed happy around you. With orders to use two more Hydro Pumps Squirt set to work. He blasted that cold pressurised jet at Banette who dodged it this time and shot back with another <b>Nightshade</b> that knocked Squirt back onto his butt. Picking himself back up he focused on his opponent ready to attack and at the right moment shot another <b>Hydro Pump</b> at Banette who <b>Screech</b>ed at the same time cutting the attack short leaving a short spray that hit the ghost and pushed it up into the air. Hydro Pump was a powerful attack and such was draining Squirts energy already and he was getting tired. Banette upon seeing this shook its head eyes coloured with disappointment, it had been a long time since it had a good challenge and this Pokemon was merely too weak to provide it. <br />
<br />
Suddenly its eyes light up as it gets an idea and grins. It gathers light blue energy in its hands and throws it at Squirt. Squirt gasps as the energy surrounds him and shines so bright you have to turn your head away. When the energy dissipates you gasp as you see what’s left. Squirt looks down and notices that the ground is further away than before. His claws are bigger and belly is definitely larger. He turns to face you and you see a Croconaw staring back at you. What had Banette done? Banette grinned pleased with its work and hissed out “Better … challenge” in English that makes your jaw nearly hit the ground. Not only had it evolved your Pokemon … it can talk!! This is nearly enough to make your brain overload. “Temp ..porary” Banette hisses out whilst urging Squirt to battle. Cacnea whose mouth was wide open held its arms out wide hoping that Banette would evolve it too. Well it seems that Banette wanted a more even challenge and by temporarily evolving Squirt has obtained it. </span><br />
<br />
<i>You now have a Level 21 Croconaw who knows all the attacks up to and including that level (including any egg/mt/tm moves already taught)</i><br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorange"><b>Artifical Dragon</b> ~</span> I was Human Paladin for ages, then decided to play again as an Undead Mage … should’ve chose the undead first, they’re very fun. What about you?<br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorange"> Finally, your battle strategy had worked and Igneous looked damn pleased by that fact. It seemed that Baltoy was running low on energy and it was proving to be its downfall. You stare at the cloud of smoke watching as it slowly starts to clear and hoping to spot Baltoy within once it did. Routing through your bag you pull out an empty Pokeball intending to capture the spinning toy when it was visible. The smoke sure was taking its time in disspating and you hoped a nice strong gust of wind would suddenly appear to aid you … no such luck. Sitting down you watch the smoke rise further into the air and can almost see through it. Holding the Pokeball tightly you focus intently on the cloud ready to throw the object and as soon as it’s clear enough to see you pull back your arm but stop. Where’s Baltoy gone? It’s not within the smokescreen anymore. Igneous ran forward searching for the illusive creature when a whizzing noise sounds from behind him. He has enough time to turn around as Baltoy slams into him with a <b>Rapid Spin</b> Baltoy careening into a dune itself from the attack. Ou curse the crafty toy and throw your Pokeball now you have the chance watching it bounce of its tan skin and absorbing it inside. Running to check over Igneous you could see him looking battered and bruised, that Baltoy didn’t know when to give up, an admirable quality non-the-less. Holding Igneous tight to you and watch as the Pokeball shakes, Baltoy fighting its bonds before it finally stops, the red light dimming. <b>Congratulations. You have captured a Level 05, genderless Baltoy.</b>. Now you had two injured Pokemon on your hands, would you be able to get them healed up and convince Baltoy to lead you to one of the fabled villages? </span><br />
<br />
<i>With Baltoy’s capture you have unlocked your rights to the Egg House</i><br />

<b>Lemon~Lime</b> ~ Upon seeing your Gligar holding his bleeding chest you shudder feeling a cold chill run down your spine. It never seemed like this on TV, Pokemon never bled when they were injured. The creature you faced was vicious and unrelenting, you hadn’t expected to come across something so feral but you reason that it’s powerful and would make a great addition to your team. For now, you would need to finish off the battle, hopefully with you and Scorpio winning, and go on from there. You urge Scorpio to dig deep down to find the energy to carry on and Scorpio nods, not wanting to disappoint you. Locking eyes you feel confident that you could, no <i>would</i> defeat this Sableye. Feeling renewed hope you yell out your instructions Scorpio wasting no time in powering up his attack. Sableye had made it back to its feet and shot a <b>Leer</b> at Scorpio who shuddered and tries as best as he could to continue his attack. Sableye roared and ran towards Scorpio whom was grimacing drawing all the energy he could despite his fear. Just as Sableye leapt claws outstretched Scorpio, claws dripping with poison unleashed his attack. It wasn’t at full power but he had to attack at the right time and he did. Sableye was struck with the poison energy again and thrown back into the side of the mine before crashing down to the ground its eyes closed in pain. <b>Level Up for Scorpio</b>. Scorpio tiredly looked to you but with a big grin on his face, you had both won your first battle together. Now the only question was what were you going to do with the Sableye?</span></span></div>

<b>empoleon dynamite</b> ~ The Teddiursa swayed on wobbly legs as it struggled to maintain its upright position, it certainly didn’t look too good. Clutching an empty Pokebll at your side you command Fungi to stand down, not wanting to continue the fight into the dead of night. Fungi reluctantly backed off and Teddiursa blinked in confusion. This was your moment; let’s hope it works out the way you planned. Throwing the red and white orb at the small teddy you watch as a look of recognition flickers over its face before it’s struck by the device. Time seems to stand still as the bear looks down at the orb before its body turns to red energy and it’s sucked inside. The ball locks shut but wobbles furiously and you wonder if you threw it at the right time. Holding your breath for fear the teddy may break free the ball suddenly stops wobbling and the light goes out. <b>Congratulations. You have captured a Level 06, Male Teddiursa</b>. You bend down to pick up your new team-mate enclosed in its capture device and smile. It had fought hard and really could have broken free of the Pokeball if it tried, but maybe … just maybe … it wanted to be with you. Now all that’s left is to leave the beautiful forest and continue your travels, there’s a big wide world there for you and your team to explore.</span></span>

<span style="color: limegreen"><br />
Wes walked over to where the Teddy had been stood and picked up the Pokeball. “We did it Fungi”, he grinned. However, Shroomish looked slightly disappointed. He had been battling so well and it was over so soon. Wes sensed this and picked up the Mushroom Pokémon. “I’m sorry pal. If it’s any constellation, I knew you would have won”, Wes put on a smile which Shroomish seemed to ignore, “Tomorrow morning we’re going to travel to mainland Fizzy Bubbles. I know battles are going to be harder there and I know I can count on you.”<br />
<br />
Wes stroked Fungi’s firm hide affectionately. It looked endearingly at Wes before jumping out of his arms. The Forest had definitely lived up to its name – there couldn’t have been a better way to start an adventure. The two of them left the forest opening and made there way out of the woodland.</span></span></div>

<b>Lemon~Lime</b> ~ Upon seeing your Gligar holding his bleeding chest you shudder feeling a cold chill run down your spine. It never seemed like this on TV, Pokemon never bled when they were injured. The creature you faced was vicious and unrelenting, you hadn’t expected to come across something so feral but you reason that it’s powerful and would make a great addition to your team. For now, you would need to finish off the battle, hopefully with you and Scorpio winning, and go on from there. You urge Scorpio to dig deep down to find the energy to carry on and Scorpio nods, not wanting to disappoint you. Locking eyes you feel confident that you could, no <i>would</i> defeat this Sableye. Feeling renewed hope you yell out your instructions Scorpio wasting no time in powering up his attack. Sableye had made it back to its feet and shot a <b>Leer</b> at Scorpio who shuddered and tries as best as he could to continue his attack. Sableye roared and ran towards Scorpio whom was grimacing drawing all the energy he could despite his fear. Just as Sableye leapt claws outstretched Scorpio, claws dripping with poison unleashed his attack. It wasn’t at full power but he had to attack at the right time and he did. Sableye was struck with the poison energy again and thrown back into the side of the mine before crashing down to the ground its eyes closed in pain. <b>Level Up for Scorpio</b>. Scorpio tiredly looked to you but with a big grin on his face, you had both won your first battle together. Now the only question was what were you going to do with the Sableye?</span></span>

He nodded at Scorpio and said &quot;Good job! Take a rest now.&quot;, returning him into his Pokeball with the touch of a button. He then looked down at the <a href="http://bmgf.bulbagarden.net/showthread.php?p=601316#post601316" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fbmgf.bulbagarden.net%2Fshowthread.php%3Fp%3D601316%23post601316&amp;hash=ddb088dbc714653ca2939469464aa694" rel="nofollow noopener">Pokeball</a> he held in his hand and tossed it at the Sableye, preparing to rush back into the cave and search for the jewels the Sableye was guarding as soon as it was captured.

<br />
<span style="color: darkorange"><b>Artifical Dragon</b> ~</span> I was Human Paladin for ages, then decided to play again as an Undead Mage … should’ve chose the undead first, they’re very fun. What about you?<br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorange"> Finally, your battle strategy had worked and Igneous looked damn pleased by that fact. It seemed that Baltoy was running low on energy and it was proving to be its downfall. You stare at the cloud of smoke watching as it slowly starts to clear and hoping to spot Baltoy within once it did. Routing through your bag you pull out an empty Pokeball intending to capture the spinning toy when it was visible. The smoke sure was taking its time in disspating and you hoped a nice strong gust of wind would suddenly appear to aid you … no such luck. Sitting down you watch the smoke rise further into the air and can almost see through it. Holding the Pokeball tightly you focus intently on the cloud ready to throw the object and as soon as it’s clear enough to see you pull back your arm but stop. Where’s Baltoy gone? It’s not within the smokescreen anymore. Igneous ran forward searching for the illusive creature when a whizzing noise sounds from behind him. He has enough time to turn around as Baltoy slams into him with a <b>Rapid Spin</b> Baltoy careening into a dune itself from the attack. Ou curse the crafty toy and throw your Pokeball now you have the chance watching it bounce of its tan skin and absorbing it inside. Running to check over Igneous you could see him looking battered and bruised, that Baltoy didn’t know when to give up, an admirable quality non-the-less. Holding Igneous tight to you and watch as the Pokeball shakes, Baltoy fighting its bonds before it finally stops, the red light dimming. <b>Congratulations. You have captured a Level 05, genderless Baltoy.</b>. Now you had two injured Pokemon on your hands, would you be able to get them healed up and convince Baltoy to lead you to one of the fabled villages? </span><br />
<br />
<i>With Baltoy’s capture you have unlocked your rights to the Egg House</i><br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">I play as a Tauren Druid. Running around as a kitty cat with horns has its perks. <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite8" alt=":D" title="Big Grin    :D" data-shortname=":D" /><br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorange">Alina sighed with relief. Thank god that's over with. Igneous looked pleased with himself but was too tired to even walk. He was probably just as relieved as his trainer was. Alina picked up the shiny ball and smiled to herself. Her first capture... the first of many. Tapping the pokeball once the Baltoy burst out in a flash of red light. It weakly spun around shaking a little bit from its weariness. Alina felt guilty for not letting it rest yet, but she'd give it plenty of time to do that later. Right now, she desperately needed to find that village. She placed her tired Cyndaquil in her backpack to rest a bit, then went to pick up her new Baltoy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, you're mine now. No more tricks,&quot; Alina began, attempting to sound strict but failing miserably. The Baltoy stared back with an indifferent face (If Baltoy can even show emotions with their faces... who knows). &quot;All three of us are exhausted and want to rest, and we won't get to do that unless you lead us to that village,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
The Baltoy didn't look happy at all as Alina put it down on the ground as gently as she could. It gave one evil look at the Cyndaquil now sleeping in her backpack, probably thinking &quot;stupid thing, I would've never got captured if it wasn't for you.&quot; None the less, the Baltoy reluctantly began to spin away, Alina closely following.<br />
<br />
After a long period of silence, Alina then said &quot;I need to think up a name for you. I was never good with names.&quot; She waited for an answer but none came. After pondering for a moment Alina remembered a name from one of her favorite songs and decided that would be a good name. &quot;Parabola, there we go! That'll be your name.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Baltoy made a sound as if to sigh and thought to itself &quot;What a lame name. Oh god, I'm going to be stuck with this trainer forever... Maybe I could sneak off--&quot; it chanced another look at that evil Cyndaquil and the completely oblivious trainer that followed it. &quot;Nah.&quot;<br />
<br />
Parabola continued to spin off in the same direction as Alina followed with high hopes.</span></span></div>

<span style="color: lemonchiffon">As the tables had now seemed to turn in your favour you felt your body relax a little more. Placing your tiny Seedot in harms way against such a gargantuan beast was foolish but with Meowth aiding you maybe, just maybe you could defeat the fat cat. Plucking up the courage, or more like stupidity you insult the Purugly who hisses at you eager to rip your throat out. It was in pain and feared losing the battle and to have you a pitiful excuse of a human throw barbs merely bruised its ego a little more. Rocky rolled her eyes at your behaviour and wondered if she beat the cat she could be leader and have the Glameow rip you apart for embarrassing her. Dropping her power hungry thoughts she awaited the next set of orders as Meowth took a <b>Quick Attack</b> from Purugly slamming it into the wall hard. Dragging your mind away from nut salads consisting of your Pokemon you stumble over your words as you try to get across your battle plan. With somewhat vague instructions (again!), Rocky begins her vengeance on the fat cat.<br />
<br />
Rocky calmed her body down and focused as she <b>Bide</b>ed her time, waiting for the right moment to strike. Meanwhile Meowth was picking itself back up from the hit it took and only just managed to dodge a meaty limbed-<b>Scratch</b> attack by rolling underneath. Meowth’s eyes widened noticing Rocky deep in concentration and ran over to stand in front of her. It remembered what attack this was and baited the Purugly over by throwing insults whilst softly quivering, it was gaining more confidence as the battle progressed it would seem. Purugly charged right for the two Pokemon and picked up speed. Meowth leapt out of the way with plenty of time left as Purugly slammed into Rocky with a <b>Quick Attack</b>. Rocky rolled back hitting the far end of the alley. Picking herself back up feeling terrible from all the attacks she had taken but fuelled by adrenaline and determination ran forward and leapt into Purugly the red energy spiking and smacking the fat cat with double the power pushing it right back and making it pant in pain. Meowth taking the opportunity leapt up and raked a claw down Purugly’s side leave small cuts in its wake. Purugly meowed in pain and got back to its feet as Rocky slammed into it with a <b>Quick Attack</b> of her own though which did less damage than her Bide, but still stung all the same. Meowth bit down on the injured flesh of the Purugly’s side making it whine and drop to its knees only to be smacked with yet another <b>Quick Attack</b> from Rocky. It was fast losing this battle now the double teaming was wearing it down very quickly. Roaring in defiance it disappeared from view, Meowth dropping off its mouth still open from its <b>Bite</b> attack. Suddenly the behemoth appeared next to Rocky and crashed into with dark energy that almost crushed the tiny seed Pokemon. Purugly was acting out of desperation and that <b>Faint Attack</b> had really hurt Rocky. Fortunately the Leed Seed sapped a little more health from Purugly that floated over and replenished Rocky a small amount. She looked battered now and would not take too many more hits. Purugly was looking just as injured and was on its last legs. Meowth was the healthiest of the bunch and moved to stand in front of Rocky in protection knowing this fact. The Glameow were all worriedly whispering amongst one another upon seeing their leader so weakened by a Seedot and a Meowth.</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: lemonchiffon"><span style="font-size: 9px">Rocky sighed in exhaustion. Even with the leech seeds that occasionally restored her heath, she didn’t feel like she could go on much longer. She was cool with this, however, as she was the one who started the fight in the first place and by all means she was determined to end it just the same. At the moment, though, instead of giving it her all she found herself hiding behind the meowth, hoping that the leech seeds might kick in a little harder now that she felt like she was going to faint. <br />
<br />
Paul meanwhile began biting his nails. It just kicked into him how bloody the skin around Rocky’s eyes had become, and how cracked and marred her hard outer shell was. Frankly it made him nervous.<br />
<br />
“Aw, jeez,” he said whilst looking at the ground in slight disgust. “Yeah, just, just <b>harden</b> little buddy.” He then looked back up to the purugly and saw that it had been damaged just as much, and his stomach churned at the sight of the bruises and cuts that covered its body. “No more biding, Rocky. Just do those <b>quick attacks</b> and try not to get stuck underneath that moose, man, that wouldn’t end well. And li’l bobcat, you know what to do, I think. Uh, don’t let Rocky pass out, try and end this, okay?” He took another look at the situation, and upon seeing that the meowth was the only lively participant in this battle made him feel like dry-heaving.<br />

<br />
<b>Furrett</b> ~ Hugging Sentret close to your body you congratulated him on his win and celebrated loudly in the silent Cemetery. With one free arm you manage to grasp an empty Pokeball from your bag and throw it at the downed Natu hoping to add a new member to your team. As the ball drew Natu inside you released your spunky Kecleon Seldon who grinned and gave a wild yell. You hear a soft ding and look over to your now full Pokeball; <b>congratulations you have captured a Level 05, Male Natu</b>. Upon seeing Omega’s change in demeanour you turn around to see the spectre of an old woman smiling at you and praising you for your well fought battle. You shake a little in fear, although you had come to the Cemetery to find ghosts this was not the kind you were thinking of. Finding your voice you thank her for her praise but put the victory down to your hardworking Sentret who, although a little nervous, smiled proudly. The old woman chuckled to herself and spoke again.<br />
<br />
“Your first battle will always be your most memorable and I thank you for sharing that with me young man. Both trainer and Pokemon work together to overcome the odds and you beat a tough opponent in Natu.” She said and you feel a little more at ease the more she talks to you, she seems to mean you no harm.<br />
<br />
“Natu has been alone in this Cemetery for a long time now, its good to see that he will finally have some company. You shouldn’t spend you entire life with the dead.” She said cryptically. <br />
<br />
“Could you possibly do this old woman a favour? Would you take Natu to the tomb at the centre of the Cemetery, he had some family there I know would want to say goodbye and I’m sure they would want to see his new trainer,” she said pointing in the direction of the tomb. </span><br />
<br />
<i>With Natu’s capture you have now unlocked your rights to the Egg House</i> <br />

<br />
<span style="color: silver"><span style="font-size: 9px">Poatato drew his eyes away from the woman for an instant to see the tomb where his Natu’s family lived. Assuming they <i>were</i> alive. He spotted it, then drew his eyes back to the ghostly figure. <br />
<br />
“Sure, I’ll do that.” Potato said agreeably. “I’m sure Natu would like to say goodbye as well.” <br />
<br />
Potato walked over to the pokeball containing his very first ever capture. Pride welled inside him, of himself mostly, selfish as it was, but for Omega, too. He pressed the center button, and the jagged line of red energy spiked out toward the ground, rematerializing as his Natu. <br />
<br />
Potato smiled at the feathered, hopefully, friend. Omega rubbed a wound on his flank, but smiled at the bird anyway. Seldon twirled on one foot with her arms extended to 90 degree angles twice, then stopped and gave an excited “Leon!”<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey... welcome to the team, Natu!&quot; Potato shouted, contrasting the quiet graveyard. &quot;I hope you um... Like us.&quot;<br />
<br />
He wasn't entirely sure, but he thought he saw Natu roll his eyes.<br />
<br />
Then he turned his head to the ghost.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; Potato said. &quot;I guess I'll go meet the family.&quot; <br />
<br />
With a last glance at the woman, Potato began walking toward the tomb.<br />
<br />
Potato gave a last look at the astral woman, then began walking over to the tomb.<br />

<b>Concore</b> ~ You listened to the girls sorrowful story as she tried to stop her tears to no avail. You wracked your brain for information on the Pokemon she mentioned, a Wynaut you had heard of them before. Suddenly as it hits you, you reminisce on the memory smiling at the good times you had. Brought back to reality by the girl’s confused look you smile gently at her and give a possible explanation for Wynaut’s disappearance relating back to experiences you had had with your own Psychic Pokemon. Caitlin sniffed and dried her tears on the sleeve of her top as she contemplated your words.<br />
<br />
“You really think that could be what happened?” she asked with a little hope lining her tone of voice. You nod your head and she perks up a little. “Maybe … maybe Crystal got lost when she went for a walk then and … she really does love me too?” she asked looking for you like you had the answer to that question. Not wanting to further damage the young girl’s already frazzled emotions you agree and she gives you her first smile which only widens when you agree to help her search for Crystal. You beckon over Spector who stops his lazy swimming to wade over to you both. Caitlin smiles at the Drowsee and says ‘Hello’ feeling more comfortable with another Psychic Pokemon trainer. <br />
<br />
“The street is at the far end of town over there,” she says pointing. “I’ll show you the way,” she said walking ahead while you and Spector follow behind. As you walk through the streets and near your destination you notice how quiet your surroundings become with less and less people milling around compared to the centre of town. You must have been walking for a good 30 minutes when Caitlin stops her gaze set on a dark street in the distance.<br />
<br />
“Its over there, we should be really careful. Daddy says I should never come here and I don’t want to but if Crystal is in there somewhere I have to be brave; and you’ll both protect me,” she says sounding confident of that last statement that had you a little worried.<br />
<br />
Taking point you enter the darkened street with Caitlin behind you and Spector bringing up the rear. You see that the few shops dotted here deal in rather weird and illegal produce and most are covered with thick bars and doors with slide-slots to only allow access to the right people. You walk past a pair of Raticate that hiss at you angrily with their rabid red eyes eying your flesh and a man sat outside a decrepit house grinning at you maliciously. Picking up the pace you hear a set of loud voices coming from inside a small warehouse. You think nothing of it but hear the mention of rare Pokemon and find your intrigue peaked. You motion for Caitlin to follow which she does keeping very close to you as walk down an alley to the back of the warehouse. Stopping outside a window you can hear several voices deep in conversation.<br />
<br />
“I found it wandering the streets this morning, pretty little thing isn’t it,” one voice said and you could almost feel the leer of his gaze from the tone alone.<br />
<br />
“It is a rare little sell you’ve found there, will fetch a good price at the Black Market for sure,” another said with admiration.<br />
<br />
“What can I say, I always get the best merchandise,” he says chuckling in a deep voice.<br />
A soft voice whines and is followed by the sound of a cane hitting flesh and a squeal of pain.<br />
<br />
“Stop whimpering, we’ll find you a nice owner soon enough,” the man says laughing.<br />
<br />
Whatever’s going on in there it doesn’t sound very legal, maybe you’ve stumbled on to what you were searching for but you have no idea of what is lurking inside that warehouse waiting for you.</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: LemonChiffon">Verne began to wonder what he let himself in for; looking around it was clear to see why Caitlin’s father wouldn’t let her down here, the sinister dens and dives that lined the street clearly housed illicit activities, but for now they had to keep focus on what they were here for.<br />
<br />
Verne glanced down at Caitlin, he saw the determination on her face, “Caitlin seems to be coping, she must really feel for her Crystal” He thought to himself.<br />
<br />
The broken, echoing voices of two men caught the attention of Verne from down one of the dank alleyways. He flagged over Caitlin who was behind him, who was in turn, followed by the plodding footsteps of Spector. They creped down the alley and cowered under the broken window of the warehouse, listening to the conversation unravelling inside.<br />
<br />
Already horrified by the what they heard the men saying, it was the heart-piercing screams of the Pokémon inside was enough for Verne, he signalled for Spector to crawl around in front of Caitlin, “OK buddy, you ready for some action” Verne whispered into the Drowzee’s ear. Spector took in a short breath, before nodding confidently.<br />
<br />
Verne clambered to his feet, and glared through the window, “Gents, I suggest you stop that at once!” He shouted.</span></span></div>

<b>Music Box </b> ~</span> That’s alright. What you do with your character is up to you. <br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorange">Feeling rather silly for forgetting such an important aspect about Ghost Pokemon you play with sand next to you wishing the ground could just swallow you up. You drag yourself out of your misery long enough to see Squirt’s Hydro Pump hit home and feel a little better, at least that attack works. Squirt looks towards you and you suggest that since Hydro Pump is that only attack that will work that he sticks with that. You glance over to Cacnea who’s watching the battle with great interest and cheering on Squirt. You wonder for a moment if you could use it in battle before you realise that as a wild Pokemon it probably wouldn’t obey you anyway. You couldn’t afford to lose this battle, you came to see the villages and having found one your chance to see it in all its glory was at stake. If you did your time here would have been a waste … well maybe not entirely as you glance at the little cactus that seemed happy around you. With orders to use two more Hydro Pumps Squirt set to work. He blasted that cold pressurised jet at Banette who dodged it this time and shot back with another <b>Nightshade</b> that knocked Squirt back onto his butt. Picking himself back up he focused on his opponent ready to attack and at the right moment shot another <b>Hydro Pump</b> at Banette who <b>Screech</b>ed at the same time cutting the attack short leaving a short spray that hit the ghost and pushed it up into the air. Hydro Pump was a powerful attack and such was draining Squirts energy already and he was getting tired. Banette upon seeing this shook its head eyes coloured with disappointment, it had been a long time since it had a good challenge and this Pokemon was merely too weak to provide it. <br />
<br />
Suddenly its eyes light up as it gets an idea and grins. It gathers light blue energy in its hands and throws it at Squirt. Squirt gasps as the energy surrounds him and shines so bright you have to turn your head away. When the energy dissipates you gasp as you see what’s left. Squirt looks down and notices that the ground is further away than before. His claws are bigger and belly is definitely larger. He turns to face you and you see a Croconaw staring back at you. What had Banette done? Banette grinned pleased with its work and hissed out “Better … challenge” in English that makes your jaw nearly hit the ground. Not only had it evolved your Pokemon … it can talk!! This is nearly enough to make your brain overload. “Temp ..porary” Banette hisses out whilst urging Squirt to battle. Cacnea whose mouth was wide open held its arms out wide hoping that Banette would evolve it too. Well it seems that Banette wanted a more even challenge and by temporarily evolving Squirt has obtained it. </span><br />
<br />
<i>You now have a Level 21 Croconaw who knows all the attacks up to and including that level (including any egg/mt/tm moves already taught)</i></span>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">All Tim could do was stare in awe at his newly evolved Coconaw. Squirt looked more terrifying with his large fangs and claws, not to mention Squirts dark green skin which made him look more like a crocodile. &quot;C- C- Coconaw!?&quot; Tim stumbled through his bag for his pokedex because Tim really couldn't believe what he saw. Once he finally found it he found this to be no illusion. &quot;This is so amazing!! Squirt evolved and he can talk!?&quot; shouted Tim when he remembered what Banette said. “Temp ..porary” Tim sent a look of gratitude towards Banette and decided to hold off on his plan until later. &quot;Just in case Squirt turns back into Totodile before the battle ends, I'll hold off on my plan.&quot; *grip* Tim clenched his hands tightly as he became more hopeful for the win. &quot;Hey Squirt! My dex said you have more moves to your arsenal and I'm guessing that's temporary too. So we better take advantage of this while it lasts.&quot; Croconaw nodded in agreement. &quot;Most defiantly!&quot; Squirt said in a British accent. &quot;WOW! YOU EVEN HAVE A COOL ACCENT!&quot; Tim said in awe. Tim shook his head to get his mind back in the game. &quot;Okay! Squirt, use <b>Leer</b>, and follow up with <b>Ice Fang</b> and <b>Bite</b>!&quot; Tim shouted to Squirt. &quot;Rightyo then Tim! Leer! Ice Fang! Hydro Pump!&quot; exclaimed Squirt. Tim looked to the side to see Cacnea who was obviously envious towards Squirt for his evolution, even though it's temporary. Tim smiled towards Cacnea and thought, &quot;It's decided, before I leave I'll ask Cacnea to join me.&quot;</span><br />
<br />
Thanks for the surprising boost! I thought I was a goner for sure. =]</span></div>

<b>RaunchyFad</b> ~ This battle was intense and it felt like it was drawing to a brutal and painful close. Rocky was feeling the effects of this war more than any other Pokemon involved. Her body was marred with scratches and bruises but she didn’t care, she had started the fight with the beast, she had not expected to come out of it unscathed. She would see this fight to the end, even if it meant her end, an admirable and brave thought indeed. Taking a moment she was glad she had Meowth in front of her for the time being giving her a much needed break to recuperate and gather herself. As a trainer you knew that Pokemon get injured in fights but to it first hand, to see how worm and battered Rocky was made your stomach turn and you nervous for her wellbeing. Biting your lip you tell her to just harden up for now whilst observing the injuries sustained by their foe, the Purugly. It looked just as beaten as your own, but it had underestimate Rocky and Meowth and by challenging you had brought this upon itself. Time to finish this. <br />
<br />
Rocky with her orders clear sits back and <b>Harden</b>s her skin boosting her defence for the time being. Meowth remained her shield for now keeping its watchful eye on Purugly, the cat in question biding its time and waiting to strike. Meowth knew that to attack it would have to leave Rocky and get closer to Purugly. Sighing it looked over its shoulder to Rocky sending a silent message to her before running at Purugly. As it reached the fat cat it received a swipe of the claw in a heavy <b>Scratch</b> attack swatting it aside. With its main target in sight Purugly charged at Rocky before pulling back its meaty limbs to attack. Feeling your heart lurch in your chest you watch as it move to take the final strike. Just as its paws land Rocky vanishes speeding out of the way. Slumping against the wall in relief you spot Rocky appear at Purugly’s side and smack right into it. Mewoth having recovered enough from its blow leapt up onto Purugly’s back and <b>Scratch</b>ed away make it buck in pain. It roared angrily and tried to dislodge the smaller feline. Rocky with what was left of her strength ran at Purugly again striking it with another <b>Quick Attack</b> knocking its legs from underneath it this time. Purugly collapsed to the ground. Meowth still clinging on opened its mouth wide and bit down hard on its neck willing it to pass out already. Purugly whined in pain and its head smacked the ground as it succumbed to darkness. <i><b>Level up for Rocky</b></i>. Meowth leaps off Purugly wiping its mouth free of fur and gave it a harsh glare, it had gotten its vengeance for the terror Purugly had reined on the streets of Mediville. Rocky stumbled over to you pleased at her victory but wanting nothing more than to rest now. The Glameow all nervous talked to each other looking down at their fallen leader before they scattered leaving you alone in the dark alley with the downed Purugly, Meowth and Rocky. <br />

<b>Concore</b> ~ As you stood by the open window listening to the two men inside the warehouse discussing their latest find you wondered who would willingly come to this place. Caitlin, despite the horrid environment was maintaining her composure, probably confident that you’d protect her and her mind was obviously on her missing Pokemon. Hearing the squeals of Pokemon being abused you hold back your anger you signal Spector to stay with Caitlin, you were going to deal with these men right now. Getting to your feet you calmly suggest the two men inside stop what they’re doing causing them to do what you ask, stop to find the source of the voice. <br />
<br />
“Is that the police,” one whispered to the other, “Would they dare to come down here?” he nervously asked his companion. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile Caitlin having too heard the screams of Pokemon was holding back her tears before running towards a door pushing it open and slowly walking inside. Spector called after her and threw his hands up in annoyance before motioned for you, running after the small girl. ‘Well its time to face the two thugs inside’, you thought as you followed after Spector entering the small warehouse to see him standing in front of Caitlin holding her back. The two men looked at the three of you with bemused expressions on their faces. Caitlin was calling out for Crystal who you spotted next the man wearing a long worn brown trench coat. She was wearing a short leash that was attached to the wall by a metal ring. She held her ear-like arms out for Caitlin crying in fear. <br />
<br />
“Well well, what are two young children like you doing here?” the guy in the trench coat asked.<br />
<br />
“You … You. YOU STOLE CRYSTAL. GIVE HER BACK TO ME NOW!” Caitlin yelled with tears running down her cheeks, fighting against Spector. <br />
<br />
“Now why would I want to do that?” he asked leering at you all.<br />
<br />
“Man, what if these brats go to the police. They know you took their Pokemon.” The other man spoke seeming nervous of the idea.<br />
<br />
“They wouldn’t get out of here in one piece if they tried,” The other man said sounding very confident of that.<br />
<br />
“I can’t be involved in this, I’ve done enough time already,” the other guy said running out of the warehouse, the man in the trench coat glaring at his back.<br />
<br />
“Whatever,” he muttered. Turning to face you he grinned. “Well now, we can’t just let you go off and inform the fuzz of our little secret can we. Come with me and I’ll make <i>sure</i> you get home alright.”<br />
<br />
Seeing your resolve he glared and said “You forget about this Wynaut, cause you’re never having it back Its mine to sell now.” He said before pulling his trench coat aside to reveal a Pokeball hidden on his belt. “I wouldn’t want to hurt you now,” he said smirking.<br />

<b>Furrett</b> ~ Upon listening to the old ghostly woman’s request you turn to face where she was pointing to spot a large tomb in the distance. You agree to take Natu there to say goodbye to his family. Picking up Natu’s Pokeball you feel a wave of pride wash over you, this was your very first capture. Releasing its occupant Natu emerges on the ground looking up at you. Omega reminded of his wounds by looking at his feathery team-mate rubbed the sore spot but still managed a warm smile. Seldon performed a little twirl before posing in front of Natu, her way of saying hello. You bend down and welcome Natu to your team yourself adding that you hope you’ll get along. Natu seemed a little indifferent to your welcomes and merely hopped off towards the tomb. You thank the spectral lady one more time before following after Natu, he seemed to know the way. A short walk later you stop in front of a large marble tomb. Trying the door you feel it shut tight, well you weren’t getting in that way. Looking around you spot your new Natu standing before a small marble statue of a proud looking man with a Xatu next to him and a Natu on his shoulder. Natu began to speak to the statue in his own tongue. Approaching him you suddenly see the forms of 3 Xatu appear behind the statue, well that answered your question, they definitely weren’t alive anymore. Natu noticed your approach and pointed towards you. The ghostly apparitions all turn their focus to you and your Pokemon and you feel a cold chill run down your spine for the second time today. The central Xatu pointed its long wing at you,<br />
<br />
“You are the one who has captured Natu?” it asked telepathically and you wince at the question, you assume it can’t be too pleased to see its family capture. You tell it yes and it seems to think. Natu speak to it again and the Xatu nods.<br />
<br />
“Natu says it was a hard fought battle, one that could have been won by either side,” you agree again and it nods “That is Natu’s first defeat, but we can see it is by a strong starting trainer,” it said almost praising you. “I can sense that you have a good heart and will care for Natu … please do” it says before addressing Natu.<br />
<br />
“Natu, we will miss you but you must live. Live on for us and see the world like we all once did. You will feel the joys of working alongside humans as I once did with my best friend. We will always be your family and we will always be thinking of you. We will together again my son but that day is far from now.” Natu nodded a small tear falling from his eye. It hops over to you and gives one last looks back as his family before he hops away with you.</span><br />

<br />
<b>Music Box </b> ~ You were literally flabbergasted! Before you stood Squirt, but not as you knew him. He was taller, fatter around the middle with bigger claws and a larger jaw. He tested his new limbs and grinned over to you. It certainly wasn’t expected but Banette seemed more than pleased by its work. Now with your newly evolved Croconaw you would prove to be more of a challenge for the Marionette Pokemon. Retrieving your Pokedex from your bag you shuffled through to find Croconaw’s page looking through all the new moves Squirt would now know. Whatever you had planned originally you put on hold with this new development. Now to take advantage of the … well new advantage you now had before Squirt reverted back to his old self. Squirt happily replied and you ran through the new attacks one last time, excited to try them out. Giving Croconaw his orders he ran them back to you, stumbling over the last one getting it wrong and you hoped he heard you right. <br />
<br />
Banette grinned, back to the battle then. Croconaw faced Banette and <b>Leer</b>ed at it and thanks to his evolution looked a lot more scary than before and Banette hesitated. Gathering Ice energy in his mouth Squirt leapt up at Banette and chomped on it, passing right through it but leaving the ice damage within the ghost making it wince in pain. Banette pointed a finger at Squirt who became covered in a grey aura making him shudder in pain losing double the energy from his attack; Banette’s <b>Spite</b> had Squirt regret using that move. Squirt made to attack again when he stopped, what was his next move again? Bite or Hydro Pump. He wracked his memory trying to remember what you had instructed him to use. Whilst he was temporarily indisposed Banette cackled and pointing a finger at Squirt again sent forth its shadow, the black form rushing forth striking Squirt making him stumble back a little. That had stung. Deciding to just attack anyway Squirt leapt up and bit down on Banette passing right it again but this time leaving dark energy circulating through its body making it cry out. That super effective move really hit hard. This battle was really getting heated now with both Pokemon pretty even despite the damage Squirt had previously taken. </span> <br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorange"><b>Artifical Dragon</b> ~ Sighing with relief you pick up Igneous whom was pleased at his first victory in battle despite how tired he felt. You were just glad that the arduous battle was finished and with a happy ending too. Picking up Baltoy’s pokeball you tapped it to release the cheeky little toy. It spun around before remembering where it was. It too looked knackered and looked up at you realising what had happened. You felt a little guilty at releasing it so soon after battle but you needed it now, it could rest later. Placing Igneous in your backpack you picked up your new Baltoy and sternly tell it that it belongs to you and you didn’t want to see anymore tricks. You couldn’t quite gauge its reaction but it almost looked like it sulked at that order. You inform it that you all want to rest but first you want to go to one of the villages that lie in the desert somewhere. Placing Baltoy back on the ground it begrudgingly looked up to the sleeping Cyndaquil in your backpack blaming its situation on that; even though it had been the one to start it with its tricks. Reluctantly is began to spin off in one direction and you hoped it was leading you the correct way. <br />
<br />
As you walked along behind Baltoy you searched your mind for a good name for it, after all you just couldn’t keep calling it Baltoy. Remembering one of your favourite songs you inform Baltoy that its now called Parabola and it sighed not quite happy with your choice of name but it would have to deal with it. It pondered spinning off when you weren’t looking but it would have to deal with the evil Cyndaquil in your backpack and you chasing after it or recalling it to that device. Anyway it didn’t have the energy to fight again or run away. The three of you kept moving through the desert and you spot a large sand dune that seemed familiar. Hadn’t Igneous rolled down that one earlier in the day? Nah, these sand dunes all look alike, it must be your imagination. After a long while of walking you head over a sand dune and gasp before looking down at Parabola angrily. It hadn’t lead you to a village, it had lead you to the exit of the Desert of Illusion. Ready to give it a piece of your mind Baltoy looked up to you and you could almost swear that it was grinning at you. It tried to communicate with you but you couldn’t quite understand it. Asking it whether it knew where the villages lay it shook its head, it didn’t. It sighed and lay back in the sands in exhaustion giving you a look that said ‘Please just let me rest now’ before closing its eyes wearily. Well there are not many choices available to you now.</span><br />

<b>Lemon~Lime</b> ~ Hugging your tired and injured Gligar to your chest you are thankful that the battle is over and that you had won. Glancing down at the unconscious Sableye on the ground by the mine’s entrance you feel a wave of compassion. Even though it was quite feral and had attack so relentlessly it was only protecting the gems of the mine. You couldn’t just leave it here in the cold for any person or Pokemon to come along and take advantage off. With an empty Pokeball in hand you threw it at the downed dark gremlin watching as it was absorbed within. Once you had captured it you would go back into the mine again and have a better look around, there had to be some gems left inside. The Pokeball wobbled slightly before the light diminished. <b>Congratulations. You have captured a Level 05, Male Sableye</b>. Picking up your new Pokemon’s ball you enter back into the mine with Gligar still in your arms. You get to the point where you first encountered Sableye and peer into the darkness. It was pitch black further into the mine, you could use some light before you go any further. Either that or head on out of the mine and back up the mountain.</span><br />
<br />
<i>With Sableye’s capture you have unlocked you rights to the Egg House</i></span></div>

<span style="color: darkorange">&quot;YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING ME,&quot; Alina cried with frustration. &quot;I run around the ENTIRE desert looking for these villages and to only go in a COMPLETE CIRCLE.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her Cyndaquil woke up with a start and jumped out of the backpack, not exactly knowing what was happening, while Parabola continued to just lay there and didn't even twitch. Alina let out a groan and dropped to her knees to just stare at the exit now. Well, at least it was civilization again. It wasn't far from the nearest Pokemon Center now... her Baltoy did the best it could. She dug a <a href="http://bmgf.bulbagarden.net/showpost.php?p=598987&amp;postcount=66" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fbmgf.bulbagarden.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D598987%26postcount%3D66&amp;hash=d13d9bcbacf1a37ceec4cfabc5f7876a" rel="nofollow noopener">Pomeg Berry</a> out of her backpack to give to the Baltoy, as a reward for leading her to the exit of the desert. Parabola stood straight up and eyed the berry curiously, not quite knowing what it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead, eat it. Wait, do you even have a mouth..?&quot; Alina said, now curiously looking over the Baltoy's face. Igneous crawled in her lap to get her attention that he wanted a berry too. After all, he was the one who tracked down and fought that Baltoy. Alina turned away from Parabola to pick out a <a href="http://bmgf.bulbagarden.net/showpost.php?p=586863&amp;postcount=43" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fbmgf.bulbagarden.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D586863%26postcount%3D43&amp;hash=a0e4ffe1874b7db1492b148db02e875d" rel="nofollow noopener">Babiri Berry</a> from her backpack. When she looked back up she saw that the Pomeg Berry she had given her Baltoy had disappeared, and Alina stared in awe. &quot;How the hell did you do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Parabola collapsed on the ground again as Alina stood up, making an extremely happy Igneous roll off her lap. She returned the exhausted Baltoy to its Pokeball and picked up her Cyndaquil, who was still munching on the Babiri Berry. Looking back at the desert for the last time she could see that the sun was now setting, and it was getting cold fast. She felt grateful that she was finally out of the Desert, or she would have to endure one cold night. Ironic how a place so hot could become so cold. Now smiling broadly, she carried her little Cyndaquil in her arms as she exited the Desert of Illusion to continue her adventures elsewhere.</span></span></span></div>

<b>RaunchyFad</b> ~ This battle was intense and it felt like it was drawing to a brutal and painful close. Rocky was feeling the effects of this war more than any other Pokemon involved. Her body was marred with scratches and bruises but she didn’t care, she had started the fight with the beast, she had not expected to come out of it unscathed. She would see this fight to the end, even if it meant her end, an admirable and brave thought indeed. Taking a moment she was glad she had Meowth in front of her for the time being giving her a much needed break to recuperate and gather herself. As a trainer you knew that Pokemon get injured in fights but to it first hand, to see how worm and battered Rocky was made your stomach turn and you nervous for her wellbeing. Biting your lip you tell her to just harden up for now whilst observing the injuries sustained by their foe, the Purugly. It looked just as beaten as your own, but it had underestimate Rocky and Meowth and by challenging you had brought this upon itself. Time to finish this. <br />
<br />
Rocky with her orders clear sits back and <b>Harden</b>s her skin boosting her defence for the time being. Meowth remained her shield for now keeping its watchful eye on Purugly, the cat in question biding its time and waiting to strike. Meowth knew that to attack it would have to leave Rocky and get closer to Purugly. Sighing it looked over its shoulder to Rocky sending a silent message to her before running at Purugly. As it reached the fat cat it received a swipe of the claw in a heavy <b>Scratch</b> attack swatting it aside. With its main target in sight Purugly charged at Rocky before pulling back its meaty limbs to attack. Feeling your heart lurch in your chest you watch as it move to take the final strike. Just as its paws land Rocky vanishes speeding out of the way. Slumping against the wall in relief you spot Rocky appear at Purugly’s side and smack right into it. Mewoth having recovered enough from its blow leapt up onto Purugly’s back and <b>Scratch</b>ed away make it buck in pain. It roared angrily and tried to dislodge the smaller feline. Rocky with what was left of her strength ran at Purugly again striking it with another <b>Quick Attack</b> knocking its legs from underneath it this time. Purugly collapsed to the ground. Meowth still clinging on opened its mouth wide and bit down hard on its neck willing it to pass out already. Purugly whined in pain and its head smacked the ground as it succumbed to darkness. <i><b>Level up for Rocky</b></i>. Meowth leaps off Purugly wiping its mouth free of fur and gave it a harsh glare, it had gotten its vengeance for the terror Purugly had reined on the streets of Mediville. Rocky stumbled over to you pleased at her victory but wanting nothing more than to rest now. The Glameow all nervous talked to each other looking down at their fallen leader before they scattered leaving you alone in the dark alley with the downed Purugly, Meowth and Rocky.</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: lemonchiffon">“Jeeeeeeez,” Paul moaned before sighing in relief. It was over, finally! He could finally leave this alley and find a place in this blasted town that was as far as can be from cats. Before moving from him place, however, he slumped to the ground and picked up his seedot. Her eyes were all squinty and she seemed barely alive, but she had done an excellent job and earned herself a gentle hug from her ignoramus trainer. “We’ll go smoke doobs after this,” he whispered to her, a smile plastered on his face. Though this would’ve normally earned him a slap, Rocky quietly agreed in her own way even though without a mouth she wasn’t able to do so even if she wanted to. It was okay; no matter how you looked at it, the moment was definitely a tender one.<br />
<br />
After the moment had passed and Rocky was nestled safely in Paul’s lap, his attention had turned to the meowth that had saved his seedot from entering a life threatening comatose. For a moment he was lost in the bright shine that reflected off of the coin that balanced perfectly upon its head until one of those few good ideas came to mind that maybe he should try to catch it.<br />
<br />
“Hey, li’l bobcat…” he paused for a moment before reaching into his backpack. “You did a great job, man,” he paused again and displayed the <a href="http://bmgf.bulbagarden.net/showpost.php?p=597798&amp;postcount=1276" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fbmgf.bulbagarden.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D597798%26postcount%3D1276&amp;hash=91535e8eb5a9a36d07a6122a52770bb6" rel="nofollow noopener">PokéBall</a> to the meowth (who looked pretty beaten as well, mind you), hoping that it knew what he was asking. “You know, this way you won’t have to steal food anymore!” he smiled. Never having caught a pokémon before, he figured he was doing it wrong. Either way he hoped that the meowth would accept his request, especially since he was so proud of how it had done in the battle.</span></span></div>

<b>Music Box </b> ~ You were literally flabbergasted! Before you stood Squirt, but not as you knew him. He was taller, fatter around the middle with bigger claws and a larger jaw. He tested his new limbs and grinned over to you. It certainly wasn’t expected but Banette seemed more than pleased by its work. Now with your newly evolved Croconaw you would prove to be more of a challenge for the Marionette Pokemon. Retrieving your Pokedex from your bag you shuffled through to find Croconaw’s page looking through all the new moves Squirt would now know. Whatever you had planned originally you put on hold with this new development. Now to take advantage of the … well new advantage you now had before Squirt reverted back to his old self. Squirt happily replied and you ran through the new attacks one last time, excited to try them out. Giving Croconaw his orders he ran them back to you, stumbling over the last one getting it wrong and you hoped he heard you right. <br />
<br />
Banette grinned, back to the battle then. Croconaw faced Banette and <b>Leer</b>ed at it and thanks to his evolution looked a lot more scary than before and Banette hesitated. Gathering Ice energy in his mouth Squirt leapt up at Banette and chomped on it, passing right through it but leaving the ice damage within the ghost making it wince in pain. Banette pointed a finger at Squirt who became covered in a grey aura making him shudder in pain losing double the energy from his attack; Banette’s <b>Spite</b> had Squirt regret using that move. Squirt made to attack again when he stopped, what was his next move again? Bite or Hydro Pump. He wracked his memory trying to remember what you had instructed him to use. Whilst he was temporarily indisposed Banette cackled and pointing a finger at Squirt again sent forth its shadow, the black form rushing forth striking Squirt making him stumble back a little. That had stung. Deciding to just attack anyway Squirt leapt up and bit down on Banette passing right it again but this time leaving dark energy circulating through its body making it cry out. That super effective move really hit hard. This battle was really getting heated now with both Pokemon pretty even despite the damage Squirt had previously taken. </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">&quot;Squirt!&quot; Tim shouted, &quot;I think we should go on with the plan, come over here for a second!&quot; Squirt and Tim huddled up as Tim explained his plan. &quot;Okay, we have this amazing power right now so we should just go on with my plan.&quot; Squirt looked at Tim with a confused look on his monstrous face. &quot;What plan? You never told me about any plan...&quot; said Squirt in a quiet tone. &quot;Oh! I'm sorry I got ahead of myself. Anyways, remember how when you used scratch. Well, Banette began to laugh a lot which kept him/her wide open. Well, if we can get Banette to laugh at you again. Maybe it will drop its guard again.&quot; As Tim explained, Squirt didn't seem to happy about making himself look dumb. &quot;Tim, I am a proud pokemon and I'd rather not stoop down to that.&quot; explained Squirt in a rather annoyed tone. &quot;I know, but if we want to win we need this plan. So get back out there and use <b>Scratch</b>. If my plan works and Banette drops his or her guard, then follow up with two <b>Bite</b> attacks. Can you do that for me? Please?&quot; After a good thirty seconds of mulling it over, Squirt agreed. &quot;Fine, but it's only because I don't want to lose.&quot; said Squirt. &quot;Thanks! Now get out there and do your best!&quot; said Tim in a delightful tone.</span></span></div>

<b>Concore</b> ~ As you stood by the open window listening to the two men inside the warehouse discussing their latest find you wondered who would willingly come to this place. Caitlin, despite the horrid environment was maintaining her composure, probably confident that you’d protect her and her mind was obviously on her missing Pokemon. Hearing the squeals of Pokemon being abused you hold back your anger you signal Spector to stay with Caitlin, you were going to deal with these men right now. Getting to your feet you calmly suggest the two men inside stop what they’re doing causing them to do what you ask, stop to find the source of the voice. <br />
<br />
“Is that the police,” one whispered to the other, “Would they dare to come down here?” he nervously asked his companion. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile Caitlin having too heard the screams of Pokemon was holding back her tears before running towards a door pushing it open and slowly walking inside. Spector called after her and threw his hands up in annoyance before motioned for you, running after the small girl. ‘Well its time to face the two thugs inside’, you thought as you followed after Spector entering the small warehouse to see him standing in front of Caitlin holding her back. The two men looked at the three of you with bemused expressions on their faces. Caitlin was calling out for Crystal who you spotted next the man wearing a long worn brown trench coat. She was wearing a short leash that was attached to the wall by a metal ring. She held her ear-like arms out for Caitlin crying in fear. <br />
<br />
“Well well, what are two young children like you doing here?” the guy in the trench coat asked.<br />
<br />
“You … You. YOU STOLE CRYSTAL. GIVE HER BACK TO ME NOW!” Caitlin yelled with tears running down her cheeks, fighting against Spector. <br />
<br />
“Now why would I want to do that?” he asked leering at you all.<br />
<br />
“Man, what if these brats go to the police. They know you took their Pokemon.” The other man spoke seeming nervous of the idea.<br />
<br />
“They wouldn’t get out of here in one piece if they tried,” The other man said sounding very confident of that.<br />
<br />
“I can’t be involved in this, I’ve done enough time already,” the other guy said running out of the warehouse, the man in the trench coat glaring at his back.<br />
<br />
“Whatever,” he muttered. Turning to face you he grinned. “Well now, we can’t just let you go off and inform the fuzz of our little secret can we. Come with me and I’ll make <i>sure</i> you get home alright.”<br />
<br />
Seeing your resolve he glared and said “You forget about this Wynaut, cause you’re never having it back Its mine to sell now.” He said before pulling his trench coat aside to reveal a Pokeball hidden on his belt. “I wouldn’t want to hurt you now,” he said smirking.<br />

As he watched the two squabbling, he failed to notice Caitlin heading inside, answering the beckoning call of her companion; it was only the fact that Spector alerted Verne with an irritated tut, and a shrug of his shoulders before dashing off, high on the heels of Caitlin, that he realized the drama outside.<br />
<br />
Following them in, Verne could hear that Caitlin was already deep into conversation with one of the men, he was then forcefully brushed aside by the other one, who was bolting for the door that they had just walked through. After recollecting himself, the first thing he noticed was the Wynaut, secured up to the wall, chain tort and craning out for it owner. What hit him next was the man’s piercing eyes and grubby trench coat, he looked the proper rough character, and this was going to be no walk in the park.<br />
<br />
Verne walked over and stood behind Spector who was refraining Caitlin from running off, he gave him a firm pat on the shoulder and stepped in front of the wrestling couple. He now realised that he was in deep, and there was only one way out of this.<br />
<br />
<i>“You forget about this Wynaut, cause you’re never having it back Its mine to sell now.”</i><br />
<br />
He stuck with the determined expression on his face and firmly said “No, I don’t think so, that Wynaut is coming with us!” all the while eyeing up the grubby-looking Pokéball, “Caitlin, I need you to stay there, can you do that for me?” he asked, “Spector, you ready buddy?”.<br />

<b>Lemon~Lime</b> ~ Hugging your tired and injured Gligar to your chest you are thankful that the battle is over and that you had won. Glancing down at the unconscious Sableye on the ground by the mine’s entrance you feel a wave of compassion. Even though it was quite feral and had attack so relentlessly it was only protecting the gems of the mine. You couldn’t just leave it here in the cold for any person or Pokemon to come along and take advantage off. With an empty Pokeball in hand you threw it at the downed dark gremlin watching as it was absorbed within. Once you had captured it you would go back into the mine again and have a better look around, there had to be some gems left inside. The Pokeball wobbled slightly before the light diminished. <b>Congratulations. You have captured a Level 05, Male Sableye</b>. Picking up your new Pokemon’s ball you enter back into the mine with Gligar still in your arms. You get to the point where you first encountered Sableye and peer into the darkness. It was pitch black further into the mine, you could use some light before you go any further. Either that or head on out of the mine and back up the mountain.</span><br />

</blockquote><span style="color: lightsteelblue"><span style="font-size: 9px">Mike returned Scorpio to his Pokeball as soon as he reentered the mine, for he deserved a good rest after all he’d been through. He pumped his fist in the air as he ran toward the spot where he’d first encountered the Sableye, excited about the new addition to his team and the riches he thought he would soon have. However, to his dismay, a quick look around revealed there were no gems to be found. This was going to require a Pokemon’s help. He held the Sableye’s Pokeball in his hand. “Come on ou-oh wait, I forgot to name you!” he said. “I’ll call you…<b>Klaus</b>! Come on out, Klaus!” <br />
<br />
Mike pressed the button to enlarge the Pokeball and tossed it into the air, opening the capsule, which then shot a red bolt of energy to the ground that took the shape of a Sableye. The energy then solidified into Klaus, who looked around upon being released from his Pokeball. Still wounded and tired from his battle earlier, Klaus looked up at Mike and scampered up onto him, searching for a place to rest. “Hahaha!” Mike said as the Sableye crawled all over him. “Stop it, that tickles!” Klaus eventually settled on his shoulders, taking Scorpio’s usual spot. Mike chuckled at the thought of them battling each other for the spot, then got down to business. <br />
<br />
“Look, Klaus,” he said, twisting his head so that he could speak to Klaus face-to-face. “You can see pretty good in the dark, right?” Klaus nodded haughtily, proud of his talent. “Okay, I know you’re new to my team and all, and you might still have some hard feelings toward us from tiring and hurting you like that, but we beat you fair and square, so we deserve to know where those gems are, right?” He nodded again, this time more wearily. “Then I need you to lead me to where the largest collection of them are right now, before your poison takes you down. And if you see <i>anything</i> dangerous, you are to signal me <i>at once</i>. Oh, and here's a bit of <a href="http://bmgf.bulbagarden.net/showthread.php?p=601316#post601316" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fbmgf.bulbagarden.net%2Fshowthread.php%3Fp%3D601316%23post601316&amp;hash=ddb088dbc714653ca2939469464aa694" rel="nofollow noopener">Potion</a> for you to help you heal.&quot; Mike took out the spray-bottle of medicine and administered the whole thing to Klaus' wounds. Klaus gave him a thumbs-up, now significantly refreshed, and pulled Mike’s arm forward. Mike was a little puzzled at first, but soon got the picture, making a mental note that whatever direction Klaus pulled his arm in was the way he ran. He then headed farther down into the cave, running as he went to speed things up and preparing for either the armload of jewels or boatload of trouble that might follow.</span></span></div>

<b>Furrett</b> ~ Upon listening to the old ghostly woman’s request you turn to face where she was pointing to spot a large tomb in the distance. You agree to take Natu there to say goodbye to his family. Picking up Natu’s Pokeball you feel a wave of pride wash over you, this was your very first capture. Releasing its occupant Natu emerges on the ground looking up at you. Omega reminded of his wounds by looking at his feathery team-mate rubbed the sore spot but still managed a warm smile. Seldon performed a little twirl before posing in front of Natu, her way of saying hello. You bend down and welcome Natu to your team yourself adding that you hope you’ll get along. Natu seemed a little indifferent to your welcomes and merely hopped off towards the tomb. You thank the spectral lady one more time before following after Natu, he seemed to know the way. A short walk later you stop in front of a large marble tomb. Trying the door you feel it shut tight, well you weren’t getting in that way. Looking around you spot your new Natu standing before a small marble statue of a proud looking man with a Xatu next to him and a Natu on his shoulder. Natu began to speak to the statue in his own tongue. Approaching him you suddenly see the forms of 3 Xatu appear behind the statue, well that answered your question, they definitely weren’t alive anymore. Natu noticed your approach and pointed towards you. The ghostly apparitions all turn their focus to you and your Pokemon and you feel a cold chill run down your spine for the second time today. The central Xatu pointed its long wing at you,<br />
<br />
“You are the one who has captured Natu?” it asked telepathically and you wince at the question, you assume it can’t be too pleased to see its family capture. You tell it yes and it seems to think. Natu speak to it again and the Xatu nods.<br />
<br />
“Natu says it was a hard fought battle, one that could have been won by either side,” you agree again and it nods “That is Natu’s first defeat, but we can see it is by a strong starting trainer,” it said almost praising you. “I can sense that you have a good heart and will care for Natu … please do” it says before addressing Natu.<br />
<br />
“Natu, we will miss you but you must live. Live on for us and see the world like we all once did. You will feel the joys of working alongside humans as I once did with my best friend. We will always be your family and we will always be thinking of you. We will together again my son but that day is far from now.” Natu nodded a small tear falling from his eye. It hops over to you and gives one last looks back as his family before he hops away with you.</span><br />
<br />
<i> You have proved yourself enough here therefore I release you from the Arcane Realm. Upon replying to this update you’re free to post in the mainstream zones (I know they’re currently un-manned but something is being worked out so fear not). The two zones per trainer rule will still apply when you do. Good Luck in all your future adventures ^-^</i><br />

<br />
Potato nodded at the Xatu, wondering how long Natu had been there to himself. <br />
<br />
Potato would liked to have explored more, but he was sure the three Xatu would not appreciate him dragging Natu all over the place, and god knows Omega did not want to be here in the slightest.<br />
<br />
So, with a last look at the Xatus, Potato turned and made his way out of the graveyard. Natu, Seldon and Omega followed ever faithfully. <br />
<br />
Potato yawned, suddenly feeling tired. The sun had been setting as he had entered the graveyard, and the moon was in the sky now. He needed sleep.<br />
<br />
“I think I need a name for you,” Potato remarked tiredly to Natu. “How about… Tei.”<br />
<br />
Tei rolled his eyes.<br />

<b>RaunchyFad</b> ~ Finally, it was over and all the remained as evidence of the battle were the three Pokemon involved. Purugly was unconscious on the ground and wouldn’t be going anywhere anytime soon. Meowth had received the least amount of damage but was still favour its left side. Rocky, poor Rocky, she was looking a right state. Her brown acorn body was marred with purple and red bruises, scratches and a couple of teeth marks where you munched on her. Slumping to the ground in relief you cradled your beaten Seedot to your chest proud of how well she fought despite the pain she had suffered. You make her an offer she would normally reject but being too tired she merely nodded eager to just rest now. The moment you shared was probably the first tender one you will remember. You immerse your self in the moment enjoying being so close to your Pokemon before your gaze is drawn to the other participant in your battle. The Meowth was licking the scratches on its side to try and speed up the healing and you are dazzled for a moment by the light shining off the gold coin on its head. After all you had been through, you didn’t want to lose touch with the little kitty cat now. <br />
<br />
Catching its attention it stops licking its wounds to look up at you and smiles at the praise you give it, noting the happy tone of voice you use. You pull out a Pokeball and Meowth’s gaze falls to the capture device an unreadable expression on its face. You jokingly tell it that it would mean that it wouldn’t have to steal food anymore and Meowth raised an eyebrow at that, remembering your success with food too. Meowth seemed to think over your offer, it after all battled alongside you and felt stronger for doing so. You had helped it to gain back its lost confidence. But on the other hand you had tried to eat your own Pokemon, if you got hungry again would you do the same to it? It stared at the ball for what felt like an eternity before it moves closer to you on all fours. It looked up at you andgave a stern look that said ‘if you try to eat me I swear’ before it touched the Pokeball with its paw. It was transferred to light energy and sucked inside. The ball remained still and the red light diminished. <b>Congratulations. You have captured a Level 05, Female Meowth</b>. With a new addition to your team you feel an even greater pride. Now all that was left was for you to leave this dark alley and get your Pokemon healed up.</span><br />
<br />
<i> With Meowth’s capture you’ve unlocked your rights to the Egg House and are hereby released from the Arcane Realm.

<span style="color: lemonchiffon"><b>Concore</b> ~ Standing firm you watch as the dastardly duo argued amongst one another before the smarter one left hurriedly not wanting anything to do with this. You see Spector putting all his effort into holding Caitlin back so that she doesn’t get hurt. The man leers at you all and it takes all your effort to not walk over there and punch him for his actions. Taking a few calming breaths you take in the situation entirely. The man in the worn trench coat was obviously threatening you with a battle if you didn’t leave and forget about what you saw here; but that wasn’t an option. Crystal seemed elated to see her trainer but the way the man was treating her, chaining her up like a wild feral beast was disgusting, and all this talk about selling her, you were going to put a stop to this before it went any further. You doubted very much that the man would let you leave here in one piece anyway. You walk in front of both Spector and Caitlin and pat your Drowsee on the shoulder the action causing both parties to stop their actions. With a bold and adamant voice you tell the man that you think not that that Crystal was coming back where she belonged. The man sneered at you and half-snorted half-laughed, amused by your statement.<br />
<br />
“Is that so, well then I’ll make sure that we’ll all leave here together and it won’t be pretty for you three. Maybe I could sell your Drowsee too. Don’t think it would pick up much but it might be worth it for slave labour or maybe meat for someone” he said and laughed.<br />
<br />
You hold down your anger and disgust and ask Caitlin to stay back and let you and Spector handle this pathetic excuse of a human being. Caitlin cast one last look over to Crystal and nodded.<br />
<br />
“Please get her back for me,” she whispered to you.<br />
<br />
Spector stood before you ready to battle and hopefully beat the man senseless afterwards for his ruse remarks. The man grinned and pulled off the single Pokeball from his belt. Enlarging it he sent out his Pokemon that turned out to be much small than Spector. The Skorupi hissed angrily clicking its claws together. You look surprised, not only is he using a Pokemon smaller than Spector but it had a type disadvantage. Maybe this would be easier than you thought. <br />
<br />
“Skorupi, <b>Leer</b> and <b>Bite</b>,” the man ordered the small scorpion ready to attack.</span> <br />

<b>Music Box </b> ~ The last round has gone well with you getting some good strong attacks in, still you felt the need to go with the plan you had thought of before Squirt evolution. You get Squirts attention, the Croconaw keeping one eye on the Banette and tell him that you still want to go with your original plan. Squirt asks what plan you mean and you remind him about what happened when Squirt last tried to use a Scratch attack The Banette had been distracted by the rookie move and it had allowed Squirt to use his Hydro Pump and he had hit the ghost with it. You suggest that Squirt uses another Scratch hoping that Banette would drop its guard and then he could attack with two super-effective Bite attacks. Squirt seems appalled by the suggestion of trickery to gain an advantage but after mulling it over agrees to go with your plan, only if it helps him win the battle.<br />
<br />
Banette watched your exchange with interest and despite the pain it was still feeling was glad it had a real challenge at last. Squirt turned back to Banette and leapt up pulling its claw back and leaping right through the ghost again, his <b>Scratch</b> surprisingly ineffectively. Squirt turned around only to get a face full of black energy that hit him with a smack throwing him back. Banette having finished its <b>Nightshade</b> looked thoroughly pissed off, it thought it had a challenge and yet you were still using these ridiculous attacks. Squirt wasn’t happy with the move and even less happy as he felt a blue aura surround him making him immobile. Banette had a few tricks of its own up its sleeves and its <b>Disable</b> has rendered Squirt useless. Banette lifted the large Croconaw up and dropped it back down on his butt. Squirt looked ticked off at being mocked and now it couldn’t use its <b>Scratch</b> attack well he didn’t care about that. He leapt forward and <b>Bit</b> down on Banette again making it wince and shudder as the dark energy course through it. That was more like it! Squirt still on the move used another <b>Bite</b> to chomp down on Banette leaving it looking rather ill. All these super-effective attacks were wearing down its health rapidly. Banette merely grinned through the pain and surrounded itself in a black aura. Yelling it charged at Squirt ramming into him hard and throwing him into the rubble. Squirt struggled to get back to his feet and just about managed it with encouragement from Cacnea who looked concerned for the crocodile. That <b>Payback</b> had caused a significant amount of damage and now both Pokemon were even on health, and it wasn’t good.</span> <br />

<b>Lemon~Lime</b> ~ Returning Scorpio to his Pokeball for a rest you celebrate alone as you run up to the Pokeball containing your newest Pokemon. Still holding onto Sableye’s Pokeball you run back into the mine, your mind on harvesting some precious gems or ores and you reach the spot you first found the dark gremlin. Looking around you see in dismay that there weren’t any gems here after all. Sighing you droop your shoulders till you get an idea. Maybe Sableye could help you out; after all he was your Pokemon now. Choosing a name before you release him, your new Sableye Klaus emerged on the ground looking quite injured still and wobbles on unsteady legs. The short spell in his new home had roused him at least. Klaus decided to rest on your shoulder and just about clambered up there making you giggle as his claws softly ran over your skin when he climbed. At least he wasn’t trying to eat you, he must realise that you’re his trainer and so it wouldn’t be a good idea to maim you. You ask Klaus if he can see in the dark and he snorts, of course he could, Sableye had superb eyesight. You explain the situation and ask him to show you to the gems now he was on your team, the largest collection if possible. Before you start off you use a Potion to heal Klaus’s wounds and he feels better for you managing a half-thankful glance before hopping off your shoulder. He grasped your arm and began to drag you into the darkness.<br />
<br />
As you walk along not able to see a thing due to the level of darkness in the mines you hoped that Klaus wasn’t plotting some form of revenge. You really wished the lamps were still work so you could see the path you were taking and hoped that Klaus didn’t run off and leave you here alone to search for the exit, never finding it. Shaking the disturbing thoughts from your head you trip as you move down hill and Klaus hisses at you for nearly treading on him. Apologizing you carry on and soon you spot a few beams of light up ahead. As you walk towards them you can see that you’re in a large cavern that was probably the main mining area. Holes in the ceiling were allowing a few beams of sunlight to filter through allowing you see some of the cavern. There were some disused mine carts and equipment on the rails and upon searching through it find nothing left. Suddenly you spot something shiny up ahead. Running up to touch it you don’t hear Klaus’ warning. Touching the silver ore you leap back in shock as it moves. A small Aron looks up at you and fearfully cries out. A roar echoes through the cavern making you back up as several Lairon and a large Aggron approach from behind the little Aron. Klaus hid behind your leg looking fearful. Aggron spots Klaus and roars pointing at him making him shiver in fear. It appears that these Pokemon know Klaus and are not happy to see him, I wonder why? </span></span></div>

<b>RaunchyFad</b> ~ Finally, it was over and all the remained as evidence of the battle were the three Pokemon involved. Purugly was unconscious on the ground and wouldn’t be going anywhere anytime soon. Meowth had received the least amount of damage but was still favour its left side. Rocky, poor Rocky, she was looking a right state. Her brown acorn body was marred with purple and red bruises, scratches and a couple of teeth marks where you munched on her. Slumping to the ground in relief you cradled your beaten Seedot to your chest proud of how well she fought despite the pain she had suffered. You make her an offer she would normally reject but being too tired she merely nodded eager to just rest now. The moment you shared was probably the first tender one you will remember. You immerse your self in the moment enjoying being so close to your Pokemon before your gaze is drawn to the other participant in your battle. The Meowth was licking the scratches on its side to try and speed up the healing and you are dazzled for a moment by the light shining off the gold coin on its head. After all you had been through, you didn’t want to lose touch with the little kitty cat now. <br />
<br />
Catching its attention it stops licking its wounds to look up at you and smiles at the praise you give it, noting the happy tone of voice you use. You pull out a Pokeball and Meowth’s gaze falls to the capture device an unreadable expression on its face. You jokingly tell it that it would mean that it wouldn’t have to steal food anymore and Meowth raised an eyebrow at that, remembering your success with food too. Meowth seemed to think over your offer, it after all battled alongside you and felt stronger for doing so. You had helped it to gain back its lost confidence. But on the other hand you had tried to eat your own Pokemon, if you got hungry again would you do the same to it? It stared at the ball for what felt like an eternity before it moves closer to you on all fours. It looked up at you andgave a stern look that said ‘if you try to eat me I swear’ before it touched the Pokeball with its paw. It was transferred to light energy and sucked inside. The ball remained still and the red light diminished. <b>Congratulations. You have captured a Level 05, Female Meowth</b>. With a new addition to your team you feel an even greater pride. Now all that was left was for you to leave this dark alley and get your Pokemon healed up.</span><br />
<br />
<i> With Meowth’s capture you’ve unlocked your rights to the Egg House and are hereby released from the Arcane Realm. Upon replying to this update you’re free to post in the mainstream zones (I know they’re currently un-manned but something is being worked out so fear not). The two zones per trainer rule will still apply when you do. Good Luck in all your future adventures ^-^</i></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">Oh boy! This was a nice little jaunt we had, man. I look forward to my Cascadia adventures, and I sure hope we get some updaters soon. Fare thee well! ;-;<br />
<br />
<span style="color: lemonchiffon">Ecstatic, Paul launched the PokéBall to the ground and after a bright light and loud pop, let his newly caught pokémon be free to roam around. Setting down his seedot, he picked up the meowth and gave it an appreciative hug. <br />
<br />
“Li’l Bobcat, you’re grade-A, man!” he said as he set her onto his shoulders where she gingerly balanced herself. She meowed then plunked down, creating a sort of cat-scarf that stylishly accented Paul’s hairy neck. Though it was kind of itchy, Paul’s neck was comfortable and certainly would become a popular spot for catnaps.<br />
<br />
Reaching into his bag, Paul pulled out a <a href="http://bmgf.bulbagarden.net/showpost.php?p=624613&amp;postcount=301" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fbmgf.bulbagarden.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D624613%26postcount%3D301&amp;hash=ab1861eeb3e5eb1dd4f669f0165ff84c" rel="nofollow noopener">Rare Candy</a> and fed it to his meowth, or his Bobcat, rather, then once again picked up Rocky and headed far, far away from the alleyway and back into town, where hopefully he could find a Pokémon Center. Once he did, it was time to blow this pop stand. Paul’s magnificent journey through the cat-filled streets of Mediville had ended, and now it was time to move elsewhere. It was a happy end, though. Paul had finally moved a step up from being a hairy bum to a Pokémon Trainer: someone with an actual job!</span></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: lightsteelblue"><span style="font-size: 9px">Mike stepped back in surprise as the supposed ore he was touching looked up at him and cried out in fear, turning out to be an Aron. In a flash, there was a gigantic roar, and a few Lairon and an Aggron appeared. Klaus jumped and hid behind Mike’s leg, trembling. The Aggron spotted the gleam of Klaus’ jewel-eye and his arm on Mike’s leg and roared while pointing at Klaus, who started to hug Mike’s leg. Mike put on a calm face before starting to negotiate. <br />
<br />
Mike bent down to the poor little Aron, nearly frightened to death by his wandering hand. “I apologize, little one.” he said. “I meant you no harm. I thought you were something you were not, and I never would have disturbed you if I knew you were an Aron.” He stood up and picked up Klaus by the scruff of his neck. “As for this little demon here, he is under my control now. He will not do anything I tell him not to do.” Mike looked at Klaus sternly. “And I tell him not to harm you or any other Pokemon in the mine. We’ll soon be on our way, but could you guys spread the word throughout the cave that this Sableye is taking orders from a good person and won’t hurt anyone anymore? Thank you.” Mike put Klaus down and held his hand rather tightly to ensure he wouldn’t do anything stupid. “Now, Klaus,” Mike said, “If you could continue leading me.” Klaus sighed and nodded while Mike picked up an old pickax in case they came across any gems stuck in the wall.</span></span></div>

Banette watched your exchange with interest and despite the pain it was still feeling was glad it had a real challenge at last.

Squirt turned around only to get a face full of black energy that hit him with a smack throwing him back. Banette having finished its <b>Nightshade</b> looked thoroughly pissed off, it thought it had a challenge and yet you were still using these ridiculous attacks. Squirt wasn’t happy with the move and even less happy as he felt a blue aura surround him making him immobile. Banette had a few tricks of its own up its sleeves and its <b>Disable</b> has rendered Squirt useless. Banette lifted the large Croconaw up and dropped it back down on his butt. Squirt looked ticked off at being mocked and now it couldn’t use its <b>Scratch</b> attack well he didn’t care about that. He leapt forward and <b>Bit</b> down on Banette again making it wince and shudder as the dark energy course through it. That was more like it! Squirt still on the move used another <b>Bite</b> to chomp down on Banette leaving it looking rather ill. All these super-effective attacks were wearing down its health rapidly. Banette merely grinned through the pain and surrounded itself in a black aura. Yelling it charged at Squirt ramming into him hard and throwing him into the rubble. Squirt struggled to get back to his feet and just about managed it with encouragement from Cacnea who looked concerned for the crocodile. That <b>Payback</b> had caused a significant amount of damage and now both Pokemon were even on health, and it wasn’t good.</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">Just picked up Squirt from the Move Tutor so I'll resume my adventure from where I left off.<br />
<span style="color: darkorange">&quot;Damn!&quot; Tim thought as he watched his plan crumble,&quot;Oh well, we still have one more trick up our sleeves.&quot; Tim's face was still looking confidant without even the slightest look of panic. &quot;Squirt! Use that move you learned a while ago!&quot; shouted Tim to the Croconaw. &quot;Hmp, I was wondering when we'd bring that out!&quot; Croconaw stated in a cool strong voice. &quot;Here I go!&quot; Croconaw lept into the air and curled his hand into a fist. &quot;<a href="http://bmgf.bulbagarden.net/showpost.php?p=626138&amp;postcount=215" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fbmgf.bulbagarden.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D626138%26postcount%3D215&amp;hash=d48b0defbcca521286d9edddb7fe290b" rel="nofollow noopener"><b>Ice Punch</b></a>!&quot; Croconaw shouted. &quot;Please, please, please hit!&quot; Tim crossed his fingers hoping for the move to be successful. &quot;Squirt, after you use Ice Punch use <b>Leer</b> and <b>Bite</b>!&quot; Tim shouted to Squirt. &quot;Both Squirt and Banette are pretty warn out. I wonder how much more this battle will last, hopefully we can finish this while we can!&quot; though Tim in an almost concerned voice. Even though Tim was in the middle of a battle, he couldn't help but keep an eye on Cacnea picturing what life would be like if Cacnea joined up with him.</span></span></div>
