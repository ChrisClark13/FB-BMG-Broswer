<br />
<span style="color: darkorange"><b><u>handymankg2</u>: </b>For better or worse, your wish has been made, and while all eyes turn to Jirachi you're left feeling quite nervous while you watch and wait to see whether or not your wish will be granted. Jirachi's eyes well with tears, the beaming smile upon its face showing it's not upset about your choice, for if anything it appears the Wish Pokémon is deeply touched by your selfless act. It first moves to hover over top of Ponyta whose lifeblood has been spilled out onto the desert floor, the cold steel dagger still embedded in its chest. In the same moment that the dagger begins to glow with psychic energy, a single teardrop falls from Jirachi's eye. The entire scene seems to take place in slow motion as the dagger slides out of the baby equine before falling upon the sand, Jirachi's tear then landing upon Ponyta's open wound which begins to repair itself before finally sealing shut to leave a small star-shaped pattern behind as a lifelong reminder that the brave and selfless little fire horse has been touched by Jirachi. You watch intently, looking for any signs of life returning to its body when Ponyta's glazed eyes begin to darken, its legs twitching, before it blinks once, then twice, and finally raising its head to look around. Your heart fills with joy, the soaring sense of elation something that is indescribable considering the circumstances, and a moment later Ponyta is on its feet, relief clearly visible in its eyes when it sees that Jack and the Nightbringers are nowhere to be seen and that you remain unharmed. It nuzzles your arm affectionately before staring up at Jirachi in awe, the legendary Pokémon smiling down upon it before making its way over to Reg in order to complete your wish.<br />
<br />
Everyone follows, gathering around Reg's crumpled and lifeless form, his blood staining the desert sand after having flowed from a deep cut to his throat. To think the man you had first loathed and feared would turn out to be one of the good guys whom you'd go so far as to make a once-in-a-lifetime wish to bring back to life is ironic to say the least, but after the events of the last two days you're finding that nothing can ever be taken for granted, especially life itself. This man had sacrificed years of his life to infiltrate and destroy an organisation whose evil intentions would have lead to centuries of death and misery on a worldwide scale for humans and Pokémon alike, only to have been brought down right at the very end. Though Reg may himself see this as a failure, the fact he'd entrusted the flute to you, and that the Nightbringers had been stopped, albeit under different circumstances, this in itself shows that he had made the right decision and that he is about to reap the ultimate reward for his sacrifice. Jirachi smiles upon Reg, a single teardrop falling from its eye to land upon the centre point of the cut, the tear then spreading out along the length of the wound. Again, you watch while it is magically repaired, a single star-shaped pattern being left behind at the base of Reg's throat where the teardrop had initially fallen. To wish upon a star and be touched by Jirachi is a great privilege indeed, and for the second time this night you watch while life returns to the eyes of another brave and selfless being. He stands, his awe-filled gaze upon Jirachi who is smiling back at him, before he looks to you and the flute still in your hand and whispering, &quot;Thank you&quot;.<br />
<br />
The head Mystic steps forward and embraces Reg, thankful his friend is alive and well. Over the next half hour the events of the night are replayed, for Reg has many questions regarding what happened following the moment he was killed, and while the humans talk you notice Ponyta and Belle playing with Jirachi. Seeing them interact with the Legendary Pokémon like this is a magical feeling, and you wonder what it must be like for Jirachi, a Pokémon so sought after yet so elusive, to have very little opportunity to interact with others, to be able to relax and simply play with no expectations upon it. Watching it now, laughing and giggling while the three play innocently, you can't help but think it must have a very lonely existence. A short while later, the three Pokémon return to the group, Jirachi's expression sad as it is now time to say goodbye. Everyone gathers around while Jirachi looks upon each and every person present, thankful to you all for having given it the opportunity to perform a good deed. A golden cloud forms around it, and in the same way that Jirachi had drifted from the tip of the flute, it now returns to it, the golden hue disappearing inside of the artifact. A part of you doesn't want to give it up, wanting to take care of the Pokémon for eternity, but another part of you is glad to be handing it back to its rightful guardians. Protecting Jirachi is a very big responsibility, and not one you'll be able to carry out for the next hundred years let alone the next thousand, and so you pass it to the Mystic who accepts it graciously. &quot;You've shown great integrity here tonight, and have made a decision that will benefit the lives of many in the future,&quot; he says with a smile. &quot;Be safe, and be sure to call upon us should you ever need a favour&quot;. He then hands you a stone which you look at curiously as it looks no different to any other small rock laying in the desert except for a small <a href="https://img43.imageshack.us/img43/4945/mysticsymbol.gif" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fimg43.imageshack.us%2Fimg43%2F4945%2Fmysticsymbol.gif&amp;hash=8fbd3a37a372ddcbc50e12ed88d6b108" rel="nofollow noopener">symbol</a> on its surface. &quot;Speak to it, and we will hear.&quot; You examine it carefully for a moment before looking up again, but the Mystic and the rest of his tribe are gone, vanished into thin air... <br />
<br />
A little later, exhausted from the day's events, you and Reg decide to camp here for the night before continuing on your separate ways in the morning. Settling into one of the abandoned Nightbringers tents, you both stretch out, glad to be finally able to rest. You watch while Belle settles on Reg's chest, the little pang of jealousy you feel at seeing your Pokémon take to another human quickly passing as you realise it's just her way of saying thank you to the man who had helped you both get through this alive. It's quite likely neither of you will ever see him again after tomorrow, so it's not exactly like he's stealing away her affections. Just as Belle as settled with Reg, Ponyta has settled with you, both Pokémon wanting to be close to the person they have bonded with for just one night. Ponyta lays next to you, and as you fall into a deep and peaceful sleep, you feel its breath against your arm, and the warmth radiating from it's body. Placing your hand on its chest and feeling its heart beating rhythmically, as well as hearing Reg's steady breathing from the other side of the tent, you can think of nothing better that you could have wished for.<br />
<br />
Waking to a bright and cheerful morning, you stand outside the tent with Reg, Belle, and Ponyta, ready to move out. The two Pokémon appear deeply saddened by the fact they're about to part ways, and Ponyta steps away from Reg's side to walk over and say goodbye, nuzzling your hand affectionately. &quot;It really likes you,&quot; Reg says with a meaningful smile. &quot;You do know this doesn't need to be goodbye?&quot; Gazing into Ponyta's eyes you wonder about asking it to accompany you, but you're sure it'll want to return to its family and are sure Reg will reunite it with them, but when you look up at him his face is grim. &quot;It's an orphan now, I saw its parents killed in the village,&quot; he continues sadly. &quot;When you saw me take down that Rapidash, it was only seconds after we'd both seen the parents slaughtered by one of the Nightbringers. The Rapidash would have gotten itself killed trying to take the Nightbringer down, so I knocked it out with Blastoise before it could get itself killed...&quot; Not quite knowing what to say you gaze at Ponyta again. This certainly does place a different light on the matter, but what if Ponyta would like to return to its herd? Hmm...</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Rick stared carefully at Jirachi after his wish had been made. Would the wish actually work at all was the Primary thing, and another possibility was that Jirachi would outright deny making the wish work, something that would be absolutely horrible. Rick sighed as he looked up at what was probably the only time he would ever witness a Legendary Pokemon at this close range, and watched as the Pokemon beamed down at Rick, making him feel a lot more confident in himself. From the look on the Jirachis face, Rick saw that the Pokemon was actually happy to oblige to the wish, and seemed touch by the boys selflessness. Rick smiled slightly, but then gulped. This was it, the start of the wish, and what he saw as make or brake time. He stared hopefully towards Jirachi, who seemed to have realised it was time to act, and had made its way to the lifeless body of Ponyta. Ricks eyes widened. This was it, the moment he was waiting for. If Ponyta was able to be resurrected, surely then Reg would be as well, and the wish would be a success. Rick felt a little tear come to his eye as he once again stared down at the lifeless body of Ponyta, a dagger imprinted still in its body, the pony laying on the desert floor vacantly. A single tear dropped from Jirachis eyes, and the dagger began to glow a bright purple colour, lifting itself out of Ponytas body, and then falling on the sand. At least, Rick thought, that if Ponyta was still to be dead after this, the weapon that did so would no longer defile its body. The tear fell downwards and landed on the open wound of Ponyta, and a miracle occurred, the wound sealing itself up on the spot as all the blood returned into the Pokemons body, a small star arriving on the locations of what was the Pokemons wound, signifying the sacrifice it had made this day. Rick gasped as he watched the Ponyta resurrected, the darkness returning to its eyes, its legs twitching on the floor, and finally the pony raising its head to look at the area around it. Rick smiled a huge beam, feelings of joy erupting inside his body as he walked over to the Ponyta and hugged it, the small pony relieved to see that Jack was nowhere to be seen, and nuzzling affectionately on Ricks arm. Rick noticed in the corner of his eye that Jirachi was moving, so quickly turned to watch the next part of the wish come into action. <br />
<br />
Everyone followed as Jirachi made its was towards the lifeless body of Reg, similar to Ponyta in death, lifeless, white eyed and laid helplessly on the floor. To think, Reg had originally been one of the bad guys in Ricks eyes, simply for the fact he was leading the criminal group in its current action. How wrong Rick had been, and how hard Reg must have worked to get that high in the organisation, only to be murdered in the vital moments of the mission. Rick felt extremely sorry for the man, but with this wish, Rick was fairly certain that he would be alive again, and ready to continue his life in whatever way he wished. The world had now been saved from total darkness, and Reg deserved all the credit he needed; Rick did practically nothing, he was just there at the right time. Although Rick knew what was about to happen, seeing it occur once again was still extremely moving, Jirachis tear healing the wound of the man on the floor, and then forming the same mark that was formed upon Ponyta, the star being a permanent reminder for Reg also of Ricks first adventure in the world of Fizzy Bubbles. Slowly, Reg was brought back into life, and Rick couldn’t help but cry with joy at the sight of the man walking again, and he continued to smile as Reg was embraced by the head mystics, the sight being quite a beautiful one in Ricks opinion. Over the next half our, Rick recalled how the adventure came to its end, and finally began to hear the mystics side of the story, which was really fascinating in all honesty, and as Ricks part ended he turned to see the Pokemon playing with each other nearby. Ponyta and Belle were showing Jirachi what would be its only good time for a thousand years, and the sight of it really made Rick think about what the Pokemons life must be like. Waking up only once in a thousand years, getting only a brief glimpse of how the world has changed, and being forced into work every time it does wake up. It must be a horrible existance. But seeing how happy Jirachi was at the moment, and figuring the Mystics would be there to provide just as much fun every other time the Legendary was awakened, Rick was at ease, and returned to the adult conversation. <br />
<br />
Eventually, the three Pokemon returned to the group, and Rick sadly eyed Jirachi, who shared the same appearance of sadness. It was time for the Pokemon to return to its sleep for a thousand years, and Rick couldn’t help but pity it as it flew up into the air, its body turning into the same golden mist from before, and filtering into the flute, fading into nothingness for the millennia. Rick wasn’t sure whether he really wanted to give up the flute in his moment of hesitation. Looking after that legendary and making sure it was okay would be a really honourable task…but, was he really going to be able to look after it by himself for the next thousand years? Unless some form of life giving elixir is invented, Rick very much doubted it. So, happy that Jirachi would at least be in safe hands, he gave the flute back to the mystics, smiling as he did so. He then listened to the mystic speak, and nodded as he received the stone, with a small symbol on the surface. Confused slightly by what the mystic had said, he put it into his bag and sealed it up tight, in case it was ever needed in the future. He then looked up, but gasped as he noticed what had happened; the entire tribe had disappeared in an instance. He looked shockingly at Belle, but the combee simply shrugged, and returned to playing with Ponyta. Rick turned to Reg, and the pair decided that they would camp up together for today, and part in the morning, heading their different directions and onto bigger and better things. Settling into one of the abandoned Nightbringers tents, the pair stretched out and fell asleep. Or at least, Reg did, as Rick eyed Belle sleeping on Regs chest, whatever jealousy Rick had fading away very quickly as he realised it was just her saying thanks to the man that had done so much for them. Ponyta was resting on Rick, so Rick didn’t really have a right to complain anyway. Rick slowly stroked the Pony, before falling into what he thought was a well deserved rest. <br />
<br />
Waking up in the morning, Rick was feeling quite gloomy indeed, realising he’d have to say goodbye to two of his comrades today. Getting ready, and staring across at Reg, he sighed as he knew that this was goodbye. Goodbye to Ponyta too, or was it? Rick listened as Reg began to explain Ponytas situation, and his heart began to rise. Rick might be able to persuade the Pony to come onto his Pokemon team after all. Reaching for a spare <a href="http://bmgf.bulbagarden.net/showpost.php?p=1102515&amp;postcount=1868" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fbmgf.bulbagarden.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D1102515%26postcount%3D1868&amp;hash=5a2dd888e544b56a24a90058c52f601c" rel="nofollow noopener">Pokeball</a>, and smiling, Rick offered “Hey…Ponyta, if you’ve got nowhere to go, consider coming to live with me and Belle. I have plenty of room for you.” Rick smiled encouragingly, hoping it was enough to win over the Pony who had done so much for him over the past few days.</span></span></div>

Fuuten: Another beautiful reply from you, I can’t say anything apart from keep it up.<br />
<br />
You explain your cover story to the large man before you, and he listens in silence, a fairly impassive expression on his face giving you little idea as to whether he is buying it or not, but his lack of objection gives you a little heart- you don’t need to be making an enemy at this stage, particularly one who is considerably bigger than you and more to the point, seems considerably warmer than you, which would probably be another advantage should push come to shove. Resolved to try and talk yourself out of any difficulty, you attempt to turn the questioning around, asking what the man is doing here while your mind subconsciously asks how he snuck up on you like that.<br />
<br />
“Ah, sorry to startle you” he says, and his deep voice echoes slightly around the cavern. “I didn’t mean to sneak up on you like that, just had to be sure you weren’t one of <i>them[/b].” As he says this, he pulls one of the strange contraptions from a strap on his jacket, and holds it above his head, pointing towards you. It looks not unlike a magnifying glass, but with extra sections attached including one aerial-like section which seems to be rotating slowly and humming slightly as it turns. Looking back at the man, you see him nod and say: “Yep, definitely alright. Bit cold, but that’s to be expected really isn’t it?” Your father really shouldn’t have let you come up here without some warmer clothes but there we go, not too cold in here after all, compared to outside. Not going to be able to get out for a while though, storm seems to be set in for a good while.” As he rambles on for a while, you begin to get the idea that the man likes to talk, and he certainly takes his time getting to the point, with you having to prompt him that you’d asked what he was doing here.<br />
<br />
Screwing up his face, the man looks at you closely before continuing: “Well, I came here looking for treasure like most people did the first time, I knew it had been abandoned for years but you just hope they got out too quickly and that there’s still plenty of riches in here somewhere. No doubt there are, but I’ve not found any yet and I’ve been here a good many times now. Something about it keeps drawing me back though, I don’t know what it is but I can take an educated guess, and that’s where this baby comes in.” With that, he jabs a chubby digit at the Magnifying Glass like contraption. “D’you know what this is?”<br />
<br />
“No?” you answer, honestly.<br />
<br />
“It’s a brand new...well, I say brand new, it ain’t but it’s brand new to me all the same, got it off some guy I used to explore these sorta places with years ago...he’s retired now but uh...oh yeah, where was I?”<br />
<br />
“You were telling me what that is.” You confirm, pointing to the device.<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah, of course. It’s a Silph Scope, made in faraway Kanto. Wanna know what it does?” The name rings a bell though, and a light goes on in your head. You already know what it does, but you hope he isn’t suggesting what you think he is. “It spots Ghosts, even when they don’t wanna be spotted. I reckon there’s a few of them in this mine, there’s funny things happening here and I think I know why. Fancy having a look round with me?” You don’t really fancy going to explore a Haunted Mine, but with the weather outside looking increasingly poor and the man seeming pretty confident in his ability to handle anything, you can’t help but consider his offer. Who knows, if there are ghosts, they might have treasure?</i></span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver"><b><u>The Graveyard</u></b> - Please reply in <b>silver</b></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: silver"><b><u>Tenorphin</u>: </b>Despite the fact Mismagius is in quite a hurry to reach the crypt before she loses her chance at freedom, this is the first wild Pokémon you've had the opportunity to fight and you're not about to give up the opportunity. Telling her you'll be quick you turn to face Shuppet, issuing Cantare with attack instructions. Mismagius scowls, powerless to do anything about it seeing as she is bound to the stone you are carrying and therefore unable to head to the crypt alone. She instead hovers over top a tombstone, sighing a little over-dramatically whilst glaring hatefully at the Shuppet who is the cause of this delay before turning her attention to Cantare whom she hopes will take the annoying little pest down quickly. Cantare is far too engrossed with Shuppet to notice Mismagius' annoyance, however, and eagerly follows your orders, far too hyped for battle to bother with his usual silly antics, and immediately whips up a <b>Twister</b> that he sends reeling toward Shuppet. Soil and grass are ripped from the ground as the tornado closes the distance between the two Pokémon, Shuppet being buffeted around in the winds and eventually thrown back out again looking a little worse for wear before the attack dies down and calm presides. Annoyed, you watch as swirling black clouds enter Shuppets eyes, not quite sure what is about to happen when two black thunderbolts shoot out of them, Shuppet's <b>Night Shade</b> striking Cantare in the chest and sending him bowling head over heels backward. Squawking indignantly, Cantare hops to his feet and flaps his wings, puffing his chest out to demonstrate he's far from intimidated by the ghost type while he draws upon his own limited stores of ghostly energy. Shuppet, feeling quite confident that this colourful little parrot is no match for him, grins back at Cantare smugly, but it soon realises its mistake when Cantare sends a rather <b>Ominous</b> looking <b>Wind</b> its way, Shuppet's eyes practically bugging out of its head as the purple wind whooshes past it, dealing quite some damage in the process. It <b>Screeches</b> the godforbidden sound so mindnumbing that Cantare's first reaction is to try and bury his head in the ground just to protect his delicate eardrums, though he doesn't quite manage to be able to do so and instead flaps his wings furiously, squawking back at Shuppet angrily. Mismagius sighs, and when you turn to look at her notice she's surrounding by an aura of dark energy that she's itching to let loose upon Shuppet. &quot;Oh <i>please</i> let me take care of this for you,&quot; she pleads, her eyes filled with glee. &quot;It's been so long since I've fought a real battle, this should be fun and will only take a moment...&quot;.</span><br />

<span style="color: darkorange"><b><u>handymankg2</u>: </b>Not realising up until this point how much you would like for Ponyta to accompany you since you hadn't really considered it to be an option, all the while assuming that it would want to return to its parents, you look at the little pony with renewed hope. You can see the sadness in its eyes, knowing that it will never see its parents again, but there is also hope as it looks up at you after hearing what Reg had to say. Belle is rather excited by the thought as well, buzzing about your head excitedly, urging you to offer Ponyta a spot on your team. Though you've already made up your mind it's still nice to know that you have Belle's blessing, and without a second thought remove a spare Pokéball from your backpack. Ponyta's eyes light up, while a broad grin appears on Reg's face. Smiling at the brave little fire horse you offer it the Pokéball and ask it to join you. Tears well in Ponyta's eyes, happy tears, and without a moment's hesitation it nudges the release mechanism on the Pokéball, triggering the capture beam which engulfs the little fire horse and pulls it inside, giving you ownership of the <b>Lv.4 male Ponyta</b>. Immediately releasing your new teammate, you watch while he says goodbye to Reg who also appears to be sad they are parting, yet at the same time happy for both of you as you now have each other and he knows that Ponyta will be well cared for. &quot;We'll meet again one day, Ponyta,&quot; he says, reaching out to stroke the pony's neck. &quot;You and I will always have a bond,&quot; he continues, placing one hand over the star-shaped pattern at the base of his throat and the other over the identical pattern upon Ponyta's chest. &quot;We've been through a lot together, and if you ever need me I'll always be here for you.&quot; With that Reg gives Ponyta a grateful smile along with one final pat before turning his attention to you. &quot;It's been.... interesting, hasn't it?&quot; he asks, his tone suggesting that his fight is far from over. &quot;We may be travelling along different paths now, but this entire ordeal is something we will always share. If one day our journeys should lead us to the same place I hope that you will still trust in me the way you do now. There is evil in the world as you well know, but the loyalty of your team is something that will always see you through. Take care of yourself Rick, and take care of your friends.&quot; While all three of you watch Reg as he walks off into the desert you think over his words, sensing there was more to what he was saying than you'd first think. There was a message in there, but what that message is you do not know. Perhaps one day, if you ever cross paths with the man again, you will have worked it out, but right now you have a very excited Combee and extremely joyful Ponyta standing beside you who are quite eager to set off upon new adventures, and if truth be told you're just as anxious to get out of this desert as they are. Right now your future is looking very bright indeed, and as the three of you head back toward civilisation with no particular destination in mind, you're really looking forward to seeing what adventures await you...<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: darkorange"><span style="font-size: 9px">Rick smiled with joy as the Ponyta began to cry, in what Rick could only hope was joy, the tears falling down onto the sands bellow and splattering into tiny particles. Without a moment of hesitation, Ponyta nudges the center of the Pokeball, and is instantly captured into the red Pokeball, no shaking process occurring as the Pony was giving in rather than attempting to escape in any fashion. Rick smiled, and stared down at the Pokeball for a few seconds, before releasing the flaming pony from within, a new team-mate for adventures to come. Rick stares down at his Ponyta, and watches as he slowly wanders over to Reg, and begins to say goodbye. Obviosuly Ponyta hasn’t got the vocal capacity to speak, so the leading of the conversation is done by Reg, whereas Ponyta just neighs and whinnies along happily, Reg smiling as he strokes the Ponytas neck. Rick almost began crying when he heard the cheesyness of the phrases that Reg was saying to the Pony, but it was still a beautiful situation nonetheless. Once Reg was finished with Ponyta, he turned to Rick, who looked up with slightly sadder eyes at the man in front of him, defeating dead, finishing what he had spent most of his life doing, and saving the world completely in the process, he truly looked like a god, and Rick was in awe of the man. But then he spoke back in his normal tone, and the glorious scene in Ricks eyes snapped straight back into reality, and he began to listen intently to the final words that Reg would say to him for a long time, possibly forever. “I…I don’t know what to say, or where to start really, so I’ll just say this. Thankyou. And Goodbye.” Rick smiled as Reg walked off into the desert, and waved after him, having the slight hope that Reg might turn around, see the waving, and be convinced to go on a journey with Rick again. He doubted it would happen, though, and as he disappeared into the sunset Rick knew he would most likely never see the man again. Rick attempted to think over what Reg had said, but didn’t really try to find any meanings in it; only cherish it, as the happiest memory of the man. Rick turned to his partner Pokemon, and newly obtained Ponyta, and smiled eagerly at them. It was time for his next adventure, time for a new place, new terrain, new people, new friends. He nodded, and the pair set off towards their next destination, however far away, however hard to get there, they would continue for many years to come.<br />
<br />
And the three young friends walked into the sunset…</span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"><br />
<br />
Tess, I can't thank you enough for the adventure you have provided with me, being everything I could of asked for as a first journey into Fizzy Bubbles and more. I honestly couldn't and wouldn't have asked for a better updater, and it was a complete pleasure to even attempt to reply to the brilliant updates you made, even making great ones when I gave you very little to go with. I hope to be updated by you again in the future, but for now, thankyou, and farewell.</span></div>

On the roleplaying feedback front, I continue to be very impressed- for someone who didn’t know what to write, you sure wrote a lot!

Kori Gotcha: After brief discussions with Kiera as to your approach to the situation, the two of you take off in hot pursuit of the Slakoth, having to run as fast as you can to catch up with the Slacker Pokémon, which is certainly not living up to its reputation at the moment, giving the two of you, and the following Pokémon, a good bit of exercise. You chase it for about a minute or so, through the underbrush and away from the Lake, into a slightly more woody area, before the Slakoth runs straight towards a tree, diving under a knot and scrambling in panic to hide inside the tree itself, which appears, on closer inspection, to be hollow.<br />

Eager to investigate, you drop down to your knees and place your head flat against the ground, attempting to see inside the hollowed out tree to see what Slakoth is up to. Moving your head forwards slightly, you are able to get a decent view inside the tree and...<br />
<br />
“OW!” You explain, withdrawing your head quickly from the opening, managing to add insult to injury by falling as you do so. “That little...scratched me right on the nose!” Your hand feels your nose, which is bleeding pretty badly from the sharp claws of the little Pokémon. Kiera pipes up:<br />
“It must be scared, the poor thing. I wonder what is wrong?” she asks, passing you a tissue for your bleeding nose. “What did you see inside the tree?”<br />
<br />
You explain that the tree is indeed hollow and that Slakoth is not the only Pokémon inside, you saw at least one other Pokémon, a Pachirisu inside, also seemingly hiding from something outside the tree, and could hear sounds which could have belonged to several other Pokémon. What you didn’t see however, was any explanation for why the Pokémon were hiding inside the tree, and you say as much to Kiera, with the tissue held over your nose, still facing the tree. Your mind drifts off, wondering what could possibly cause such an uncharacteristic reaction from the Slakoth, when Kiera’s voice drifts into your head, sharper than her usual soft tones, jolting you back to the present.<br />
<br />
“I think I know what the cause of this is.” She says, a note of alarm in her voice.<br />
“What?” you ask, still trying to stop the flow of blood.<br />
“Kori. Turn around. Slowly.” Her voice is shriller and more commanding this time, and you do as she says, turning slowly on the spot. Suddenly, you too have a good idea of the cause of all this.<br />
<br />
Standing not more than three metres from you is another Pokémon. This one however, is not running scared. No, not at all. In fact, unless you’re very much mistaken, this is the reason the other Pokémon are hiding, and probably also the reason that you haven’t seen many signs of life on this side of the Forest. The creature in front of you is a hulking beast, a Vigoroth for sure, but even larger and more feral than most of its species, standing maybe a few inches taller than yourself, and towering over Torchic and Cyndaquil, who have retreated to stand by you and Kiera’s fee. Its fur is matted and slightly browned from dirt, with a distinct red tinge around the mouth area which you don’t need a second look at to identify: Blood. It is none of these things though, that truly chills you about the Pokémon before you. No, the thing causing the hairs to stand up on the back of your neck is Vigoroth’s eyes. They are semi-glazed and almost vacant in appearance, hardly noticing you but clearly aware of your presence by smell. You are struck by the feeling that this Vigoroth appears to be completely mad, and, judging by its appearance, aggressive.<br />
<br />
Now that explains why the Forest is quiet today.</span></span>

</blockquote><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: LemonChiffon">It was far beyond obvious to Kori, this Vigoroth was not in a right state. The eyese were practically blank, but the feeling that was coming off of them only spelled murderous intent. Kori slowly shuffled over to his right, but the Vigoroth turned his head in the same direction.<br />
<br />
“Kiera….I think you should slowly head back towards town…and get some help.” said Kori in the calmest manner he could maintain. Kiera was shaking though and could barely pick up a word Kori was saying. <br />
<br />
<i>Shit, she’s too freaked out.</i> he thought. Taking another look at the Vigoroth, Kori also thought <i>I’m pretty close to crapping my pants too</i>. Kori saw his Torchic down by his feet. <i>Damn it, if only my Torchic had some more experience, or if I had some other Pokemon…..</i> That was when Kori had an idea. It was risky as all hell, but it was the only thing that he could think of. If it worked, then he just might have a chance against this thing. If it didn’t, this will go down as probably one of the shortest, and bloodiest Pokemon journeys for 2 people.<br />
<br />
“Torchic, listen….I need you to be tough for this. On the count of three, I need you to run directly for the tree where the Slakoth and the Pachirisu were hiding. I need you to convince them to help us.” he said. The little Torchic looked up at it’s trainer and looked at him with big teary eyes. <br />
<br />
“Chi chic chic, Torchic!” <i>You’ve gotta be shitting me!</i><br />
<br />
“While you do that, I'm going to run the other way and get this thing's attention away from you. Ok Torchic, 1…..” he said, keeping his eyes on the Vigoroth, it’s breathing was heavy, body shaking with mounting adrenaline. “2…..” he said, sweat beading on Kori’s brow, his heart pumping faster than ever. “3!!!!!!!!!!” </span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver"><b><u>The Graveyard</u></b> - Please reply in <b>silver</b></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: silver"><b><u>Tenorphin</u>: </b>Despite the fact Mismagius is in quite a hurry to reach the crypt before she loses her chance at freedom, this is the first wild Pokémon you've had the opportunity to fight and you're not about to give up the opportunity. Telling her you'll be quick you turn to face Shuppet, issuing Cantare with attack instructions. Mismagius scowls, powerless to do anything about it seeing as she is bound to the stone you are carrying and therefore unable to head to the crypt alone. She instead hovers over top a tombstone, sighing a little over-dramatically whilst glaring hatefully at the Shuppet who is the cause of this delay before turning her attention to Cantare whom she hopes will take the annoying little pest down quickly. Cantare is far too engrossed with Shuppet to notice Mismagius' annoyance, however, and eagerly follows your orders, far too hyped for battle to bother with his usual silly antics, and immediately whips up a <b>Twister</b> that he sends reeling toward Shuppet. Soil and grass are ripped from the ground as the tornado closes the distance between the two Pokémon, Shuppet being buffeted around in the winds and eventually thrown back out again looking a little worse for wear before the attack dies down and calm presides. Annoyed, you watch as swirling black clouds enter Shuppets eyes, not quite sure what is about to happen when two black thunderbolts shoot out of them, Shuppet's <b>Night Shade</b> striking Cantare in the chest and sending him bowling head over heels backward. Squawking indignantly, Cantare hops to his feet and flaps his wings, puffing his chest out to demonstrate he's far from intimidated by the ghost type while he draws upon his own limited stores of ghostly energy. Shuppet, feeling quite confident that this colourful little parrot is no match for him, grins back at Cantare smugly, but it soon realises its mistake when Cantare sends a rather <b>Ominous</b> looking <b>Wind</b> its way, Shuppet's eyes practically bugging out of its head as the purple wind whooshes past it, dealing quite some damage in the process. It <b>Screeches</b> the godforbidden sound so mindnumbing that Cantare's first reaction is to try and bury his head in the ground just to protect his delicate eardrums, though he doesn't quite manage to be able to do so and instead flaps his wings furiously, squawking back at Shuppet angrily. Mismagius sighs, and when you turn to look at her notice she's surrounding by an aura of dark energy that she's itching to let loose upon Shuppet. &quot;Oh <i>please</i> let me take care of this for you,&quot; she pleads, her eyes filled with glee. &quot;It's been so long since I've fought a real battle, this should be fun and will only take a moment...&quot;.</span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver">Mismagius grimaced at gloomy Shuppet, who interrupted her path to freedom, but being helpless to break out of the stone curse by herself, she stared at Shuppet vengefully, as if Shuppet is the one who trapped her in the first place. Instead of objecting to Shou's request, she drifted over to &quot;sit&quot; on a tombstone, while giving everybody a look, before exhaling out in a very loud and peeved manner, as if nobody would be there to hear it, which is ironic, since both Shou and Cantare have better ears than most human and Pokémon respectively.<br />
<br />
Cantare, meanwhile, was too deeply preoccupied by his anger towards Shuppet to notice the loud sigh, and proceeded to attack the Shuppet with much gusto. Sending out spinning air towards the ghastly puppet figure. Shou watches as Shuppet came tumbling up and down inside the twister, feeling somehow glad. But that feeling was short-lived as Shuppet's eyes darken and shot two bolts of dark lightning towards Cantare and hit him in the chest. Gasping loudly, Shou feared for Cantare's safety, but knows that Cantare needs to win this himself as it's his first and the more emotional battle, so he did nothing other than holding his fist together. Picking himself up, Cantare continues his battle with Shuppet, forming a dark shaded wind to be flung towards Shuppet and got screeched in return, which Shou responded with clamping his palms to his ears.<br />
<br />
Sighing, Mismagius offered to help beating up Shuppet to a pulp. Reluctantly, Shou looked at her, thinking over and over again whether to let her help. On one hand, Shou wanted her to help as he cringe at the sight of Cantare being stalked. On the other hand, if Cantare didn't win this by himself, he'd probably sulk all the way through the rest of the week. THAT is not a productive trainer experience. Turning to face Mismagius, Shou realised that Mismagius is already powering up to prepare an attack. He quickly checked that Cantare was still fighting on, and whispered to Mismagius, &quot;Help him if you want, but please do it secretly, it's his first battle, and I don't want him to feel incompetent because he needed help with his battles. I certainly don't want Shuppet to win, either. So please, be subtle.&quot; With that said, Shou turned to Cantare to watch him flapping his wings trying to shake away the echoes of the screeching.<br />
<br />
Without having further thought, Shou ordered, heart racing, &quot;Cantare! Use <b><span style="color: Gold">Metronome</span></b> and then <b><span style="color: Gold">Supersonic</span></b> to confuse the Shuppet, then use your <b><span style="color: Gold">Peck</span></b> to attack it!&quot;</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: LemonChiffon">Mediville (Please reply in LemonChiffon)<br />
<br />
Korius von Gotcha: With the shambling monster little more than ten feet in front of you running its ruddy claws against eachother as the adrenaline began to course through its feral body, your fear begins to clutch at your throat. &quot;Get to town, get help, and quick.&quot; you say, as quietly as you can to Kiera through gritted teeth. You're not sure whether she hears you or not as she makes no immediate movement, so you move to step two of the plan, trying to attract the terrifying Vigoroth's attention as you break from the group, sprinting off to your left. You don't turn back to see what has hapenned but you know the beast is chasing you, its footfalls heavy and its cries blood curdling as you run for your life, adrenaline coursing through your own body now as you sprint around the clearing. Luckily the beast doesn't appear to be as quick as it's species would normally be, probably due to its excess size, so you are not torn apart in the first few seconds at least.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, your companions are not idle. Torchic has returned to the tree and is conversing with the Pokemon there with frantic chirps, trying to enlist their aid to help you out. Meanwhile, Kiera is nowhere to be seen as you look around frantically, not looking where you are running now as you look to see the progress of your companion.<br />
<br />
<i><span style="font-size: 15px">Thunk</span></i><br />
<br />
The crunch of bone on wood is sickening as you manage to run straight into a tree, smashing your arm and right shoulder into the bark, knocking you to the floor. Writhing in pain, you roll over and come face to face with the more immediate concern. The Vigoroth is but inches from you, hunched over. You can feel its hot breath on your face, unpleasant to smell but more unpleasant when it opens its mouth and roars, raising one clawed paw. You close your eyes, and await the inevitable...<br />
<br />
<i>Quuuuuuil</i><br />
<i>GGGGAAAAAAROOOTTTTH</i><br />
<br />
Opening one eye, you are given brief respite to see Vigoroth has turned away from you, and with a view of the creature's back you can see a patch of charred fur, still smouldering. As you look, it begins to sprint towards the source of this new irritation, and as you look past it you can see a shaking Kiera holding Cydanquil tightly in her arms as the beast closes in on them. With another cry, Cyndaquil exhales a thick screen of Smoke, which clouds the area and blocks your view of the situation. You can only hope this buys the two of you some time as Torchic doesn't seem to be making much progress with his negociations..</span></span></div>

Writhing in pain, you roll over and come face to face with the more immediate concern. The Vigoroth is but inches from you, hunched over. You can feel its hot breath on your face, unpleasant to smell but more unpleasant when it opens its mouth and roars, raising one clawed paw. You close your eyes, and await the inevitable...<br />
<br />
<i>Quuuuuuil</i><br />
<i>GGGGAAAAAAROOOTTTTH</i><br />
<br />
Opening one eye, you are given brief respite to see Vigoroth has turned away from you, and with a view of the creature's back you can see a patch of charred fur, still smoldering. As you look, it begins to sprint towards the source of this new irritation, and as you look past it you can see a shaking Kiera holding Cydanquil tightly in her arms as the beast closes in on them. With another cry, Cyndaquil exhales a thick screen of Smoke, which clouds the area and blocks your view of the situation. You can only hope this buys the two of you some time as Torchic doesn't seem to be making much progress with his negotiations.. </span></span>

</blockquote> <span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: LemonChiffon"> Kori stood up, holding is lifeless and limp arm. “Kiera!” he shouted as he saw the crazed Vigoroth charge into Kiera’s Cyndaquil’s Smokescreen. The Vigoroth would have a lot of trouble trying to find those two in the black cloud of smoke, but Kori couldn’t see anything either. It was driving him mad but there was barely anything he could do. As quickly as he could, Kori hobbled over to a nearby bush and hid himself in there, knowing that as things were now, Kiera was the only one that could actually do anything against it without Torchic.<br />
<br />
*** <br />
Torchic made it to the tree successfully. He did just as Kori commanded, run full on for the tree and don’t look back. When he got into the tree, he saw that the Pachirisu and the Slakoth were both still in there, cowering.<br />
<br />
“We need your help! My trainer is out there and he needs us all to help him!” yelled Torchic at the pair. The Slakoth and Pachirisu looked at the small bird like it was crazy. <br />
<br />
“So what do you want us to do about it? I don’t know if you got a good look at that thing, but I saw it take down some of the others in these woods. It’s not natural and I’m not putting myself in it’s path!” said the Pachirisu. <br />
<br />
“Yeah.” said the Slakoth, nodding in agreement with the Pachirisu.<br />
<br />
“You don’t want to put yourselves in its path, but that’s what my trainer is doing right now! He ran away from here knowing that that beast would follow him. Who knows what it’s done to him by now!” said Torchic growing angry.<br />
<br />
“But what can we do?” asked the Slakoth. Torchic’s yelling might have sounded like cute and hurried little chirps to the human ear, but to these Pokemon, they were angry and desperate please.<br />
<br />
“ANYTHING! If there is anything any one of us can do, then we have to do it! If we don’t stop that monster right now, it won’t just tear up my trainer, but it’ll come back for you guys. You saw that monster, how long do you think you can hide from it? It’ll get you no matter how long you hide in here!” screamed Torchic. Pachirisu and Slakoth looked at each other and then at Torchic, but neither would say a word. Torchic’s feathers ruffled up with anger. If he couldn’t get through to these Pokemon now, then he would have to go back for his Trainer and do whatever it was possible to help him. <br />
<br />
“Fine, you cowards. You call yourselves Pokemon, but you are all nothing but chickens!” yelled Torchic in full realization of the irony. Putting on his bravest face, Torchic ran back out of the tree, angrier than before and hoping that he could make it back to his trainer before he was sliced into pieces. </span></span></div>

Korito Gotchaski: Clutching your badly hurt arm, you stagger into the thick smoke, not really sure how to help further as it seems Torchic is not making much progress playing Ban Ki Moon. You can hear the angered cries of the Vigoroth not far from you, but it sounds like it has not yet found Kiera, Cyndaquil or Torchic as it thrashes around in anger, which gives you a degree of comfort. It doesn't seem like you can remain hidden much longer though as the Smokescreen is definitely thinning, allowing you to see a shape a few feet to your left, which causes you to freeze to spot as you try to make it out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kori, is that you?&quot; a soft but desperate whisper comes from the figure, and you are hugely relieved to see Kiera and Cyndaquil, who has hidden away his flame to help the pair hide. You nod and move towards the pair, tripping over something by your feet and landing on your one good side with a bump, but more worryingly, a pretty loud noise. Looking down at your feet, you see the obstacle as Torchic looks at you nervously, having tripped you unintentionally. Scrambling to your feet, you are happy to be reunited with your companion and friend, but that noise will almost certainly have given away your location.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, you hear heavy footsteps followed by a bloodcurdling roar, which clears the smoke to reveal Vigoroth, looking evening more maddened by his inability to catch either of the two of you so far. As it starts to charge towards you, your two Pokémon step forwards to protect you instinctively, but you can’t see the two of them having much chance of doing much more than slowing the shambling beast.<br />
“Why didn’t you run?” you ask Kiera, remembering your previous plan<br />
“I can’t leave you hear with this, you’d never survive long enough.” She replies, wringing her hands in fear. As you speak, the two Fire Pokémon unite with a pair of Ember attacks, shooting a pair of small fireballs at the Vigoroth, scorching it slightly but not stopping its advance. Suddenly though, without the two Pokémon doing anything more, Vigoroth stops dead in his tracks, and you can see that something has attacked it from behind as it waves it’s huge claws around behind his back. As it swings around, you can see Pachirisu and Slakoth clinging on to its fur, clawing and biting at the monstrosity. Roaring again, Vigoroth throws them off and then two fly back, landing heavily by your feet, but the two jump up again, standing shoulder to shoulder with Torchic and Cyndaquil. Perhaps the four Pokémon together might have more of a chance...</span></span></div>

<span style="color: silver"><b><u>Tenorphin</u>: </b>&quot;I don't do subtle,&quot; Mismagius replies, a wicked grin forming on her lips whilst eyeing Shuppet. A moment later though, upon witnessing Cantare bobbing up and down while using <b>Metronome</b>, Mismagius is so taken aback that she forgets to attack. Her eyes bulge while Catare's tail feathers flick in rhythm with his motion and in the next instant she's screeching with laughter. Not quite sure whether to be taken aback by her reaction or to laugh along with her, you're glad Cantare is too engrossed in his battle to have noticed. You watch while Cantare appears to struggle to perform the move, hoping he's able to pull it off so that Mismagius doesn't have a reason to tease your teammate mercilessly for failing to perform a move he can't possibly know. Shuppet, meanwhile, can see that Cantare is struggling and uses this opportunity to unleash another <b>Night Shade</b>. Cantare is struck in the chest, and although he's stinging from the attack he does little other than utter a pained squawk while continuing to concentrate on his attack. Shuppet appears pleased, and just as it moves in to attack with a physical blow Cantare unleashes an orb of energy that flies toward Shuppet, closing the distance between them at lighting speed. The <b>Aura Sphere</b> smacks Shuppet head on, startling the ghost though not hurting it while Cantare sighs with disappointment at having called upon a move the ghost type is immune to. Shuppet then continues to move in to strike Cantare just hard enough to <b>Knock Off</b> the Silk Scarf he's holding. Frustrated beyond measure, Cantare opens his mouth wide and screeches out a <b>Supersonic</b>, the high-pitches noise having the desired effect of confusing his opponent. While Shuppet is shaking its head to help regain its senses, Cantare hops forward and starts <b>Pecking</b> it. At this point in time Shuppet doesn't know up from down let alone how to respond, and can only attempt to defend itself by backing away from the highly annoyed Chatot attacking it. Mismagius has stopped laughing, a thoughtful look on her face. Cantare my have failed to call upon a useful attack, but the fact he'd managed to succeed in pulling off his Metronome seems to have impressed her and she's now watching closely to see how this battle ends...</span></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: LemonChiffon"> “Alright! You did it Torchic!” yelled Kori, ever so thankful that at least part 1 of his plan worked out. Now came part 2, the toughest part which was bringing down the mad Vigoroth and staying alive. Kori looked at the beast with renewed vigor, a smile forming on his face. Then Kori looked down at the Pachirisu. “Hey! Pachirisu! If we get out of this alive, you’re going to pay for this!” he yelled, pointing at the scratch across the nose the Pachirisu gave him. Pachirisu turned back and responded.<br />
<br />
“Pachi pachi!” <i>Suck it!</i> it said, Torchic and Cyndaquil slightly embarrassed at that exchange.<br />
<br />
“Kori, focus!” yelled Kiera. Kori regained composure and knew what to do with this. <br />
<br />
“Alright Torchic, this is it! Use Focus Energy and Agility to get close to the Vigoroth, then hit him hard with Crush Claw! Be sure to get out of there really quick! Pachirisu, support Torchic with whatever you got!” ordered Kori. He turned to Kiera who was still standing nervous but Kori looked into her eyes. “Don’t worry Kiera, we’ll get out of this alive. Now you know what to do Kiera, I know you can do it.” he said. Kiera looked at Kori and found that she had stopped shaking. She smiled at him and nodded saying “You know, you really gotta quit saying those cheesy things.” </span></span></div>

Pokemonxd4: <i>Would have been easier to read that in two paragraphs rather than one but no big deal. Reply is perfectly fine, no issues with self updating or anything else and the length is fine considering you didn’t have much to work with</i><br />
<br />
Yourself and Wipeout step through into the darkened room, stepping off the stone stairs you recent ascended on. As your back foot leaves the platform, it shudders slightly and begins to slowly descend back towards the floor from whence it came, leaving you and Wipeout stuck on the upper level. “Great.” You mutter, “Trapped in the dark attic of a creepy Tomb. What could possibly go wrong.” Wipeout giggles, albeit nervously in your arms, holding his tail out in front of the two of you which provides enough light for you to have a quick look around your new surroundings. In front of you is a fairly large stone walled room, far less ornate than those you have walked through before. In fact, it seems like this room was purely a functional one, as the room is sparsely furnished. Underfoot, the room is dusty and coated with a layer of what seems to be, to put it subtlety, the leavings of a creature or creatures unknown.<br />
<br />
Recoiling slightly as you notice the rather smelly carpet on the floor of the room, Wipeout covers his nose from the smell, which you notice for the first time. Not pleasant, not at all. “This gets better and better.” You mumble once more, kicking slightly at the layer of feaces which comes away slightly underfoot, suggesting that it might be a little more recent than the majority of the contents of the Tomb. Looking around to see a source of the leavings, no life is immediately apparent but the stone room, whilst free of doors, does appear to have a number of holes in the wall which could well be occupied by...well, who knows what? <br />
<br />
Wipeout remains in your arms, clearly not keen to take the floor in the absence of the shoes which protect your own feet, but stands up in your arms, craning his neck to look for a sign of life, and you approach the nearest hole. Wipeout holds his flame up to illuminate the hole, and something inside stirs. There is not quite enough light for you to make it out, but Wipeout shivers noticeably, clearly creeped out. Will you investigate further?</span><br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Gold">Sorry I took so long. Hope you don't mind too much. And I'm sorry for making Kori wait for an update a litte while ago.<br />
<br />
Zack began to approach the hole when he stopped and looked down at his shoes. He just stepped into a huge pile of...well feacies and... &quot;Oh you've gotta be kidding me. How could it get any worse?&quot; He was about to find out how, as the next step he took got his other shoe covered in it as well. Wipeout began to laugh for at least a minute before he calmed down. He lifted his feet up to get farther away from the gunk on the ground. Zack however tried in a futile effort, to get the feacies off of his foot. It just resulted in making his shoe stink even more. He and Wipeout plugged their noses in an attempt to block out the smell however both of them start coughing in disgust.<br />
<br />
After that Zack began to look around. He noticed that the room had no doors but small holes. Wipeout began moving to Zack's back. Apparently he had the feeling water was in the holes. &quot;Don't worry Wipeout. There's no water here. At least I don't think there's any.&quot; Zack had sometimes been able to sense some of Wipeout's emotions due to the special bracelets he and Wipeout wear.(See Zack and Wipeout's history.) So he knew that Wipeout was feeling his fear of water. Wipeout decided to trust Zack and came back around to the front of him. He put out his tail for more light.<br />
<br />
Zack started approaching the nearest hole while Wipeout started looking around for some form of life that could be in the area. Zack bent down to look inside and moved Wipeout's tail. He thought he saw some kind of movement. *What could be in there? A Pokemon? Most likely. There has to be some other way to get in there. I guess I just have to investigate further.* He moved Chimchar's tail closer for a better look.</span></span></div>

Kori Gotcha: The four Pokémon unite against a common enemy in the form of the shambling, feral Vigoroth before you, each one towered over by the monster with the matted fur. A little further back, you and Kiera have finished exchanging good lucks and give your Pokémon orders to bring down the circling beast. You hear Kiera issuing orders to her Cyndaquil in the eerie silence which comes before the storm:<br />
<br />
“Cynadquil, distract it from Torchic’s attack with a Leer, then Ember! Slakoth, help us out here with whatever you have!” she cries out to her partner, who steps forward.<br />
<br />
Cyndaquil nods and begins to Leer at Vigoroth, who stares back at the Fire Mouse, looking about as intimidated as an Elephant being stalked by a Guinea Pig, and charges at Cyndaquil, who cries out in fear. With Torchic having finished Focusing his Energy, he is ready to intervene, using a burst of Agility to get in between the monster and his target, swiping with a heavy Crush Claw into the knee of Vigoroth, who trips and falls forwards onto his face, as Torchic zips away out of reach of retaliation. As the beast falls, Slakoth and Pachirisu jump into the fray, Slakoth scratching away at the back of the creature while Pachirisu’s Quick Attack bombards the back of the creature’s legs. Cyndaquil is then ready to atack, breathing forth an Ember into the face of Vigoroth, scorching fur and enraging the creature.<br />
<br />
Vigoroth stands defiantly and with a bellowing roar, throws off Pachiriu and Slakoth, who was clinging onto the back fur of the feral Pokemon, leaving the two crumpled in a heap behind him as he advances on the two of you and your respective fire types. Leaning back and belllowing, it begins to create an Uproar,the deafening noise causing all of you to cover your ears to prevent the most piercing noise while Vigoroth is on the move once more, diving towards Torchic and unleashing a huge set of Fury Swipes, causing Torchic to cry out in pain and fall back towards you, hurt considerably by the attack but still ready to fight on for you.<br />
<br />
What now?</span><br />

<span style="color: Gold">Ancient Tomb (Please reply in Gold)<br />

Skyminxd: <i>Welcome back. Firstly, you need to update your <a href="http://bmgf.bulbagarden.net/showthread.php?t=8699&amp;page=4" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fbmgf.bulbagarden.net%2Fshowthread.php%3Ft%3D8699%26page%3D4&amp;hash=2d53273711180dd44d08e955f7fbe0b8" rel="nofollow noopener">Account Names</a> post for your new username. Also, you need to put a link to your FB registration post in your sig- doesn't need to be very big, but just make sure it's there.</i><br />
<br />
Steeling himself against the possibility of finding water in the dark holes, Wipeout raises his tail flame to the hole slowly to illuminate it. As the light comes over it, the noise stops suddenly in the hole, and you are left, crouching to see into it, seeing nothing but the inside of dark green hole, seemingly covered in some of moss, which would suggest the presence of water at some point, but there is none to be instantly seen which will no doubt be of relief for Wipeout. Dissapointed not to see anything of note inside the hole, Wipeout inserts a finger and scrapes some of the mossy substance off onto his finger, and sniffs it.<br />
<br />
Wipeout's reaction clearly suggests that it does not smell nice. The monkey Pokemon gags slightly and throws it to the floor, as you too get a whiff of the fungi. It smells not unlike rotten eggs, which is a smell to overwhelm even the reasonably acrid natural smell of this mysterious high room. As the two of you are distracted by the smell, there comes a bloodcurdling screech and a considerable amount of flapping, which makes the two of you jump backwards, stumbling out of the way of the stone wall from which a pair of dark green-blue forms come shooting out. The two fly straight out of the room into the air and past the place where the stairs you climbed in on had been, and in the light you can see that they are both Zubats, flapping noisily. As they fly out of the room, you notice something has fallen out of the hole, a small bit of rather battered looking paper which you hold in the light from Wipeouts tail flame and read. It is mostly illegible, but you can make out some letters and words:<br />

<span style="color: LemonChiffon"><span style="font-size: 9px"> “Torchic!” yelled Kori. Those Fury Swipes that the Vigoroth waylaid onto the small chick Pokemon were brutal, but the little bird soldiered on, standing back up against the beast. 4 small Pokemon vs 1 unnaturally large monster, this fight was going to be tougher than Kori thought. There was no time for faltering though, everyone chose to fight on and the attack has to press on. Thinking though was hard, that Upoar attack nearly turned his brain into mush. After shaking off the effects and setting his sights straight, Kori finally thought of his next set of orders.<br />
<br />
“Alright Torchic, I hope that didn’t take too much out of you because your going to go in heavy with this turn. You gotta use that Copycat move you learned and hit that Vigoroth from all angles, try and triple up your Ember attack while you’re at it! Then get out of there with a Bounce and hit it hard when you drop back down! Pachirisu, keep working on it’s legs and if you got an electric attack in you that’d be great!</span></span></div>

A moment later though, upon witnessing Cantare bobbing up and down while using <b>Metronome</b>, Mismagius is so taken aback that she forgets to attack. Her eyes bulge while Cantare's tail feathers flick in rhythm with his motion and in the next instant she's screeching with laughter. Not quite sure whether to be taken aback by her reaction or to laugh along with her, you're glad Cantare is too engrossed in his battle to have noticed. You watch while Cantare appears to struggle to perform the move, hoping he's able to pull it off so that Mismagius doesn't have a reason to tease your teammate mercilessly for failing to perform a move he can't possibly know. Shuppet, meanwhile, can see that Cantare is struggling and uses this opportunity to unleash another <b>Night Shade</b>. Cantare is struck in the chest, and although he's stinging from the attack he does little other than utter a pained squawk while continuing to concentrate on his attack. Shuppet appears pleased, and just as it moves in to attack with a physical blow Cantare unleashes an orb of energy that flies toward Shuppet, closing the distance between them at lighting speed. The <b>Aura Sphere</b> smacks Shuppet head on, startling the ghost though not hurting it while Cantare sighs with disappointment at having called upon a move the ghost type is immune to. Shuppet then continues to move in to strike Cantare just hard enough to <b>Knock Off</b> the Silk Scarf he's holding. Frustrated beyond measure, Cantare opens his mouth wide and screeches out a <b>Supersonic</b>, the high-pitches noise having the desired effect of confusing his opponent. While Shuppet is shaking its head to help regain its senses, Cantare hops forward and starts <b>Pecking</b> it. At this point in time Shuppet doesn't know up from down let alone how to respond, and can only attempt to defend itself by backing away from the highly annoyed Chatot attacking it. Mismagius has stopped laughing, a thoughtful look on her face. Cantare may have failed to call upon a useful attack, but the fact he'd managed to succeed in pulling off his Metronome seems to have impressed her and she's now watching closely to see how this battle ends...</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Silver">Shou could tell that Mismagius is sort of a cunningly vengeful Ghost Pokémon judging from the devilish smirk on her face. She has her eyes set on Shuppet, who is having a face off with Cantare, with possible dark intentions. Shou turned his attention back to Cantare when he started to wiggle his tail to prepare the move Metronome. Cantare's tail glowed brightly, leaving a trail of white slashes in Shou's vision as it continually swung left and right. Noticing Mismagius laughing, Shou shot Mismagius a look while eyeing Cantare, hoping him not to notice this insult. <i>Cantare doesn't seem to be noticing, thankfully,</i> Shou thought. He turned his attention back to Cantare, who was struggling to pull off a successful Metronome attack. <br />
<br />
The white glow was slowly becoming more intense as seconds passes. Shuppet, however, wasn't intending to let time pass waiting for Cantare to attack. Shou watched in anxiety as Shuppet unleashes another purplish-black ghostly energy. The energy wave hit Cantare in the chest, seemingly disrupting the Metronome process. Shou had the sudden urge to rush up to Shuppet to beat it to pulp, but he refrained himself from doing so out of consideration of Cantare's huge sense of pride and type immunity. Shou throwing a punch is definitely a fighting-type, which is immune by Shuppet, and is illegal anyway.<br />
<br />
Squawking painfully, Cantare continued to focus his energy on Shuppet, which results in a ball of brick-red energy. It glowed softly and got larger continuously. Cantare fixed his eyes on Shuppet, who closed in with Cantare trying to land a physical attack on Cantare, but Cantare was faster. He let loose the brick-red ball of Aura Sphere, passing through Shuppet and startling it. Unfortunately, it didn't cause any damage to the ghost Pokémon at all. Feeling somewhat dejected, Shou watched in horror as Shuppet managed to Knock Off the Silk Scarf Cantare is holding. He hurried to pick up the Silk Scarf, worried that it might be lost if it's not picked up soon. Shou put the Silk Scarf back into his bag, making a mental note to put it back on Cantare when he finishes his fight.<br />
<br />
Cantare felt the frustration of not being able to hold onto his hold item, causing him to screech out a shaky Supersonic even Shou couldn't bear and have to cover his ears with Silk Scarf. Shou couldn't care so much about Mismagius now, as he couldn't take his eyes off his starter Pokémon thrashing about in resentment. The furious music note Pokémon hopped towards the confused Shuppet in his fastest speed ever achieved yet, using his wings to propel himself towards his opponent. At the end of his self-propulsion, he prepared his ever-trusty beak and Pecked ferociously on Shuppet, who can only slowly back off to avoid the Peckings.<br />
<br />
Having the upper hand, as Shou perceived to be, he ordered Cantare again, &quot;Be quick now, <b><span style="color: Gold">Mirror</span></b> the Shuppet's last <b><span style="color: gold">Move</span></b> back on it. It really should taste its own medicine.&quot; While saying so, he glimpsed at Mismagius, who is now watching the battle impressed. Feeling glad, he continued, &quot;While you're on it, do <b><span style="color: gold">Ominous Wind</span></b> on Shuppet as well. He can't be immune to Ghost attacks. Finally, <b><span style="color: gold">Twister</span></b> Shuppet out of its consciousness, if you can.&quot; Searching for signs of approval on Mismagius' face, Shou decided to end the battle quickly, get done with Mismagius' request, and get out of the spooky graveyard as soon as possible.</span></span></div>

Kori Gotcha: <i>My apologies for how long this update has taken , I’m not quite sure why I haven’t updated this before, probably only a few more updates after this one, so I’ll try and get you out early in 2010, so you can have a bit of fun.</i><br />
<br />
Even four against one, this battle is proving harder than you’d even feared, with the Pokémon’s attacks seemingly only enraging the mad Vigoroth further. Torchic fights on, despite receiving a heavy blow, and the two of you devise a plan to increase your numbers still further, Torchic using Copycat to split itself into three separate triplets, moving independently, at the expense of half of its remaining health. Whilst this hurts Torchic, he toughs it out and the trio face down the perplexed Vigoroth, who looks on in some measure of surprise at the multiplication of Chickens before him, snarling as the identical threesome combine their powers to form a hailstorm of Embers, forcing Vigoroth to cover his face as the small jets of flame rain down on him, aided by Kiera’s Cyndaquil who is clearly keen to assist with whatever can be done.<br />
<br />
Throwing his arms wide, Vigoroth lets out another bestial Uproar, ceasing the Fire Pokémon’s attacks and causing them to step back slightly in fear as their ears ring and their faces are drenched with the foul spittle of the beast. Bravely, Pachirisu and Slakoth charge forwards at Vigoroth, attempting to show their lack of fear, Pachirisu aiming for a Quick Attack whilst Slakoth has his own claws raised for a wild Scratch attack borne out of desperation to bring down Vigoroth. The matted, shambling beast is not taken by surprise again though, and swings one heavy paw around, swatting the two Pokémon out of the air in one clean blow, sending them both spinning into the ground, landing face down and unmoving, evening the numbers involved. <br />
<br />
Advancing, Vigoroth slams heavy feet into the turf, vibrations or fear or both causing the fire Pokémon to quiver as he comes forwards, scooping seizing Cyndaquil in one huge paw, seemingly untroubled by the flames on the Mouse’s back. With the small fire Pokémon and its owner screaming, Vigoroth shakes mercilessly before throwing the petrified and seemingly unconscious Cyndaquil back at Kiera, who catches her Pokémon and bursts into tears, seeing the merciless assault of Vigoroth. Torchic gulps slightly, but the three Fire types jet up into the air with a tremendous Bounce, getting a good distance above Vigoroth, who looks up to see the chicks descending upon him, swinging his arms in another Fury Swipes on the descending Pokémon, clawing clean through one Copycat Torchic, which disappears, and then a second, also evaporating into the ether just as the final and true Torchic lands on Vigoroth’s nose, clawing away before bouncing back out of the reach of a vengeful Slash.<br />
<br />
Landing on the ground, Torchic looks around and realises he is alone against Vigoroth, with the other three Pokémon slumped, Cynaquil cradled in Kiera’s shaking arms, Pachirisu and Slakoth off to one side, breathing but unconscious. Gritting his tiny teeth, Torchic cries out “Chiiiiiiiiic” and begins to glow...<br />
<br />
<i>Torchic gains one level, from 15 to 16</i><br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: LemonChiffon"> “Chhiiiiiiii!” screamed the small glowing pokemon. Kori looked in awe and amazement. Just a second ago, it seemed like a dark shadow of despair was covering the area. Now, Torchic’s light brought on a new ray of hope to Kori. The shape of Torchic began to change within that light, it’s body growing larger. It’s small chicken sticks grew thicker, more muscular, it’s tiny wings that it used to barely fly turned into arms. When the glowing died down, the new pokemon that appeared in Torchic’s place stretched its new limbs.<br />
<br />
“Combuuuuusken!” it yelled, jumping up into the air doing a back flip and then settling into a pose that said “ready for action!” Kori got out his Pokedex and pointed it at his new Pokemon. <br />
<br />
“Combusken, the young fowl Pokemon. Combusken battles with the intensely hot flames it spews from its beak and with outstandingly destructive kicks. This Pokémon's cry is very loud and distracting.”<br />
<br />
“Holy crap! That’s awesome!” Yelled Kori. As he looked around him though, this was still no time to truly celebrate just yet. He looked at Kiera who also bore witness to Torchi’s evolution into Combusken and was still holding tight to her Cyndaquil. “Kiera!” he yelled. Kiera shook herself out of her shock, a mix of hopelessness and awe had taken her out of the moment. “I need you to get Pachirisu and Slakoth and make sure they’re ok!”<br />
<br />
“I’m not going to leave you alone with that thing Kori! I didn’t last time and I won’t this time!” she said. <br />
<br />
“Kiera, I’m not asking you to run away, I just want to be sure that they’ll be alright, because I’m about to beat this monster back to wherever it came from, and after that, we’re all going to celebrate and be happy again!” said Kori with a smile of reassurance beaming. Kiera looked at Kori, half like he was crazy, but at the same time with a greater measure of courage and bravery. She looked at her Cyndaquil, unconscious but alive, held on tight to it, stood up and began running over to Slakoth and Pachirisu, hoping that Kori would succeed.<br />
<br />
Kori stared down his opponent, the maddened Vigoroth and began thinking of a new battle plan when he noticed his Pokedex blinking with an entry. Kori selected the entry and ran down a list of recorded attacks found in a Combusken. This gave Kori an idea.<br />
<br />
“Combusken, look sharp because this is it! We’re going to bring this insanity to an end now! Use Ember to drive Vigoroth back again and then use Focus Energy again to gather up all of your strength. Once you do that, give him a Double Kick! </span></span></div>

Kori Gotcha: <i>Buuuuusken!</i><br />
<br />
The newly evolved Combusken calls its name, in a much deeper voice than before and stands, facing down Vigoroth, who for the first time looks a little concerned as the young fowl stands before him, still a little smaller but certainly a lot more even. The beast is cornered, but as any fool knows, a wild, feral creature such as that before you is at its most dangerous when it feels threatened, and from the look on Vigoroth’s face, it is certainly that. Combusken stares back fearlessly, adrenaline from the evolution pumping through him and he strikes, blowing another Ember towards the aggressor, beating him back further, before stopping to focus his energy into one final blow. Looking up at his opponent, Vigoroth appears to have been driven to desperation, raking his foot along the ground before charging headlong, almost like a bull.<br />
<br />
Combusken takes a step to one side as Vigoroth charges in, but the normal-type Pokémon flies through, wide of the fire-type, who realises too late that he was not the intended target of that attack. Kiera unleashes a chilling scream as Vigoroth tears past Combusken and tackles you, 50kg of muscle and fur colliding with you and the two of you go tumbling back, the smell almost overcoming you as the matted fur and the hot breath of the Pokémon on top of you as you break apart, leaving you slumped against a tree stump, with Vigoroth rising before you. You close your eyes, once more anticipating an attack...<br />
<br />
“Chiiiiiiiriiii”<br />
<br />
Opening one eye, you see a small blue-yellow flash jet across your field of vision, clipping Vigoroth as it goes past, causing the shambling beast to roar out in pain once more, turning to see Pachirisu standing before him, wobbly on its feet but defiant. Sitting up, your throat becomes tight from fear for the small Pokémon, alone against the beast, who swings a fist down towards the Pokémon...and collapses to the ground, seemingly falling towards you. As it falls, you see Combuken with one taloned foot planted on the temple of Vigoroth, following it up with second kick as the normal-type falls for good measure, out cold long before it lands in the dirt.<br />
<br />
As Combusken lands on his feet, triumphant, you start to drift slightly in and out of consciousness, and see only fleeting images of what follows...Pachirisu dancing around Combusken in excitement, Kiera and Cyndaquil coming over to you and Slakoth too climbing to his feet. The last thing you remember before losing consciousness is Combusken coming over to you, concerned and giving your limp hand a bit of a lick as you slip into blackness<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Sometime later, you don’t really know how long, your eyes open again, and through a heavy haze across your eye line you make out the shape of a room and a bed...you seem to have been moved somewhere. You try to move, but everything is stiff and sore, and as you start to fidget you hear a voice. “Kori?” Are you awake?” the soft voice is instantly recognizable as Kiera’s, which soothes you. She sounds calm, and that spreads to you. You open one eye a little wider and manage to nod slightly as she comes into view. She’s clearly changed clothes, so you reason that you must be back in Mediville. She squeezes your hand slightly as she continues, which hangs off the bed slightly. “I’m glad your okay...I was worried for a while, but the Doctor came, he said you weren’t badly hurt, that you were lucky not to have broken anything, that you just need rest.”<br />
<br />
Weakly, you nod again, and see Combusken in the corner of the room, sleeping. You also become aware of a small weight climbing up your leg and onto your chest, looking down to see a ruffled and rather concerned looking Pachirisu staring into your eyes, looking slightly worried as she pats your face, catching site of the nose that she’d scratched when you first met. Kiera giggles slightly “Pachirisu seems to have taken quite the liking to you and Slakoth to me. It seems we’ve met our first Pokémon captures, although not quite in the way I’d imagined we would!” You smile, slightly painfully, and remember your nose, prodding it delicately. Kiera smiles, and says once more: “Oh, and the Doctor said that would probably scar. Sorry about that!”<br />

Kori Gotcha: <i>Buuuuusken!</i><br />
<br />
The newly evolved Combusken calls its name, in a much deeper voice than before and stands, facing down Vigoroth, who for the first time looks a little concerned as the young fowl stands before him, still a little smaller but certainly a lot more even. The beast is cornered, but as any fool knows, a wild, feral creature such as that before you is at its most dangerous when it feels threatened, and from the look on Vigoroth’s face, it is certainly that. Combusken stares back fearlessly, adrenaline from the evolution pumping through him and he strikes, blowing another Ember towards the aggressor, beating him back further, before stopping to focus his energy into one final blow. Looking up at his opponent, Vigoroth appears to have been driven to desperation, raking his foot along the ground before charging headlong, almost like a bull.<br />
<br />
Combusken takes a step to one side as Vigoroth charges in, but the normal-type Pokémon flies through, wide of the fire-type, who realises too late that he was not the intended target of that attack. Kiera unleashes a chilling scream as Vigoroth tears past Combusken and tackles you, 50kg of muscle and fur colliding with you and the two of you go tumbling back, the smell almost overcoming you as the matted fur and the hot breath of the Pokémon on top of you as you break apart, leaving you slumped against a tree stump, with Vigoroth rising before you. You close your eyes, once more anticipating an attack...<br />

<br />
Even through the pain, Kori sits up and looks around at everyone. Kiera, Combusken, Pachirisu, Cyndaquil, Slakoth, it was such a relief to see everyone safe and unhurt. It was all such a relief that Kori broke out laughing. <br />
<br />
“What’s so funny Kori?” asked Kiera.<br />
<br />
“Well, I run into a tree, and I get tackled by an insane Vigoroth, and the only thing I come out of it with is a scar from Pachirisu!” he laughed. The laughing grew louder and was even accompanied by Kiera who also took note of the hilarity of that. Combusken was even stirred awake from his sleep and jumped to Kori’s side when he saw that he was awake. Everyone was celebrating and happy again, just as Kori said.<br />
<br />
***<br />
After a few more hours of rest, and a few more hours of arguing with doctors, telling them that he was fine enough to leave, Kori and Kiera leave the Mediville hospital, their Pokemon following behind them. Once out, Kori stretched his arms and legs and breathed deep the town air. <br />
<br />
“Maaaaan it’s good to get out of there. I can’t stand the scent of iodine and disinfectant.” said Kori. Combusken walked alongside Kori. “Are you sure you should be walking around already? You really should stay here at least another day.” advised Kiera worriedly. “No way, Combusken and I have to get out on the road. It was one heck of a beginning but that’s all this was, just the beginning. What about you Kiera?”<br />
<br />
Kiera looked down, disappointedly. “I’m going to stay here for a little while longer. When my father heard about what happened, he called the Mediville police and Pokemon control to make sure that there weren’t anymore Pokemon out there like that Vigoroth. He’s a little bit of a worrywart so he insisted that I stay until they make sure that everything is fine.”<br />
<br />
“Ah, that’s a bummer. I hope that was the only one like that, but now that I have Combusken,” Kori, looked down and smiled at the little white and blue squirrel near his legs, “and Pachirisu, I don’t think they’ll be a problem for me.” he said. A thought suddenly came to him. “Ah, that’s right; we have to make this official, right Pachirisu?” Pachirisu looked up at Kori questioningly while Kori dug around his backpack and pulled out a small <a href="http://bmgf.bulbagarden.net/showpost.php?p=1141451&amp;postcount=1895" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fbmgf.bulbagarden.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D1141451%26postcount%3D1895&amp;hash=ead208b6846f7e5e79506ff14c08bfce" rel="nofollow noopener">Pokeball</a>. He pressed the button in the middle and it grew to the size of a softball. Getting down on one knee, Kori asked, “You do want to come along with me, right?” presenting the Pokeball in front of the little electric Pokemon. Pachirisu looked at Combusken.<br />
<br />
“Pachi, pachi risu?” <i>Think I should go?</i> <br />
“Busken. Combusken combusken busken combus.” <i> Sure. As long as your not planning on scarring our trainer again.” said Combusken. Pachirisu blushed a little from embarrassment.<br />
<br />
“Well? Are you in?” asked Kori. Pachirisu smiled and pressed the button on the Pokeball. A small red ray of light shot out and wrapped itself around Pachirisu, and the little squirrel was in the red and white ball. “Alright, welcome to the team Pachirisu.” Kori said to the ball that was in his hand. He pressed the ball again releasing Pachirisu from her ball and extended his hand to the squirrel who immediately jumped up on his arm and sat up on his shoulder. Kori looked at Combusken who, even though he had a beak, seemed to be smiling as well. “Alright guys, let’s hit the road he said. Turning toward Kiera, Kori extended his hand and said “It’s been one heck of an experience, let’s meet again out there.” he said. Kiera reached to take Kori’s hand, however she hesitated. “Kiera…?” began Kori, but was then interrupted by a hug instead. <br />
<br />
“Definitely, we’ll definitely meet again.” said Kiera. Kori hugged Kiera back, hoping that they were right, that one day, along their Pokemon journey, Kori and Kiera will once again meet and have another great adventure. They released each other and said their final goodbyes. Kori walked out onto the road, Combusken by his side and Pachirisu perched on his shoulder. Kiera watched as the three moved farther and farther into the distance. While every step moved Kori further from Mediville, each step also moved him closer to his next great adventure. The road to new sights, new people, new pokemon, and new experiences lay ahead of the young Kori Gotcha, and he intended to take every step of the way there.</i></span></span></div>

<span style="color: silver"><b><u>Tenorphin</u>: </b>Not even giving Shuppet a chance to retaliate, Cantare spins around and, remembering his agitation when the ghost type <b>Knock</b>ed <b>Off</b> his Silk Scarf, <b>Mirror</b>s the <b>Move</b> right back at it only to find Shuppet isn't holding anything. Shuppet is startled, however, just long enough for Cantare to unleash an <b>Ominous</b>ly hazy purple <b>Wind</b> chocker block full of ghost energy upon his foe. Shuppet takes heavy damage, barely hanging on to consciousness now, and with desperation mounting it shoots a <b>Night Shade</b> at the colourful Chatot hoping it will be enough to end this battle. Unfortunately this isn't the case and Cantare, dizzy with anticipation, pulls out all stops, summoning a <b>Twister</b> that he sends flying toward his enemy. The tight cyclonic wind whips across the grass, turf flying in all directions as Shuppet is drawn into the tornado. It spins, out of control, its final <b>Night Shade</b> lost in the swirling gale before the wind dies down and Shuppet comes crashing to the ground, KO'ed. <b>Level up for Cantare</b>.<br />
<br />
Mismagius' eyes are narrowed as she examines Cantare closely. She has been locked away for centuries and has never before witnessed a Pokémon use a move it doesn't learn naturally. Things have certainly changed since she was last free, but now that the battle is over it seems she's eager to move on. &quot;Quickly!&quot; she urges, turning and drifting off toward the far end of the cemetery. &quot;We're running out of time!&quot;</span></span></div>
