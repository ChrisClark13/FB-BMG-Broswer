<br />
<span style="color: silver"><b><u>Tenorphin</u>: </b>Not even giving Shuppet a chance to retaliate, Cantare spins around and, remembering his agitation when the ghost type <b>Knock</b>ed <b>Off</b> his Silk Scarf, <b>Mirror</b>s the <b>Move</b> right back at it only to find Shuppet isn't holding anything. Shuppet is startled, however, just long enough for Cantare to unleash an <b>Ominous</b>ly hazy purple <b>Wind</b> chocker block full of ghost energy upon his foe. Shuppet takes heavy damage, barely hanging on to consciousness now, and with desperation mounting it shoots a <b>Night Shade</b> at the colourful Chatot hoping it will be enough to end this battle. Unfortunately this isn't the case and Cantare, dizzy with anticipation, pulls out all stops, summoning a <b>Twister</b> that he sends flying toward his enemy. The tight cyclonic wind whips across the grass, turf flying in all directions as Shuppet is drawn into the tornado. It spins, out of control, its final <b>Night Shade</b> lost in the swirling gale before the wind dies down and Shuppet comes crashing to the ground, KO'ed. <b>Level up for Cantare</b>.<br />
<br />
Mismagius' eyes are narrowed as she examines Cantare closely. She has been locked away for centuries and has never before witnessed a Pokémon use a move it doesn't learn naturally. Things have certainly changed since she was last free, but now that the battle is over it seems she's eager to move on. &quot;Quickly!&quot; she urges, turning and drifting off toward the far end of the cemetery. &quot;We're running out of time!&quot;</span></span>

<br />
<span style="color: Silver">Shou almost leaped towards his Chatot in excitement when Cantare pulled off the <b>Mirror Move</b>d <b>Knock Off</b> successfully. Although it didn't actually knock off anything since Shuppet is empty handed, Shou is glad Cantare have stunned that nasty Shuppet with a super effective move. Cantare whipped up a pile of dark purple energy cloud, flapping his wings as fast as he could. He then released the <b>Ominous</b> looking <b>Wind</b> towards the still-startled Shuppet, suffocating it with the ghostly vapour Cantare released. Taking severe damage, Shuppet breathed heavily on the ground, giving Cantare the opportunity to flap rapidly once again, this time creating colourless gale force, twisting and spinning, and still rapidly growing in size. Shuppet gave one last struggle and tried to sneak in a shot of <b>Night Shade</b> while Cantare is still building up the gale, who immediately tossed the <b>Twister</b> at Shuppet's direction. The Twister whooshed through the breezy graveyard, collided with Shuppet's Night Shade, dissolving it into nothingness and finally hit Shuppet, who got sucked into the spinning wrath of Æolus. As the wind stilled, Shuppet laid on the ground, unconscious.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: RoyalBlue">Cantare gained a level, from <a href="http://bmgf.bulbagarden.net/showpost.php?p=1294412&amp;postcount=394" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fbmgf.bulbagarden.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D1294412%26postcount%3D394&amp;hash=5edf6042565f71e8a4087290ad2ed048" rel="nofollow noopener">Lv.25</a> to Lv. 26.</span><br />
<br />
Shou gave an eager yell as Shuppet dropped to the ground, unresponsive. He sprinted towards his victorious Chatot and hugged him while Cantare struggled to get free. They danced for a while before Mismagius' urge finally got through their vestibulocochlear nerve and into their consciousness. &quot;Quickly! We're running out of time!&quot; Gotten pulled back into reality, and idea came to Shou. He fumbled through his bag pack and managed to find a <a href="http://bmgf.bulbagarden.net/showpost.php?p=1394506&amp;postcount=2056" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fbmgf.bulbagarden.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D1394506%26postcount%3D2056&amp;hash=735bc4eea8916d6bbfd2093f13cccbcf" rel="nofollow noopener">Pokeball</a>. Not wanting to waste anymore time, Shou threw the ball towards Shuppet, who turned into a mass of white light before entering the ball, and waited anxiously for the red light on the ball to die down. <br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver"><b><u>The Graveyard</u></b> - Please reply in <b>silver</b></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: silver"><b><u>Tenorphin</u>: </b>With Mismagius already on her way to the crypt you don't have much of a chance to celebrate Cantare's victory, but you're not about to allow the chance to make your first capture pass you by no matter how eager she is to get moving. Hurriedly rifling through your pack you remove the first empty Pokéball you can lay your hand on and without a moments hesitation toss it at the knocked out Shuppet. Already unconscious it doesn't put up a fight, and a second later a resonating <i>&quot;PING!&quot;</i> sounds out signalling your successful capture of the Lv.4 male ghostie. Exhilarated, you scoop up the ball and race off into the night after Mismagius.<br />
<br />
A short while later you stop outside of a white marble crypt on which the moonlight is shining, giving the marble an eerie ghostly glow. A beautiful angel statue is sitting atop the crypt above the name &quot;Rochester&quot; carved with gold lettering into the marble. At first glance you feel that whoever owns this crypt must care so deeply for their former Pokémon that they've created a very special resting place for them, but after everything Mismagius has told you about the Rochesters you figure it's best not to take anything at face value. According to her this family is evil, and despite the fact this beautiful resting place gives off a peaceful vibe, you can't help but shiver as your gaze passes over it. Anyone so evil as to incarcerate an innocent Pokémon for eternity cannot possibly have any kind of goodness in them.<br />
<br />
&quot;We must move swiftly,&quot; Mismagius whispers. &quot;The family will already have been alerted to our escape so this is the only chance we have to break the curse.&quot; She then shoots through the doorway, leaving you no other option than to follow. Once inside you look around, soft torchlight flickering from the four corners of the room giving the interior of the crypt a soft, warm glow. Mesmerised by the architecture as well as the inscriptions on the walls you note that these are very strange symbols and can't help but wonder what they mean. You also feel the odd stone in your pocket begin to vibrate, the fact it is showing any signs of life at all a little unnerving as you really don't understand all of this talk of magic and curses and really want all of this to be over so you can get out of here before these Rochesters turn up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where do they keep it?&quot; Mismagius hisses, her eyes darting about the room. The expression on her face is a little scary to be honest, but if you'd been trapped and tortured for centuries and had only minutes, if that, to break the curse binding you here then you guess you'd be looking pretty desperate as well. &quot;It's a golden <a href="http://www.nsidecollectibles.com/images/d_4413.jpg" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nsidecollectibles.com%2Fimages%2Fd_4413.jpg&amp;hash=b7c02dbfe08cd105c7fd31d5b584b6da" rel="nofollow noopener">Mjöllnir</a> imbued with special powers so that only it is strong enough to break the stone and, with it, the curse,&quot; Mismagius continues. &quot;It has to be here!&quot; You join in the search, hoping to find this mjöllnir as quickly as possible when you suddenly feel a change in atmosphere. A shadow falls across the room and the first thing you notice is that Mismagius has stopped dead in her tracks, her eyes locked upon the crypt's open doorway.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see you're still up to your old tricks, Spiritomb,&quot; says a deep voice, and when you spin around you see a tall man standing in the doorway. While your mind is trying to make sense of his words, your eyes are taking in his appearance. He's at least 6'4&quot; with dark hair and intense blue/grey eyes. He's athletic, yet muscular, with the kind of rugged good looks that would make many women swoon. The only thing you are sure of right now is that this man is the mysterious Rochester, but why did he refer to Mismagius as 'Spiritomb'? &quot;You'd better hand the stone over, boy,&quot; Mr Rochester says softly, his eyes not moving from Mismagius for a second, &quot;Because as soon as Spiritomb gets what he wants he'll kill you. I can stop that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;LIES!&quot; Mismagius shrieks, her voice taking an hysterical tone. &quot;Don't believe a word of it! We must destroy the stone before he imprisons us BOTH for eternity!&quot; <br />
<br />
Now extremely confused you find yourself looking between Mr Rochester and Mismagius wondering what the hell you're supposed to do next...<br />
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: silver"><b><u>Tenorphin</u>: </b>With Mismagius already on her way to the crypt you don't have much of a chance to celebrate Cantare's victory, but you're not about to allow the chance to make your first capture pass you by no matter how eager she is to get moving. Hurriedly rifling through your pack you remove the first empty Pokéball you can lay your hand on and without a moments hesitation toss it at the knocked out Shuppet. Already unconscious it doesn't put up a fight, and a second later a resonating <i>&quot;PING!&quot;</i> sounds out signalling your successful capture of the Lv.4 male ghostie. Exhilarated, you scoop up the ball and race off into the night after Mismagius.<br />
<br />
A short while later you stop outside of a white marble crypt on which the moonlight is shining, giving the marble an eerie ghostly glow. A beautiful angel statue is sitting atop the crypt above the name &quot;Rochester&quot; carved with gold lettering into the marble. At first glance you feel that whoever owns this crypt must care so deeply for their former Pokémon that they've created a very special resting place for them, but after everything Mismagius has told you about the Rochesters you figure it's best not to take anything at face value. According to her this family is evil, and despite the fact this beautiful resting place gives off a peaceful vibe, you can't help but shiver as your gaze passes over it. Anyone so evil as to incarcerate an innocent Pokémon for eternity cannot possibly have any kind of goodness in them.<br />
<br />
&quot;We must move swiftly,&quot; Mismagius whispers. &quot;The family will already have been alerted to our escape so this is the only chance we have to break the curse.&quot; She then shoots through the doorway, leaving you no other option than to follow. Once inside you look around, soft torchlight flickering from the four corners of the room giving the interior of the crypt a soft, warm glow. Mesmerised by the architecture as well as the inscriptions on the walls you note that these are very strange symbols and can't help but wonder what they mean. You also feel the odd stone in your pocket begin to vibrate, the fact it is showing any signs of life at all a little unnerving as you really don't understand all of this talk of magic and curses and really want all of this to be over so you can get out of here before these Rochesters turn up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where do they keep it?&quot; Mismagius hisses, her eyes darting about the room. The expression on her face is a little scary to be honest, but if you'd been trapped and tortured for centuries and had only minutes, if that, to break the curse binding you here then you guess you'd be looking pretty desperate as well. &quot;It's a golden <a href="http://www.nsidecollectibles.com/images/d_4413.jpg" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nsidecollectibles.com%2Fimages%2Fd_4413.jpg&amp;hash=b7c02dbfe08cd105c7fd31d5b584b6da" rel="nofollow noopener">Mjöllnir</a> imbued with special powers so that only it is strong enough to break the stone and, with it, the curse,&quot; Mismagius continues. &quot;It has to be here!&quot; You join in the search, hoping to find this mjöllnir as quickly as possible when you suddenly feel a change in atmosphere. A shadow falls across the room and the first thing you notice is that Mismagius has stopped dead in her tracks, her eyes locked upon the crypt's open doorway.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see you're still up to your old tricks, Spiritomb,&quot; says a deep voice, and when you spin around you see a tall man standing in the doorway. While your mind is trying to make sense of his words, your eyes are taking in his appearance. He's at least 6'4&quot; with dark hair and intense blue/grey eyes. He's athletic, yet muscular, with the kind of rugged good looks that would make many women swoon. The only thing you are sure of right now is that this man is the mysterious Rochester, but why did he refer to Mismagius as 'Spiritomb'? &quot;You'd better hand the stone over, boy,&quot; Mr Rochester says softly, his eyes not moving from Mismagius for a second, &quot;Because as soon as Spiritomb gets what he wants he'll kill you. I can stop that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;LIES!&quot; Mismagius shrieks, her voice taking an hysterical tone. &quot;Don't believe a word of it! We must destroy the stone before he imprisons us BOTH for eternity!&quot; <br />
<br />
Now extremely confused you find yourself looking between Mr Rochester and Mismagius wondering what the hell you're supposed to do next...<br />
<br />

<span style="color: Silver"><span style="font-size: 9px">Following the much anticipated &quot;Ping!&quot;, Shou squealed in delight, along with Cantare's wonderful mimic of Shou's voice, making the empty graveyard echo.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: DarkOrchid">~Shou caught a Lv.4 Shuppet (Who'd have thought a Lv.4 Shuppet could put up such a fight? He Knocked Off my silk scarf!)~</span><br />
<br />
Grabbing the Pokéball with the newly obtained Shuppet from the ground, Shou hastily raced after Mismagius towards Rochester's white marble crypt which Shou marvelled at. The moon shone on the white marble, illuminating the angel statue on top of the crypt. Shou looked at the statue, awed, noticing the golden carvings just beneath it, and snapped back into reality. &quot;This is it. The Rochester's crypt,&quot; He said, remembering how evil and heartless the Rochesters are towards Mismagius. As if needing approval, Shou looked at Cantare, who is staring back at him, signalling him to go.<br />
<br />
Mismagius urged them again, silently this time. She then went in the doorway, rushing. Shou took a deep breath, and followed Mismagius through the crypt entrance. <br />
<br />
Shou couldn't resist the urge to glare at the masonry once he's in the crypt. It was constructed so grandiosely, even so than the exterior, Shou thought it would take royalty, or at least nobility to have this built. The walls are etched with patterns so distinctively with flair, the pillars are carved so memorably elegant, and it was spacious enough to have a medium sized party in there. Warm glows of torches were placed nicely in the four corners, giving the crypt a feel of ancientness. The stone in Shou's pocket throbbed like a palpitating heart in a sudden, scaring Shou as he thought some creatures somehow got into his shirt. <br />
<br />
Mismagius hissed dramatically at the crypt, her eyes shifting around so rapidly her body followed to turn wherever she had her eyes on. Shou unthinkingly followed Mismagius around since he really doesn't know what to look for, and decided that he'd best leave the searching for Mismagius. Looking frantic and frenzied, Mismagius darted from one spot to another within 5 seconds of arriving, making it almost impossible to follow, so Shou just stood at the centre of the crypt, and let Mismagius move about searching for a weapon Shou does not know.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a golden Mjöllnir imbued with special powers so that only it is strong enough to break the stone and, with it, the curse,&quot; Mismagius answered, as if she read Shou's mind, or that Shou has been thinking loudly. Having a slight idea that Mjöllnir is a hammer-like weapon, Shou joined in the search. He flipped every slab of flippable stone, and looked in every hole. His shirt was almost soaked when the air felt different, as if someone injected the crypt with fresh air. Shou whirled around to see a tall figure staring at Mismagius, who is frozen in her tracks, staring the figure in return.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see you're still up to your old tricks, Spiritomb,&quot; The figure spoke softly, yet it's still booming in Shou's ears. The lean masculine figure, Rochester, Shou is certain, stood taller than anyone Shou knows, and him vibrating an aura of holiness doesn't turn the board in Mismagius' favour. Rochester commanded Shou to give him the stone imprisoning Mismagius, which Shou responded with &quot;Spiritomb? How is she a...&quot; before being cut off by Mismagius rudely. &quot;LIES!&quot; She shouted vociferously. Suddenly aware of this rudeness, Shou was having second thoughts about Mismagius. Scared and confused, Shou looked at Cantare, who is now repeating the word &quot;LIES!&quot; at allegrissimo. Having forced to make a choice, Shou thought, <i>Without a Mjöllnir, Mismagius would still be stuck. What if she IS Spiritomb? There no way I can prove that... Unless... Pokédex?</i> With that in mind, Shou pulled out his Pokédex with his shaking right hand, then slowly and unwillingly pointed at Mismagius. A light cheerful tone broke the silence. &quot;Mismagius, the Magical Pokémon. Mismagius chants incantations, and while some cause misery, some give happiness as well.&quot; Shou didn't immediately remove the Pokédex out of sheer confusion. The Pokédex beeped oddly, and continued, &quot;Spiritomb, the Forbidden Pokémon. As punishment for misdeeds 500 years ago, Spiritomb was sealed in the fissure of an Odd Keystone.&quot; After which it shows a picture of a stone looking exactly like the one Shou is holding. Horrified, Shou dropped the Pokédex and looked at Mismagius/Spiritomb, who looked agitated and somewhat slumped. Decided, Shou approached Rochester while trembling, and hands him the stone while stuttering, &quot;Sorry, sir... I-I don't know that... Um...&quot;<br />

<br />
<i>&quot;Houndour, the Dark Pokemon. It conveys its feelings using different cries. It works in a pack to cleverly take down prey.&quot;</i><br />

A vast desert, filled with all kinds of Pokémon. It is rumored that two special villages can be found here, but is this fantasy or reality?</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Axel was glad he had finally started his journey. There were many locations he could've chosen but for some reason he decided on the Desert of Illusion He still wondered why. Ivy, his Chikorita, was walking by his side. She was very affectionate and liked being near Axel all the time. Axel and his Chikorita had been walking for about an hour now. They had entered the Desert of Illusion with no plan of action. <br />
<br />
Axel tried looking in the distance but couldn't see anything at the moment. Axel took a look at Ivy and asked, &quot;Hey are you alright? You look a little tired.&quot; Ivy shook her head and pointed in one direction with the leaf on her head. &quot;You wanna head that way?&quot; Axel asked. Ivy nodded her head and the two began walking. &quot;You know there are supposed to be these two villages hidden somewhere in this desert but, we haven't seen anything besides sand.&quot; Axel noted to Ivy. He then said, You know, I think we should take a break. Just relax and eat. What do you say?&quot; Ivy nodded her head vigorously. Axel assumed this meant she was really hungry and he was right. The two sat down and when Axel pulled out some Pokemon food for Ivy she practically swallowed it. &quot;Why didn't you tell me before that you wanted to eat?&quot; Axel asked. Ivy shook her head as if to say that she didn't know. Axel sighed and simply ate some of the bread he brought for himself.<br />
<br />
The pair got up and Axel told Ivy, &quot;If you see anything I don't, like another Pokemon or something in the distance just let me know.&quot; Ivy nodded her head and they began to walk again.</span><br />
<br />
Alrighty then I hope this is good enough. Also if you could point out any mistakes or improvements I could make that would be very helpful. <br />

<span style="font-size: 9px">I'd like to start by welcoming the two of you to FB. As you may or may not be aware I am currently without my own computer so I'm using mah hubby's whenever I can. Mine is being picked up by the repair people tomorrow so over the next couple of weeks we'll move a little slowly but we will move along so please be patient. The best piece of advice I can give you is to try not to overthink your replies. Take it as it comes, RPing your thoughts and feelings into your replies, imagining what you would do if you found yourself in your character's given situation. Once you're in character it's hard to go wrong. Good luck, and let's begin!<br />

<span style="color: limegreen"><b><u>Forest of Adventure</u></b> - Please reply in <b>limegreen</b></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: limegreen"><b><u>hen da man</u>: </b>The tranquillity of the forest is amazing. The air is light and crisp, with a soft fresh breeze keeping you feeling cool and refreshed upon your journey. Blaze is frolicking along the trail, utterly enjoying the freedom from his Pokéball as you travel deeper into the woodland. The sounds of nature surround you, and time and again you catch a glimpse of the occasional Pidgey, Taillow, and Starly flitting through the treetops. There is movement in the shrubbery as well, but the Pokémon living there are wary of strangers and in no hurry to introduce themselves to a Pokémon Trainer passing through their home. You're finding yourself more eager than ever to find some adventure, though, for it's the name of this mysterious forest that has brought you here. It isn't long before you hear what appears to be singing, quite unharmonious singing at that, by a male person whose warbling baritone is disrupting the serenity of the forest at a very rapid rate. You can see and hear more movement from the native forest inhabitants now, many of them heading away from the terrible noise invading their home, others heading towards it most likely curious to see what is responsible for it. Blaze looks up at you curiously before you both veer off the trail and walk in the direction of the singing, soon after finding yourself standing at the edge of a forest clearing where a middle aged professor, drunk as a sailor, is downing the last dregs of whiskey from a bottle which he then proceeds to smash against the tree trunk he's leaning on. His lab coat is almost as filthy as his matted, greying beard, and upon closer inspection you can see that he's covered in a multitude of welts that appear to be insect bites or stings of some sort. He is so wasted that you cannot understand a word of the lyrics he is singing, but that seems rather irrelevant in the next moment anyway as they professor promptly falls silent, then sideways and asleep on the forest floor, snoring like a trooper. Blaze glances up at you, &quot;WTF?&quot; clearly expressed in his features, before he looks back at the drunk professor. Hardly considering babysitting a plastered old man to be the adventure you were looking for, you wonder if it's worth sticking around to make sure he's alright, or whether you should continue on your way...</span><br />

<span style="color: darkorange"><b><u>paperluigi</u>: </b>After hours of travel and a quick bite to eat you and your Chikorita, Ivy, are hoping to find shelter soon. The hot desert sun is beating down, the heat from the sand and rocks beneath your feet radiating up through the soles of your shoes. Right now you're feeling like a heating rod, and it's unpleasant to say the least. With your water supply running alarmingly short you realise you're either going to have to turn back now, or hope to find a source of nourishment somewhere out here in this harsh, barren wasteland when you notice a large object in the distance. Looking down at Ivy you see she's also spied it and is quite excited about what it could mean. Without a word you both quicken your pace and an hour later find yourselves standing in the shadow of a large sandstone monument in the shape of a Wailord. It measures roughly 260 feet long, 20 feet wide, and 65 feet high, which is approximately the same size as The Great Sphinx. Finding any monument, particularly of this size, in the middle of the desert is strange enough, but of a Water Pokémon? That's even weirder. Circling the statue you find nothing but large sandstone blocks and can't help but wonder who made this, how they made it, and why. While you're both standing and staring at it, you notice a little Sandshrew leisurely wandering out from the side of the monument and you can't help but wonder why you'd not seen it before since you'd only just passed by that section a minute earlier. Suddenly Sandshrew notices you and it stops dead in its tracks, staring in disbelief, before squeaking with fright, turning, and running in the opposite direction. Racing after it you find no trace of the little sand mouse as you round the statue which is even more curious. Ivy then taps you on the leg and points her leaf at the phantom Sandshrew's footprints which stop at the very edge of the monument, right beneath the Wailord's front left fin.

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">As the pair were walking, with the sun beating down on them, Axel was beginning to get tired. He took out his water bottle, along with his Chikorita Ivy's, and noticed he was beginning to run short. He knew that he would either have to turn back or find another water source soon but he knew that both Ivy and he himself did not want to stop here. He put the water away and looked up to see some sort of object in the distance. He looked over at Ivy and she seemed to have noticed it too. The pair began heading towards it without another word. After an hour of tiring walking the two found themselves standing in the shadow of a giant statue of a Wailord that's about the size of the Great Sphinx. Axel looked in amazement at it's size. <i>I wonder why there's a statue of a water Pokemon in the middle of a desert... Maybe one lived in an oasis near here but... why did they make this statue so big? And who could've made something like this?</i> He and Ivy began circling the massive statue wondering this when they noticed a small Sandshrew walking out from the side of the monument. &quot;I thought we just passed there...&quot; muttered Axel. However, the Sandshrew noticed the two and ran away around the statue. The pair began to give chase but it seemed to have disappeared and they couldn't find it even after going round the statue. Axel was tapped on the leg by Ivy and saw she was pointing to some small footprints that seemed to have come from the Sandshrew. They stopped at the edge of the monument under the Wailord's left fin. &quot;That's weird... Let's go check it out.&quot; Axel said to Ivy. The two walked up to the fin and looked underneath to investigate. </span></span></div>

The boy is pondering over the reasons they were here enjoying the views as a quick smile appears on his face.<br />

Out of no-where, the Houndour's ears flick up. &quot;What is that awful... well, singing?&quot; Henry asks Blaze as the dog runs on ahead. They follow the track until they find a wasted middle-aged man who looks to be a professor of some kind. He is filthy with a grey beard and some welts which look like the work of some Beedrill maybe. He keeps on singing some words that are put together randomly. This proves quite funny as Henry gives a chuckle. Just as he laughs though, the professor drops all of a sudden and starts snoring his brains out on the floor. Blaze looks up at his trainer a little confused at what just happened as Henry shoots back the human version of that look.<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px">I'd like to offer the two of you - hen da man and paperluigi - my apologies. I'd rather be a reliable Mod than an unreliable updator so several things will be changing in the near future.<br />
<br />
As of now the Arcane Realm is being permanently shut down. It may return one day, but that is unlikely.<br />
<br />
If either of you are still interested in taking part in this RPG you are free to enter other zones.<br />
<br />
There are changes in store for FB, long overdue changes, which are just around the corner.<br />
<br />
Hopefully you'll both now find there is more to FB than waiting on updates, so sit tight and hopefully it won't be long before activity starts to pick up again.</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><b>The Arcane Realm - FB Training Zone</b><br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center"><b>The FB Training Zone</b>&#8203;</div><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px">Unlike other Fizzy Bubbles zones, this zone has been created for the sole purpose of introducing new members to RPing FB Style before venturing into current zones. It gives you a chance to familiarise yourselves with how we work and to experiment and expand upon your RPing skills before moving on. <br />
<br />
While the updates I provide here will be far from top quality due to time restraints, they will still provide enough information for you to formulate a decent response and to RP to your highest standard. While updates won't be top-notch, your replies should be as whether or not you're given the ok to leave this zone behind and enter regular zones will depend upon how you reply. You should always be striving to give your replies everything you can as that is what is expected in all FB Zones. Please remember that while FB has Gyms, Contest Halls, Bases, the Arcade, and various other activities as well as Time Out to help pass the time between updates, our primary purpose is role playing and while we don't always expect <i>lengthy</i> replies, we do expect a reasonable degree of <i>quality</i>. Replies don't have to be long to be good as some people are mistakenly inclined to believe.<br />
<br />
<b>Rules</b><br />
- No less than four (4) lines when replying, and by four lines I mean four complete lines of text. Not three or four words before hitting the enter key and writing another three or four words. Decent and articulate sentences are a must.<br />
- No chat speak. No abbreviations. No icons/smilies. Type properly or I'll ignore your post.<br />
- Please proofread posts. It's not only a great way to check for errors, it's also an excellent chance to see if you can expand upon/improve your reply before submitting.<br />
- ALWAYS quote your update by using the quote button in the bottom right-hand corner of the post. If you c/p and add Quote tags, your post will be ignored. Also, don't quote the entire post, only the update that has been written for you.<br />
- When using attacks for battle, please state clearly what you are ordering your Pokémon to do, and order no more than three attacks (offensive or defensive) per round of battle.<br />
- <i>Never</i> take it upon yourself to encounter or capture a Pokémon. The Pokémon you encounter is entirely up to the discretion of your updator. If you've read through the Updates &amp; Replies Thread you will find that there are several reasons for this rule being in place.<br />
- When in a battle situation, never, <i>ever</i> try to control the moves or reactions of your opponent Pokémon. It's <i>my</i> job to give you an adventure, it's <i>your</i> job to overcome any obstacles I put in your path. Be sure to give clear and precise instructions for the moves you want your Pokémon to use, but don't ever try to control the Pokémon you are battling. I'm hoping I'll never have to PM anyone about editing their reply because they've posted incorrectly. It's embarassing for you, and uncomfortable for me.<br />
- If your Pokémon has a nickname please don't expect me to know it straight off the bat. After a while I do become familiar with the teams of people I update but when you're new to me I'd appreciate it if you would refer to the Pokémon you have, not call them by name. For example, somebody says, <i>&quot;Blaze use Ember!&quot;</i> Ummm, who/what is Blaze? I know it's a Fire Type, but what is it? A Torchic, Charmander, Houndour??? I won't know unless you tell me.<br />
- I do ask that you keep a profile of your FB team in your signature which includes your Pokémon, their levels and genders. I do however understand that not everyone wants to do this so if you could, at the very least, post a link to your registration post I'd appreciate it greatly. If you do neither and I need some information about your Pokémon, there's a strong likelihood you'll be skipped.<br />
<br />
And lastly, I'm not expecting everyone to start off perfectly here. Mistakes are expected and I'm more than happy to offer pointers/advice when asked for it, as are many FB members. I'm lenient to a point, but if you've been informed about something that has been done wrong and continue to ignore the advice given to correct it, then you will be ignored. End of story.<br />
<br />
Now that formalities are out of the way, how about we get down to business? Below are a list of areas you may enter (only one area at a time), so all you need to do is decide where you would like to travel before making your introductory post.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 26px"><span style="color: paleturquoise"><b>The Arcane Realm</b></span></span>&#8203;</div><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: limegreen"><b><u>Forest of Adventure</u></b> (Please reply in LimeGreen)<br />
According to legend, no trainer can enter this enchanted forest without an adventure befalling them.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: lemonchiffon"><b><u>Mediville</u></b> (Please reply in LemonChiffon)<br />
This well-populated village and its surrounding farmlands contain many low-levelled wild Pokémon suitable for beginning trainers to practice against. Levels are only gained by Pokémon under level 10.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: silver"><b><u>The Graveyard</u></b> (Please reply in Silver)<br />
A haunting graveyard where the spirits of Pokémon have been put to rest. At night a thick fog hangs in the air while the restless spirits of those Pokémon with unfinished business rise from the grave, looking for closure that often never comes.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorange"><b><u>Desert of Illusion</u></b> (Please reply in DarkOrange)<br />
A vast desert, filled with all kinds of Pokémon. It is rumored that two special villages can be found here, but is this fantasy or reality?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: gold"><b><u>Ancient Tomb</u></b> (Please reply in Gold)<br />
An ancient maze supposedly containing the tombs of long-departed kings which is filled with treasure and danger. You will not be able to leave until you find an escape rope and you can't bring one with you.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: deepskyblue"><b><u>The Ocean of Mystery</u></b> (Please reply in DeepSkyBlue)<br />
An ocean with many mysteries that have yet to be solved. Only those with Water Type Pokémon can travel these seas, as whenever a ship has set sail, they have never again been seen. What has happened to these ships, their crew and passengers, is anyone's guess, but few are willing to take their chances by travelling out by boat.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: lightsteelblue"><b><u>Silverton Ranges</u></b> (Please reply in LightSteelBlue)<br />
A snow-capped mountain range where many wild Pokémon reside. Many old mines litter the mountainside from the days when silver was heavily mined, but due to the often below zero temperatures, they were eventually abandoned. Rumor has it however, that there are still many valuable ores hidden within the mountains.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px">For several reasons the Arcane Realm is being returned to Fizzy Bubbles. From today on, all new members who pass the Registration Test will need to post here for their first adventure and will remain in this zone until their updator releases them into mainstream zones.<br />
<br />
Additionally, those who have already been in FB for a while but never had the pleasure of experiencing this zone may post for the duration of a single adventure. If you're still looking for your first capture then this is your chance.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to seeing you soon ^^.</span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: lemonchiffon"><span style="font-size: 9px">Dylan topped the rise of a gently rolling hill, dust from the ancient dirt road puffed under his feet. Yukihime, his snorunt, road on his shoulders piggy-back style. As far as he could see left and right lush green fields and bright golden farmland rolled off into the sunset. In a dip in the valley below, however, was a fairly sizeable village. The midday sunlight flashing off tin and clay-tile roofs. <br />

&quot;We made it, Yuki, it's Mediville,&quot; Dylan says as he heads down the hill into town, &quot;I wonder what sort of hijinks we can get up to here?&quot;</span></span><br />

It's a perfect spring morning, the air is crisp and fresh, and the farms you're passing appear to be quiet and peaceful. This seems to be just the kind of place to visit for some time away from the hectic hustle and bustle of the city, and with the farming village of Mediville now within sight you can't help but quicken your pace now that you're so close to your intended destination. Just as you're approaching the outskirts of town, however, the sound of raised voices attracts your attention and you look to see a couple of youngsters in the midst of a heated battle. The girl can't be more than eight years old and the boy is clearly two to three years older than her.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you cheated! You can't take Lily when you cheated!&quot; cries the girl, her voice unnaturally high, undoubtedly due to her distress.<br />
<br />
&quot;Prove it ya little cry baby! I won this battle fair and square so you need to give me your Pokémon. Those are the rules, NOW HAND IT OVER!&quot; the boy yells, standing over the child who is holding a Petilil close to her chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't have her,&quot; the girl replies defiantly, standing her ground against the bully, her voice croaky with fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can have whatever I want, I own this town,&quot; he sneers, snatching a Pokéball from the girl's pocket and using it to recall the Pokémon she's trying to keep from him.<br />
<br />
The girl screams with a combination of rage and frustration, and tries to attack the boy who pushes her back causing her to land flat on her rear in a puddle of mud. &quot;She won't listen to you! She'll never listen to you!&quot; she screams, &quot;and you'll be forced to give her back!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll trade her away in a far off town before I give her back to you,&quot; the boy staunts, turning and walking away while the girl is left crying her heart out.<br />
<br />
The boy disappears from sight as he enters Mediville leaving you wondering what to do. Approach the girl, follow the boy, or stay well enough out of this as you can't shake a niggling feeling there's a lot more to this than a couple of kids squabbling over a little Grass type Pokémon...</span></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: lemonchiffon">Dylan continues his trot down the hill, happy that he's reached Mediville at last. He wasn't looking forward to camping in a field again. True he'd likely only be in town for that day and part of the next but a night in an actual bed was just about the most wonderful thing he could think of. <br />
<br />
As he walked Yukihime burbbled from her piggy-back position, &quot;Sno-runt sno-runt sno-sno-runt!&quot; It made him happy to know that his friend was enjoying herself. Little did he know he was about to encounter a scene that would suck all the fun right out of their demeanor.<br />
<br />
He came across a boy and girl and heard their exchange. The more he watched and listened the more his jaw muscles tightened and his fingernails dug into the palms of his hands. The nerve of this kid! It was enough to set Dylan's blood boiling. It was enough to make him want to chase down the little bully and give him a swift punch to the jaw and take the Petilil back by force. <br />
<br />
He knew that this wouldn't be the best idea, though and so he did his best to keep a cool head. Yukihime had already decided on what route was best to take. The moment the boy had disappeared into town the Snorunt had leapt from Dylan's shoulders and tottered over to where the little girl still sat sprawled in the mud crying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sno, Snorunt, sno?&quot; she asked placing one tiny hand? paw? thing on the little girl's arm as though to comfort her.<br />
<br />
Dylan walked over and knelt down in front of the girl, &quot;Are you alright? I saw what happened. I want to help if I can. My name is Dylan, and I'm a traveling pokemon trainer, this wonderfully compassionate snorunt here is my travelling companion Yukihime.&quot;</span></span><br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">OoC: I hope this doesn't inconvinces you, I thought to clean up my intro post, nothing from the previous intro has changed, but some major character development; just letting you know.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: lemonchiffon">A young man walked inside the huslte and buslte environment of a train station. He wore glasses on his face and a cap on his head that covered his black wavy hair; He learned long ago that the biggest indicator of person's Identity was a their hair, strange as it may seem.<br />
<br />
Ethan walked calmly, trying not to look behind his back too often to see as to whether anyone was following him or paying more attention then they should. It's a hard thing to live like, having a target on your back.<br />
<br />
He stopped by a newspaper stand to grab the Times. On the front page was an article with a heading in big bold letters, 'The Phantom under arrest', he read 3 pages full of details of who he was, of his crimes and how Jenny, Police Officer for the Castelia PD had single handily brought the masked art thief to justice 3 night ago.<br />
<br />
The Phantom left the paper on the counter and looked at the big clock in the middle of the station.<br />
<br />
He had calculated it would take a couple of mintues before the police would discover his empty cell. Giving him enough time to make his escape. <br />
They sure got one fact wrong about his MO. He never worked alone.<br />
<br />
Getting out of the city was hard enough, having to call in a favor from a 'friend' to get him across the desert and into Nimbasa City. It was going to be a little trickier getting out of the region though, with his identity well known now and his assets frozen, his home probably being searched and taken apart; in a matter of hours the world would know him better then he knew himself.<br />
<br />
He Grabbed an unattended bag full of things for a beginner trainer to have, along with some pocket change; 3,000 coins worth (who carries so much?, this is why he could never stop being a theif!). He quickly walked toward a crowd of passengers that had just departed their train, He bummed into a couple of people obtaining various things from their pockets: He grinned when he saw he grabbed a pass that allowed him to collect a Starter Egg in the nearest Egg Hut he came across, and a train ticket, one bound for a faraway region with a place he had never heard of. <br />

A snow-capped mountain range where many wild Pokémon reside. Many old mines litter the mountainside from the days when silver was heavily mined, but due to the often below zero temperatures, they were eventually abandoned. Rumor has it however, that there are still many valuable ores hidden within the mountains.</span> </span>

It all started off well enough: On the first day, sunlight pierced the naked skies effortlessly, bathing the mountains in a rich, orange glow. Temperatures soared as high as 2°C, and stunning vistas of the Arcane Realm lit up in every direction. A charmed start for the young traveller, GZ, and his beloved Trubbish, Rose; By the evening they found themselves already past the snow line, and watching a beautiful sunset together. The next day went similarly also, initially, with a scenic sunrise start and little to hinder their swift ascent. However, the barren wastes of the Silverton Ranges were not known for their charity, and in the afternoon a bitter wind suddenly fell across the sterile, white slopes.<br />
<br />
At first, GZ paid little heed to the worsening weather, beyond pulling the hood of his winter coat a little tighter. With at least four layers of clothing on his upper body alone, he thought himself perfectly well-dressed for the occasion. Likewise, he had already returned Rose's shivering form to her Poké Ball a while ago, tucking it into one of his inner coat pockets. Nevertheless, as the day wore on, conditions continued to deteriorate. The sky turned ashen and bleak, as dark clouds rolled in to perch above the mountaintops, blotting out the Sun. Snow soon followed as the temperature began to plummet, combining with the increasingly wild winds to form drifts that flew into GZ's face, obscuring his vision and--<br />
<br />
&quot;For fuck's sake! That's the fifth time!&quot; He shouted from the ground. The icy gales had caused him to slip and fall onto the path, which was becoming harder to see as it became further buried by snow. Even so, despite the growing storm, there was no way he was quitting now; his journey had only just begun! He couldn't just give up at the first sign of adversity. <br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Still, better at least look for some place to hold up for a while ...&quot;</i> He thought, earache starting to set in. Having briefly checked to make sure everything was in tact, GZ rose from the ground again and marched on with steely resolve, scanning the area for anything remotely useful.<br />

The young girl lifts her head, her nose sniffling.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Mia,&quot; she sniffled, wiping the back of her hand against her nose. &quot;That bully told me that he wanted to battle. I told him no, but he said that I had to because looked me in the eyes or something and the next thing I knew, he had sent out his pokemon and told me that whoever one would get the other's pokemon.&quot;<br />
<br />
She took a deep shuddery breath, as tears started to well up again. &quot;I had no choice but to battle him, and then he cheated and took Lily!&quot;<br />
<br />
She burst into tears again, still incredibly distraught about her loss. This sure was something, how horrible did this boy have to be to essentially steal a little girl's pokemon?<br />
<br />
Mia stopped crying momentarily, and looked back up at you. &quot;Can you get Lily back for me?&quot;<br />

You get on the train headed towards Mediville, escaping from the police. With the sense that you are safe, or at least for the time being, you allow yourself to relax. The train itself isn't too full, there are maybe about ten other people sitting spread out in your carriage. All in all, it seems like it is going to be a nice and easy trip.<br />
<br />
So nice and easy, that you only realise that you feel asleep at least an hour after when your eyes snap open. The train is now much fuller, and the view outside of the train has turned into a pleasant forest view. Realising that you have actually managed to get away and are now safe, you recline back and let your eyes wander. They sweep over the passengers, each person seeming non descript and boring. All but one. You look over at a young man, who appears to be scared and a little bit anxious. He is erratically looking around the carriage, and he keeps touching something underneath his bulky jacket.<br />
<br />
You keep your eye on him as the train continues its path, but surely you are just overthinking it? Unfortunately though, that observation is wrong. The man notices you looking at him and jumps up, his demenour suddenly changing into something a lot more confident. He pulls his jacket open to reveal bombs strapped to his stomach, each the size of a baseball and shaped like a Voltorb.<br />
<br />
&quot;No one move, or I blow us all up!&quot; he yelled, his voice strangely monotone.<br />
<br />

You trudge along, somewhat irritated at the weather. But a little snow never hurt no one, so of course you keep going. However, as you keep walking you notice that that the weather is steadily worsening. Wind starts to pick up, and the snow starts to fall down thicker. It suddenly dawns on you that you need to find yourself some shelter to make sure you don't freeze to death. Quickening your pace, and making sure that you don't slip over, you scan the area around you, trying to find yourself somewhere to stay safe during the storm. <br />
<br />
The snowfall increases even further, cementing your decision that you really need to find yourself somewhere to hide. Thankfully, you eventually find what looks to be a small cave, especially relieving sicne the snow had gotten to the point that you couldn't actually see properly. Thanking the stars, you rush into the cave, which is definitely much bigger than it looks on the outside. It smells dank, and the the cave is too deep for the light from the mouth to illuminate it. But it is better than staying outside, that's for sure. Well at least that was what you were thinking before there is a loud &quot;RARGH!&quot;<br />
<br />
You freeze in place, and watch in horror as a large Beartic walks out from the black of the cave.<br />

Dylan listened to the little girl's story and his anger at the kid's gaul grew greater and greater with each passing second. He was building into a righteous wrath the likes of which he hadn't felt in... but that wasn't the point now. There was only one point to be had in this mess. He had to help this little girl reclaim her pokemon. <br />
<br />
&quot;I most certainly can and will, Little miss Mia. First things, first though, let's get you out of that mud,&quot; Dylan and Yukihime (Snorunt) helped the little girl out of the mud and after some searching in his bag Dylan found his last clean towl, <i>No biggy</i>, he supposed, <i>I'll be in Mediville long enough to get a little laundry done I hope</i>. <br />
<br />
Once she was cleaned up Dylan stowed the towel again and adopted his serious face as they walked on toward Mediville as briskly as Little Mia could manage. While on the way Yukihime did her best to keep Mia cheerful, just before they got to town Dylan turned to Mia again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you remember what the boy looked like very well or what pokemon he used? I didn't get a good look myself since his back and side were to me the whole time.&quot; He asked. This was important. If they were gonna find the brat and teach him a lesson then they'd need to know him on sight.</span></span><br />
