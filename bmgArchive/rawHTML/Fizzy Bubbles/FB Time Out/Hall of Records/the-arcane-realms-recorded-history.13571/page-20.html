<br />
<span style="color: silver"><b><u>Tenorphin</u>: </b>Deliberating over the strange markings on the wall it takes a few moments to realise each of them represents a letter of the alphabet which in turn spells out the word, &quot;Twister&quot;. Mulling over this it doesn't take long for you to connect the word with the attack move Twister which, thankfully, Cantare had learned just prior to your ending up in here. Unfortunately he's not had a great deal of time in which to perfect his use of the move and after several failed attempts finds himself huffing and puffing, not to mention a little worse for wear after having gotten himself caught up in his own gust of wind and buffeted around a little. He ruffles his feathers, however, and puffs his chest out, his arrogance getting the better of him after you suggest he take a rest, finally whipping up a tight, cyclonic wind that he sends reeling toward the word etched into the wall. Standing back, you're barely able to contain your excitement and watch with bated breath while the <b>Twister</b> pounds the chamber wall, your eyes practically bugging out of your head when the letters themselves seem to come alive. One by one they're drawn out into the strong wind, spinning round and round as the humming in the room becomes louder. A beautiful pinkish psychic glow fills the room as the Twister dissipates, the letters still spinning in the air before moving back into their original positions. As the final &quot;R&quot; fits back into its place in the wall, a hidden door opens, allowing you to pass through before it shuts behind you again. Cantare is looking rather pleased with himself, if not a tad mystified by the next room. You gaze around noting there is not one, but three new sets of inscriptions. One on the wall to your left, one on the wall to your right, and the third directly opposite. Moving in to examine them, you see that they read:<br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Silver">With the twister finally subsided, revealing a set of 7 floating Unowns spinning and circling in the chamber, Shou felt himself go weak in the knee. &quot;What's happening?&quot; He yelled in surprise, before deciding that it's a bad idea, since Cantare started yelling it too. Adding it on Cantare's panicky behaviour, i.e. flapping around, as if it was trying to escape from being sucked into the twister, Shou actually laughed at the appropriateness of that sentence.<br />
<br />
The Unowns finally returned to their original locations one by one. Almost immediately, a tiny crack appeared on the wall with a loud creaking noise, causing Shou to clap his hands to his ears immediately. Following it, the crack enlarged rapidly, shaking the ground and knocking Shou off balance. Hitting the ground on his backside, Shou yelped and grumbled for a bit as he tried standing back up without much success. Cantare, on the other hand, was flying so he wasn't affected at all. <i>Lucky bastard</i>, Shou thought, somehow a little annoyed that his partner was mimicking his grumbles while he was struggling to his feet.<br />
<br />
As the wall inched sidewards, revealing what looks like another chamber, Shou gave Cantare a nasty look. <i>Again?</i> He thought. Going through the wall/door into the second chamber, Shou took a good look of it. It was just a tad bit larger than the last chamber, but it has more torches too. The wall was still grimy and mossy, and there seemed like no way out. But Shou knew better. &quot;There had to be an inscription somewhere.&quot; Shou told Cantare, who responded with &quot;Inscreeption sumwear!&quot; Chuckling at the sentence, Shou found himself more tolerant of Cantare's outbursts of mimicry. <i>Maybe it was the loneliness down here</i>, he thought. It seems that he wasn't too used to talking to his Pokémon yet. <br />
<br />
Shou was startled by the wall/door closing behind him as he was being self-absorbed in his thoughts. Cantare was doing a mimicry of a laughing Rapidash Shou had no idea where he'd learnt from. &quot;Quiet you!&quot; Shou felt himself blush being laughed at by his Chatot and tickled Cantare with gusto. The music note slash bird Pokémon, of course, wasn't so stupid. It flew around the room, stopping at the middle of each of the walls briefly to bounce to another wall before Shou caught up. Before long, Shou stopped chasing Cantare, having glimpsed at one of the walls to find that there were another set of Unown inscription, and the other two were soon uncovered too under careful inspection of Shou and Cantare.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sing, Keen Eye, Berry?&quot; Shou wondered out loud. &quot;Let's try singing, it's our profession after all.&quot; Shou told Cantare, getting the reply &quot;pro-fesh-shawn&quot; from the hilarious Pokémon. Shou went to the left wall from the wall he'd walk into the room, and start singing. The wall didn't move. Not even one bit. <i>I guess it would have to be a Pokémon, then?</i> Biting back disappointment, Shou thought. He then ordered Cantare to <b>sing</b>. The bird only stared at Shou oddly. &quot;It can't be! You don't know how to <b>sing</b>?&quot; Cantare shook his head vigorously. &quot;Lies! How do yo-&quot; Shou started to get a little frustrated. Cantare sang when they first met, sang with him the whole time they were together. <i>But wait... He's only mimicking my voices every single time?</i> Realisation hit Shou soon after. Shou held Cantare in his palms and apologised to him, even though Cantare doesn't even seem fazed by his sudden accusation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's try the others.&quot; Shou told Cantare, earning a very distorted version of the same sentence. &quot;Berry... I don't really want to just throw it away, but I don't exactly know how to comprehend Keen Eye, unless you stare into it, Cantare?&quot; Shou asked doubtfully. Cantare blinked once, twice, and hopped in front of the wall inscribed with &quot;Keen Eye&quot; and stare at it, specifically, the inscriptions. Hoping that it'd work, Shou imagined what it would be for the next room. Will it be like this one, with more inscriptions on the wall? Or will it be a treasure room that would make Shou a millionaire before he get out of the place and have lots of coins? Maybe it's a way out too! Shou got excited thinking about it.<br />
<br />
For a moment, it seemed like nothing was going to happen. Nevertheless, Shou swore that the ground shook a little when Cantare was still staring at the wall's inscription. <i>Spooky. I never knew Cantare had such a patience to do anything. Looks like I've got much to learn.</i><br />

<span style="color: limegreen"><b><u>OrangeDonphan</u>: </b><i>Your first paragraph would have been better suited to your last reply as you ended that one by entering the tree, so beginning this one while you're still outside doesn't really fit. Also, there is no mention of Ludicolo as it's still back in the glade where you'd initially come across it so there are just a couple of little things to note there.</i><br />
<br />
Diving into the fighting mass isn't at all appealing to either of you, but Phil is a brave little fellow and races in at full throttle, determined to do what he can to retrieve the items you need. Dodging around the boulders lining the edge of the battlefield, you keep your eyes peeled, praying that no attacks come your way. After several nerve-wracking minutes Phil comes hurtling out of the crowd using <b>Gyro Ball</b> to send a couple of Sneasel who where trying to halt his escape flying in opposite directions. Proud of the little guy you notice he has the orb curled in his trunk and the seed secured in his mouth, and quickly taking the orb from him, you both flee up and out of the crater leaving the battle raging behind you. Chatot had been quite clear about the fact you need to return both items to the glade, but if you have to choose between the two then the seed seems to be the most important of the two as it has not yet been tainted by any dark energy. Just as you're exiting the crater and entering the base of the tree you find your first obstacle in the form of a rather mangy looking Poochyena who is snarling viciously at the two of you and blocking your exit path back into the forest. Tucking the orb safely into your pocket you then proceed to take the seed from Phil who is eyeing Poochyena with surprising malice. It appears that witnessing the lengths the forest Pokémon are going to to save their forest has given your little sidekick quite a confidence boost. Whether it's that or the fact his adrenaline is still rushing after having been in the midst of the fighting is anyones guess, but whatever the case it appears he isn't about to let the dark pup get the better of him and takes an attack stance, awaiting your instructions...</span><br />

<br />
<span style="color: silver"><b><u>Coel</u>: </b>Taking all things into consideration, the longer you think about it you come to realise only one thing; coming here was a very bad idea. Your fear only serves to feed Bix's less than pleasing taunting side, however, and it isn't long before he's delving into unwelcome territory and dragging up memories of your rival, using him to utterly manipulate you once again. You may have started out on this journey wanting to turn a new leaf and not allow Bix to get the better of you, but it seems old habits die hard and he already has you exactly where he wants you. With Kevin and his sister now the furthest things from your mind, you're out to prove that you're not the coward Bix seems to think you are and proceed to release your newest teammate to accompany you upon your investigation of the crypt. There is safety in numbers, after all...<br />
<br />
Upon entering the stone structure you feel a chill creep up your spine not only because it's quite cold in here, but because the aura of death surrounds you. Four lanterns light the room, one in each corner, shedding enough light for you to see your surroundings. Pleased that you've not found yourself cloaked in complete darkness you notice a shattered urn on the far side of the room and find yourself thankful there are no ashes spread on the floor around it. A large coffin is resting in the middle of the room, while eight smaller ones line the walls and several more urns sit in alcoves in the wall. Each of the coffins have plaques atop them, with plaques also hanging on the walls beside each urn. Although curious to read them, the shattered urn on the floor has your attention as it can't have just fallen by itself. Adding to this Kevin stated quite clearly that <i>&quot;It's hiding inside,&quot;</i> and you can't help but wonder what &quot;it&quot; is, and why it would smash the urn.<br />
<br />
While you're pondering this, Swablu sits on your shoulder nibbling your earlobe affectionately while Bix shoots her death stares. You take no notice of him, however, as you soon hear a scuttling sound and scamper backward toward the exit. It stops, and you check the room again, realising that whatever is hiding in here must be behind one of the coffins. Gulping down the knot of fear slowly but surely forming in your throat you step carefully forward, checking behind each of the coffins while Bix trails along behind you. Just as you're approaching the last of the small ones along the back wall of the crypt a shadow leaps out at you and you yell, jumping back and nearly tripping over Bix who is far too full of himself to admit that he'd been scared as well. Gathering yourself, you find the culprit to be none other than a Nincada, and a rather feisty one at that which seems a little out of the ordinary for its species, but it seems Nincada isn't the only thing present in the room if the sobbing from behind the coffin it had been hiding behind is anything to go by...</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: silver"><b><u>Tenorphin</u>: </b>With three choices before you, you contemplate each one. With Cantare being unable to sing properly just yet this seems out of the question, and not quite prepared to give up a berry from your sparse collection, you finally turn to the last option; Keen Eye. This can mean only one thing, and thankfully this is something that Cantare may be able to perform. Though you're not certain how staring at a wall will help, you stand back and watch him as he appears to enter an almost hypnotic state whilst staring intently at the inscription on the wall. After about a minute of inactivity your jaw practically drops as Cantare appears to float across the room. He's completely unaware of the fact he's moving at all, and as he stops directly in front of the inscription, just hovering there while the humming sound increases in intensity, you practically leap out of your skin when he suddenly breaks free of his trance and screeches excitedly. &quot;Lever!&quot; he cries, flapping his wings wildly. &quot;Lever! Lever!&quot; When he tries unsuccessfully to force his wing through the wall you step closer to notice the spot he's trying to reach is actually a cleverly disguised alcove. You can stand directly in front of it and not notice it at all, but when reaching <b>into</b> the concrete slab find that there isn't one there at all. This illusion is obviously designed to hide the secret alcove from the naked eye, but when a Pokémon with the <b>Keen Eye</b> ability stares at it they can see it for what it is. Reaching in and hoping you don't find yourself caught up in some kind of trap you feel a wooden stick, a lever, just like Cantare had said. Wrapping your fingers around it you push, but it doesn't give. Then, pulling it upward, you hear a click as it gives way, and a second later find another secret door opening in the wall. Cantare rushes through, leaving you to follow quickly before it closes, and once again you find yourself standing in another chamber only without any inscriptions on the walls.<br />
<br />
This chamber is much larger than the previous two, the humming you've been hearing most definitely coming from here although you cannot see what's causing it. The room is completely empty with the exception of a black marble pedestal in the centre atop which rests an odd stone of some sort, and although there doesn't appear to be any obvious way out you're sure there's an exit here somewhere. Cantare flits about examining the room, attempting to use his Keen Eye ability again in case there is another illusion for him to find, but there is nothing. You join him, and after a good half hour of scouring every nook and cranny and coming up with nothing become quite frustrated. At this point, the humming intensifies again, and certain something is about to happen hold your breath while waiting for it. Surely enough, a purplish glow starts to form, and a moment later you find yourself staring into the tormented eyes of a very sad and lonely Mismagius. &quot;Please help me...&quot; she pleads. &quot;Help free me from this prison and I'll show you the way out...&quot;</span><br />

<span style="color: darkorange"><b><u>handymankg2</u>: </b>It doesn't take Ponyta long to free you, and before long, after freeing Belle from the confines of your knapsack, you're making your way back over to the group gathered in a wide circle around Reg. The head of the Nightbringers stands next to him which isn't at all surprising considering the power Reg holds in his hands, and as silence sets in all eyes are turned to the man who is about to summon Jirachi. Reg looks nervous, his eyes scanning the crowd for any sign of you, but you know you can't reveal yourself with Jack standing close by watching Reg intently, and are sure to keep yourself hidden amongst the crowd. Reg's eyes meet Jack's and in that moment, as Jack sneers cockily at him, Reg suspects his game is up. He falters for a moment, knowing that if he plays the flute now and fails to summon Jirachi, all of the years he's spent infiltrating this organisation in order to prevent this very event from working in the way the Nightbringers had hoped will be lost. Trying to put yourself in his shoes, you think over what you know. Reg doesn't have the real flute, but everyone thinks he does. Jack himself had even gloated about being the one to have initially acquired it. In the worst case scenario Reg could play the fake and then claim ignorance, possibly even accusing Jack of having stolen the genuine artifact which could at least buy Reg enough time to save himself and for you to get the hell out of here. Wondering what he'll do, you watch closely as Reg raises the instrument to his lips, reaching into your pack to remove your own. As the crystal clear notes of the glass replica ring out into the desert night, you realise for the first time that you can't play the real flute here because everyone will hear it. You're too close to the action! Its too late to retreat however, so you swiftly make your way to the back of the crowd and place the flute to your lips, playing it as softly as you can and hoping for the best. <br />
<br />
When the sweet melody Reg is playing stops, you stop playing as well, your heart beating so heavily in your chest that you feel it's about to explode. All eyes are turned to him as dead silence fills the night, and when nothing happens and the angry murmurs begin, you know you've not played the flute properly. The head Nightbringer reaches out to grab the flute, accidentally knocking it out of Reg's hand so that it drops to the ground, shattering against a small rock upon the sand. Reg feigns shock, staring at it in disbelief, while Jack races forward screaming hysterically. &quot;It's a fake! Its a fake! He's fooling us all! He wants it for himself so that HE can rule the world!&quot; Reg looks aghast, his expression very real, for this is not his intention at all despite the fact Jack is partly correct in his accusation of the flute being a copy. &quot;Him and his little buddy cooked up a plan, they've fooled you aallll!&quot; Jack squeals madly. It's at this point you realise that you need to flee because Reg's plan is unravelling quickly, and despite Reg's protests to the contrary, the angry crowd, including the head Nightbringer, appear to believe Jack. Just as you're about to turn and run you watch the head Nightbringers arm swing forward. It all happens so quickly that there's not even enough time to yell out a warning, and the next minute Reg drops to the desert floor to land in a pool of his own blood that is seeping from his throat and into the sand. His blank, lifeless eyes stare into yours, and you run, fleeing for your life as orders are barked to the crowd to hunt you down and bring you back; dead or alive.<br />
<br />
Taking cover in the first place you find, you run into one of the canvas tents pitched nearby. Luckily the Nightbringers seem to think you've escaped into the desert, however, and are all either driving out in jeeps or riding their Pokémon out into the desert in search of you. After several minutes you dare to peek out, the sight of Reg's body laying on the sand unnerving to say the least, but at least everyone seems to have disappeared and so you take the chance to sneak out to escape before they return to find you hiding here. You've not gotten far though, when a familiar gloating laugh causes your heart to sink. &quot;You didn't really think you were gunna get away with it, did ya?&quot; Jack drawls, and as you turn to face him you see something glinting in the moonlight as he throws it at you. &quot;Jirachi is mine!&quot; Jack yells as the knife he'd stolen from you earlier hurtles toward your face, Ponyta leaping forward to prevent you from being hurt only to be struck in the chest instead. It drops to the ground, neighing softly as its blood seeps into the desert sand, and for the second time in a matter of minutes you watch as the second of the only two allies you had out here dies before your eyes. Belle is beside herself, and moves into attack position, ready to battle the boy who had just taken the life of her new friend, Jack snickering as he reaches for a Pokéball. &quot;Pitiful creature,&quot; he sneers, a wicked grin on his face. &quot;Let's see how you like this!&quot; he yells, releasing a Nuzleaf. While you're struggling to comprehend how things have turned upside down, going from bad to worse in a less than ten minutes, the only thing you're thankful for is the fact you still have the flute. There is so much more to consider now, the simple wish you had before now not being such a simple thing after all. Wishing the Nightbringers didn't exist won't bring Reg or Ponyta back, or get you out of this mess, because the organisation can always reform under a different name. You need to think very carefully before summoning the legendary, because so much more is at stake now. First things first though is Jack. You'll need to do something about him so that you're able to make your wish without him getting in the way...</span></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Rick smiled very weakly as he was freed by Ponyta, and Rick quickly scrambled for his backpack, quickly gripping the zip that opened the bag, and thrusting it down at a lightning fast pace, allowing his Combee, Belle, to quickly fly out of his backpack, flinging it round onto his back soon after, a dull thud resounding as it hit Ricks back, quickly being zipped up again; he had no time to check if anything had been stolen at this point. The Combee that came out of his rucksack beamed happily towards Rick, happy to be freed from the constraints that it had been bound too for the last few minutes. She fluttered rapidly around the small space of area they were in, making sure that she wasn’t injured in any ways, and that all her senses still worked clearly. Ponyta neighed softly, reminding Rick, who had been watching Combee rather thoughtlessly thus far, of what he had come here to do. Turning quickly and walking towards the area he seemed to remember he should be in, he quickly ducked behind a tent, making sure that he could still see what was going on, but was well hidden from the eyes of anyone looking behind them. What Rick could see was what he was expecting, really, but still, the sight of it was really unnerving. The entire collective unit of the Nightbringerss was rather large indeed, several rings of people circling the center of a small clearing, free of tents. People were chatting animatedly as Rick noticed the man he was looking for, Reg, standing in the center of the ring, being stared down by both the Nighthawk leader, and Jack, Ricks evil little doppelganger who had tied Rick to a post not long ago, threatening him with a gun, which is something Rick didn’t particularly take very kind too. Rick watched carefully as Regs eyes began to dart the area, searching for what Rick assumed could only be him, the person who was holding the flute of which the entire Nightbringer army was looking to use. Rick made sure to keep himself concealed, however, as he wanted not the entire Nighthawk army, specifically Jack, attacking him should the plan go wrong. Reg looked slightly worried when he couldn’t see Rick in the area, and turned to Jack, who was standing very close to Reg. He gave a very cocky smile, and Rick saw Regs expression falter. Rick attempted to put himself in Regs shoes; what he must be thinking right now. It had taken the man several years to get into the huge criminal organisation like this, and he was now putting his very life in the hands of a young kid like Rick, whos only Pokemon on hand was a three headed bee. Yes, who wouldn’t be worried at that thought?<br />
<br />
Rick watched carefully as Reg put the flute to his lips, and attempted to mimic the movement perfectly; if he played it too quickly or slowly, the cover might be blown for Reg, which would be disastrous for both of them. Rick was surprised at the fact that the Replica was actually playing some pretty soothing music, and as he started to copy, he quickly stopped. He knew that if he played from here, he would certainly be heard by the Nightbringers, and most certainly be killed seconds after. Backing away slightly from the crowd, Rick attempted to play the flute as lightly as possible, making some very light serene sounds, Rick smiling as it played. When Reg stopped playing however, so did Rick, and Ricks eyes widened as absolutely nothing occurred; nothing. This was disastrous, and the angry murmurs of the Nighthawks soon confirmed that they weren’t happy with what was going on, some of them even moving closer towards Reg, fists raised. One of the Nightbringers attempted to reach out and take the flute from Reg in anger, but instead knocked it to the ground, the flute shattering into tiny pieces as it did so. Rick sighed, this was it, they had failed. But then again, Reg still had the ignorance card, right, he could blame it on Jack…Well, he could off, at least, until Jacks voice resounded loudly through the area, making Rick curse under his breath as it did so. Despite Regs arguments, the crowd aren’t buying anything, apparently willing to believe the Jack. As Rick got ready to run, he saw the lead Nightbringers arm strike forwards, and slam into Reg, knocking him straight down to the ground. Combees eyes widened as it happened, as did Ricks, Reg lying in his own pool of blood on the floor as the Nightbringers looked angrily around. Rick heard orders barked, and soon decided it was now or never to escape, and ran towards the nearest tent he could find, the group of three leaping in and silently hiding themselves, Nightbringers running past in the search for Rick and his pals, whereas Rick was still perfectly okay in the tent. He began to think slowly about what had happened; it was a horrible thing to think about. Rick had unknowingly brought the death of the only person that had showed him kindness in the desert, and someone who seemed like a fairly nice man. What had gone wrong? What had caused his death to happen so quickly. Was he wrong about Jirachi appearing if played early? All these questions resounded through Ricks head as he heard the running stop, and he walked out of the tent quickly, deciding to escape before anything else happens.<br />
<br />
However, Rick hadn’t got very far before the familiar voice of Jacks sounds through the area, and Rick turns to find him standing there, Pokeball in hand. Jack was also wielding a knife, and before Rick could react, the knife was flinging directly at Ricks face. His eyes were now widened fully; this was the end of his life, meaning that everything he had fought for today and previously was in vain; it was the end of the world. He stood standing, waiting for the oncoming dagger and…it never came, instead, smashing into Ponyta, who was flung flying down onto the floor in front of Rick, the life being sucked out of the horse as it whinnied for a final time, the eyes in its socket turning completely white. Rick could barely comprehend it; the Pokemon who had been working with Rick for the last two days, someone who had become like a friend, was now lying dead on the floor in front of him. Rick barely saw as Jack released a Nuzleaf in front of him, anger simply boiling up in Ricks mind. He would end this now, and Jack would pay for what he had done, he would pay big time. When Rick got that wish…it was too late to think of that now. All he could think of was battling, and most importantly, winning. “Belle, you’re up. Gust him quickly, follow it with an Aerial Ace, and extract our Fury in Cutter form.” The Bee nodded, apparently just as distraut, and headed towards the enemy for the first turn of the battle.</span></span></div>

<br />
Walking together through the scrub, your foursome begins to encounter an area where the signs of life are more common. A bit of discarded food here and there, sometimes a feather shed by a bird Pokémon. Torchic picks up a discarded feather in his beak and tickles Cyndaquil with it, causing the two to erupt in another bout of playing, tickling eachother with the feather until Cyndaquil sneezes, accidentally scorching the little feather. Kiera giggles a little at the scene, and you can’t help but smile yourself at the two playing side by side, new friends. Your mind can’t help but wander to your future- how many new friends are there ahead of you and Torchic? Who might they be? Of course, you’re looking for your first ever capture here by the lake of Mediville, and that might just be the greatest friend for Torchic of all.<br />
<br />
After several minutes of looking for Pokémon, the two of you stop, having found nothing. <br />
“That’s odd.” Kiera says, “There’s usually plenty of Pokémon around here, I used to come here with my older sister before she moved out.” <br />
“Doesn’t seem to be much around at the moment” you reply, stating the obvious.<br />
“Chiiic!” Torchic squawks in agreement, playing with some grass out of boredom.<br />
“I wonder why it’s so quiet around here?” You ask. Kiera shrugs, and gazes around until she spots something and stops dead. You track her eyes to spot a small Slakoth, which surprisingly for a species noted for its laziness is running at full speed across your path. Your eyes and Kiera’s meet and the question is obvious- what to do? <br />

</blockquote><span style="color: LemonChiffon"><span style="font-size: 9px">Kori and Kiera continued to walk on. as signs of pokemon became more and more apparent. Broken nut shells left behind by a Rattata or a Bidoof, pecked at seeds and scratched dirt, telltale signs of any number of small bird types, and a small coiled up turd that Kori almost stepped into if Kiera didn’t warn him. Kori’s heartbeat quickened with anticipation. It was like they were getting closer and closer to their eventual goal. Kori’s Torchic found a feather on the ground and grabbed it in between it’s beak. He let Kiera’s Cyndaquil get farther ahead of him and proceeded to sneak up behind her.<br />
<br />
<i>Hehehe, this is gonna be funny as hell.</i> Thought the little Torchic as it krept up behind Kiera’s Cyndaquil, step by step when he smoothly brushed the feather on the Cyndaquil’s back. “CYNDAAAAA!” yelled the Cyndaquil. Torchic chirped in laughter, dropping the feather from it’s beak. Cyndaquil quickly grabbed the feather and began to retaliate. “Cynda, Cynda, Cynda, Cynda!” <i>Take that, and that, and that, and that!</i>. The Torchic’s eyes began to bead with tears from laughter as Cyndaquil continued her relentless assault until a small piece of feather broke off and fluttered it’s way into Cyndaquil’s nose, causing her to sneeze. A small jet of fire burst out of Cyndaquils mouth from the following sneeze, a bit of the feather getting caught in the blaze. Torchic and Cyndaquil looked at the smoldering feather and laughed a little. Kori and Kiera chuckled at the silliness of their little fire types and kept on moving.<br />
<br />
****<br />
<br />
<br />
It was a while longer and the mood died down quite dramatically from high energy and playful to boredom and disappointment. “That’s odd.” Kiera says, “There’s usually plenty of Pokémon around here, I used to come here with my older sister before she moved out.” <br />
“Doesn’t seem to be much around at the moment” you reply, stating the obvious.<br />
“Chiiic!” Torchic squawks in agreement, playing with some grass out of boredom.<br />
“I wonder why it’s so quiet around here?” You ask. Thinking back, there were signs of lenty of Pokemon activity, but not a whole lot of human activity. If Pokemon were here, then they should still be here Kori reasoned. Kiera could only shrug on the answer since she only had as much of a clue as Kori did. Kori walked over to a tree and sat down against it, a little dejected from this experience, and, very much like the Pokemon, began to pull the grass out. Kiera let out a sigh and began to follow Kori when her eyes found something brown in the distance. She turned and to her surprise, there was a small pokemon!<br />
“Kori, look!” she said pointing. Kori’s attention perked up and he rushed over to Kiera’s side where he too saw it.<br />
“Alright! Let’s see what the ‘Dex has to say about this.” he said and pointed his Pokedex in the Slakoth’s direction. <br />
<br />
“Slakoth, the Slacker Pokémon. Slakoth is generally found sleeping and very few ever witness it in motion.” said the computer book in it’s robotic tone. Kori and Kiera looked at the entry a little puzzled.<br />
<br />
“Hmm, if this thing is right, and Slakoth don’t move around very much, then how come it looks like this Slakoth…..” Kiera started to say until the tiny Pokemon quickly closed the gap between them and blew right past, kicking up a storm of dust. Kori and Kiera look into each others eyes, the same thought hatching behind their eyes. <br />
<br />
“Let’s go after it!” they yell and they quickly begin running after Slakoth, Torchic and Cyndaquil running close behind. The Slakoth’s speed was amazing, especially for a pokemon of it’s usual nature, Kori and Kiera beginning to run out of breath merely by trying to keep up with the supposedly slow pokemon. The Slakoth kept on running, almost mechanical like, never noticing anyone behind it, only turning to avoid trees and brush.<br />
<br />
“Man Kiera, what is going on with this place!” Kori asked.<br />
“I don’t know, this is really weird, I’ve never seen it like this, but what should we do with this Slakoth? Should we try to capture it?” she asked.<br />
“Actually, I think we should keep following it! I don’t know why, but my gut is telling me where this Slakoth is going might give us an answer about the rest of the other Pokemon that should be around here!” said Kori. <br />

<br />
<span style="color: darkorange"><b><u>handymankg2</u>: </b>Emotions are high as this battle begins. The deaths of both Reg and Ponyta, the only two that you've met during the course of your adventure that you could have considered friends, weighing heavily on your heart. There is so much to consider, yet the outcome seems so simple. Or is it? There will always be evil in this world, and it will come in many shapes and forms, the Nightbringers being only one small element. In the grand scheme of things they're really not all that important, particularly considering they're relying upon Jirachi's wishes to give them what they want. If they truly want world domination they'll fight for it, and face many obstacles and people like Reg who will fight to bring them down, and perhaps one day someone will succeed. Not on this night however, for right now you can only take one step at a time, and in this very moment Jack is your focus. The boy could be your twin, but you shudder at the thought, your blood boiling for all that he's done, and as your eyes fall upon Ponyta's motionless body and you think about all it had done to help you despite the fact it is... <i>was</i>... still very young, you can't help but be angry over the injustice of it all. Two brave souls have died tonight, neither deserving to, and with all of this and more spinning around in your mind, you prepare to battle with Belle by your side.<br />
<br />
The little Combee wastes no time in carrying out your instructions, so distraught by tonight's events that her emotions are giving her an added edge. This isn't just a trainer battle where the outcome will simply serve to provide her with much needed experience, this battle is about fighting for the will to survive, knocking the arrogant Jack down a peg or two, and avenging her fiery friend. This is personal. Belle's little wings flutter so fast that all you see is a blur, <b>Gust</b>s of wind carrying grains of the gritty desert sand pelting Nuzleaf who grunts angrily, trying to shield itself without success. When the wind dies down it stares at her through irritated eyes before unleashing a barrage of <b>Razor</b> sharp <b>Leaves</b> that, while intimidating, do little more than shave off a little fuzz from Belle's abdomen. She then starts to circle Nuzleaf, flying just high enough to be out of its reach, watching while it races in circles on the ground below her shaking its fist before attempting to strike her with another <b>Razor Leaf</b>. She dodges this easily as she sharply changes direction, moving in at lighting speed to strike her enemy with <b>Aerial Ace</b>, knocking Nuzleaf to the ground. Both trainer and Pokémon roar angrily, Jack's expression not so cocky anymore as Nuzleaf rises to its feet and spins around to <b>Pound</b> Belle hard on the back. She gasps, surprised, before her expression changes to one of utter determination and she flies at it in a rage, her little wings like sharpened knives as she slashes away at Nuzleaf with <b>Fury Cutter</b>. As the two Pokémon separate, staring each other down, it seems Nuzleaf has definitely come off worse for wear so far which only serves to add to Jack's fury. Belle has used a little more energy than you would have liked after that last unnatural attack, but considering she's holding her own against an evolved Pokémon, she's doing rather well...</span></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: darkorange"><span style="font-size: 9px">Ricks emotions were soaring high above what they’d usually be at the moment, and he’d sure that his father would be ashamed if he saw him now, letting his fury and his sadness consume him like this. He was certain, however, that his mother would be extremely proud at him for the fact he has shown very important emotions in the recent moments. Passion, love, grief, all of these emotions would supposedly make him stronger, but currently, Rick had no idea how they could even be thought too, considering how much they deeply hurt. There is so much to consider, but he has so little time to do so, and thinking through briefly what had happened, he decided that he should focus fully on the battle at hand. He had no longer any care to what he was doing, however insignificant it may be in the face of the world, he would still fight. Fight until there was nothing left of the murderers that were the Nightbringers, even if he had to die trying, something that was becoming strangely obvious as an outcome. Considering that the Nightbringers weren’t strong enough to pose any threat to the world without Jirachis wishes, some may think that Ricks emotions were pointless. He would disagree strongly at any given time; he needed to honour those who had died fighting, and in the current period of time, this was the only way he could think off. He glanced once again down at the Ponyta. It looked tiny in death, but Rick knew for certain, it died a hero. Ricks hero, and he would avenge it no matter what.<br />
<br />
Belle was soon to initiate Ricks orders, and flew straight into the battle like a blur, ready to avenge her fallen comrade against the wicked Jack and his unfortunate Pokemon. Rick felt slightly sorry for the Pokemon, as surely no Pokemon would want to serve a master as cruel as Jack. Rick thought to himself that the Pokemon may well love his master, though, as many Pokemon seem to do regardless of what their master has said or done. Their master will have raised them through thick and thin, trained them as a partner. It was best not to dwindle on these facts, though. All that was important was the Nuzleaf was serving the enemy, and as such had to be defeated in order to achieve the bigger picture. Simple, right? Rick smiled as Belle began to rapidly flutter her wings, her anger displayed in a <b>Gust</b> attack that was sent soaring at the enemy, winds being swept up as desert sands smacked against the opponent, who attempted to cover themselves as the attack hit for some good damage. Rick smirked, his first attack had worked. The Nuzleaf replied by launching a barrage of <b>leaves</b> at <b>Razor</b> sharp angles, which pelted Belle, but did little damage due to the typing of the bee. Belle now began her second move, flying in a circle around Nuzleaf, who thinking Belle was taking a breather, began to launch more of the <b>Razor Leaves</b> at Belle, who disappeared in a flash, appearing on the other side of the enemy as was normal for a <b>Aerial Ace</b> attack. Belle, however, was not expecting an after attack, and was shocked to find a <b>Pound</b>ing feeling in her back, Nuzleaf having struck her. Her eyes quickly widened in rage, and she turned round swiftly, her <b>Fury</b> displayed as she began to <b>cut</b> Nuzleaf angrily, slashing like mad against the opponent. As the Pokemon separated, Rick smirked as he saw his partner was doing better than his opponent, but had used more energy than the Nuzleaf. It was time for turn two, and Rick was determined to win. <br />
<br />
“Combee, start the round off with another <b>Gust</b>, aiming for the Pokemons feet to try and knock it over. Follow up with another <b>Gust</b>, which if the Nuzleaf was knocked over, should do some good damage. Finish with a <b>Aerial Ace</b>, making sure to wait until it was standing if it had been knocked over.” Rick eyed his Combee with adoration as she smiled weakly back at him, before turning, and going straight back into the battle against Jack and his rightly infuriated Nuzleaf.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver"><b><u>The Graveyard</u></b> - Please reply in <b>silver</b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Tenorphin</u>: </b>With three choices before you, you contemplate each one. With Cantare being unable to sing properly just yet this seems out of the question, and not quite prepared to give up a berry from your sparse collection, you finally turn to the last option; Keen Eye. This can mean only one thing, and thankfully this is something that Cantare may be able to perform. Though you're not certain how staring at a wall will help, you stand back and watch him as he appears to enter an almost hypnotic state whilst staring intently at the inscription on the wall. After about a minute of inactivity your jaw practically drops as Cantare appears to float across the room. He's completely unaware of the fact he's moving at all, and as he stops directly in front of the inscription, just hovering there while the humming sound increases in intensity, you practically leap out of your skin when he suddenly breaks free of his trance and screeches excitedly. &quot;Lever!&quot; he cries, flapping his wings wildly. &quot;Lever! Lever!&quot; When he tries unsuccessfully to force his wing through the wall you step closer to notice the spot he's trying to reach is actually a cleverly disguised alcove. You can stand directly in front of it and not notice it at all, but when reaching <b>into</b> the concrete slab find that there isn't one there at all. This illusion is obviously designed to hide the secret alcove from the naked eye, but when a Pokémon with the <b>Keen Eye</b> ability stares at it they can see it for what it is. Reaching in and hoping you don't find yourself caught up in some kind of trap you feel a wooden stick, a lever, just like Cantare had said. Wrapping your fingers around it you push, but it doesn't give. Then, pulling it upward, you hear a click as it gives way, and a second later find another secret door opening in the wall. Cantare rushes through, leaving you to follow quickly before it closes, and once again you find yourself standing in another chamber only without any inscriptions on the walls.<br />
<br />
This chamber is much larger than the previous two, the humming you've been hearing most definitely coming from here although you cannot see what's causing it. The room is completely empty with the exception of a black marble pedestal in the centre atop which rests an odd stone of some sort, and although there doesn't appear to be any obvious way out you're sure there's an exit here somewhere. Cantare flits about examining the room, attempting to use his Keen Eye ability again in case there is another illusion for him to find, but there is nothing. You join him, and after a good half hour of scouring every nook and cranny and coming up with nothing become quite frustrated. At this point, the humming intensifies again, and certain something is about to happen hold your breath while waiting for it. Surely enough, a purplish glow starts to form, and a moment later you find yourself staring into the tormented eyes of a very sad and lonely Mismagius. &quot;Please help me...&quot; she pleads. &quot;Help free me from this prison and I'll show you the way out...&quot;</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Silver">As Cantare started to set its eyes on the inscription, Shou let himself take a break and shut his sore eyes, exhausted from the excessive squinting in the darkness and the constant anxiety since arriving at the Graveyard. using his remaining senses, particularly his acute sense of hearing, he could still tell if anything was wrong and react to it immediately. With his eyes closed, Shou realised that it wasn't all that different from just several minutes before, since it was also dark with humming in the back ground. The most obvious difference between the two situations is probably the decibel of the humming.<br />
<br />
Hearing nothing from Cantare, who was still spouting random phrases just moments ago even when staring at the wall, Shou opened his eyes in order to look at where Cantare is. Cantare wasn't on the floor, where he originally was. Instinctively, Shou looked away and upwards from the ground. All he saw was, to his surprise, Cantare hovering towards the wall with the inscription. <i>Why is Cantare hovering? Shouldn't Chatots fly instead?</i> Realising he had his jaw dropped, Shou shut his mouth and started following Cantare to the wall. As he did that, the humming gets louder and louder by millidecibels, and the environment gets creepier every inch Shou moved in. <br />
<br />
Shou was still wondering what happened to Cantare when the Pokémon started screeching, which sounded like someone hit an enormous bell beside his ears. &quot;Cantare! What&quot; &quot;Lever!&quot; &quot;are you-&quot; Shou's hand shot up to protect his ears from going deaf, yelling when he found out that Cantare was shouting something. &quot;What did you just say?&quot; &quot;Lever! Lever!&quot; &quot;But there is no lev-&quot; Shou pressed on the wall to show Cantare his point when his palm passed through the stone wall, rendering Shou off-balance. &quot;Whaaa-&quot; Shou yelled with a sudden fear of falling, flailing momentarily before his hand hit something solid. Shou sighed his relief. Reaching his other hand through the &quot;wall&quot;, Shou finally understands what Cantare meant. The wall was an illusion, with a lever Shou hadn't found behind it to supposedly do something of utmost importance.<br />
<br />
Feeling with both his hands, Shou secretly hoped that it is not any of hidden tricks used by people to trap intruders. A cylindrical object passed by Shou's hands and it felt like wood to his hands. Gathering his bravery all he could, Shou pushed the lever down but it wouldn't budge. Shou grunted, and pulled the lever up. This time, it sounds like it worked as a click registered itself in Shou's very polished hearing sense. Immediately, unlike the last chamber, a door appeared, this time not the wall itself, but still on the wall nonetheless. A standard sized door opened, also sliding, at the left corner of the wall. Getting very excited again, Cantare rushed through the only half-opened sliding door. Not wanting to get closed oout, Shou hastily followed Cantare into the next room.<br />
<br />
The next room is significantly larger than the previous two, but looked similar nonetheless due to the light intensity, colour tone, and room condition. But there is one thing that is vastly different from the other two rooms, it is that there is a black marble pedestal at the center of the room. The humming sounds like it's coming from here, specifically the black marble pedestal, as Shou walked around the room to check for more inscriptions. He can't find any, but as he moved, the humming source changes from in front to the right side, and stayed at the right side all the time as he circled the room. Thus he concluded that it must come from the pedestal. Looking at the spot, though, Shou couldn't see anything that can remotely make sound. Trying to ignore the sound for now, Shou searched more thoroughly with Cantare, but both of them, after a good moments searching, turns out with nothing. Loaded with frustration and disappointment, Shou was ready to burst out in tears.<br />
<br />
It was a sudden change in the environment. Shou throws his hands up to cover both of his ears when the humming had an abrupt increase in volume, while wincing in auditory pain. Being certain it was a sign of an event coming up, Shou held his breath tensely while seeming to wait for something to miraculously happen. <i>I hope this thing that is going to happen spells e-x-i-t</i>. Having that thought, Shou looked around to check if there was any doors appearing. Finding none, he unwillingly turned back front, and found himself looking directly at a pair of excruciated eyes. Being frightened, Shou staggered back a few step, almost falling to the floor. &quot;Whaaa!&quot; He exclaimed before he heard a ladylike voice. &quot;Please help me...&quot; Shou felt his heart jerked, <i>She can talk!</i> Standing straight again, Shou found out the master of the voice is a lonesome Pokémon that looks like a witch wearing a oversized purple pointed hat and an old purple cape. There were spikes along the Pokémon's hat, and she has rubies around her body. Not knowing what it is, Shou took out his high technology Pokédex that is given from the professor in his hometown and pointed it to the Pokémon. &quot;Mismagius, the Magical Pokémon. Mismagius chants incantations, and while some cause misery, some give happiness as well.&quot; The mechanical tenor-ish voice from the digital encyclopaedia said.<br />
<br />
The Mismagius pleaded Shou again, in her tormented sad voice. &quot;Help free me from this prison and I'll show you the way out...&quot; Being unable to ignore a sad Pokémon, and also because of his unability to resist to such an offer, and maybe, a little mystified, Shou said after contemplating, &quot;How do I do that?&quot;<br />

<span style="color: limegreen"><b><u>OrangeDonphan</u>: </b><i>Your first paragraph would have been better suited to your last reply as you ended that one by entering the tree, so beginning this one while you're still outside doesn't really fit. Also, there is no mention of Ludicolo as it's still back in the glade where you'd initially come across it so there are just a couple of little things to note there.</i><br />
<br />
Diving into the fighting mass isn't at all appealing to either of you, but Phil is a brave little fellow and races in at full throttle, determined to do what he can to retrieve the items you need. Dodging around the boulders lining the edge of the battlefield, you keep your eyes peeled, praying that no attacks come your way. After several nerve-wracking minutes Phil comes hurtling out of the crowd using <b>Gyro Ball</b> to send a couple of Sneasel who where trying to halt his escape flying in opposite directions. Proud of the little guy you notice he has the orb curled in his trunk and the seed secured in his mouth, and quickly taking the orb from him, you both flee up and out of the crater leaving the battle raging behind you. Chatot had been quite clear about the fact you need to return both items to the glade, but if you have to choose between the two then the seed seems to be the most important of the two as it has not yet been tainted by any dark energy. Just as you're exiting the crater and entering the base of the tree you find your first obstacle in the form of a rather mangy looking Poochyena who is snarling viciously at the two of you and blocking your exit path back into the forest. Tucking the orb safely into your pocket you then proceed to take the seed from Phil who is eyeing Poochyena with surprising malice. It appears that witnessing the lengths the forest Pokémon are going to to save their forest has given your little sidekick quite a confidence boost. Whether it's that or the fact his adrenaline is still rushing after having been in the midst of the fighting is anyones guess, but whatever the case it appears he isn't about to let the dark pup get the better of him and takes an attack stance, awaiting your instructions...</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">Ok, now I can finally write!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: LimeGreen"><span style="font-size: 9px">“Hmm, where could they be?” thought Alex. Having circled around almost the whole crowd, he was confused about the fact that the precious pieces were no where to be seen, “Is that?- nope, that’s an Exeggcute. Hm…”<br />
<br />
“Sneees!” Phil came bounding out of a crowd of Sneasels, the steely lace of his Gyro Ball disappearing behind him. “Haha! Awesome, Phil!” exclaimed Alex. Ignoring the bloody battle, the pair met towards the back of the chasm. “Ok, so which one did you get?” asked Alex. Phil placed both the orb and the seed on the ground in front of him. An excited smile rushed to the elephant’s face, from both the success and the happiness of its trainer. “Here, I’ll hold the orb.” spoke Alex while picking up the menacing object. He thought it would be heavier, and Phil would be better at protecting the more valuable of the halves. After all, the dark types barely had time to contaminate it. Hoisting Phil over his head with one hand, he helped the ground type climb the rather steep “stairs”. Following suit, he lifted himself over the ridge and entered the rather dark passage way out of the tainted tree. Barely taking three steps, Alex and Phil were met be a low and rumbling growl.<br />
<br />
Finally noticing the camouflaged Pocchyena that was hiding in the darkness of the tunnel, Alex realized it wasn’t about to freely let you pass. Phil jumped in front of Alex, ready to take on his first opponent. Cocking his head, he looked toward Alex for commands.<br />
<br />
“Sorry buddy, I ain’t about to risk your life- or play fair,” replied Alex, “Let’s see, come on out Baah!” He tossed the familiar pokeball of his second and newest pokemon and a small blue and white sheep appeared next to Phil. The small light on her tail illuminated the makeshift battlefield. “Ok, Phil, I want you to play some offense with a <b>Defense Curl</b> to <b>Rollout</b> combo while Baah holds it with a <b>Thunder Wave</b>. Baah, I also want you to set up a <b>Reflect</b> if needed to heed the pup from hitting you or Phil!”</span></span></div>

<br />
<span style="color: silver"><b><u>Coel</u>: </b>Taking all things into consideration, the longer you think about it you come to realise only one thing; coming here was a very bad idea. Your fear only serves to feed Bix's less than pleasing taunting side, however, and it isn't long before he's delving into unwelcome territory and dragging up memories of your rival, using him to utterly manipulate you once again. You may have started out on this journey wanting to turn a new leaf and not allow Bix to get the better of you, but it seems old habits die hard and he already has you exactly where he wants you. With Kevin and his sister now the furthest things from your mind, you're out to prove that you're not the coward Bix seems to think you are and proceed to release your newest teammate to accompany you upon your investigation of the crypt. There is safety in numbers, after all...<br />
<br />
Upon entering the stone structure you feel a chill creep up your spine not only because it's quite cold in here, but because the aura of death surrounds you. Four lanterns light the room, one in each corner, shedding enough light for you to see your surroundings. Pleased that you've not found yourself cloaked in complete darkness you notice a shattered urn on the far side of the room and find yourself thankful there are no ashes spread on the floor around it. A large coffin is resting in the middle of the room, while eight smaller ones line the walls and several more urns sit in alcoves in the wall. Each of the coffins have plaques atop them, with plaques also hanging on the walls beside each urn. Although curious to read them, the shattered urn on the floor has your attention as it can't have just fallen by itself. Adding to this Kevin stated quite clearly that <i>&quot;It's hiding inside,&quot;</i> and you can't help but wonder what &quot;it&quot; is, and why it would smash the urn.<br />
<br />
While you're pondering this, Swablu sits on your shoulder nibbling your earlobe affectionately while Bix shoots her death stares. You take no notice of him, however, as you soon hear a scuttling sound and scamper backward toward the exit. It stops, and you check the room again, realising that whatever is hiding in here must be behind one of the coffins. Gulping down the knot of fear slowly but surely forming in your throat you step carefully forward, checking behind each of the coffins while Bix trails along behind you. Just as you're approaching the last of the small ones along the back wall of the crypt a shadow leaps out at you and you yell, jumping back and nearly tripping over Bix who is far too full of himself to admit that he'd been scared as well. Gathering yourself, you find the culprit to be none other than a Nincada, and a rather feisty one at that which seems a little out of the ordinary for its species, but it seems Nincada isn't the only thing present in the room if the sobbing from behind the coffin it had been hiding behind is anything to go by...</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Silver">Now there were various things going through the boys mind at that moment, one of which was the question of when it would be lunch time for MTC at the moment was quite hungry indeed. This irelevent factor of course being over shadowed by the pure fact that the coffin appeared to be crying. There was of course the Nincada to which Swablu gave a friendly wave of her fluffy wing despite being scared stiff. Not stiff enough to prevent her overly chipper nature from taking effect despite the fact it had just leapt out at the three moments ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wet pants, check.&quot; Bix stated, his voice seemed to be void from it's usual layer of sarcasm but it still earned him a glare from MTC despite the boy himself being just as scared if not moreso. Now they had to be rational, what exactly were they afraid of? The fact the coffin was crying or the thought that there is something behind said coffin? Well it seemed it was the least of Tweeta's problems as she was more distracted by the small bug than anything, MTC didn't even notice the fact the small bird had left his shoulder. Surely in the future when all this was over he'd blame the fear for his irresponsibility because he would eventually have to blame something. Though Tweeta's philosophy of 'hug any fellow Pokemon on sight' wasn't exactly the safest either.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, are you just going to stand there or are you going to move on with the adventure,&quot; Bix said, his usual air of sarcasm returning as he turned his attention to his trainer who was still frozen to the spot.&quot;Really... and you ask me who the Pokemon is.&quot; The green-hat-clad Pokemon walked a few steps forward, this in itself enough to get MTC's competitive side going. If there was two people, or Pokemon for that matter, he hated to get the better of him it was Sam and Bix. If Bix was going to be an idiot and stupidly investigate what was making that loud sobbing sound, he was too. Stupidity seemed to run in the team.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's see what's behind coffin number one,&quot; MTC blurted, covering up his fear with an extremely poor game show host voice which made Bix cringe. Being emotionally conected to an even bigger idiot than one-self was taxing sometimes especially moments like this. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, looks like we'll find out, as soon as you grow a pair and actually look...&quot;<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px">Only one reply so far to my last set of updates, so it seemed unfair to make Kori wait any longer, so you get your own personal update. Lucky you. On the roleplaying feedback front, I continue to be very impressed- for someone who didn’t know what to write, you sure wrote a lot! Keep that quality of reply up and you’ll be out of here before you can say “Riviera”<br />
<br />
<span style="color: LemonChiffon">Mediville (Please reply in LemonChiffon)<br />
<br />
Kori Gotcha: After brief discussions with Kiera as to your approach to the situation, the two of you take off in hot pursuit of the Slakoth, having to run as fast as you can to catch up with the Slacker Pokémon, which is certainly not living up to its reputation at the moment, giving the two of you, and the following Pokémon, a good bit of exercise. You chase it for about a minute or so, through the underbrush and away from the Lake, into a slightly more woody area, before the Slakoth runs straight towards a tree, diving under a knot and scrambling in panic to hide inside the tree itself, which appears, on closer inspection, to be hollow.<br />
<br />
Eager to investigate, you drop down to your knees and place your head flat against the ground, attempting to see inside the hollowed out tree to see what Slakoth is up to. Moving your head forwards slightly, you are able to get a decent view inside the tree and...<br />
<br />
“OW!” You explain, withdrawing your head quickly from the opening, managing to add insult to injury by falling as you do so. “That little...scratched me right on the nose!” Your hand feels your nose, which is bleeding pretty badly from the sharp claws of the little Pokémon. Kiera pipes up:<br />
“It must be scared, the poor thing. I wonder what is wrong?” she asks, passing you a tissue for your bleeding nose. “What did you see inside the tree?”<br />
<br />
You explain that the tree is indeed hollow and that Slakoth is not the only Pokémon inside, you saw at least one other Pokémon, a Pachirisu inside, also seemingly hiding from something outside the tree, and could hear sounds which could have belonged to several other Pokémon. What you didn’t see however, was any explanation for why the Pokémon were hiding inside the tree, and you say as much to Kiera, with the tissue held over your nose, still facing the tree. Your mind drifts off, wondering what could possibly cause such an uncharacteristic reaction from the Slakoth, when Kiera’s voice drifts into your head, sharper than her usual soft tones, jolting you back to the present.<br />
<br />
“I think I know what the cause of this is.” She says, a note of alarm in her voice.<br />
“What?” you ask, still trying to stop the flow of blood.<br />
“Kori. Turn around. Slowly.” Her voice is shriller and more commanding this time, and you do as she says, turning slowly on the spot. Suddenly, you too have a good idea of the cause of all this.<br />
<br />
Standing not more than three metres from you is another Pokémon. This one however, is not running scared. No, not at all. In fact, unless you’re very much mistaken, this is the reason the other Pokémon are hiding, and probably also the reason that you haven’t seen many signs of life on this side of the Forest. The creature in front of you is a hulking beast, a Vigoroth for sure, but even larger and more feral than most of its species, standing maybe a few inches taller than yourself, and towering over Torchic and Cyndaquil, who have retreated to stand by you and Kiera’s fee. Its fur is matted and slightly browned from dirt, with a distinct red tinge around the mouth area which you don’t need a second look at to identify: Blood. It is none of these things though, that truly chills you about the Pokémon before you. No, the thing causing the hairs to stand up on the back of your neck is Vigoroth’s eyes. They are semi-glazed and almost vacant in appearance, hardly noticing you but clearly aware of your presence by smell. You are struck by the feeling that this Vigoroth appears to be completely mad, and, judging by its appearance, aggressive.<br />
<br />
Now that explains why the Forest is quiet today.</span></span></div>

Fuuten: <i>First of all, the black powder/white powder thing made me howl with laughter, but on with the update...Your reply is good, mentioning that there was no response to your cry verges on the self-updating side but it’s nothing major, just be careful there. Your consistent quality of replies is very impressive.</i><br />
<br />
After a while contemplating the nature of the cart that you’ve seen and more specifically its propulsion, and a further while dusting plenty of the mysterious black powder of off your person, you decide that you’ve spent quite enough time in this eerie old mine and would prefer to head back to whence you came, although perhaps a brief inspection of the cart that went past you so conspicuously might be in order as well. Walking back up the path at decent speed, you notice that the Cart seems to have deposited a fair bit of the black powder on the floor of the mine during its ascent, not copious amounts but certainly the odd patch here and there. Clearly whatever force is driving that cart isn’t exactly taking care to preserve its contents.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes trudging uphill, you reach the entrance to the mine which you entered not long ago, and with a chill you remember the weather outside. If anything, it seems to have worsened with the passing of time and the blizzard seems to have only increased in its ferocity. More importantly, you can see the Cart which passed you at the end of the tracks which cease just before the entrance of the mine. A light sprinkling of snow has settled on top of the black powder, so now you have a white powder as well, although the cart is mostly covered so there is only a small amount of snow covering the contents. Mildly amused by the snow blanket, you stand back a few feet from the cart and observe it for a few seconds.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the cart begins to shake, gently at first but then more insistently, rocking on its track before there is a small puff of powder, flying around as if something inside exploded outwards. Peering forwards, you can’t see anything to cause the explosion, but the hairs stand up on the back of your neck as a cold wind blows past you. The lights around you flicker, but almost as quickly as the strange events start they stop again, with the lights returning to normal and the temperature returning to mildly chilly. How odd. Just as you consider what you’ve seen, a voice from behind you speaks:<br />
<br />
“Good Afternoon young lad.” You spin on the spot at breakneck speed to face the voice, which belongs; you are somewhat relieved to see, to a man. The man is of a pretty large build, although his frame is increased in size by the heavy clothing he is wearing and the assortment of strange contraptions attached to it. “What are you doing here then?”</span></span>

<br />
<span style="color: LightSteelBlue">The cavern once again was mute as Roy continued to move along one of its walls, his movements less enthusiastic then previous. Still keeping a fair pace up the incline, thoughts of doubt no longer could be forced to the back of his head, as the familiar view of the path he passed through not long ago lay before him. <br />
<br />
A long drawn out squint could not make out anything up ahead resembling a cart; the flames of the oil lamps ahead could only be seen ahead, trading in their seductive dance for a still, unnerving one amongst the stagnate air of the mine. The possibility of the cart continuing its climb far out into the raging blizzard was only too likely. Should he give chase once more? Or should he leave the oddity to its icy fate? Though even if he gave up on the cart, would he continue down the mine once more, or turn tail and leave this place for good? These thoughts continued to run laps around Roy’s mind, but were halted to a stop as a crunching sound protruding from his right foot broke the eerie silence and collided with his train of thought. <br />
<br />
Lifting his foot, a small mound of black powder was seen below with the imprint of his boot upon its surface. Using his basic reasoning and somewhat lacking observational skills, he came to realize this was the same powder carried by the elusive cart itself within a minute or two of “what the heck is that?” floating inside his head. Continuing his pace once more and eyeing the ground much more carefully, small piles of the black soot continued to show up upon the trail. Obviously the black powder wasn’t a concern considering the sloppy packaging of the powdery substance on the vessel. Pondering upon his observations, Roy began to question the very use of the sheet upon the cargo seen earlier... Maybe the black powder was preserving ore! The powder must prevent any ore scratching each other or scuffing them up or something during travel. The sheet was to keep the powder in, but it was done sloppily because the powder didn’t retain any value, but the contents within did! <br />
<br />
“That’s gotta be it!” Roy whispered, his voice practically spurting out with vim and vigor like a public fountain to water as he began to mutate. A face of anguish and doubt now transformed into one with animation and anticipation. A shark-like grin grew upon the boy’s face. His eyes once dull, now a feral hunter’s who hadn't eaten in weeks, but had finally spotted its prey and was ready to lunge and devour it whole. Practically crushing the bucket handle in his hand, his body began to tighten as he could feel his excitement push against his chest to go forward in pursuit. His well paced stroll quickly was turning into a blood thirsty charge. His transformation: a total success. Roy’s previous thoughts continued to pound into his head, consuming any thought of logic and reason, forcing each stride forward, each breath in and out of his lungs... Ore had to be in that cart. It had to be. <br />
<br />
*** <br />
<br />
Reaching the entrance of the descending cavern within a few minutes, Roy stopped his movements forward and bent over, placing his hands against his thighs as he let out heavy breathes against the mine floor. Their was no question in his mind that he over did that run. The thoughts of wealth and greed that empowered him began to subside as he tried to catch his breath. Doubt began to take residence again, realizing if he got tired this early into the game, he surely wouldn’t be able to catch up with that damn cart... A slight chill down his spine cut off his thoughts, causing Roy to shake a little. This feeling was all too familiar. <br />
<br />
Taking back the air in his lungs, Roy’s gaze changed from the ground beneath him to the sights that were in front of him. Recalling bits and pieces of this starting point, something was off. At first, he looked towards the outside, concluding conditions were much bitter then before. The outside looked as if some one put a large, blank piece of paper in front of the entrance. Nothing could be seen from the outside. Though there was definitely an outside. The piercing cold winds emitting from the entrance hit at Roy’s bare skin, feeling like it froze him at the touch. Cringing at the frigid winds lashing out at him, he wondered how in the world an icy hell could possibly become twice as hellish as before. It most likely wouldn’t be possible to turn back now unless he wanted to be encased in snow and ice a meter out. Still, something didn’t look right. Ignoring the cold, Roy’s eyes again glazed over the vicinity. Something was off, that was for sure, but what? Examining the area once more, he found the “something” almost immediately this time. He couldn’t believe his eyes. <br />
<br />
<br />
He stumbled towards it, and fell to his knees a few meters away, gawking at it in astonishment. It was a cart. The cart Roy had been in pursuit of, just stopped before the entrance. An angelic choir was singing in the background as a spotlight brighter then any other lamp in the room was placed upon the cart in a holy light... At least in Roy’s mind, considering his fortune of the cart stopping right here instead of out in the bone chilling blizzard. Shaking himself out of his daze, Roy regained his composure and had risen up from the dirt ridden mine floor, looking upon the cart in disbelief. This couldn’t be the same cart considering its speed before, but the similarities were striking. Analyzing the contents from a far, he could see the black powder was lightly covered with snow, reminding him of his previous thoughts of “white powder”. Roy smirked, but quickly set his feelings aside. It was time to start digging. <br />
<br />
Grabbing the bucket he’d been carrying with both hands (biting his fingers at the touch), a smirk turned into a wide grin as his eyes flashed with excitement, most likely turning into dollar signs if he was some kind of cartoon character. Finally the riches he’d been looking for! Now possibly... No. Certainly a few footsteps away, deep within the black mess, crying out to be “saved”. Though abruptly these avarice filled musings were ceased; the object of fascination and intrigue now became an object of shock and awe. The cart began to tremble. <br />
<br />
At first at a slow rate, emitting a quiet creak that was just enough for Roy to take notice, but it quickly sped up, probably even alerting someone hard at hearing at this point. Suddenly powder burst out from its container (the surprise knocking Roy off his feet and right on his ass) and began to rain down upon Roy and the surrounding area. After breaking into a couple coughing fits and shaking off the residue from the queer weather, Roy hastily got up and examined the cart’s innards. Powder remained, no ore was in sight, but more importantly, no device of any sort could be noted that would cause such a strange occurrence. No Pokemon. Nothing. Maybe it was the wind.<br />
<br />
Chills ran down his spine as a gust of wind blasted past Roy, changing the temperature to unbearable levels and snuffing out the lamps around the mine entrance. Before he could even respond to such strange behavior the lamps were relit. The mine warmed up, back to its previous state (being still rather bitter). Just like that, the moment passed. As if it never occurred. What could possibly be the meaning of such bizarre happenings? With the powder being blown in all directions previous, maybe the wind was responsible for such shenanigans? The wind should have picked up from the blizzard storm, so it’s undoubtedly a sound conclusion... <br />
<br />
<br />
“Good Afternoon young lad.” <br />
<br />
<br />
Roy could feel is heart leap right into his mouth and adrenaline pump through him head to toe with this sudden interruption. His body snapped quickly in front of the source of his alarm. Luckily it was a man. Well what else could it be, right? With a glance, the man obviously had a sizable build going. Nothing like the “Wailord” he’d seen previous, but pretty close to uncle Vinny. Then again, he had some pretty thick clothing on and some weird... What are those? Anyways, he’s probably a lot smaller under all that shit. A new thought was processed. Roy didn’t hear him come up to him or follow him for that matter. Such a man of his mass couldn’t be stealthy enough to sneak up on him like that. So how in the world did he?<br />
<br />
“What are you doing here then?” <br />
<br />
With those words, Roy awoke from his pondering daze. He’d been caught! Here he was, his mouth open and his eyes wide with surprise. Not saying a word, not devising any sort of explanation of why he was up here. Just staring at the man stupid. This mine was sure screwing with his mind, and it sure as hell wasn’t consensual. Usually he was quick about these things. Making up phony excuses was almost a hobby back in the slums. Always with degrees of success mind you, but at least they were there. Ready to be used at the moment needed. Now he had to think of something quickly... No matter how wild it was, it was better then his current position of just gawking at the man. Let’s see... Ore... Bucket... Mountain... Got it! <br />
<br />
<br />
“Sorry! Cold really has gotten to me guy!” Roy exclaimed with one of his hands rubbing against his forearm. Keeping his eyes upon the other man’s and forming a cheap grin, he continued his charade. “Why I’m here? Well, I’m up here with my dad and his... er... Colleagues! Ya, doing studyin’ and stuff up here with minerals, but we got separated... The blizzard got crazy and I found this place...” <br />
<br />
Colleagues... Flicking through them channels back then did pay off! Now a back up plan. “Hit the sack and don’t look back” has been a pretty standard trick. Though running out in the frozen apocalypse wouldn’t be such a bright idea. Maybe a nice smack to the noggin. Knocking him out with the bucket would work! All those layers of clothing, he would have no problem going out in the storm. At least hypothetically... Oh and the ore! Yes, the ore! Possibly bundled in that black mass behind him. But what of his silent vow to himself when he left the disaster of his home? To become successful without dirtying himself with the sludge of the past? A little stealing isn’t too bad, but taking the man’s garments and letting him freeze over in this desolate mine? Was it...<br />
<br />
Through all this moral drivel, a question that had been always been left unanswered since he had enter this eerie place had awoken. It needed to be asked. <br />
<br />
“What are you doing here guy? I read that the mines here were abandoned for years...”</span></span></div>

Eager to get out of here before any more surprises pop up, you quickly release Baah to help Phil. The little Mareep blinks curiously, but is quite eager to show its new trainer and teammate what she can do, immediately unleashing a <b>Thunder Wave</b> while Phil rolls into a <b>Defense Curl</b>. The electric attack completely paralyses the small pup, its muscles tightening and leaving it unable to move or even howl, a gurgling sound all that it's able to muster to express its rage over the ambush. Phil then charges forward while still curled in his defensive position, and rams Poochyena with <b>Rollout</b>, effectively breaking the electrical binds holding it still and allowing Poochyeana to <b>Howl</b> its fury. A moment later a Sneasel drops from the mass of rotting vines above, alerted by the distressed cry of its ally, and performs a rather elaborate if not slightly ridiculous series of ninja moves before taking an attack stance directly in front of Baah with an evil glint in its eye and gloating grin of soon to be victory plastered on its face. Baah wastes no time in setting up a <b>Reflect</b>ive Wall before looking worriedly up at you for her next instructions. Cursing the circumstances you wonder if you'll ever be able to get out of here, let alone back to the glade, when a thought hits you.

There are surely forest Pokémon outside who will be willing to protect him so it may be the chance you're looking for. At the same time you're really not sure you want to be separated from him, and so think over possible strategies.

Nincada then scuttles across the floor ready to <b>Scratch</b> your feet to shreds but you're quick to dodge the little bug by dancing around it before backing away. Tweeta quickly flies off your shoulder to sit atop the coffin and watch the events, partly amused by the way Nincada has taken you and Bix totally off-guard, but also partly worried for your safety. While she watches the two of you dance around the small bug who is ferociously protecting its territory, she again notes the sobbing and peeks down the back of the coffin. Whatever she has seen results in her releasing a distressed cry and a moment later she hops from atop the coffin and disappears down the back of it. Wondering what on earth is going on, and what is down there, you soon realise that you're either going to have to defeat the little Nincada or calm it down by convincing it that you're not here to hurt anyone. Either way, you'll need to do something as it doesn't appear ready to give up on its rather vigorous attempts to maul you and Bix half to death any time in the near future...</span><br />

<span style="color: silver"><b><u>Tenorphin</u>: </b>&quot;This stone has been imbued with magical qualities that will trap me here for all eternity,&quot; Mismagius replies, looking toward the stone sitting atop the black marble pedestal. &quot;Its powers are so strong that my own enchantments are unable to break the wretched curse keeping me here, so I'll need you to destroy it for me as it's the only way I'll ever be free. Unfortunately there are no Pokémon strong enough to shatter the stone, so it needs to be taken above ground and smashed with a specific weapon that is housed in one of the crypts in the graveyard. The... <b><i>Rochester</i></b> family crypt.&quot; The distaste with which she practically spits out the name &quot;Rochester&quot; tells you that there is a nasty history here, and you can't help but wonder what kind of evil people they are to have imprisoned this lovely Pokémon down here like this, or even why, but Mismagius' eyes are filled with such misery that you don't dwell on it for too long since you're fully prepared to help her in whatever way you can. &quot;I cannot move it myself, and the curse is so strong that it binds me to the stone wherever it may be so if you take it with you I'll be able to follow and instruct you in how to destroy it properly when we reach the Rochester crypt,&quot; she continues. &quot;I apologise for having tricked you when you first entered this chamber, but I had to be certain you weren't one of the Rochester's coming down here to torture me with their magic the way they do every few decades or so, teaching their children and their children's children to keep up their hateful and wrongful persecution of me.&quot; When Mismagius finishes speaking she turns toward the far wall of the chamber and that's when you notice a stairway leading upward appear out of nowhere. &quot;This will lead us out, but there are guards so we'll have to be quick. We won't win if we stop to fight so we'll have to run, aiming for the exit at all costs.&quot; She stares deeply into your eyes at this point, her mesmerising gaze filling you with pity for the poor ghost. &quot;Are you sure you want to do this?&quot; she asks. &quot;It will be dangerous...&quot;</span><br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Rick smiled happily as Belle once again flung herself into battle, ready again to fight for Rick and avenge the fallen comrades of the hour. Belle once again began to flap her wings rather rapidly, her eyes staring at Nuzleaf with almost an empty expression, the winds being flung forwards towards the Nuzleaf in front of her, who began to harden himself to embrace the attacks coming his way. It was in vain, though, as the super effective gust that followed simply burst past the harden and knocked the grass and dark type onto its rear, looking up with a new-born fury towards the little bee Pokemon. The Nuzleaf picked itslef back up, and quickly began to pelt a large amount of razor sharp leaves towards Belle, who had already began her next attack, circling the opponent rather quickly in order to prepare for her aerial ace attack. The way she moved was as if to taunt the Nuzleaf, who angrily shook its fist at the Combee, who simply grinned, happy to see she was making the Nuzleaf even more infuriated than before; anger can be an opponent downfall. She decided it was the time to attack, and vanished rather suddenly, the Nuzleaf looking frantically around for the insect whom it believed had snuck behind it. It was mistaken, though, and soon the Nuzleaf was smashed hard in the back by Belles attack, the Nuzleaf being flung to the desert floor bellow. The Pokemon yelled angrily, getting up promptly and spitting the sand out of its mouth, before leaping at Belle with its arm outstretched, the pound attack hitting Belle hard on the head. Rick gasped slightly, wondering how the Nuzleaf actually pulled it off. The Pokemon/Trainer team soon noticed that the Nuzleaf was breathing heavy, though, and as such it would probably be a good time to end it. Belle happily nodded to Rick as he looked at her; she wanted to end this as much as he did, and avenge the fallen comrades.<br />
<br />
“Right then Belle, let’s end this. <b>Gust</b> into <b>Fury Cutter</b>, use another <b>Gust</b> to finish it off if needed.” The Combee nodded, all three of its faces now having a very determined look on her face, and turning towards the opponent, getting ready to strike.</span></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Rick watched carefully as Belle sped back in for what would hopefully be the final part of the battle, Belle flying straight in and whipping up what seems to currently be Ricks most favourable move to order, the winds quickly coming out of the Combees tiny wings and flying towards the enemy, an unfortunate Nuzleaf owned by the trainer Jack. The Pokemon attempted to respond by spawning some Razor sharp Leaves, which flung themselves towards Belles gust, which simply knocked the leaves away into the desert around. Nuzleaf wasn’t looking particularly pleased with what was going on, and despite the fact it was barely standing, it wouldn’t allow itself to be beaten, leaping forwards with a Pound attack which smacked Belle hard in the center of her three faces. She was taken aback by this attack, but was still feeling much better than her opponent, Rick assumed, and the onslaught would end rather quickly, Belle sharpening her wings into blade like weapons as she slashed forwards in her Fury Attack, knocking the Nuzleaf straight down to the ground, in a motionless heap. Belle stared cautiously at the Nuzleaf, prepared should it attempt to get up again and continue the fight, but thankfully, that was the end of the battle, the Nuzleaf on the ground fainted, and Belle gaining some well needed experience. Rick stepped back cautiously, eyeing Jack for his reaction, which soon became clear, the man screaming with rage and leaping forwards in an attempt to attack Rick, who stepped back even further, rather pointlessly, however, as Jack wouldn’t be attacking Rick today. No, it was the leader of the Nightbringers who would be having an attempt at Ricks life, stepping forwards to block Jacks path, who eyed daggers at the Nightbringers leader, sulking off to return his Nuzleaf. Once Jack was gone, the Nightbringers leader turned to Rick, half of his face covered, but the rest showing a true grim expression, the malice showing him that it was time to give up the flute, and that Rick would truly be joining his friends in a matter of moments. He held up his hand, and told Rick to hand it over, but Rick was not going to do so without a fight. Two of his comrades had given their lives to protect this flute, their entire futures gone in a moment because of this man and his soldiers. Rick was not going to dishonour their deaths and hand this item to them; no, he was beyond caring for his own life now. If he had to die fighting, so be it. <br />
<br />
But then again…Rick was so heavily surrounded by the Nightbringers now, several of them staring daggers at Rick also. Would his friends have really wanted him to die for this cause like they did? What would they do to his Pokemon once he was dead? Rick closed his eyes and sighed angrily; he couldn’t allow more people to die because of him, but either way there was going to be death. Either the death of him and his Pokemon, or the end of the world. But looking at this situation, the end of the world was inevitable, and would Rick dyeing really affect the scheme of things? He didn’t think so, so he had to reluctantly do what he was certain was the wrong idea, lifting the flute forwards carefully towards the Nightbringers…Suddenly, a large commotion and a number of shouts could be heard from behind Rick, as he quickly pulled the flute back and turned, finding the entire group of Nightbringers being restrained by what looked like some sort of desert tribe, spears in their hands and wearing little clothes. Ricks eyes widened; could these people truly be the mystics who Rick was supposed to bring this flute too? The Head of the Nightbringers suddenly growled, and shot his arm out to grab the flute, but was quickly knocked away by one of the tribespeoples spears, the spear then being positioned inches away from the mans face. They had a staring contest, or at least what seemed like one, for several moments, until the Mystic said rather briefly ‘Summon Him’. Of course, it couldn’t be so simple as to hand the flute over to the Mystics and leave the area…no, he had to do the summoning himself. How perfect. At least, Rick supposed, the Nightbringers head wouldn’t be doing any summoning or wishing today, and Rick had saved the world from almost certain destruction. A good first days adventure, even if death was too deeply involved. He pulled the flutes up to his lips, and slowly began to play, able to do it much louder than previously due to him having no fear of being discovered. Would he succeed in summoning the wishmaker, though, or would he fail and end his adventure on a rather boring and low note.</span></span></div>

<br />
<span style="color: darkorange"><b><u>handymankg2</u>: </b>Thankful that the Mystics have arrived just in time to stop the Nightbringers from securing their victory, but a little miffed that you're not simply being allowed to hand the flute over to its guardians and simply leave, you raise the flute to your lips. It's almost as though the Mystic next to you has been able to read your mind, however, as before you start to play he speaks again. &quot;We do not keep the artifact to summon Him, our role is to guard it from those with evil intentions,&quot; he says, which at least answers one question. &quot;The one who was to summon Him for good is dead, and I will not allow the ones with evil intentions to use it, so that leaves you,&quot; he continues, finally turning his head to gaze deeply into your eyes. &quot;You've unintentionally stumbled upon happenings you had no wish to be a part of and could easily have been tainted by power or greed upon discovering the true nature of the artifact, but have chosen to take neither path. Instead you've tried to protect it which demonstrates the power of good within you. Think about all that has happened, all you have experienced, all you have... <i><b>lost</b></i>,&quot; though he doesn't mention either Ponyta or Reg you know he's referring to them and come to the realisation that all you've fought for today isn't about saving the world, it's about good versus evil and the struggle to allow good to prevail. There will always be organisations like the Nightbringers who will want ultimate power, or individuals like Jack whose inflated sense of self-worth leads them to believe they deserve more than they rightfully do, but there's nothing you can do about that whether you have one wish or a thousand. Good and evil should always be at balance, take away one or the other and humanity is doomed. Today is about making a statement, and that statement is that good will always prevail. &quot;You will make the right decision,&quot; the Mystic finishes, allowing you to continue to perform the summoning.<br />
<br />
Raising the flute to your lips you play it again, this time its crisp, sweet melody playing loud and strong, the calming tune drifting across the desert. Everyone present is mesmerised, gasps coming from the onlookers as a beautiful golden hue begins to drift from the tip of the flute as you play. While you watch it begins to gather in cloud above, and eventually Jirachi itself appears, hovering over you with a sweet smile on its face as it looks upon you. You stop playing, only able to stare at the Legendary Pokémon, before you're broken out of your trance by a loud and rasping voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;And my first wish is for the Mystics and this boy to DIE RIGHT NOW!&quot; <br />
<br />
Shocked, you turn to see the head Nightbringer step forward, his hood swept back to reveal a hideously burned and scarred face, so badly maimed that any resemblance to his former self would be impossible to identify. Only a few wispy strands of white hair remain on his scarred head, and his piercing sky blue eyes are full of lethal vengeance. Your breath catches in your throat as the realisation of the fact there is only one wish to make and that it's just been used to seal your fate strikes you. You wait for it, cursing yourself for not having thought he could beat you to the mark, but instead the Mystic strikes him across the head with his spear eliciting a pained and angry howl from the Nightbringer. <br />
<br />
&quot;Only the one who summons is able to wish,&quot; he says matter-of-factly, his tone much like someone speaking to a small child who really should know better. At this, the remaining Nightbringers who are looking on realise that their time is up and they flee into the night, not once looking back as they put as much distance as they can between their master and themselves as possible. Now that they know they're not in control they're not about to risk themselves for anyone, putting themselves first before they can be struck down by you should you decide to take your revenge. <br />
<br />
&quot;Get out of here. We are not murderers, and have no wish to kill you,&quot; the Mystic says to the head Nightbringer. &quot;Go, but be warned; Should you ever set foot in this desert again, you will not leave alive.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You will pay. Every single one of you will pay,&quot; the Nightbringer growls threateningly. &quot;You will rue the day you met me, and wish that you had Jirachi to end your miserable little lives, for this is only the beginning,&quot; he threatens, being sure to stare hatefully at you before turning on his heel and stalking off into the desert night.<br />
<br />
A moment later, with only you, Belle, the mystics, Jirachi, and the corpses of Reg and Ponyta left on this warm summer night, you can't help but be relived that the threat has passed, yet at the same time quite perplexed as your impending wish still remains unspoken. As all eyes turn toward you, it seems you have quite a responsibility on your shoulders. Whether you go with you heart or your head, you have only one wish to make so you'll need to make sure it counts...</span></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: darkorange"><span style="font-size: 9px">It was almost as if the mystic who was standing besides him was reading all of Ricks thoughts, as he began to speak about the exact thing that his mind was focussing on. <b>“ We do not keep the artifact to summon Him, our role is to guard it from those with evil intentions.”</b> Well, at least that answered one of Ricks questions as to why they weren’t doing it themselves, but he still had no clue why he was doing it, nor really why they just couldn’t not wish when Jirachi appeared for the first time in one thousand years; surely Jirachi, as a Pokemon, would actaully want to do things other than simply be forced into labour by man. Nonetheless, it appeared to be what Rick was meant to do, and he would do it as such. The man continued in the same gruff voice he used prior, saying <b>“ The one who was to summon Him for good is dead, and I will not allow the ones with evil intentions to use it, so that leaves you”</b> Well, that told Rick the answer to his second question as to why it was him, and was just what he expected really. At the word dead, however, Ricks thoughts turned back to the cold and lifeless eyes of both Reg and Ponyta, and shuddered at the thought of their bodies simply lying there to rot. No, he wouldn’t allow that. He couldn’t allow that. He wanted to think more into it, but once again the Mystic spoke, saying <b>“ You've unintentionally stumbled upon happenings you had no wish to be a part of and could easily have been tainted by power or greed upon discovering the true nature of the artifact, but have chosen to take neither path. Instead you've tried to protect it which demonstrates the power of good within you. Think about all that has happened, all you have experienced, all you have... lost”</b> Rick listened to what he said, and actually was slightly shocked at how much the Mystics knew about what had happened. He smiled slightly at the fact he had good within him, and honestly, with all that had gone on today, he found it hard to see the good in anyone, or the world for that matter. Once again, on the word lost he started tracking off with his thoughts, but this time he stopped himself. What had to be done must be done, and if he was so good, surely he would make the right decision. The Mystics words, <b>“ You will make the right decision”</b> just added a slight touch of confidence to the mix, and now he was ready to do it. Ready to summon the wishmaker. <br />
<br />
Raising the flute to his lips, he slowly began to blow into it like before, making sure this time to do it as loud and clear as possible, the melodies coming out flowing and drifting through every corner of the desert, a beautiful golden hue erupting from the end of the flute as he played, floating and forming up above him, until finally the melody had stopped, and the ritual was complete, floating before him what could only be Jirachi. The Pokemon looked like something out of a fairytale, being fairy like in shape, yet letting off such a stunning aura that Rick could barely stand it. The Pokemon itself was a very pale blue colour, and was wearing a yellow hat like attire, the hat having three blue tags strapped on in the center, left and right sides of the Pokemons helm. It had a pair of stubby arms on either side of its small body, and from the back of the neck a yellow cape like item was split in two, one coming out on each side of the Pokemon. It had what looked like a smile on its lower belly, and had a pair of stump like legs. Underneath its black, oval eyes, a pair of blue tear like drops are positioned, staying on the Pokemons face like a form of makeup. Rick continued to stare at the beauty of the Pokemon for a good while, before being suddenly broke out of the trance by a loud rasping voice. <b>“And my first wish is for the Mystics and this boy to DIE RIGHT NOW!”</b> Came the voice, as the leader of the Nightbringers stepped forwards. Rick frantically turned to the mystics, who seemed rather unworried, and calmed down. Obviously they knew something Rick didn’t. Turning back to the Nightbringers leader, Rick began to realise why he usually wore a hood. The mans head was horribly scared and burned, so far so any identification of who the man once was would be impossible. He had only a few wispy strands of hair left, and looked at Rick with a gaze of deep loathing, only to be hit on the head with a spear by one of the Mystics, who said <b>“Only the one who summons is able to wish”</b> To which Rick sighed in relief, and any remaining Nightbringers not being restrained quickly fled the scene, leaving as promptly as possible. <br />
<br />
Soon, the head mystic asked the head Nightbringer, Raven, Rick seemed to remember, to leave, and after a few death threats, the man left, storming off into the desert. Rick gulped; all eyes were once again on him, including those of Jirachi, and he had to make his wish. But what to chose. So much had gone on today…so much was wrong in the world…so much death. Rick stopped thinking there. That was it; death. He couldn’t think of any one thing that would save the world, but he could save the worlds of one or two people; the people who fought so hard to stop this wish from going into evils hands. Standing up straight, Rick proclaimed loudly “I wish that the two people that helped retrieve this flute and lost their lives, Reg and the young Ponyta killed fairly recently, will regain their life.” Rick stopped. Did he phrase it right? He didn’t want them to end up like zombies, which is something that he has seen happen before in various medias (but not real life, of course). He just figured, that if he made the wrong choice, he hasn’t made things any worse for the world; he’ll only have let down himself and the Mystics, but still have thwarted the plan of one organisation.</span></span></div>

We won't win if we stop to fight so we'll have to run, aiming for the exit at all costs.&quot; She stares deeply into your eyes at this point, her mesmerising gaze filling you with pity for the poor ghost. &quot;Are you sure you want to do this?&quot; she asks. &quot;It will be dangerous...&quot;</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver">Mismagius was telling Shou about a stone that has magical power so strong it will trap Mismagius for eternity when Shou followed her gaze to a stone on top of the black marble pedestal in the middle of the room. Shivering lightly, Shou wondered if his strength was enough to help Mismagius, since even a Pokémon famous for enchantments couldn't break the curse. Unless, it was supposed to be destroyed physically.<br />
<br />
True enough, Mismagius told him about shattering the stone with a specific weapon above ground, meaning if he could get above ground and to the place with the weapon, anyone will able to shatter the stone and break the curse trapping Mismagius. Keeping quiet, Shou listened all the instructions Mismagius has to tell, while Cantare was happily flipping about occasionally repeat what Mismagius said verbatim. According to Mismagius, there was a crypt by the Rochester family, which the weapon needed to break Mismagius' curse is hidden. Sensing the distaste Mismagius has when she mentioned the name &quot;Rochester&quot;, Shou's frontal lobe, as well as auditory and visual cortex collaborated and became significantly active to show Shou some wild images of what could have happened before to Mismagius and the Rochesters.<br />
<br />
Realising himself spacing out, Shou snapped out of his vivid imaginations and return to Mismagius' miserable eyes. Telling himself to start working, he asked, &quot;How do I get to the crypt, then? I can't shatter it if I don't have the weapon, moreso if I can't get out of here.&quot; Cantare squawked and chanted, &quot;Get to the crypt, get ripped, get whipped. Shatter the weapon, shatter, chatter.&quot; Shou stifled the urge to ask Cantare where he learnt that from and ignored Cantare's nonsensical chants. &quot;I cannot move it myself, and the curse is so strong that it binds me to the stone wherever it may be so if you take it with you I'll be able to follow and instruct you in how to destroy it properly when we reach the Rochester crypt.&quot; Mismagius said, and Shou nodded in comprehension. Mismagius continued with her apology about tricking Shou and turned around, approaching the wall at the other side. Shou's eyes threatened to jump out of their sockets when he saw a stairway that wasn't there before.<br />
<br />
With a warning about resistance to guards be futile, Mismagius fixed her eyes on Shou's. &quot;Are you sure you want to do this?&quot; Mismagius asked. &quot;It will be dangerous...&quot; Calculating the risks, Shou figured if the guards are able to catch up, he would use something to distract them, and continue fleeing. &quot;Lead the way.&quot; Shou answered Mismagius, feeling not very certain, but want it over with. Shou, holding the stone, ascended the stairs with Mismagius leading the way. The stone is somehow light enough to be carried around despite being able to disable Mismagius' locomotion. Feeling curious and a bit awkward with the silence, he asked, &quot;Why did those Rochesters trapped you in here?&quot; Hoping Mismagius is in a sharing mood.</span><br />
<br />
I hope this last few sentence wouldn't count as self-update. I didn't describe anything about the staircase, and it's only sensible with Mismagius leading Shou. The stone part seemed like a logical explanation too. </span></div>

<span style="color: silver"><b><u>Tenorphin</u>: </b>Taking the stone you nod, agreeing to help Mismagius and telling her to lead the way before following her up the stairway. While you're walking you ask Mismagius why the Rochesters had imprisoned her to begin with, but before she has a chance to respond the staircase begins to darken while the low and constant sound of humming increases in intensity. &quot;RUN!&quot; she cries, hurrying forward, and without a second thought you do as she says, racing along the hallway as fast as your legs will carry you while strange object fly around your head and waves of energy pound the walls and floor around you. Several times you feel as though you're going to be knocked off your feet, but you keep stumbling along, your heart pounding, until you eventually burst into another chamber with several ghosts present, none of them wanting to allow Mismagius to escape. A Haunter, Gastly, Duskull, Sableye, and Shuppet block the exit ahead, Mismagius firing off several <b>Dark Pulse</b>s in different directions and two directly at the ghosts ahead causing them to scatter and leave the entrance unguarded. &quot;Stop for nothing!&quot; she cries again. &quot;Head only for the exit!&quot; Considering you have no wish to be battling a multitude of ghosts, most of whom are a lot stronger than your own Pokémon, you don't need Mismagius to be telling you to get the hell out of here because neither you or Cantare want to be here at all. With your path clear you don't even look at your surroundings, focusing your gaze only upon the doorway that will lead you out of this chamber, and racing as fast as you can with Cantare zooming along beside you, you both streak through the door and into another long hallway where you can see the soft glow of moonlight at the very end of the tunnel. It's sloping upward, and as you proceed along it hear a massive explosion from behind before Mismagius comes rushing out of the chamber after you. All three of you rush toward the light before bursting out into the graveyard, but it seems you've not escaped yet. Cantare squawks loudly, his surprised cry stopping you dead in your tracks as you notice him drop to the ground, and turning around find a lone Shuppet staring at all three of you, apparently injured though you're not quite sure how, but still hell-bent on stopping Mismagius' escape. &quot;Leave it!&quot; Mismagius screeches, her voice a little hysterical with the glorius feeling of freedom now so close within reach that she can practically taste it. &quot;The Rochesters will have been warned, we must reach the crypt before they arrive!&quot; Cantare hops to his feet, a little dazed from the <b>Night Shade</b> that had caught him off-guard, but very annoyed and fully prepared to fight the little cretin that had surprised him like that. He squawks angrily and hops toward Shuppet, waiting for you to issue him with attack orders so he can teach it a lesson. &quot;Let's go!&quot; Mismagius urges, not wanting to waste precious minutes on a worthless battle when she is so close to being set free of the odd stone you are holding...</span><br />

<br />
<span style="color: darkorange"><b><u>Desert of Illusion</u></b> - Please reply in <b>darkorange</b></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorange"><b><u>handymankg2</u>: </b>For better or worse, your wish has been made, and while all eyes turn to Jirachi you're left feeling quite nervous while you watch and wait to see whether or not your wish will be granted. Jirachi's eyes well with tears, the beaming smile upon its face showing it's not upset about your choice, for if anything it appears the Wish Pokémon is deeply touched by your selfless act. It first moves to hover over top of Ponyta whose lifeblood has been spilled out onto the desert floor, the cold steel dagger still embedded in its chest. In the same moment that the dagger begins to glow with psychic energy, a single teardrop falls from Jirachi's eye. The entire scene seems to take place in slow motion as the dagger slides out of the baby equine before falling upon the sand, Jirachi's tear then landing upon Ponyta's open wound which begins to repair itself before finally sealing shut to leave a small star-shaped pattern behind as a lifelong reminder that the brave and selfless little fire horse has been touched by Jirachi. You watch intently, looking for any signs of life returning to its body when Ponyta's glazed eyes begin to darken, its legs twitching, before it blinks once, then twice, and finally raising its head to look around. Your heart fills with joy, the soaring sense of elation something that is indescribable considering the circumstances, and a moment later Ponyta is on its feet, relief clearly visible in its eyes when it sees that Jack and the Nightbringers are nowhere to be seen and that you remain unharmed. It nuzzles your arm affectionately before staring up at Jirachi in awe, the legendary Pokémon smiling down upon it before making its way over to Reg in order to complete your wish.<br />
<br />
Everyone follows, gathering around Reg's crumpled and lifeless form, his blood staining the desert sand after having flowed from a deep cut to his throat. To think the man you had first loathed and feared would turn out to be one of the good guys whom you'd go so far as to make a once-in-a-lifetime wish to bring back to life is ironic to say the least, but after the events of the last two days you're finding that nothing can ever be taken for granted, especially life itself. This man had sacrificed years of his life to infiltrate and destroy an organisation whose evil intentions would have lead to centuries of death and misery on a worldwide scale for humans and Pokémon alike, only to have been brought down right at the very end. Though Reg may himself see this as a failure, the fact he'd entrusted the flute to you, and that the Nightbringers had been stopped, albeit under different circumstances, this in itself shows that he had made the right decision and that he is about to reap the ultimate reward for his sacrifice. Jirachi smiles upon Reg, a single teardrop falling from its eye to land upon the centre point of the cut, the tear then spreading out along the length of the wound. Again, you watch while it is magically repaired, a single star-shaped pattern being left behind at the base of Reg's throat where the teardrop had initially fallen. To wish upon a star and be touched by Jirachi is a great privilege indeed, and for the second time this night you watch while life returns to the eyes of another brave and selfless being. He stands, his awe-filled gaze upon Jirachi who is smiling back at him, before he looks to you and the flute still in your hand and whispering, &quot;Thank you&quot;.<br />
<br />
The head Mystic steps forward and embraces Reg, thankful his friend is alive and well. Over the next half hour the events of the night are replayed, for Reg has many questions regarding what happened following the moment he was killed, and while the humans talk you notice Ponyta and Belle playing with Jirachi. Seeing them interact with the Legendary Pokémon like this is a magical feeling, and you wonder what it must be like for Jirachi, a Pokémon so sought after yet so elusive, to have very little opportunity to interact with others, to be able to relax and simply play with no expectations upon it. Watching it now, laughing and giggling while the three play innocently, you can't help but think it must have a very lonely existence. A short while later, the three Pokémon return to the group, Jirachi's expression sad as it is now time to say goodbye. Everyone gathers around while Jirachi looks upon each and every person present, thankful to you all for having given it the opportunity to perform a good deed. A golden cloud forms around it, and in the same way that Jirachi had drifted from the tip of the flute, it now returns to it, the golden hue disappearing inside of the artifact. A part of you doesn't want to give it up, wanting to take care of the Pokémon for eternity, but another part of you is glad to be handing it back to its rightful guardians. Protecting Jirachi is a very big responsibility, and not one you'll be able to carry out for the next hundred years let alone the next thousand, and so you pass it to the Mystic who accepts it graciously. &quot;You've shown great integrity here tonight, and have made a decision that will benefit the lives of many in the future,&quot; he says with a smile. &quot;Be safe, and be sure to call upon us should you ever need a favour&quot;. He then hands you a stone which you look at curiously as it looks no different to any other small rock laying in the desert except for a small <a href="https://img43.imageshack.us/img43/4945/mysticsymbol.gif" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fimg43.imageshack.us%2Fimg43%2F4945%2Fmysticsymbol.gif&amp;hash=8fbd3a37a372ddcbc50e12ed88d6b108" rel="nofollow noopener">symbol</a> on its surface. &quot;Speak to it, and we will hear.&quot; You examine it carefully for a moment before looking up again, but the Mystic and the rest of his tribe are gone, vanished into thin air... <br />
<br />
A little later, exhausted from the day's events, you and Reg decide to camp here for the night before continuing on your separate ways in the morning. Settling into one of the abandoned Nightbringers tents, you both stretch out, glad to be finally able to rest. You watch while Belle settles on Reg's chest, the little pang of jealousy you feel at seeing your Pokémon take to another human quickly passing as you realise it's just her way of saying thank you to the man who had helped you both get through this alive. It's quite likely neither of you will ever see him again after tomorrow, so it's not exactly like he's stealing away her affections. Just as Belle as settled with Reg, Ponyta has settled with you, both Pokémon wanting to be close to the person they have bonded with for just one night. Ponyta lays next to you, and as you fall into a deep and peaceful sleep, you feel its breath against your arm, and the warmth radiating from it's body. Placing your hand on its chest and feeling its heart beating rhythmically, as well as hearing Reg's steady breathing from the other side of the tent, you can think of nothing better that you could have wished for.<br />
<br />
Waking to a bright and cheerful morning, you stand outside the tent with Reg, Belle, and Ponyta, ready to move out. The two Pokémon appear deeply saddened by the fact they're about to part ways, and Ponyta steps away from Reg's side to walk over and say goodbye, nuzzling your hand affectionately. &quot;It really likes you,&quot; Reg says with a meaningful smile. &quot;You do know this doesn't need to be goodbye?&quot; Gazing into Ponyta's eyes you wonder about asking it to accompany you, but you're sure it'll want to return to its family and are sure Reg will reunite it with them, but when you look up at him his face is grim. &quot;It's an orphan now, I saw its parents killed in the village,&quot; he continues sadly. &quot;When you saw me take down that Rapidash, it was only seconds after we'd both seen the parents slaughtered by one of the Nightbringers. The Rapidash would have gotten itself killed trying to take the Nightbringer down, so I knocked it out with Blastoise before it could get itself killed...&quot; Not quite knowing what to say you gaze at Ponyta again. This certainly does place a different light on the matter, but what if Ponyta would like to return to its herd? Hmm...</span></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver">Still walking without any slowdowns, like some people will do when they are asking questions, Shou waited for Mismagius to answer him. It was quite an awkward moment that made Shou slightly regretting asking that question. A split second later which seemed like hours for Shou, when Mismagius looked as if she's ready to talk, the light along the staircase dimmed to barely noticeable. At Shou's disdain, the humming that has been ignored some time ago intensified to the point it's unbearable. Shou took out his ear plug and stuffed it in his ears just after he heard Mismagius cried, &quot;RUN!&quot; Shou was taken aback by the shout and lagged behind by a second. Cantare, meanwhile, started to speed over with Mismagius, and Shou caught up a few split moments later.<br />
<br />
Panting, Shou miraculously dodged a few flying objects from behind as his leg threatened to fall off of intense running. Another ball of energy slammed just beside Shou, which he responded with a surprised yelp. Stumbling over some damaged tiles, Shou kept his balance and was thanking Arceus for letting the attacks missed him. Cantare and Mismagius was a few steps in front, passing through the obstacles like light through glass. Unable to keep track of the time he spent running, Shou found himself rushing into another chamber. Unlike the first few he'd had in this underground, Shou finds himself being targeted by several ghost Pokémon, none of them seemed to be in a helpful stance. <br />
<br />
By the looks of it, those ghost Pokémon, including a Haunter, a Gastly, a Duskull, a Sableye, and a Shuppet aren't some pushover that can be easily defeated. They were standing in a &quot;Defender&quot; formation, and the use of it is being quite obvious: They wanted to prevent Mismagius from going out. Firing off several rounds of Dark Pulse everywhere, including two that is targeted towards the ghosts, Mismagius hastily rushed towards the exit, leaving behind extraneous command of fleeing, which Shou intended to do without Mismagius saying so. Charging across the room, Shou didn't pay attention to the details in the chamber, instead just focused on Cantare and the exit. Practically tackling open the door, Shou and Cantare whizzed to the other side of the door, which Mismagius seemed to follow after mere seconds, after leaving what sounds like a massive explosion in the room that Shou has no intention to find out.<br />
<br />
Cantare squawked at this point of time, &quot;Moon, light, moon, light...&quot; Shou turned around from the door to look at where Cantare was looking at, and there he saw it, the soft silver glow of moon lighting the rest of the tunnel, inviting Shou and Cantare to go back above ground. With Mismagius bursting through the door, Shou slammed it shut and proceed to race to the top of the tunnel, hoping to end this nightmarish adventure. As the exit neared Shou and Cantare, he felt as if he never breathed his whole life. The air fresh without the underground grimy smell, the view clear all around, and the sound of crickets filled Shou's heart with chilly delight.<br />
<br />
As if it was being pulled underwater, Cantare suddenly squawked in panic. As he dropped to the ground, Shou turned around to see a lone Shuppet, although somewhat injured, but still determined to keep Mismagius back. &quot;Leave it!&quot; Mismagius sounded a bit frenzied as her freedom was being so near, yet she was still being intercepted. She proceeded to warn Shou about the Rochesters being notified about them. Cantare, recovering from the Night Shade attack, hopped upright and against Shuppet who had fired him the unexpected attack, looking as furious as a tiger being disturbed from its sleep. Never seen Cantare as furious as this, Shou felt that Cantare should have his revenge. He turned to Mismagius, despite her urging them to leave, and said, &quot;I'm sorry, but this will be quick, I promise.&quot; Shou turned back to see Cantare shaking in infuriation. &quot;Cantare! Use <b><span style="color: Gold">Twister</span></b> to disorient the Shuppet, and then <b><span style="color: Gold">Ominous Wind</span></b> to reduce its HP!&quot;</span></span></div>
