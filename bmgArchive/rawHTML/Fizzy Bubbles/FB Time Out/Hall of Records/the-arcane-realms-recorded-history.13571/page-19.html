Concerned that helping these forest PokÃ©mon may be too big a task considering your inexperience, Phil's expression makes up your mind in an instant. Without even stopping to try and find out exactly what the precious leaf is for, or why it is so dear to the PokÃ©mon of the forest, you take off into the trees at high speed before you can lose the trail of the dark types that have stolen it. Phil is hot on your heels, and while you occasionally lose sight of the Murkrow flying ahead of you as the thick canopy blocks your view, you soon catch sight of them again, altering your course to match theirs until you eventually enter an area of the forest that seems darker than the rest. The trees are old and withered, and even though there is a sparse canopy above there doesn't seem to be as much light here. It's been close to an hour since you began this reckless chase, and just as you're beginning to think you'll collapse from exhaustion and lose sight of the Murkrow altogether you see them descend next to what appears to be the tallest tree in the forest not too far away. Thankful that you can finally take a break you stop to catch your breath, both you and Phil taking a drink from your water bottle before moving on. Knowing that you're close now and that you'll more than likely have a welcome party awaiting you, you take it slowly and carefully, not wanting to alert any of the dark types to the fact you're approaching. Finally coming across an enormous tree in the forest you can only stand and stare at it, for it's so out of context with anything you'd expect to find in a place like this that you're not sure what to make of it. This tree has to be ancient if its size is anything to go by. It's at least twenty metres wide and hundreds of metres tall, but it's not so much the age of the tree that is an issue, but the fact there is a face staring back at you from its trunk. Your stomach feels as though it's doing backflips as you stare at it, for the image doesn't appear to have been carved into the tree, it's as though it's a part of it, but the most disturbing aspect of it all is that it bears a striking resemblance to the legendary PokÃ©mon, Darkrai. Its mouth is gaping open creating an opening for you to enter the tree itself, its eyes seeming to be boring right into you. Not a single leaf lives on this tree, all of its branches long dead, much like the area of forest surrounding it. You look down at Phil to see that he's giving it the same horrified look you were, the little Phanpy shivering with fear. You can both feel an evil presence here, and while you're wondering if you should continue on with your quest to help the forest PokÃ©mon, or turn and run pretending you'd never seen anything at all happening in the forest today, you hear a voice say, &quot;I wouldn't do that if I were you.&quot; Startled, both you and Phil jump, spinning around to notice an aged Chatot sitting on a dead tree branch behind you. Its expression is filled with deep sadness and you find you can't help feeling sorry for the poor little thing...</span></span></div>

<br />
Pokemonxd4: Having inspected the murals of Groudon, legendary PokÃ©mon of the Earth, and Kyogre, legendary PokÃ©mon of the seas, you decide to follow the doorway opposite to the one you came in, expecting to see a similarly detailed and beautiful mural of the legendary PokÃ©mon of the skies and the final member of this trilogy, Rayquaza. As you go through the door though, no such mural is immediately apparent and you instead come to a spiral staircase of marble, which, like much of the tomb, is inlaid with gems and gold which tempt you and Wipeout in the manner of all forbidden treasures. <br />
<br />
As there seems to be no other option, you step onto the Spiral staircase and begin to ascend, Wipeout jumping onto your back and holding on to save himself the effort. You continue to plod upwards around and around the spiral staircase. After a while, you look up to try and see if there is a clear end to the ascent, and it is then that you notice for the first time that running along the bottom of the staircase youâre walking up is the mural of Rayquaza, uncurled, long tail twisting around and up into the air above you. Following the staircase for one more revolution, you reach a dead end in mid air, the stairs ceasing and leaving you suspended about 50 feet up in the air on the penultimate step.<br />
<br />
At the end of the staircase is the end of the mural, Rayquazaâs head painted on a stone slab with a beautiful attention to detail which you and Wipeout cannot help but admire, running your hands along the cold stone of the great Leviathanâs head. Wipeout is admiring the eyes of the Legendary dragon, which are set with chunky Emeralds which shine even brighter than those seen in the legendary duo before. Bounding forwards, Wipeout cannot help but grab hold of the Gem despite orders to the contrary earlier on, small hands grasped around the gem, which does not move but begins to glow a brilliant white.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px"><b>Clunk</b></span><br />
<br />
You gulp at the ominous noise as the gem is twisted and look around to see what has been triggered- nothing is immediately apparent until you look directly down and realise that the staircase youâre standing on is slowly rising up into the air, leaving the ground behind it. The gem flashes as the ascent speeds up, taking you upwards and coming to rest with the stairs leading into a darker room a good hundred feet above the floor you were until recently attached too. Trying to gaze into the room ahead, you cannot see a great deal at all, and Wipeout isnât helping in hiding himself and his tail flame in your arms.<br />
<br />
What now?<br />
<br />
<br />
RP Feedback: This update was a marked improvement on your last, in quality as well as length. I particularly like the fact that you RP your own thoughts and actions separately to those of your Pokemon, showing the separate personalities. Keep it up.</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Gold">As Zack walked up the staircase he saw that the stairs looked like Rayquaza and jumped thinking it an actual pokemon. After he realized it was just a long mural he started thinking *How would these people have made such detailed murals? These titans wouldn't have just sat down and posed for this. This one would've taken months or even years. the other two would've taken weeks. It's a complete mystery to me.*<br />
<br />
As Zack thought about this Wipeout was looking at the mural too. Wipeout seemed to think that this mural would come to life and attack them so he hid his face behind Zack. ack noticed this and said &quot;Don't worry Wipeout it's just a mural. It won't do anything.&quot; However Zack was dead wrong. When they reached the top they stopped as they saw Rayquaza's head as the end of the mural.<br />
<br />
It was more beautiful and amazing than the other two combined. It was detailed to the last scale. He got down and marvelled at it. Wipeout couldn't help but get over it's fear and look too. Zack was now even more puzzled. *How would they have gotten this much detail unlesss they were right up against Rayquaza when they did this?* He was even tempted to take some of the Emeralds with him but knew that that could ruin the mural and decided against it. He looked around and saw no other way to go so he wondered what he was supposed to do. Maybe the emeralds were the treasure.<br />
<br />
As he wondered Wipeout got closer to the mural. He was completely hypnotized into staying there by the Mural's brilliance. He was so hypnotized he forgot about what Zack said and grabbed the Emeralds of the eyes that shone brighter than the other murals. Zack saw Wipeout about to grab them and shouted &quot;Wipeout, wait!&quot; but Wipeout had already grabbed it. When Wipeout grabbed it though it didn't come out but it started to glow white.<br />
<br />
Zack jumped up and gulped as he looked down and noticed the stairway was rising. Wipeout noticed this as well and grabbed on to Zack. Zack sighed and thought *I know Wipeout trusts me a lot but he is getting way too clingy.* When the stairway stopped moving Zack saw a dark room in front of him and Wipeout. He pulled Wipeout from his arms and put his tail in front of him to light the way and entered the doorway to see what was inside.</span></span></div>

Phil is hot on your heels, and while you occasionally lose sight of the Murkrow flying ahead of you as the thick canopy blocks your view, you soon catch sight of them again, altering your course to match theirs until you eventually enter an area of the forest that seems darker than the rest. The trees are old and withered, and even though there is a sparse canopy above there doesn't seem to be as much light here. It's been close to an hour since you began this reckless chase, and just as you're beginning to think you'll collapse from exhaustion and lose sight of the Murkrow altogether you see them descend next to what appears to be the tallest tree in the forest not too far away. Thankful that you can finally take a break you stop to catch your breath, both you and Phil taking a drink from your water bottle before moving on. Knowing that you're close now and that you'll more than likely have a welcome party awaiting you, you take it slowly and carefully, not wanting to alert any of the dark types to the fact you're approaching. Finally coming across an enormous tree in the forest you can only stand and stare at it, for it's so out of context with anything you'd expect to find in a place like this that you're not sure what to make of it. This tree has to be ancient if its size is anything to go by. It's at least twenty metres wide and hundreds of metres tall, but it's not so much the age of the tree that is an issue, but the fact there is a face staring back at you from its trunk. Your stomach feels as though it's doing backflips as you stare at it, for the image doesn't appear to have been carved into the tree, it's as though it's a part of it, but the most disturbing aspect of it all is that it bears a striking resemblance to the legendary PokÃ©mon, Darkrai. Its mouth is gaping open creating an opening for you to enter the tree itself, its eyes seeming to be boring right into you. Not a single leaf lives on this tree, all of its branches long dead, much like the area of forest surrounding it. You look down at Phil to see that he's giving it the same horrified look you were, the little Phanpy shivering with fear. You can both feel an evil presence here, and while you're wondering if you should continue on with your quest to help the forest PokÃ©mon, or turn and run pretending you'd never seen anything at all happening in the forest today, you hear a voice say, &quot;I wouldn't do that if I were you.&quot; Startled, both you and Phil jump, spinning around to notice an aged Chatot sitting on a dead tree branch behind you. Its expression is filled with deep sadness and you find you can't help feeling sorry for the poor little thing...</span></span>

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: LimeGreen">The forest was bleak, quite a few times Alex almost lost the trail. Setting Phil down to hide behind a fallen log, Alex peered over to examine the area ahead. The new clearing looked empty, a lone tree stood above the rest, it reminded him of the odd ones described in the Book of World Records. Seeming safe, the pair started to walk towards the tree, when suddenly, a strange whirring sound was coming from Alexâs pocket. Reaching into the pocket, he pulled out a vibrating pokedex. He flipped open the lid and it beeped while speaking, âRequested item received, press the button to examine.â Startled, Alex almost threw the technology on the ground, in fear of being found, and out of sheer surprise. <br />
<br />
âWell, Phil, looks like we got ourselves a new friend,â quietly told Alex. He pressed the button as commanded, and a small red and white capsule materialized in his palm. Pressing the new button, the pokeball expanded, and opened revealing a strange red light. The light traveled onto the ground next to Phil and took the shape of a small sheep. The Mareep, small and blue with fluffy white wool, stared around, a little phased by her new environment. âWelcome, Baah, I donât think this is the exactly appropriate time to meet, so, Iâm going to return you into your pokeball.â Baah silently returned into her pokeball; she appeared to understand. <br />
<br />
Creeping forward, Alex and Phil crawled towards the large tree. Arriving at the footstep, Alex heard a quiet squeal from behind. Turning around, Alex noticed that Phil had made the noise who was fearfully transfixed towards the doorway. Looking up, Alex saw what had scared his partner; the top of the doorway contained a sinister etching of Darkrai into the tree. Growing up, Alex was told many stories about this creature. Darkrai could control nightmares, and this made all sleepiness release from his body. Unsure about if this should be fun or completely dangerous and crazy, Alex started to stand up and walk into the doorway when,<br />
<br />
âI wouldnât do that if I were you.â<br />
<br />
Spinning around ready to yell at who he thought was scolding him, his expression quickly changed to pity when he stared at the creature not human. A small, withered Chatot sat on a dying branch behind the two. Patches of grey feathers were scattered along the parrotâs body. It solemn face projected immense sadness, and Alex almost cried. Phil feeling sorry, wobbled under the branch, and extended his trunk in a kind gesture. Not wanting to bother the bird, Alex spoke, âThatâs ok, Phil, no need for that,â then addressing the Chatot, âIâm not wanting to ignore you, but I really need to find something, and Iâm really sure it is in there, could you maybe explain why?â</span></span><br />

The description says that there is a fog at night, but it doesn't say at what time you arrive. Also the tree.

<br />
Arriving at the graveyard on the outskirts of Mediville, you glance across the rows upon rows of headstones lining the neatly cropped lawn. The sun is setting, a slight chill creeping in as pretty colours streak the sky at what is the end of yet another long day of travelling. Cantare's antics are starting to grate on your nerves as weariness settles in, and although this seems an unlikely place to find shelter for the night you have a feeling you're doing well considering all of the travels you have ahead of you. Noticing a line of crypts along the eastern edge of the cemetery, you hope to find at least one of them open so that you're able to to stave off the elements for the night and begin to walk toward them. You've only taken several steps, however, when you suddenly feel the ground give way beneath your feet. Cantare starts squawking up a storm, but his panic is nothing compared to yours as grotesque visions of falling into the grave of a human or PokÃ©mon fill your head. Though it seems like an eternity, a moment later you hit solid ground, relief flowing through you when you realise you've not fallen into a grave but into what appears to be an underground tunnel. It must be at least twelve feet deep, and thanking your lucky stars that you've not broken any bones call for Cantare to come join you since you have no hope of climbing back out again. A few minutes later, with Cantare sitting nervously on your shoulder, you're mulling over which direction to take as the tunnel you're standing in appears to lead into pitch darkness at both ends. The sun finally sets above ground, the little light you did have all but vanishing as it's replaced with the very faint glow of moonlight. Not at all liking the choices you have you can't help but wonder why on earth you'd chosen to visit a creepy old cemetary when you should have been searching for a PokÃ©mon Centre that could at least offer you a warm bed for the night. With only three apparent options available you mull over them quickly. One, stay put and scream your lungs out hoping someone will hear and come to your rescue. Two, take the tunnel to your left which leads into pitch black silence. Or three, take the tunnel to your right which also leads into darkness, but from which is emitting a faint humming sound. Hmm, curious...</span></span>

<i>You're right. Eek! I won't do it again. And thanks for the update. ^^</i><br />
<br />
Shou yawned as Cantare continuing his endless mimics. As he was stretching, he noticed, at the back of his eyes, that there were some crypts along the east edge of the cemetery. Shou signalled Cantare to come with him, and started walking towards the crypts, secretly wishing that one of them was left open. Then, at least he can have his first night outside of hometown without worrying the rain or something creepier. He was counting his seventh step when he felt himself stepping on a piece of weird feeling ground. As he shifted his weight, the world fell apart. Well, not really, but the piece of ground that Shou stepped on collapsed and Shou fell in, with Cantare noticing a split second later and start squawking nonsensical sounds.<br />
<br />
Shou's head spun around, and he was on the edge of vomiting split pea soup. His mind was filled with dead people and pokÃ©mons and coffins when he slid down the big hole created by him. When he finally hit ground, which seemed like an eternity to him, he thanked his lucky stars for it. &quot;Oww, my butt...&quot; He said painfully while loudly calling his Chatot to his side. &quot;Note to self: Never land on butt when sliding. Thank Dratinus I didn't break any of my bones. Cantare! Come down please! I can't climb up there!&quot; With that Shou saw a shady Chatot entering the hole while chanting, &quot;Climb up there. Climb up there.&quot;<br />
<br />
While Shou was waiting for his Chatot to land on his shoulder, he looked around to identify his surroundings. It was apparently a tunnel, and by the looks of it, it was disastrously long. It stretched towards both left and right, and was only faintly lit, at that spot, by the moonlight that starts glowing not long ago. Shou wondered, <i>What is it that have gotten into me that make me choose to come to a creepy chilly cemetery instead of a warm PokÃ©mon Center?</i><br />
<br />
The tunnel seemed oddly big for an underground tunnel that can go unnoticed yet supporting all the tombs, headstones, and visitors everyday. <i>It must have been new</i>, Shou thought. <i>That or I'm being extremely unlucky today.</i> He looked up at his entrance hole again, deciding between staying and wait for help the next day, climbing back up even if it meant a few fruitless hour wasted, and going to either end of the tunnel.<br />
<br />
Anxious and wanting to get out, Shou decided to walk towards the end of the tunnel and hopefully find a way out. It was then he noticed the faint humming coming from his right side of the tunnel. It sounded like a refrigerator hum, but at the same time it sounded like a hummingbird or a mosquito. Shou hesitated, thinking it would mean either treasure or danger. He wasn't very keen on going on a death trip. The other end, on the other hand, does not emit any sound. Stuck undecided, Shou asked Cantare who was on his shoulder, &quot;Which way do you think we should go?&quot; expecting a joyous &quot;We should go! We should go!&quot; Shockingly, Cantare stayed silent. Shou was frowning and he turned his head to look at the silent Chatot sitting on his shoulder.<br />
<br />
Looking somewhat excited mixed with furious, Cantare gave a sharp yell, hopped off Shou's shoulder and started flying towards the right side of the tunnel at high speed. &quot;Why does he always do this? Wait up!&quot; Shou grumbled, yelled and gave chase to his pokÃ©mon who had disappeared into the humming darkness.<br />

<br />
<span style="color: darkorange"><b><u>handymankg2</u>: </b>Reacting instinctively as the last thing you want is any of these men finding the hidden chamber, you instruct Belle to create a distraction. With two of the men already walking out of the room she only has one left to target, and as he reaches down to lift the urn covering the spring mechanism she whips up a <b>Gust</b> of wind that has his grip on the urn he's already carrying slip. He curses loudly as he fumbles the object, completely forgetting about the one he was about to lift in his haste to retain his grip on the one he's fumbling. While he's juggling the urn Belle returns to your side, appearing innocent as ever, and by the time the man has managed to secure his grasp on his prize, he has absolutely no idea that he'd just been played. &quot;On second thought, I'd better get this one out first. These winds comin' outta nowhere, it's kinda creepy,&quot; he mutters, glancing around the room uneasily. &quot;You sure you can manage that on your own?&quot; he asks, and after receiving a nod in return he grunts and leaves the room, leaving you standing there with Belle and Ponyta, all of you relieved to see the back of him. After waiting a few minutes to ensure all three men are gone you once again move the golden urn away from its position in the corner, once again watching as the hidden doorway opens to reveal a chamber beyond. Slipping inside you find yourself standing in front of a pedestal upon which lays a maroon cushion. Stepping closer you see that a golden flute embedded with sapphires has been placed upon the cushion, and having absolutely no doubt in your mind that this is the artifact the men are looking for, waste no time in reaching out and taking it, placing it in your backpack for safekeeping. Realising the men may become suspicious if you return without the urn you weigh up your options. You can leave the urn and hope one of them doesn't return to collect it which will lead to them discovering the chamber, or you can take the urn so they don't return for it and in the meantime hope that nobody else decides to search the temple. There isn't anything in sight with which you can replace the urn's weight upon the spring mechanism, so it seems that no matter what you do you're going to have to hope they stay away. Feeling that taking it with you is safer than leaving it here, you lift it up and carry it out of the chamber, heading back to the entrance.<br />
<br />
Some time later, out of breath and sweating from the strain of lugging the heavy golden relic, you emerge from the temple only to find that more time has passed than you'd thought. It's night time, the darkness lit only by the moon above and the flames leaping from a campfire in the centre of the village. Unfortunately you're also greeted with the unwelcome company of those who have not yet finished pillaging this village, and while a couple of them eye you strangely with others avoiding eye contact, you feel an instant state of dread fall upon you. Something in their actions is telling you they've discovered you're not the real Jack, but none say anything to lead you to conclusively believe this is the case. Any hopes you had of escaping into the desert have been crushed for the time being, and as the man you recognise as being the driver of the jeep you'd passed in the desert earlier approaches, you wonder if you'll get out of this at all. &quot;C'mon Jackie, we're campin' here for the night!&quot; he says jovially, grabbing you by the arm and leading you toward the campfire. &quot;We only have one more day left to find the artifact so we're gunna resume our search at first light. But now, we're gunna celebrate trackin' down these Mystics and the power we'll have when the ritual is performed tomorrow night.&quot; He leads you to a fallen tree beside the campfire, ensuring you sit down before he plants himself firmly beside you. &quot;It's here Jackie, I can feel it,&quot; he says, eyeing you closely. &quot;Perhaps closer than we think.&quot; While Belle huddles close to you on the log you can feel Ponyta nudging you in the back. You can sense its urgency to get as far away from here as possible, but for now you know you're stuck right where you are. The only positive that can possibly come out of this is finding out what this lot is up to, and looking for an opening to escape, but for now you'll listen and learn because really, what other choice do you have?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Rick sighed quietly as the distraction worked its magic, the man who was attempting to help Rick with the urn leaving to help the others, giving Rick ample time to get ready to look inside. He waited a few minutes to make sure he couldnât hear any footsteps, and that nobody would come back and interrupt him halfway through his search. Waiting patiently, he then turned round to the urn and began to lift it out of the way, putting it on the ground as the familiar sound of the door opening began once again, the gap in the wall appearing and ready to go into. Smiling down at the Ponyta and Belle, he received a cautious glance back by the three headed bee, but nonetheless Rick decided he should go inside, as after all, he didnât want the thugs to come back for the urn when âJackâ doesnât come out with it, and then find the treasure hidden amongst the ruins, did he? He walked into the doorway, looking carefully around the interior with a chance to see it more clearly than prior, and Rick found it wasnât a particularly large or treasure filled place; all it contained was a Pedestal with a purple cushion on top. Surely the cushion couldnât be the treasure, right?<br />
<br />
Glancing down at the cushion, Rick noticed what was sitting on top. A beautiful golden flute embedded with glistening blue sapphires. Surely this must be the treasure they were after, right? Smiling down at it, he picked it up and carefully placed it in his backpack, making sure it was perfectly okay and not going to be visible by the men. Rick let out a sigh of relief. He had done what was needed, and has received the treasure. All he needed to do now was escape somehow from the town, but how he would do so would be a different story entirely. For now, he just needed to get out the temple. Slowly mulling over whether to take the urn or not, he looked around for anything visible to take the weight in the temple. Figuring it would probably be simpler to just take the urn, he did so. Why would anyone come back to the temple after it was empty, anyway? Walking out and carrying the heavy urn, he made his way back to the temple door.<br />
<br />
Emerging from the temple, Rick saw that much more time had passed than he originally thought, and the only thing that Rick could see was the light of the campfire in the village, and something he had hoped he wouldnât have to see straight away. The assaulters of this village, many of them eyeing Rick, and some avoiding eye contact completely. Rick gulped, this probably meant that they had figured out something about Rick that they shouldnât off. Perhaps they had even figured out he wasnât Jack. Walking along, as any hopes of escaping were now gone, Rick found himself grabbed by the driver of the jeep, who pulled Rick along and sat him down by the fire. Rick assumed that it was the fire that was making him hot, but it could well be the fear that was rising in the back of his throat. As he spoke, Ricks face really began to whiten; he knew the treasure was close. He knew Rick had it, that could be the only thing, it must be, right? Rick guessed heâd have to just sit and listen for now, as he had no means of getting away at this point.<br />
<br />
He had several escape plans in his mind, the one that seemed most likely to Rick was that in the morning, just after dawn (He would take shifts with his Pokemon to watch the bag overnight), he would sneak away from the men, and ride Ponyta away to find wherever the mystics are. This seemed to Rick the only way he would personally escape, but he had other means of the flute escaping. Should the men close in on Rick (assuming they know he has the treasure), he would throw his backpack to either Combee, who would fly off with it, or Ponyta, who could run away. He guessed considering their large Pokemon from before he would have little chance though. Of course, there was always the possibility of the three of them sneaking out to the jeep and driving away while they werenât looking, but heâd need the keys for that, and prying them off the jeep driver didnât seem to be that appealing a task.</span></span></div>

<br />
To all of my peeps, just letting you know that I have a work function on tomorrow evening so it's unlikely I'll be home early enough to get an update out. I'm aiming for Friday though, so fingers crossed there are no other distractions. I'd also like to add that you're all doing really well which helps me with the updating as you're making it an enjoyable experience and I'm looking forward to seeing your adventures through to the end. Well done ^-^.<br />
<br />
Friday night edit (11:04pm): Sorry guys, but I can't finish these tonight although I have made a start on them. I had some reports and stat paperwork to finish off tonight for my RL job, it's getting late, and I have to work tomorrow. After work I have a birthday dinner to attend (can't really get out of it since it's mine <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite7" alt=":p" title="Stick Out Tongue    :p" data-shortname=":p" />), and if I don't get some sleep soon I'll be a total zombie by Sunday and sleep the day away. I'll make it up to you next week ^-^.</span></div>

Kori Gotcha: Heading down towards the lake with Kiera and Torchic, you stroll along the path looking into the sky. Itâs mid afternoon now, but the temperature is pleasant and the wind is a cool occasional breeze. In short, itâs a beautiful early summerâs day and what better way to spend it than down by a lake with some friends. The lake in question approaches fast and you note that it is a reasonably large, clean freshwater lake, surrounded by a good amount of greenery, shrubs and grass neatly kept by the locals who frequent the lake on pleasant days such as this.<br />
<br />
Kiera turns to you as your trio stop on the lakefront. âWell then, if weâre hunting PokÃ©mon, weâd better go round the other side of the lake. This side tends to be too busy with people, the bustle means that the PokÃ©mon tend to stay on the far bank or in the bushes behind the water. I reckon that would be our best bet.â She says to you, and you nod, her local knowledge proving invaluable as the two of you walk round the lake clockwise, giving you plenty of time to observe the activity around the league. PokÃ©mon are clearly thriving around the lake, and you can see a few bird and bug PokÃ©mon in the undergrowth around the banks, hiding from each other and from people.<br />
<br />
After a good while walking, you reach the far side of the bank. On this side, the bushes and plants are a little thicker, although still reasonably tidy, and the water is a little deeper on this side, with the tell tale darker patches in the water betraying the location of a school of fish PokÃ©mon to a Wingull, which you can see circling a way out into the lake. Moments later, you get a rather grim reminder of the circle of life when the Wingull swoops down and plucks a Finneon from the surface of the water, flying off over the trees and towards the horizon with its prize.<br />
<br />
Turning back to the party, you notice that Kiera was not watching that spectacle and instead was untucking something from her belt. âNow that weâre out of the way, itâs time I got it out really isnât it?â she says softly.<br />
âEr...what?â you ask, confused.<br />
âMy PokÃ©mon, silly. I thought you were curious to see her?â and with that Kiera removes the PokÃ©ball from her belt, presses the button in the centre and drops the ball, which explodes on the ground.<br />
<br />
âChiiiiic!â comes the cry from Torchic as he dashes over to greet the new arrival, which forms up from the light as a small rodent-like Pokemon with a long nose. <br />
âCyyyyyndaquil!â Kieraâs Pokemon replies, leaping forwards to play with her fellow fire type. The two of them bound around, sniffing each other and firing small embers at one another playfully as the two of you watch on.<br />
âI think they get onâ says Kiera<br />
âFire attracts fireâ you reply as they continue to roll around. <br />
âStill, weâd better have a look for a wild Pokemon or two, thereâll be plenty around.â<br />
<br />
RP Feedback: Again, not much I can say, some very good work from all three updates. Just to apologize for the time it took me, I hope it will be considerably less next time.<br />

<br />
<span style="color: LemonChiffon"> The pair and their Pokemon soldiered onward through the thick grass, Kori smiling every time he saw the two fire types playing with each other and getting along. Kori reached into his back pocket and pulled out a Pokedex. He pointed it at the Cynaquil and listened for the analysis.<br />
<br />
âCyndaquil. The Fire Mouse Pokemon. Cyndiquil are normally timid in nature and are usually found hunched over. When frightened, Cyndiquil will shoot flames from itâs back which intensify when angry.â said the Pokedex.<br />
<br />
Kiera looked over at Kori and said âWow! Thatâs a fancy gadget you got there!â She said regarding the Pokedex. Kori handed over the Pokedex to Kiera to show her. âYeah, my brother told me about these. They basically pocket sized encyclopedia with information on just about every pokemon out there. Check it out.â he said. She started pressing the buttons, flipping through the electronic pages and looking through the information each page had to offer. âGeeze,â she said âthe world of Pokemon is much bigger than I ever thought. Thereâs so much information on just Cyndaquil alone.â she said. <br />
<br />
âHehe, I know. This alone makes being a trainer all the more exciting.â Kori said smiling. He knew the feeling that Kiera was getting, the desire to see everything that was out there, the rush of finding out all about a new Pokemon and then finally being able to train it, even though Kori was a newbie trainer himself, he had experience handling Pokemon back on his families farm, this experience was completely new to Kiera, so the feeling mustâve been that much more intense for her. She handed the Pokedex back to Kori, her eyes glowing, scouring the land, the air, the lake behind them for all of the possibilities that now lay before her. <br />
<br />
âCome on Kori, thereâs a bigâole world full of Pokemon and I hear them callin out to us even more than ever now. I can feel it, something is just waiting for us right around the corner.â she said. Cyndaquil and Torchic rushed up to their masters, Torchic by Koriâs side and Cyndaquil by Kieraâs side. They looked at each other and smiled.<br />
<br />
âTorchic chic chic tor!â <i>It looks like our humans are having fun!</i> <br />
<br />
âQuil! Cyn da cynda, Cynda quil cyn.â <i> Yeah! Iâm so glad, Kieraâs never had more fun before!</i> agreed the Cyndaquil.<br />
<br />
âChic chic chic, Tor chic!â <i> Letâs do our best then. </i> cheered Torchic.<br />
<br />
âCynda quil!â <i> For sure.</i> nodded the Cyndaquil. The 2 humans and the 2 fire type Pokemon marched through the brush, for lack of better words, more fired up than ever. The cool air blew behind them as if pushing them forward to destiny. <br />

Fuuten: Making the split-second decision to hide and observe the passing of the cart, you dive into the darkened corner, pushing yourself right up against the wall and trying to moderate your breathing at the same time. The click-click of the metal wheels against the tracks draw ever closer and your grip tightens on Grimerâs PokÃ©ball, a degree of fear creeping into your throat- the fear of the unknown. Crouching, you try to angle your head to see a little further down the hall, and you see the top of the cart emerging into your eye line. It seems a pretty simple design, wooden slats nailed together neatly, although it looks like itâs somewhat less than brand new.<br />
<br />
As the cart passes you, you are able to see that it is around three-quarters full of a thick, black powder which looks not unlike crushed coal or carbon. There is a sheet partially over the top of it, but it doesnât cover the powder fully as you get a good view. Not exactly the treasures and gems that you had in mind, but itâs something and a sign that the mine is still in use. Distracted by the contents of the cart, it takes you a few moments to realise the strangest thing about the Cart, but when you do it is so blindingly obvious you have to steel yourself not to thump your own forehead for your stupidity.<br />
<br />
<i>The Cart is driving itself</i>...<br />
<br />
Or at least, nobody seems visibly to be pushing it, in fact there is nobody in sight at all. The Cart is simply moving uphill of its own accord, despite showing no signs of being motorized. While you sit, contemplating the strange event youâve just witnessed, the cart rolls on past, out of sight, back upwards from whence you came earlier on. <br />
<br />
Sitting in the darkened corner, you sit for a short while, considering your next move, before standing up and dusting yourself off- the floor of a mine is not the cleanest of places to stay for too long, and your trousers now seem to be covered in soot and grime, as it the bucket- you lean around the corner to look down the pathway. The sound of the cart is distant behind you now, and there doesnât seem to be another following it as far as you can hear. From here then, you face another decision- to head on down into the mine to see where the Cart came from or to chase after it back from where you came shortly before and try and investigate what was going on. What do you think would be best?<br />
<br />
RP Feedback: Again, really good work from you, Iâm impressed, considering you didnât have much to work with. Canât really say much more.</span><br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: LightSteelBlue">Sounds of the assumed ascending cart moving towards Roy continued to fill his ears with a high pitch ring with each second that passed. The ringing though was only secondary to the pulsing of his heart, hastily pumping the blood through his rigid and almost comatose body. Beads of sweat began to form around his scrunched up forehead (turning cold within seconds in the crisp mine), running sluggishly down towards eyes focused and narrow on the tracks that lay before them. These eyes feeling strained, Royâs vision began to blur in and out a bit, as the tension of the situation increased his grip upon the sphere carrying his slimly companion to the point of turning it into pieces. Fear was obviously a factor in Royâs unusual behavior. Fear of the unknown. Fear of decisions that could not be undone. Fear of his time and suffering being wasted upon trudging up this godforsaken mountain to be kicked out, caught, killed, dismayed, whatever this hand of fate would deal him in the form of this unknown entity clashing against the metal tracks closing in... <br />
<br />
<br />
A quick shake of the head returned him to his senses. Saying this was the worst situation he has been caught up in would be an outright lie. Thoughts of his earlier experiences came back to him. These memories dwelled within the back of his mind, but now resurfaced, bringing back cringing pains, betrayal, and dreaded sights. But they also brought forward confidence. Heâs survived worst. The terror he felt previous was just down right silly. The cold must of been toying with his head. <br />
<br />
Lessening his grasp upon the Pokeball, mussels of stone, unmoving and unchanging in the past moments, began to awaken from their terror stricken slumber. Maneuvering their movements quickly (but in silence and still in a crouched state), eyes once in pain now looked on forwards at sights found by new positioning. Now much more relaxed, but still very pensive, Royâs eyes peeked out of his dark hiding place, fixed upon the roaring beast charging him below. <br />
<br />
Fortunately this âbeastâ was a cart like hypothesized. A cart simply made of wooden staves nailed methodically together, curiously looking older compared to the wooden beams in the mine itself. Zooming past Royâs location, the contents could be seen clearly. Black powder filled above the brim of the wooden cart cover loosely by a sheet, but was rather ineffective as powder remained visible in Royâs position. Contemplation quickly commenced. <br />
<br />
Thoughts of the black powder gave way to the lack of any valuable ore being possibly harvested within the mine. This put a damper upon Royâs metaphorical parade, as this black âshitâ (as Roy called it), would most likely wouldnât be of any value in small amounts. Even if he filled the bucket currently in his presence, profit would be very minimal compared to any ore that could have been obtained. Plus his âcontactsâ wouldnât most likely would take any black powder. White maybe, black not so much. What ever this black stuff was and the value it could possibly possess, it was most likely going back to Royâs previous starting point, moving up... Moving up... Moving? <br />
<br />
âWhat the fuck?â Roy bellowed, bewildered at one moment and frantic at the next, quickly slapped his hand against the top of his mouth as his voice echoed through out the cavern. Quickly turning his head below, not a spectator was in sight, but Roy couldnât take chances. Staying still and silent for a moment to catch any unexpected guests answering his call, thoughts sporadically sprang up about the cartâs magical moving properties. <br />
The cart was unmanned, at least it looked that way. So being pushed was obviously out of the question. Not a motor or any mechanism was visible upon the vessel to assume mechanical motivation of the cartâs upward momentum... What the heck is moving that cart? Was the black powder magical or something? The cart sentient? Nothing made sense! <br />
<br />
âTime to check out what the hell is happening in this joint, but first that weird ass cart...â <br />
<br />
Roy once again checked the path below of any unwanted company and stood up after all that crouching. He could hear the cracking of his legs as they returned to a stance he was most comfortable with. Returning Grimerâs Pokeball to his belt, his arms now released the kinks that had accumulated within the mussels and bones within, stretching the ligaments in an outward motion. After the necessary exercise, Roy noticed soot and grime had taken its place upon his snow pants and the inside of the bucket. Attempting to wipe off the new found disgust, he brushed off his legs, sleeves and even patted down his hair lightly to make sure this new grimy pest (other then the one in his Pokeball), took their leave off any part of Royâs being. <br />
<br />
Realizing the cart had made its way far from Royâs current sight, he knew he had a ways to go to catch up with the mysterious moving object. Scooping up the bucket beside him, he checked a THIRD time of anyone giving chase towards his person and began to ascend to the place once he came in a quick sprint. The lights of the oil lamps filled his sight again, much brighter now as he had placed himself in a darken place a few minutes ago, he stuck to the side of the cavern as not to draw attention of another cart possibly with a passenger on board. As his eyes adjusted and his breath began to get heavy, Roy wondered if this never ending race upon this damn mountain would ever cease.<br />

<br />
<span style="color: limegreen"><b><u>OrangeDonphan</u>: </b>The Chatot's words are surprising, not only because it's speaking properly rather than simply mimicking something it's heard, but because it's warning you not to enter the ancient tree. It stares back at you for a few moments, an aura of deep sadness completely surrounding it, before it finally responds to your question.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;This glade is the heart of our magical forest, the ancient oak the vessel in which Celebi's sacred life force is to be protected for all eternity. For many centuries the power of good, hope, and happiness has radiated from here, but a year ago the evil PokÃ©mon Darkrai sought to steal Celebi's life-force and destroy the forest, turning it into a haven of darkness for himself and his minions. Those loyal to Darkrai entered the ancient oak, waging war against all who fought to protect the life-force, including myself. The battle lasted days, but we were outnumbered. Our final act was to transfer Celebi's life-force into the original seed that was planted to grow this great tree, for as long as it survives then we still have hope. We were interrupted during the transference, however, and were unable to complete it. The orb containing half of the life-force was stolen, while my allies were able to escape with the seed containing the other half. The orb has been imbued with dark energy which is slowly radiating out into the forest and killing everything in its path. It's taking far longer than Darkrai had hoped and is why his minions have been hunting down the sacred seed, for once they have it they will be able to completely destroy Celebi's life-force and complete their mission. Today my allies were to perform a ritual that will purify the orb, but the seed was stolen before the ritual could begin. Once the two life-forces are reunited, we will lose all hope of ever saving our forest...&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Chatot stops speaking, its gaze returning to the ancient oak. If what Chatot is saying is true then it's only a matter of hours, if that, before the two halves of Celebi's life-force are merged. If this happens they'll have exactly what they want, and this beautiful forest of mystery will turn into a dark and evil wasteland. You notice forest PokÃ©mon gathering around the tree, all of them fearful yet at the same time determined. It appears none of them are prepared to allow Darkrai's minions to succeed in their mission to destroy Celebi's life-force, and though they realise a dangerous and lethal battle is at hand, are prepared to die to save their home. Knowing that your own PokÃ©mon are far too inexperienced to stand a chance against the powerful dark types that will surely be awaiting you, you also realise that stealth is something that you can use. If these PokÃ©mon can keep the dark types occupied, you may be able to retrieve the two halves of the life-force yourself. The only question is if you feel you're ready to take part in such a dangerous mission...</span><br />

<span style="color: silver"><b><u>Tenorphin</u>: </b>It appears Cantare is more in the mood for action as opposed to deliberation, the only choice you really have in the matter being to chase your over-excited parrot into the darkness leading toward the low humming you can hear in the distance. Eventually stumbling through total darkness and hoping you don't trip over something and break your neck down here where no help is likely to find you, a couple of minutes later you find yourself emerging into a small, dimly lit chamber. The walls are made of large concrete slabs. Moss is growing in the cracks between each one, while the natural scent of earth fills your nostrils. This place feels old, and although there is nothing that directly leads you believe that it is you have a niggling feeling that this place has been here far longer than the cemetery itself. The humming is louder here although it seems to be coming from somewhere beyond this chamber which means there could be a path leading back to civilisation if you can find something that will give you a clue as to how to get out of here. The flame from a single torch protruding from the wall on north-east corner of the room casts shadows around the chamber, and although you're quite certain that both you and Cantare are alone in here, some of the shadows are quite unnerving at times as you see strange shapes flickering in the corner of your eye. Upon closer examination you find that there is nothing in this chamber at all with the exception of a single etching in the wall, and bending down you squint at it, trying to make it out.<br />

<span style="color: darkorange"><b><u>handymankg2</u>: </b>Knowing you can't escape while all eyes are on you, all you can do is try and act like you belong, and sit there quietly, your mind reeling with possible courses of action should you need to act quickly. With a rough plan sorted out you listen to what the men are talking about, and over the course of the next hour learn that the name of the man keeping you under his watchful gaze is Reginald, or &quot;Reg&quot; as most are referring to him, and that he appears to be the leader of this group. The most unnerving part is that they all appear to be only one division of a much larger organisation known as &quot;The Nightbringers&quot;. The purpose of this organisation is to destroy all governments in the land and take control as the ultimate world power. The artifact they're searching for is apparently a mystical instrument that is said to summon Jirachi, the Legendary PokÃ©mon who is said to have the ability to grant any wish for just one week every thousand years. Putting all of the pieces of this puzzle together your mind starts spinning with horror for if these men do manage to summon Jirachi and have all of their wishes granted, they'll be indestructible when carrying out their plans for world domination. Listening intently you also discover that tomorrow evening is the anniversary of Jirachi's last visit, and is why they're so intent upon retrieving the artifact at all costs. Knowing that you're in possession of the item they need, and intimidated by the power that it holds, you're under no illusion regarding the fact these men will not hesitate to kill you to obtain it should they discover it to be in your possession, and come to the swift realisation that you need to get yourself out of here and fast. Eventually they settle in for the night, going to sleep around the campfire one by one, even Reg settling in by the campfire and giving you a meaningful stare before he closes his eyes and also drifts off. Settling down as well, with both Ponyta and Belle keeping close at all times, you wait until you can hear Reg's deep, steady breathing before making any kind of move to leave. It feels like forever while you wait as you don't want to make any move to escape while even one of these men may be awake, and as you're starting to drift off yourself you feel Ponyta and Belle gently nudging you awake. You raise your head slowly and carefully, gazing around at the sleeping group before rising to your feet. Slinging your backpack over your shoulder you slip off into the night, stealthily putting as much distance as possible between yourself and the campfire. When you're far enough away for Ponyta's galloping not to disturb the sleeping group, you stop to mount the nervous equine while Belle hovers anxiously by your shoulder, constantly looking back to ensure you're not being followed. Unfortunately, just as you're swinging your leg over Ponyta's back a sadistic laugh causes your heart to sink. So close, yet so very far... Looking up you see the form of a boy who is the spitting image of yourself emerge from the darkness, a cocky grin on his face. &quot;Didn't think you'd get away that easily, did ya?&quot; he drawls, raising a wooden object to his lips. A deep sense of dread overpowers you, because you know that if he blows that horn then any chance of escape you may have had will surely be lost...</span></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Rick began to listen actively to what the men were saying; gaining as much information as possible before leaving is vital if he hoped to ever find the mystics, or find out what the flute would do, for that matter. Waiting hopefully, Rick listened as he soon found out a lot of useful information about where the flute was from, and what its use would be to the burly men. First of all, Rick was informed of the name of the driver, Reg, and found that he was in fact the leader of the group, something that didnât really surprise Rick after the way he had been acting lately towards Rick. Rick was quite upset to find that they werenât just a one off gang of thugs, but actually, a small division of a large group known as The Nightbringers. It was unnerving to think that there were more of these people, ready to take over the entire world should Rick make one little mistake, and this certainly wasnât doing his confidence and bravery any favours, as Rick very much valued his life. Continuing to listen, he finally found out what the purpose of the flute was; it was a summoning tool Supposedly able to summon Jirachi, this tool would provide a wish for whoever wanted it, and Rick dreaded to think what these people would wish for with the flute. It certainly wouldnât be anything good.<br />
<br />
Further listening revealed that Jirachi would grant any wish, but only for one week in every thousand years, the only time that the Pokemon would awaken from its slumber. And the most worrying part, that was tomorrow, the start of the week of wishes. Putting the puzzle pieces together in his mind, he soon worked out that with an entire week of wishes, the group would be absolutely indestructible power wise, able to take over the whole world, with no resistance, and make the necessary wishes to make sure nobody would ever be able to take the world back from them again. Rick shook slightly, and quickly put his arms up to pretend he was somehow cold, and unlikely story but the best he had to cover it up. Rick had the artefact, and surely the group must know it, otherwise why would they force him to stay here like this? He knew that come tomorrow, he would be dead meat unless he somehow got out of there fast, flute in hand. He abandoned all other plans, and decided to simply sit it out. Regardless of how tired he was, he would just wait for them all to settle down, and then run for it.<br />
<br />
And so he did, waiting for the entire group to drift off, slowly, one by one. Eventually, even Reg began to drift off, loosening his grip on Rick and allowing Rick to actually be comfortable. Comfortable for a sleep perhapsâ¦Yawning, Rick began to slowly close his eyes as he prepared for a well deserved sleep. His eyes opened only a second or two later, however, as he was being nudged by Ponyta and Combee. Of course, he needed to stay awake, or otherwise how would he escape? Realising everyone else had drifted off, Rick slowly pushed himself up, and slinging his backpack carefully over his shoulder, as to not make so much noise, he headed slowly out of the campsite, stealthily putting much distance between himself and the almost put out fire. When he finally thought he was a far enough space away, he slowly began to mount Ponyta, carefully getting ready while Combee anxiously fluttered nearby. As, however, one leg came over his steed, a nearby sound diverted Rick attention.<br />
<br />
Turning round, he saw the spitting image of himself walking out towards him, laughing and speaking to Rick. He then pulled out a horn, and put it to his lips, laughing all the while doing so. Rick stared angrily at the whistle, and then whispered to Belle anxiously. âRight, we need to get that horn away from him. Rapid Fire Bullet seed at the horn, hopefully knocking it out his hand, or hurting his hand enough for him to stop it. Then, follow up with a Gust to get the horn as far away from him as possible, and a second gust to his legs in order to knock him over.â</span></span></div>

A haunting graveyard where the spirits of PokÃ©mon have been put to rest. At night a thick fog hangs in the air while the restless spirits of those PokÃ©mon with unfinished business rise from the grave, looking for closure that often never comes.</span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Silver">MTC gazed across the desolate landscape, it was eerily quiet, at least as far as he could see and hear, he wasn't exactly the most observent of people. What a great start to his first adventure, wandering aimlessly into a possibly haunted graveyard. This had to be the work of a genius! At least, in his own mind it was. <br />
<br />
&quot;Creepy? Check! Ominous? Check!&quot;<br />
&quot;Pants wet?&quot; interjected the small psychic Pokemon, speaking sarcasticly through the young boys mind before he could finish.<br />
&quot;Still working on that,&quot; he retorted dryly, raising an eyebrow at his less than tame Ralts.<br />
&quot;Remember, only crazy people talk to themselves, so that would be rather accurate of you to do so.&quot;<br />
<br />
The small psychic type, green-pumpkin hat and all wandered beside the trainer doing his best to grab every oppertunity to add his own little remark whenever he could. Being a psychic type he was very good at this sort of thing indeed. Even so, MTC was growing used to small white Pokemon's back-talking and usually would find something to say back, though the boy would normally get the short end of the stick especially as the psychic-type's wit was far sharper than his own. Not only that but the small Ralts could sense any incline of fear and use it against him. Though the two didn't exactly get on very well there was an odd type of respect the two had for each other though neither of them would like to admit it.<br />
Today was the day, the day the name MTC would no longer be used as an insult. He was determined to proove to everyone back home that he wasn't just some worthless coward, he wasn't yellow, or pink for that matter. Taking a few steps forward he pushed any regrets as far back into his mind as possible and plowed blindly forward, a hint of vigor in his steps. Hoping that he wouldn't ironicly trip on something, fall flat on his face and ruin the moment.<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver">Sorry these are a little short but I was on the last couple of lines of the second of two quite lengthy updates when we had a blackout and I lost everything. I guess it's my own fault for not saving my progress, but as it's getting quite late now I don't have time to rewrite them in as much detail so I'll be cutting them short. On the bright side though, it'll give you more to think about for your reply as there will be less detail to reply to. Have fun ^-~<br />

<b><u>The Graveyard</u></b> - Please reply in <b>silver</b></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: silver"><b><u>Coel</u>: </b>Although an eerie graveyard is the last place on earth you would have liked to find yourself, especially after only having recently set out on your first adventure, you're not about to let Bix's sarcastic comments get you down and continue walking along with purpose as though this is exactly where you knew you'd end up and where you want to be. Being very in tune with your emotions, however, the little Ralts is well aware of the fact this place is making you quite uncomfortable and soon stops the banter as he's not exactly thrilled with the vibe of death and misery radiating from here either. It's late afternoon and in a couple of hours the graveyard is going to appear even less welcoming than it does now. While you're walking, you notice a boy of about five crouching outside of one of the crypt doors along the eastern edge of the cemetery with an Electrike. He's whispering to the little electric pup who is listening intently to its master and appears to be quite excited by his words. You also notice a girl of about thirteen kneeling by a headstone several rows down who is wiping tears from her eyes as she lays a bouquet of flowers in front of it. A few other people are leaving the grounds as it's getting quite late now and a distinct chill is settling in, and as you're wondering if you should perhaps leave as well to search out some shelter for the night you hear a &quot;Psst!&quot; coming from somewhere nearby. Looking around you see the boy next to the crypt looking at you before whispering, &quot;Hey, mister!&quot; Wondering what he wants you walk over and the boy grins at you. &quot;Mister, I need you to guard this door. It's hiding inside and will escape if I leave but I'll sneak back after bedtime so don't let it out ok?&quot; Just then the girl you'd noticed earlier approaches. &quot;Kevin! Come on, we have to go home now,&quot; she calls, looking you up and down curiously. &quot;Please excuse my brother,&quot; she says by way of apology before taking Kevin's hand. &quot;I'm sure he's been filling your head with stories of dangerous ghouls, but I can assure you he's just a boy with an over-active imagination. You know how kids are.&quot; As she leads him away with Electrike trotting alongside them, she looks back over her shoulder. &quot;See you around if the ghouls don't get ya!&quot; she laughs, before they disappear from view and leave you standing there wondering what they're talking about. Dangerous ghouls? Hardly. But then a loud crash from inside the crypt causes both you and Ralts to start. Looking at each other, you wonder if you should perhaps investigate. Kevin did ask you to stand guard, after all...</span><br />

<span style="color: darkorange"><b><u>Desert of Illusion</u></b> - Please reply in <b>darkorange</b></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorange"><b><u>handymankg2</u>: </b>With absolutely no intention of allowing Jack to alert the others to the fact you're about to escape you issue your instructions to Belle who is quick to respond. Just as the horn reaches the boy's lips, he's assaulted with a barrage of <b>Bullet Seed</b>s that pelt his face and hands. Jack yells with surprise, your new concern being that the ruckus he's making may be enough to wake his sleeping comrades. The surprise attack has bought you a few precious seconds, however, and as Jack's face contorts into a mask of rage Belle sends a strong <b>Gust</b> of wind hurtling towards him. He fumbles the horn, dropping it before stooping to pick it up only to be met with a <b>Tackle</b> from Ponyta who sends him reeling face first into the sand. Jack's scream of rage echoes across the desert and within seconds you hear shouts, your heart sinking as you realise his allies are on their way. With no time to think you race over to Ponyta while Belle flaps her little wings madly, <b>Gust</b>ing the gritty desert sands into Jack's eyes. He screams, scrabbling to his feet whilst attempting to shield his eyes which are watering heavily. Belle swoops over, taking her place in front of you as you scrabble to mount Ponyta as quickly as possible. Although Ponyta is young, it's also very fast and knows this desert well. If there is any chance of escaping these men at all then this little fire horse is your only hope. Just as Ponyta sets off, however, you feel something heavy hit you from behind before feeling yourself being pulled to the ground. In his heightened state of fury, Jack has launched himself at your back, dragging you down to the ground with him. You both land with a painful thud and, winded, it takes you a moment to react which is all Jack needs to yank off your backpack. <i>&quot;Back off!&quot;</i> Jack yells furiously, warning his cohorts off with a raised hand. They all stop dead in their tracks, watching the scene unfold. &quot;This one is mine...&quot; he drawls, holding up your backpack while staring at you with malice through red, glazed eyes. &quot;I have a feeling you have what we're looking for,&quot; Jack says slowly, eyeing the backpack. &quot;If you co-operate now and give us what we want I'll spare your life, but if I have to take it forcefully then I'm afraid it's game over for you and your friends...&quot;</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: limegreen"><b><u>Forest of Adventure</u></b> - Please reply in <b>limegreen</b></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: limegreen"><b><u>OrangeDonphan</u>: </b>The Chatot's words are surprising, not only because it's speaking properly rather than simply mimicking something it's heard, but because it's warning you not to enter the ancient tree. It stares back at you for a few moments, an aura of deep sadness completely surrounding it, before it finally responds to your question.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;This glade is the heart of our magical forest, the ancient oak the vessel in which Celebi's sacred life force is to be protected for all eternity. For many centuries the power of good, hope, and happiness has radiated from here, but a year ago the evil PokÃ©mon Darkrai sought to steal Celebi's life-force and destroy the forest, turning it into a haven of darkness for himself and his minions. Those loyal to Darkrai entered the ancient oak, waging war against all who fought to protect the life-force, including myself. The battle lasted days, but we were outnumbered. Our final act was to transfer Celebi's life-force into the original seed that was planted to grow this great tree, for as long as it survives then we still have hope. We were interrupted during the transference, however, and were unable to complete it. The orb containing half of the life-force was stolen, while my allies were able to escape with the seed containing the other half. The orb has been imbued with dark energy which is slowly radiating out into the forest and killing everything in its path. It's taking far longer than Darkrai had hoped and is why his minions have been hunting down the sacred seed, for once they have it they will be able to completely destroy Celebi's life-force and complete their mission. Today my allies were to perform a ritual that will purify the orb, but the seed was stolen before the ritual could begin. Once the two life-forces are reunited, we will lose all hope of ever saving our forest...&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Chatot stops speaking, its gaze returning to the ancient oak. If what Chatot is saying is true then it's only a matter of hours, if that, before the two halves of Celebi's life-force are merged. If this happens they'll have exactly what they want, and this beautiful forest of mystery will turn into a dark and evil wasteland. You notice forest PokÃ©mon gathering around the tree, all of them fearful yet at the same time determined. It appears none of them are prepared to allow Darkrai's minions to succeed in their mission to destroy Celebi's life-force, and though they realise a dangerous and lethal battle is at hand, are prepared to die to save their home. Knowing that your own PokÃ©mon are far too inexperienced to stand a chance against the powerful dark types that will surely be awaiting you, you also realise that stealth is something that you can use. If these PokÃ©mon can keep the dark types occupied, you may be able to retrieve the two halves of the life-force yourself. The only question is if you feel you're ready to take part in such a dangerous mission...</span><br />

<br />
âIt appears as if he was reading a diaryâ¦,â thought Alex.<br />
<br />
âThe orb containing half of the life-force was stolen, while my allies were able to escape with the seed containing the other half. The orb has been imbued with dark energy which is slowly radiating out into the forest and killing everything in its path.

<br />
It was like all of those fairy tales of good against evil. The good, Celebi and its forest kingdom, had been attack by Darkrai, the bad. Now that Darkraiâs minions had stolen the second half of the safely concealed Celebi, the entire area could be destroyed. âWoah,â stuttered Alex while trying to comprehend the situation. Weighing his options, he realized this would be the biggest choice of his life up to now. If he tried to stay and help, he and his pokemon could be seriously hurt and he might not even return. But if Alex didnât help, his conscience would kill him, and heâd let a bunch of other innocent pokemon die. And even then, Alex would have to get not one, but two, pieces of a probably highly defended artifact.<br />
<br />
âPhanpy, py,â solemnly spoke Phil acknowledging his readiness with a nod.<br />
<br />
âThen its settled, I donât know what youâre doing, Mr. Chatot, but me and Phil are going to head on in!â exclaimed Alex. Then the two turned around and headed into the darkness, literately, and mentally.</span></span><br />

<span style="color: silver"><b><u>Tenorphin</u>: </b>It appears Cantare is more in the mood for action as opposed to deliberation, the only choice you really have in the matter being to chase your over-excited parrot into the darkness leading toward the low humming you can hear in the distance. Eventually stumbling through total darkness and hoping you don't trip over something and break your neck down here where no help is likely to find you, a couple of minutes later you find yourself emerging into a small, dimly lit chamber. The walls are made of large concrete slabs. Moss is growing in the cracks between each one, while the natural scent of earth fills your nostrils. This place feels old, and although there is nothing that directly leads you believe that it is you have a niggling feeling that this place has been here far longer than the cemetery itself. The humming is louder here although it seems to be coming from somewhere beyond this chamber which means there could be a path leading back to civilisation if you can find something that will give you a clue as to how to get out of here. The flame from a single torch protruding from the wall on north-east corner of the room casts shadows around the chamber, and although you're quite certain that both you and Cantare are alone in here, some of the shadows are quite unnerving at times as you see strange shapes flickering in the corner of your eye. Upon closer examination you find that there is nothing in this chamber at all with the exception of a single etching in the wall, and bending down you squint at it, trying to make it out.<br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Silver">Walking along the dark tunnel, Shou has reduced from the initial big steps chasing Cantare to cautious small strides, being unable to see anything in the dark. Having his hands tracing the left side of the tunnel wall, Shou made way through the tunnel slowly, and firmly, hoping that he wouldn't step onto some other holes or walk into a big boulder. The humming never ceased and kept its ever-low tone consistent. Cantare was nowhere to be seen yet (though, nothing else can be either), but Shou has a feeling that the darkness is coming to an end.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cantare?&quot; Shou shouted out for his Chatot again. A firm reply indicated the parrot was just in front of Shou some hundred yards or meters away. Shou quickened up, wanting to catch up with Cantare, so he walked with his left palm only cruising through the rock wall, occasionally sliding through a wood plank of some sort. A minute later, with Cantare on his side, Shou saw a dim light flicker in the distance, possibly hinting an existence of fire, and he picks up his pace as he was nearing the light source, being able to see again, little by little.<br />
<br />
At the end of the tunnel is a chamber of some sort. It was dim, with only a single torch lighting up the whole chamber, even though the chamber itself was not that big. The smell of mud and earth took up all of Shou's smelling senses. The only feeling Shou have gotten since entering this chamber is that it's old, ancient, even. The humming was more audible here, and Shou knocked himself in the head lightly when he realised that he was catching the pitch of the hum, which was a low D. The humming itself didn't seemed to be coming from the chamber, but rather beyond it. That and the flame that doesn't seem to be dying gave Shou hope about a way out. Speaking of the flame, the shadows of both the trainer and the PokÃ©mon was casted on the floor of the chamber. However, the feeling of other shadows moving was growing in Shou's mind. It was an eerie unpleasant feeling, like someone was stalking you when you're walking down the streets at night alone. Shou shook his head, trying to deny the feeling. <i>You're being paranoid. There's no one down here except for you and Cantare.</i> He thought.<br />
<br />
Shou decided to look around for clues to get out of the creepy chamber. After a somewhat detailed search, Shou has only one discovery. The etching of some strange alphabetic PokÃ©mon at one of the walls. Shou has no clue about what the PokÃ©mon are, he didn't even know what to make of it when Cantare started squawking &quot;Tee! Tee!&quot; But even then, Shou didn't know what he was trying to say. Shou tried to push, shove, and dig away the walls, without much success. Cantare used the pitch and timbre from before and yelled, &quot;Doubleyou!&quot; As it was coming unexpectedly, Shou was shocked and looked around swiftly to find that Cantare wasn't refering to Shou having a DoppelgÃ¤nger, but the alphabet &quot;W&quot;. <br />
<br />
Coming with it, a realisation hit Shou. &quot;So, it's T-W-this looks like I-swirly, S?-T again-something-something.&quot; <i>TWIST**. Twist**. Sounds familiar.</i> Shou thought. He had restrained himself for speaking out his thought in the memory of Cantare constantly annoying him. Instinctively, Shou looked at his Chatot. A sudden white flash blinded Shou momentarily the moment he set his eyes upon Cantare. <i>TWIST-ER!</i> Excitement flared up Shou's heart so quickly Shou could feel his heart pumping blood at a super increased rate. Unable to contain his excitement, Shou squealed and pointed at the etching, &quot;Cantare! Use the <b>Twister</b> move you just learnt on that wall!&quot; The sudden command, amplified and echoed by the small chamber and tunnel, after such a long silence from his trainer caught Cantare off guard and stunned him momentarily. He squawked in fright and trembled before realising that his trainer gave a command.<br />
<br />
Cantare immediately started to flap his wings, using the move for the first time after he has learnt it. A small gust of breeze started to form, but it died down as the music note PokÃ©mon stopped for breath. &quot;Come on, Cantare, try it again. You know you can do it.&quot; Having heard the encouragement, Cantare started again to blow up enough wind to hit the wall. He failed again. But Cantare was not a PokÃ©mon that gives up that easily. He tried once, twice, thrice, again and again until he managed to whip up a strong enough twister to send to hit the wall. Yet, this time he got sucked into the twister itself and sent the twister to the opposite direction out of disorientation. Shou was worried about his Chatot. &quot;Are you okay? Can you continue? We can rest for a while if you want.&quot; Cantare's arrogance got the better of him. This time, with determination coupled with frustration towards the &quot;enemy&quot;, Cantare was able to whip up a twister and send it towards the right wall in just 5 seconds. As the twister neared the wall, Shou found himself stopping his breath out of anxiety.<br />

Just as the horn reaches the boy's lips, he's assaulted with a barrage of <b>Bullet Seed</b>s that pelt his face and hands. Jack yells with surprise, your new concern being that the ruckus he's making may be enough to wake his sleeping comrades. The surprise attack has bought you a few precious seconds, however, and as Jack's face contorts into a mask of rage Belle sends a strong <b>Gust</b> of wind hurtling towards him. He fumbles the horn, dropping it before stooping to pick it up only to be met with a <b>Tackle</b> from Ponyta who sends him reeling face first into the sand. Jack's scream of rage echoes across the desert and within seconds you hear shouts, your heart sinking as you realise his allies are on their way. With no time to think you race over to Ponyta while Belle flaps her little wings madly, <b>Gust</b>ing the gritty desert sands into Jack's eyes. He screams, scrabbling to his feet whilst attempting to shield his eyes which are watering heavily. Belle swoops over, taking her place in front of you as you scrabble to mount Ponyta as quickly as possible. Although Ponyta is young, it's also very fast and knows this desert well. If there is any chance of escaping these men at all then this little fire horse is your only hope. Just as Ponyta sets off, however, you feel something heavy hit you from behind before feeling yourself being pulled to the ground. In his heightened state of fury, Jack has launched himself at your back, dragging you down to the ground with him. You both land with a painful thud and, winded, it takes you a moment to react which is all Jack needs to yank off your backpack. <i>&quot;Back off!&quot;</i> Jack yells furiously, warning his cohorts off with a raised hand. They all stop dead in their tracks, watching the scene unfold. &quot;This one is mine...&quot; he drawls, holding up your backpack while staring at you with malice through red, glazed eyes. &quot;I have a feeling you have what we're looking for,&quot; Jack says slowly, eyeing the backpack. &quot;If you co-operate now and give us what we want I'll spare your life, but if I have to take it forcefully then I'm afraid it's game over for you and your friends...&quot;</span></span>

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Rick smiled with delight as the Bullet Seeds pelted into Jack, hitting him hard in his face. Rick, however, then facepalmed himself quite hard. He had neglected the fact that the noise Jack would make could very well wake up the guards, and if that happened, he would be in series trouble indeed. The surprise, however, brought Rick and his friends enough time for Combee to prepare her next attack, the gust surging forwards towards the man. His hands slowly fumbled on the horn, and he dropped it onto the ground, the Gust doing what it was supposed too, Jack then bending down to pick it up. Now Ponyta decided to lend a hand to the events, running at Jack and smashing him face first into the sand with a powerful tackle attack. Jacks screams were now getting extremely loud, and Ricks heart completely sank. They had woken up the others, and that meant Rick was as good as dead. Nonetheless, he had to keep fighting; he didnât want the world to end, afterall, and if Rick knew that he had prevented the worlds end, who cared if he passed away in the process? He quickly ran over to the flaming pony while Belle used her second gust attack, the desert sands slamming into Jack, the scream now louder than before and Jack in much more pain. <i>Good</i>, thought Rick <i>At least I can cause him a bit of pain before this is over</i>.<br />
<br />
Bellle swooped over to Rick as he attempted to manage the flaming Pokemon, attempting to get on a part of it that wasnât coated in fire. He certainly didnât want to get burned as well as killed, in fact, heâd rather be neither. Rick supposed that it was his best option really, as he was sure that Ponyta would know the desert vaguely well from the journeys thus far. If there was any chance of escaping the men at all then the Ponyta was the only way to do so, and he hoped with all his heart that it could run faster now than when it was injured prior to now. Just as the Ponyta set off (Rick on top, of course) he felt a jolt of pain as something heavy hit him from behind, Rick being pulled straight off Ponyta and slamming himself straight to the ground. Turning around, he found that Jack had leapt at him, pulling him straight down to the ground with Rick. A sinking feeling soon followed in Ricks chest; he had lost. He was dead. Rick attempted ot react, but Jack had already grabbed the backpack. He then yelled at his partners to stop, Jack holding up the backpack while staring directly down at Rick, a evil look in the boys eyes.<br />
<br />
This was it; Rick had no choice now. He was in pain from the collision to the ground, and Ponyta couldnât be feeling particularly grand either. Rick knew he wouldnât be able to get the backpack back now, despite what ever method he attempted, so he decided that it simply wasnât worth losing his life, and then not getting the flute back. Rapidly, thoughts of what to do sprang through Ricks head, and he quickly came to what he thought would be a logical solution. âIâllâ¦I give up. But please just allow me a few things. One, after youâve taken the item out, give me my backpack back. You can search it if you want; thereâs nothing valuable other than the item in there. Two, allow me to stay and watch the ceremony; if the worlds going to end, then I might as well watch it happen. The third thing may be a bit of a stretch, but allow me to exit any time I like with my Pokemon. I know Iâm not really in a position to bargain, but these are just the things Iâd hope youâd give me.â A tear slowly swelled up in his eye and fell to the ground. It was an act, although, it did rely on the men having a heart, which he hoped at least one of them would do so.<br />
<br />
His plan was simple; wait until they started performing the ceremony, and whenever the person performing it had even the slightest moment when the flute was obtainable, heâd get Combee to Aerial Ace in there, grab the flute (by this point Rick would already have mounted Ponyta) and get out of there as soon as he could. He hoped it would work, and if it didnât, he would have at least held off the end for a bit more time. He would tell Belle that even if he got captured, she should keep flying as far away as she could, towards any town or village or anything where these men werenât. He would tell the Pokemon this plan whenever he had a spare moment with them, or an opportunity to at least whisper to them. This plan was most likely his last shot, and he didnât have any time to think of anything better, so he sure hoped heâd succeed. Not for his sake, but the worlds.</span></span></div>

Fuuten: <i>First of all, the black powder/white powder thing made me howl with laughter, but on with the update...Your reply is good, mentioning that there was no response to your cry verges on the self-updating side but itâs nothing major, just be careful there. Your consistent quality of replies is very impressive.</i><br />
<br />
After a while contemplating the nature of the cart that youâve seen and more specifically its propulsion, and a further while dusting plenty of the mysterious black powder of off your person, you decide that youâve spent quite enough time in this eerie old mine and would prefer to head back to whence you came, although perhaps a brief inspection of the cart that went past you so conspicuously might be in order as well. Walking back up the path at decent speed, you notice that the Cart seems to have deposited a fair bit of the black powder on the floor of the mine during its ascent, not copious amounts but certainly the odd patch here and there. Clearly whatever force is driving that cart isnât exactly taking care to preserve its contents.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes trudging uphill, you reach the entrance to the mine which you entered not long ago, and with a chill you remember the weather outside. If anything, it seems to have worsened with the passing of time and the blizzard seems to have only increased in its ferocity. More importantly, you can see the Cart which passed you at the end of the tracks which cease just before the entrance of the mine. A light sprinkling of snow has settled on top of the black powder, so now you have a white powder as well, although the cart is mostly covered so there is only a small amount of snow covering the contents. Mildly amused by the snow blanket, you stand back a few feet from the cart and observe it for a few seconds.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the cart begins to shake, gently at first but then more insistently, rocking on its track before there is a small puff of powder, flying around as if something inside exploded outwards. Peering forwards, you canât see anything to cause the explosion, but the hairs stand up on the back of your neck as a cold wind blows past you. The lights around you flicker, but almost as quickly as the strange events start they stop again, with the lights returning to normal and the temperature returning to mildly chilly. How odd. Just as you consider what youâve seen, a voice from behind you speaks:<br />
<br />
âGood Afternoon young lad.â You spin on the spot at breakneck speed to face the voice, which belongs; you are somewhat relieved to see, to a man. The man is of a pretty large build, although his frame is increased in size by the heavy clothing he is wearing and the assortment of strange contraptions attached to it. âWhat are you doing here then?â</span><br />

<br />
Pokemonxd4: <i>Would have been easier to read that in two paragraphs rather than one but no big deal. Reply is perfectly fine, no issues with self updating or anything else and the length is fine considering you didnât have much to work with</i><br />
<br />
Yourself and Wipeout step through into the darkened room, stepping off the stone stairs you recent ascended on. As your back foot leaves the platform, it shudders slightly and begins to slowly descend back towards the floor from whence it came, leaving you and Wipeout stuck on the upper level. âGreat.â You mutter, âTrapped in the dark attic of a creepy Tomb. What could possibly go wrong.â Wipeout giggles, albeit nervously in your arms, holding his tail out in front of the two of you which provides enough light for you to have a quick look around your new surroundings. In front of you is a fairly large stone walled room, far less ornate than those you have walked through before. In fact, it seems like this room was purely a functional one, as the room is sparsely furnished. Underfoot, the room is dusty and coated with a layer of what seems to be, to put it subtlety, the leavings of a creature or creatures unknown.<br />
<br />
Recoiling slightly as you notice the rather smelly carpet on the floor of the room, Wipeout covers his nose from the smell, which you notice for the first time. Not pleasant, not at all. âThis gets better and better.â You mumble once more, kicking slightly at the layer of faeces which comes away slightly underfoot, suggesting that it might be a little more recent than the majority of the contents of the Tomb. Looking around to see a source of the leavings, no life is immediately apparent but the stone room, whilst free of doors, does appear to have a number of holes in the wall which could well be occupied by...well, who knows what? <br />
<br />
Wipeout remains in your arms, clearly not keen to take the floor in the absence of the shoes which protect your own feet, but stands up in your arms, craning his neck to look for a sign of life, and you approach the nearest hole. Wipeout holds his flame up to illuminate the hole, and something inside stirs. There is not quite enough light for you to make it out, but Wipeout shivers noticeably, clearly creeped out. Will you investigate further?</span><br />

Kori Gotcha: <i>I liked the update, although translating the PokÃ©mon was a bit clichÃ©d it worked. Technically if you use an item youâre meant to link to it, but seeing as everyone has a Pokedex and itâs kinda incidental anyway, but just make sure you do that if you use say, a Potion.</i><br />
<br />
Walking together through the scrub, your foursome begins to encounter an area where the signs of life are more common. A bit of discarded food here and there, sometimes a feather shed by a bird PokÃ©mon. Torchic picks up a discarded feather in his beak and tickles Cyndaquil with it, causing the two to erupt in another bout of playing, tickling eachother with the feather until Cyndaquil sneezes, accidentally scorching the little feather. Kiera giggles a little at the scene, and you canât help but smile yourself at the two playing side by side, new friends. Your mind canât help but wander to your future- how many new friends are there ahead of you and Torchic? Who might they be? Of course, youâre looking for your first ever capture here by the lake of Mediville, and that might just be the greatest friend for Torchic of all.<br />
<br />
After several minutes of looking for PokÃ©mon, the two of you stop, having found nothing. <br />
âThatâs odd.â Kiera says, âThereâs usually plenty of PokÃ©mon around here, I used to come here with my older sister before she moved out.â <br />
âDoesnât seem to be much around at the momentâ you reply, stating the obvious.<br />
âChiiic!â Torchic squawks in agreement, playing with some grass out of boredom.<br />
âI wonder why itâs so quiet around here?â You ask. Kiera shrugs, and gazes around until she spots something and stops dead. You track her eyes to spot a small Slakoth, which surprisingly for a species noted for its laziness is running at full speed across your path. Your eyes and Kieraâs meet and the question is obvious- what to do? <br />
<br />
<i>Sorry your one is disappointingly short, Iâm tired but refusing to go to bed until these are posted...they took about five hours bizarrely. I get distracted too easily.</i><br />

<span style="color: limegreen"><b><u>OrangeDonphan</u>: </b><i>On the contrary, when you're given history like that there is usually quite a bit to RP about. It's simply a matter of tapping into the roleplayer within to express your thoughts and feelings in relation to the information you've just uncovered as time and experience will teach you. As an added note, try not to be intimidated by what could be seen as overwhelming odds. Strategy is just as important as battling, so think out your reply before you post. Roleplaying is the core of what we do here, and this update is going to give you a lot of material to RP with.</i><br />
<br />
Paying no attention at all to the forest PokÃ©mon who are prepared to put their lives on the line to save their habitat, you inform Chatot that you're going in and then proceed to enter the gaping hole in the ancient oak's trunk. Not wanting to lose sight of you Phil sticks close by your side, never more than a couple of footsteps away, while Chatot's cry of <i>&quot;Return both halves to the glade from where the seed was stolen. Only then can Celebi be saved!&quot;</i> rings out behind you. Coldness shrouds you the moment you set foot inside, but it's not the temperature that has you shivering so much as the sense of evil pulsating through the air. As you look around all sense of perception is lost as the inner tree appears so much larger than it does from the outside. A network of ramps and stairs line the inside of the trunk, stretching so far up that you can't even see what is at the top. The PokÃ©mon who had been gathering outside are entering now, but rather than making their way upward, they all move stealthily towards an opening in the floor at the centre of the tree's base. Figuring they must know where they're going, you follow, soon finding yourself in a massive underground chamber. You could swear this tree is growing out of a crater considering the size of this place, but the most intimidating part is the sheer amount of dark type PokÃ©mon gathered upon several of the ledges surrounding a platform in the centre. They're all very quiet, all eyes focused upon a Shiftry standing on the platform who is holding a dark, swirling orb in one of its leafy hands, and a softly glowing seed in the other. The PokÃ©mon with whom you had entered are using boulders scattered around the inner chamber to hide themselves as they dart in closer to the army of dark types, but it's their sense of urgency that has you holding your breath. Shiftry appears ready to merge the two halves of the life-force at any given second as the forest creatures move into their attack positions and you have to wonder if they'll be able to move in time to stop it. While you watch, Shiftry raises its arms above its head, holding its prized possessions up for all to see, the dark types collectively crying out in triumph as they know the time has come to finally take control of the forest. At that moment, as the howls, screeches, and cries of your enemy echo throughout the cavern, your allies attack, leaping out of the shadows and straight into battle. <br />
<br />
&quot;All hell breaking loose&quot; is an expression you've heard many times in your life, but nothing could have prepared you for this. Your allies are markedly outnumbered, the odds being roughly five to one, which leaves you with very little time to act as this battle appears to be a suicide mission for those fighting to buy you the time needed to retrieve the orb and seed. As you watch you witness a Mightyena chomp down on the head of a Furret who is slashing away at a Stunky, ripping its head right off its shoulders; three Sneasel ganging up on a Pinsir, tearing its pincers off its head before kicking it off the legde to roll to the bottom of the crater and plop into a pool of water where several Carvanha sweep in to finish it off; four Cacturne shredding apart a Weepinbell with a relentless barrage of Pin Missiles until there is practically nothing left of it; two Murkrow pecking away at a Kricketune they have trapped against the far wall; and a Crawdaunt sitting on the belly of an Ariados, slowly plucking its legs off one by one. With this being only a small portion of the horrors taking place, it is only now, with the violence taking place before your eyes, that you really begin to understand just what kind of danger you've gotten yourself into. Though it's tempting to turn and run, you realise these PokÃ©mon are literally sacrificing their lives to allow you to do as you had promised, and so try to close off the gruesome images around you and instead concentrate upon Shiftry. It's the one who has the two halves of Celebi's life-force after all, and with the forest PokÃ©mon prepared to protect you and Phil in order for you to retrieve them, then you'd better move fast or else these PokÃ©mon are all sacrificing their lives for nothing. Shiftry, its face contorted into a mask of fury, utterly enraged that anyone dare attack at a time like this, gazes around the cavern before grinning manically, its gurgling laugh making your skin crawl. It appears Shiftry isn't about to allow a little hiccup in its plans to stop it, however, and moves to unite the two pieces it's holding. At that moment however, an angry squawk catches its attention and its eyes bulge as the old Chatot you'd encountered earlier swoops down and knocks both the orb and seed out of its hands. It screams, furious, and dives to grab the two items, but isn't fast enough to stop them from being kicked into the brawling mass of PokÃ©mon. It appears it's now or never if you're going to attempt to retrieve them. There's you and Phil, as well as an orb and seed; two for two. Now your only problem is to work out how you're going to retrieve them before one of both are destroyed in the raging battle...</span><br />

<br />
<span style="color: silver"><b><u>Tenorphin</u>: </b>Deliberating over the strange markings on the wall it takes a few moments to realise each of them represents a letter of the alphabet which in turn spells out the word, &quot;Twister&quot;. Mulling over this it doesn't take long for you to connect the word with the attack move Twister which, thankfully, Cantare had learned just prior to your ending up in here. Unfortunately he's not had a great deal of time in which to perfect his use of the move and after several failed attempts finds himself huffing and puffing, not to mention a little worse for wear after having gotten himself caught up in his own gust of wind and buffeted around a little. He ruffles his feathers, however, and puffs his chest out, his arrogance getting the better of him after you suggest he take a rest, finally whipping up a tight, cyclonic wind that he sends reeling toward the word etched into the wall. Standing back, you're barely able to contain your excitement and watch with bated breath while the <b>Twister</b> pounds the chamber wall, your eyes practically bugging out of your head when the letters themselves seem to come alive. One by one they're drawn out into the strong wind, spinning round and round as the humming in the room becomes louder. A beautiful pinkish psychic glow fills the room as the Twister dissipates, the letters still spinning in the air before moving back into their original positions. As the final &quot;R&quot; fits back into its place in the wall, a hidden door opens, allowing you to pass through before it shuts behind you again. Cantare is looking rather pleased with himself, if not a tad mystified by the next room. You gaze around noting there is not one, but three new sets of inscriptions. One on the wall to your left, one on the wall to your right, and the third directly opposite. Moving in to examine them, you see that they read:<br />

Hmm, what to do?</span><br />

<br />
<span style="color: darkorange"><b><u>handymankg2</u>: </b>Knowing you have no real way out of this, all you can do at this point is attempt to strike up a bargain and hope for the best. Jack doesn't appear to be at all accommodating, sneering at you with contempt before Reg steps in and interrupts before Jack has a chance to speak. &quot;He's conceded, Jack, so you need to hold up your end of the bargain. First we'll see if he does in fact have the artifact, and then we'll decide what to do with him&quot;. Unimpressed, Jack simply nods before rummaging through your pack, tossing its contents all over the ground before finally pulling out the flute. &quot;AHA!&quot; he gloats, eyeing it with greed. &quot;I told you the imposter had it! Why else would he run?!&quot; Reg frowns, reaching out to take the flute from Jack whose expression darkens, his fingers tightening around it. Reg stares him down, however, and Jack eventually relinquishes his hold on the item, though not without casting Reg a death stare as the man tucks it safely into an inner pocket of his jacket. You watch the confrontation between the two with interest, and can already see the power of the item over which they are fighting. That flute is going to give one person an awful lot of power, and if they're already bickering amongst themselves then it won't take much to turn them against one another. Distracted from your train of thought by Reg's voice telling everyone to get back to camp and pack up so that you can move out, you watch while they all disappear. &quot;I don't know what you think you're doing, kid, but you could have gotten yourself killed just then. I knew the moment I saw you earlier today that something wasn't right about you, but didn't suspect for a moment you'd be Jack's doppleganger,&quot; he says quietly. &quot;The Nightbringers are dangerous. I've spent years infiltrating this organisation and can't risk anything going wrong now.&quot; Reaching into his jacket pocket again he pulls out the flute. &quot;Keep it well hidden,&quot; he says while you stare at him, dumbfounded, and watch while he removes an exact replica of the flute from another pocket. &quot;They all saw me put it away so as far as they're concerned I have it. This is glass,&quot; he adds, nodding to the one he's holding. &quot;The one you have is real. What the Nightbringers don't know is that if the flute is played before the time is right, Jirachi will grant only one wish instead of a full week of wishes. It's my intention to ensure that happens, and to make sure I'm the one to make what they believe is only the first of many wishes. By the time they realise what has happened, their chance of world domination will have been destroyed for the next thousand years. Right now, we need to get back to camp, so pack up your stuff because we have a long trip ahead of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Late the next day after having travelled miles through the desert, the Nightbringers meet up with several other divisions of their organisation, including a mysterious man known only as 'Raven' who is apparently their leader. His face is never seen, partially covered by a hooded cloak at all times. Reg makes sure to keep you close during the trip, partly so that none of the others decide to deal out their own brand of punishment for you having tried to run off with the artifact, and partially because he knows that you have the real flute and that your role in tonight's events will be instrumental to his plan succeeding. Unfortunately you don't have much of a chance to talk with Reg again despite travelling with the man as Jack for some reason has decided to stick to the two of you like glue, never allowing either of you out of his sight. His attention is uncomfortable to say the least, and you can't help but wonder why he's so intent upon watching you. Raven, impressed with Reg for having brought him the artifact that will summon Jirachi, grants him permission to summon the Legendary PokÃ©mon and to make the first wish when it appears. Jack isn't impressed with Raven's decision, informing the head of the Nightbringers that he had in fact been the one to have first obtained the flute and that Reg had confiscated it from him so as to take credit for himself, but Raven dismisses the boy with a wave of his hand, angering Jack who finally storms off to leave you with some breathing space. Shortly afterwards, just as the sun is setting, but several hours before the summoning ceremony is due to officially begin, Reg approaches Raven holding his radio in his hand. &quot;My Lord,&quot; he frowns, appearing quite agitated. &quot;We've just had word from Delta Division. The Mystics have ambushed them, and are on their way. If their calculations are correct, they'll be here in the next hour. We must begin the ceremony.&quot; Admiring Reg's performance, and pleased by Raven's immediate agreement to Reg's plan, you watch as instructions are barked out amongst the various divisions to prepare for the ceremony. Knowing that he won't be able to stay close at all times during the next hour, Reg slips something into your pocket. &quot;For protection, I'll meet you at the ceremony&quot; he whispers. &quot;Be careful.&quot; A moment later he's gone, and reaching into your pocket feel a cold, steel blade, your blood turning colder than the blade itself at the thought of actually using it on anyone, whether it's in self-defence of not. Your thoughts are cut short, however, when you feel something small and hard pushed up against your spine. &quot;You're comin' with me,&quot; says the all too familiar voice of Jack, whom you'd almost forgotten about. Figuring he has a weapon of some kind you obey his command and allow him to lead you away from the group.<br />
<br />
A short time later Jack has tied you and Ponyta to a tent pole some distance away from where everyone is gathering, and shoves Belle into your backpack so that she's unable to help you fight him off this time. Slinging his rifle over his shoulder he grins at you cockily. &quot;I was wondering what you two were talkin' about last night, ya see, so I headed back and heard something really interesting,&quot; Jack drawls, referring to the conversation you were having with Reg after he'd sent everyone away to pack up their gear after your scuffle with the boy. <i>&quot;If the flute is played before the time is right, Jirachi will grant only one wish instead of a full week of wishes. It's my intention to ensure that happens, and to make sure I'm the one to make what they believe is only the first of many wishes,&quot;</i> he recites with cold accuracy, a gleeful glint in his eye. &quot;Well it's <i><b>my</b></i> intention to make sure <i><b>I'm</b></i> the one who makes that wish because your buddy Reg is gunna die before he can make it.&quot; Reaching into your pocket Jack pulls out the knife. &quot;You won't be needin' this either, so watch and weep kid 'cuz you're the first on my hit list when I become the Supreme Immortal Overlord of this world.&quot; Jack then trundles off toward the crowd gathering for the ceremony having ensured you're far enough away not to be heard should you call for help. Thinking back over what he'd said, you realise that he'd only heard part of the conversation and thankfully not the most important part. Jack has no clue at all that you're in possession of the real flute, but if you can't free yourself soon in order to summon Jirachi in the same moment that Reg plays his glass replica, then his cover will be blown anyway. It's then that you feel some heat by your side and realise that Ponyta is carefully burning through the ropes binding you, and you can only hope the little fire horse can free you before it's too late...</span></span></div>

<br />
<span style="color: darkorange"><b><u>handymankg2</u>: </b>Knowing you have no real way out of this, all you can do at this point is attempt to strike up a bargain and hope for the best. Jack doesn't appear to be at all accommodating, sneering at you with contempt before Reg steps in and interrupts before Jack has a chance to speak. &quot;He's conceded, Jack, so you need to hold up your end of the bargain. First we'll see if he does in fact have the artifact, and then we'll decide what to do with him&quot;. Unimpressed, Jack simply nods before rummaging through your pack, tossing its contents all over the ground before finally pulling out the flute. &quot;AHA!&quot; he gloats, eyeing it with greed. &quot;I told you the imposter had it! Why else would he run?!&quot; Reg frowns, reaching out to take the flute from Jack whose expression darkens, his fingers tightening around it. Reg stares him down, however, and Jack eventually relinquishes his hold on the item, though not without casting Reg a death stare as the man tucks it safely into an inner pocket of his jacket. You watch the confrontation between the two with interest, and can already see the power of the item over which they are fighting. That flute is going to give one person an awful lot of power, and if they're already bickering amongst themselves then it won't take much to turn them against one another. Distracted from your train of thought by Reg's voice telling everyone to get back to camp and pack up so that you can move out, you watch while they all disappear. &quot;I don't know what you think you're doing, kid, but you could have gotten yourself killed just then. I knew the moment I saw you earlier today that something wasn't right about you, but didn't suspect for a moment you'd be Jack's doppleganger,&quot; he says quietly. &quot;The Nightbringers are dangerous. I've spent years infiltrating this organisation and can't risk anything going wrong now.&quot; Reaching into his jacket pocket again he pulls out the flute. &quot;Keep it well hidden,&quot; he says while you stare at him, dumbfounded, and watch while he removes an exact replica of the flute from another pocket. &quot;They all saw me put it away so as far as they're concerned I have it. This is glass,&quot; he adds, nodding to the one he's holding. &quot;The one you have is real. What the Nightbringers don't know is that if the flute is played before the time is right, Jirachi will grant only one wish instead of a full week of wishes. It's my intention to ensure that happens, and to make sure I'm the one to make what they believe is only the first of many wishes. By the time they realise what has happened, their chance of world domination will have been destroyed for the next thousand years. Right now, we need to get back to camp, so pack up your stuff because we have a long trip ahead of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Late the next day after having travelled miles through the desert, the Nightbringers meet up with several other divisions of their organisation, including a mysterious man known only as 'Raven' who is apparently their leader. His face is never seen, partially covered by a hooded cloak at all times. Reg makes sure to keep you close during the trip, partly so that none of the others decide to deal out their own brand of punishment for you having tried to run off with the artifact, and partially because he knows that you have the real flute and that your role in tonight's events will be instrumental to his plan succeeding. Unfortunately you don't have much of a chance to talk with Reg again despite travelling with the man as Jack for some reason has decided to stick to the two of you like glue, never allowing either of you out of his sight. His attention is uncomfortable to say the least, and you can't help but wonder why he's so intent upon watching you. Raven, impressed with Reg for having brought him the artifact that will summon Jirachi, grants him permission to summon the Legendary PokÃ©mon and to make the first wish when it appears. Jack isn't impressed with Raven's decision, informing the head of the Nightbringers that he had in fact been the one to have first obtained the flute and that Reg had confiscated it from him so as to take credit for himself, but Raven dismisses the boy with a wave of his hand, angering Jack who finally storms off to leave you with some breathing space. Shortly afterwards, just as the sun is setting, but several hours before the summoning ceremony is due to officially begin, Reg approaches Raven holding his radio in his hand. &quot;My Lord,&quot; he frowns, appearing quite agitated. &quot;We've just had word from Delta Division. The Mystics have ambushed them, and are on their way. If their calculations are correct, they'll be here in the next hour. We must begin the ceremony.&quot; Admiring Reg's performance, and pleased by Raven's immediate agreement to Reg's plan, you watch as instructions are barked out amongst the various divisions to prepare for the ceremony. Knowing that he won't be able to stay close at all times during the next hour, Reg slips something into your pocket. &quot;For protection, I'll meet you at the ceremony&quot; he whispers. &quot;Be careful.&quot; A moment later he's gone, and reaching into your pocket feel a cold, steel blade, your blood turning colder than the blade itself at the thought of actually using it on anyone, whether it's in self-defence of not. Your thoughts are cut short, however, when you feel something small and hard pushed up against your spine. &quot;You're comin' with me,&quot; says the all too familiar voice of Jack, whom you'd almost forgotten about. Figuring he has a weapon of some kind you obey his command and allow him to lead you away from the group.<br />
<br />
A short time later Jack has tied you and Ponyta to a tent pole some distance away from where everyone is gathering, and shoves Belle into your backpack so that she's unable to help you fight him off this time. Slinging his rifle over his shoulder he grins at you cockily. &quot;I was wondering what you two were talkin' about last night, ya see, so I headed back and heard something really interesting,&quot; Jack drawls, referring to the conversation you were having with Reg after he'd sent everyone away to pack up their gear after your scuffle with the boy. <i>&quot;If the flute is played before the time is right, Jirachi will grant only one wish instead of a full week of wishes. It's my intention to ensure that happens, and to make sure I'm the one to make what they believe is only the first of many wishes,&quot;</i> he recites with cold accuracy, a gleeful glint in his eye. &quot;Well it's <i><b>my</b></i> intention to make sure <i><b>I'm</b></i> the one who makes that wish because your buddy Reg is gunna die before he can make it.&quot; Reaching into your pocket Jack pulls out the knife. &quot;You won't be needin' this either, so watch and weep kid 'cuz you're the first on my hit list when I become the Supreme Immortal Overlord of this world.&quot; Jack then trundles off toward the crowd gathering for the ceremony having ensured you're far enough away not to be heard should you call for help. Thinking back over what he'd said, you realise that he'd only heard part of the conversation and thankfully not the most important part. Jack has no clue at all that you're in possession of the real flute, but if you can't free yourself soon in order to summon Jirachi in the same moment that Reg plays his glass replica, then his cover will be blown anyway. It's then that you feel some heat by your side and realise that Ponyta is carefully burning through the ropes binding you, and you can only hope the little fire horse can free you before it's too late...</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: darkorange"><span style="font-size: 9px">Rick continued to stare upwards at the men as he conceded, still uncertain about his chances of surviving, let alone getting his request. He stared upwards at the man named Reg as he wandered over, and listened intently as he began to speak to Jack, telling him in simple terms that he shouldnât harm Rick now heâs conceded. Rick was slightly confused by this remark; surely the leader of a violent group of thugish men would condone violence of all sorts? Well, maybe Rick had just fallen for another one of his fathers annoying stereotypes that had been forced upon him at a young age, and considering his father was the perfect example of this stereotype, he wondered why he often used it to describe over people when it clearly was meant for himself. Anyway, Jack seemed to have a slight sense of honour in the fact he listens to authority, and the man searched through Ricks backpack rather quickly, messily throwing the contents around without a care. A triumphant âahaâ soon soared through the area as Jack pulled out the flute, believing himself to be extremely intelligent simply because he stated what was extremely likely to be true, and most likely was being thought by everyone. Rick noticed that Jack was extremely reluctant as Reg pulled his arm forwards, expecting to receive the Flute. After a long cold stare, Jack finally conceded, handing over the flute but still gazing angrily at his superior figure; it certainly wasnât his intention to give the Flute up, and Rick expected that Jack wouldnât give up easy. I mean, who would if they knew they had the chance of extreme and godly power? Rick broke out of his thoughts as he heard Reg shout at the men, sending them back to camp, and most likely back to sleep, Rick having woken them up close to dawn, not something particularly great if the mot important day of your life is occurring tomorrow, Rick would assume. Reg put it carefully into one of the pockets on the inside of his jacket, and Rick slowly stared as the last of the men cleared out of the area, leaving only Rick and Reg remaining.<br />
<br />
Rick stared up as Reg began to talk, and Ricks eyes widened slightly. Not only did Reg, the leader of this band of thugs, willingly let Ricks plea for mercy be accepted, but now he was actually talking as if he had real concern for Rick. Rick smiled slowly as he mentioned that Rick could most likely be dead right now, and he then began to listen to the fact that nobody actually had suspected he was Jacks doppelganger until Jack himself showed up. âIn all honesty, I didnât even know I had a doppelganger, and I wasnât particularly happy to find out he was a criminalâ¦â Rick trailed off, he realised that the man he was in fact talking too was a criminal also, and that wasnât the brightest thing to say to a man like that, especially when theyâre strong, tall, and facing a small tired kid whos only usable Pokemon is a Ponyta. Ricks eyes found themselves widening even more, now, however, as Reg went on to explain that he wasnât even a true member of the Organisation at all, just a agent infiltrating them. For what government, Rick wasnât sure, but he didnât really have a chance to ask, as Reg was pulling out the flute from his pocket and handing it to Rick, who weakly accepted it, taking it and hiding it on the inside of his jacket (which is inside his backpack), making sure its secure enough that it wouldnât be noticed even if someone ripped his entire backpack apart to find it. He looked up at the glass replica and smiled; things were starting to get slightly better after all, surviving death and saving the world in one day seemed like a proper adventure, after all. Rick listened intently as Reg said about the flute, and told him information Rick certainly wouldnât trust with a kid. Rick figured, he must be something special, as otherwise, what fool would share the info with him? As he was finished, Rick nodded politely and began to pack up the rest of his things that Jack had messed up earlier, smiling as he did so. There was somebody on his side.<br />
<br />
After travelling for most of the day, Rick and the Nightbringers arrived at the destination, several other divisions of the organisation arriving, including the man that seemed like the head honcho himself. All that Rick could gather from people talking was that he was named Raven, and he was certainly in charge. Rick wondered how willingly that Raven would be to kill a man to get what he wanted, and slowly shivered as he imagined the results of the question. Reg kept Rick close by all the day, making sure that none of the organisation, especially Jack, attempted to give Rick a different type of punishment to the one that he currently had, which was practically nothing. Of course, there was another reason Rick was being kept close, but he wouldnât willingly share that reason with anyone; nobody here was trustworthy, really, and he wasnât even completely sure that Reg would be fully trustworthy either. Assuming the best is always good, though, even if its rather stupid in some peoples eyes. Jack also decided to stick close to his boss for the day, watching Rick and Reg evilly when he thought Rick wasnât paying attention. There was something in Jacks eyes that made Rick slightly suspicious, but he figured it was just his seething fury at Rick for the earlier events involving much pain to the mans eyes. Raven seemed to be very please with what Reg had achieved (who wouldnât be?) and agreed to let Reg do the summoning of Jirachi and make the first wish, which Rick thought was a slightly strange decision to make. Reg must have worked quite hard indeed to get trusted if he had made it this high in the ranking of things. Rick laughed quietly when he watched Jack attempt to plea to the boss, trying to get him to see Reg was a liar, but who would believe some insignificant twerp? Later that night, Rick pretended to look slightly confused when he heard that the Mystics had ambushed a certain division, but he assumed that it was just Regâs act. If it wasnât, Rick wouldnât mind. The wish would have been done by then, and Rick could join the battle alongside the mystics, or take his chance to escape from the area. Rick nodded as he was told he couldnât be taken into the ceremony, and gulped slightly as he felt something dropped into his pocket. Reaching down, he found it was a dagger. Rick couldnât imagine using it on anybody; he was just a child, but it would be useful anyway. Suddenly, Rick felt something hard against his back, and a familiar voice resounded. Jack. He had a weapon. And Rick, knowing that it would be his only shot, willingly was taken away with him (he didnât want to die at this vital point).<br />
<br />
Rick was lead far away from the group, and towards some sort of tent pole, which Rick found himself and Ponyta bind too pretty quickly. Belle was soon reprimanded, and put into Ricks backpack so she couldnât aid him. Jack slung the rifle over his shoulder, and began to speak once again to Rick. Ricks heart fell as he listened; Jack knew about the fact that only one wish could be made if it was played early, and Rick was pretty disheartened by what was said next. Jack, a not so powerful young lad, was going to attempt to kill Reg, and therefore make the wish for himself. Jack reached into Ricks pocket, and his eyes widened uncontrollably; he was going to use Regâs own weapon to kill him. He wanted to take that knife and stab it into Jack instead so badly at this moment, but he was tied up, and he didnât particularly want to be sent to jail for life. It seemed Jack was going to use the wish to make himself overlord of the world. Well, some people have different wishes to others, Rick guessed. Jack walked away happily, ensuring that Rick was too far away to be heard if he called for help. Thinking over what Jack had said, Rick soon realised that he had no idea about the most important factors: Reg being a double agent, Rick having the real flute, or the simple fact that Rick had a fire type on his side, apparently, as Ponyta soon began to use a very light fire attack to burn away the ropes, making sure it didnât burn Rick. Hoping he wouldnât be too late for the ceremony, Rick quickly thought of what he would do. Of course, he would play the flute at the right time, making sure Reg could make the wish. If Reg was killed, Rick would simply shout out his own wish before Jack could make his, and Ricks wish would be simple. âI wish the Nightbringers no longer existedâ. It would be simply enough, and hopefully would work, meaning he wouldnât have to worry about Jack, and their plans of world domination would fail. Of course, if Reg managed to make the wish instead, well, that would be perfectly fine.</span></span></div>

<br />
Paying no attention at all to the forest PokÃ©mon who are prepared to put their lives on the line to save their habitat, you inform Chatot that you're going in and then proceed to enter the gaping hole in the ancient oak's trunk. Not wanting to lose sight of you Phil sticks close by your side, never more than a couple of footsteps away, while Chatot's cry of <i>&quot;Return both halves to the glade from where the seed was stolen. Only then can Celebi be saved!&quot;</i> rings out behind you. Coldness shrouds you the moment you set foot inside, but it's not the temperature that has you shivering so much as the sense of evil pulsating through the air. As you look around all sense of perception is lost as the inner tree appears so much larger than it does from the outside. A network of ramps and stairs line the inside of the trunk, stretching so far up that you can't even see what is at the top. The PokÃ©mon who had been gathering outside are entering now, but rather than making their way upward, they all move stealthily towards an opening in the floor at the centre of the tree's base. Figuring they must know where they're going, you follow, soon finding yourself in a massive underground chamber. You could swear this tree is growing out of a crater considering the size of this place, but the most intimidating part is the sheer amount of dark type PokÃ©mon gathered upon several of the ledges surrounding a platform in the centre. They're all very quiet, all eyes focused upon a Shiftry standing on the platform who is holding a dark, swirling orb in one of its leafy hands, and a softly glowing seed in the other. The PokÃ©mon with whom you had entered are using boulders scattered around the inner chamber to hide themselves as they dart in closer to the army of dark types, but it's their sense of urgency that has you holding your breath. Shiftry appears ready to merge the two halves of the life-force at any given second as the forest creatures move into their attack positions and you have to wonder if they'll be able to move in time to stop it. While you watch, Shiftry raises its arms above its head, holding its prized possessions up for all to see, the dark types collectively crying out in triumph as they know the time has come to finally take control of the forest. At that moment, as the howls, screeches, and cries of your enemy echo throughout the cavern, your allies attack, leaping out of the shadows and straight into battle. <br />
<br />
&quot;All hell breaking loose&quot; is an expression you've heard many times in your life, but nothing could have prepared you for this. Your allies are markedly outnumbered, the odds being roughly five to one, which leaves you with very little time to act as this battle appears to be a suicide mission for those fighting to buy you the time needed to retrieve the orb and seed. As you watch you witness a Mightyena chomp down on the head of a Furret who is slashing away at a Stunky, ripping its head right off its shoulders; three Sneasel ganging up on a Pinsir, tearing its pincers off its head before kicking it off the legde to roll to the bottom of the crater and plop into a pool of water where several Carvanha sweep in to finish it off; four Cacturne shredding apart a Weepinbell with a relentless barrage of Pin Missiles until there is practically nothing left of it; two Murkrow pecking away at a Kricketune they have trapped against the far wall; and a Crawdaunt sitting on the belly of an Ariados, slowly plucking its legs off one by one. With this being only a small portion of the horrors taking place, it is only now, with the violence taking place before your eyes, that you really begin to understand just what kind of danger you've gotten yourself into. Though it's tempting to turn and run, you realise these PokÃ©mon are literally sacrificing their lives to allow you to do as you had promised, and so try to close off the gruesome images around you and instead concentrate upon Shiftry. It's the one who has the two halves of Celebi's life-force after all, and with the forest PokÃ©mon prepared to protect you and Phil in order for you to retrieve them, then you'd better move fast or else these PokÃ©mon are all sacrificing their lives for nothing. Shiftry, its face contorted into a mask of fury, utterly enraged that anyone dare attack at a time like this, gazes around the cavern before grinning manically, its gurgling laugh making your skin crawl. It appears Shiftry isn't about to allow a little hiccup in its plans to stop it, however, and moves to unite the two pieces it's holding. At that moment however, an angry squawk catches its attention and its eyes bulge as the old Chatot you'd encountered earlier swoops down and knocks both the orb and seed out of its hands. It screams, furious, and dives to grab the two items, but isn't fast enough to stop them from being kicked into the brawling mass of PokÃ©mon. It appears it's now or never if you're going to attempt to retrieve them. There's you and Phil, as well as an orb and seed; two for two. Now your only problem is to work out how you're going to retrieve them before one of both are destroyed in the raging battle...</span></span>

Sorry about my last misjudgement, I'll take the CC and turn it up a notch:<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: LimeGreen">Not wanting to put the other forest pokemon at risk, Alex headed on into the tree with Phil close by his ankles. The darkness suddenly surrounds them as a final cry of instruction from Chatot is heard, &quot;Return both halves to the glade from where the seed was stolen. Only then can Celebi be saved!&quot; The small footsteps of Alex and Phil were all they heard for a second and then suddenly several noises came from behind. Alex turned around, startled, until he realized that it was a group of the pokemon from the party and the ones that surrounded the tree. Way in over his head, Alex tried to act brave and said, âLet me go in alone. I donât want any of you to get hurt, and with this many pokemon, there will be no stealth at all!â The Ludicolo from earlier stepped out of the group and shook his head; the expression on its face shifted from sorrow to anger. The other forest pokemon seemed to agree, and the mob started to head deeper into the darkness. With no other choice, Alex continued into the tree and evergrowing presence of evil looming over him.<br />
<br />
The darkness cut into the group, but the drive of the pokemonâs revenge and Alexâs sheer sense of excitement overpowered their fear. Nearing a ramp, Alex started to climb, until he realized the pokemon were descending through an opening and not following him. Slipping through the hole in the treeâs core, Alex and Phil found themselves in a large underground dungeon. Several rows of ledges lined the area with dark pokemon seated on all of them. Large rock structures surrounded the area like a broken gate. The center of attention: a huge, circular dais. An overpowering Shiftry stood on the center while holding two objects. Alex waited to see if the demented creature would hunch over and mutter âpreciousâ while cuddling the dark orb and glowing seed in each of its hands. Moving from stone to stone, the group of forest pokemon started to advance towards the crowd. The Shiftry raised the holy objects, and its followers all cheered and hollered. Phil ducked behind Alex, afraid of what would happen next. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, the forest pokemon leaped into the midst and a fight began. Alexâs original bravery was drained from his as he hid behind one of the boulders, but he was amazed at his allies will to fight against great odds. âThis must be like life or death for them,â muttered Alex, receiving a nod from Phil. Suddenly, Phil cried, as a familiar Mightyena tore head from torso of a Furret who was doing what it could to attack a Stunky. The small cranium bounced to a halt by the pairâs hiding place. Alex spared politeness and kicked the head away while almost vomiting. More gore appeared, left and right; bodies and limbs appeared all around the floor. Alex started to move away from the area when suddenly a stomach wrenching laugh was heard from of stage. The Shiftry had moved past anger and let dementia carry on its mission. It started to move the two pieces together and Phil and Alex cried in fear.<br />
<br />
âCraawsqaaawk!â<br />
<br />
The elder Chatot flew in from behind Alex and swooped in at the Shiftry. âYeah!â cheered Alex thinking that they won until the two halves flew out of Shiftryâs hands and landed in the crowd of fighting. Alexâs expression slid off his face as he started to look all around for a glimpse of the treasures. He stumbled over to Phil and slowly whispered, âOh Phil, its time to shine, I need your help. Somewhere in that,â pointing into the rumble, âare two halves of Celebiâs life force. Youâre small and can roll in between all of that mess. I just want you to look wherever you can, but if some one starts to attack, I want you to coat yourself with a Gyro Ball in defense, then run.â <br />
<br />
âPy, py!â replied Phil, understanding his assignment. Alex left Phil, trusting him with his responsibility, and circled around the boulders, not wanting to be hurt by any attacks. After all, he didnât know any pokemon moves. âAll I have to do is reach in and run if I grab it,â thought Alex, trying to reassure his fear.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver"><b><u>The Graveyard</u></b> - Please reply in <b>silver</b></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: silver"><b><u>Coel</u>: </b>Although an eerie graveyard is the last place on earth you would have liked to find yourself, especially after only having recently set out on your first adventure, you're not about to let Bix's sarcastic comments get you down and continue walking along with purpose as though this is exactly where you knew you'd end up and where you want to be. Being very in tune with your emotions, however, the little Ralts is well aware of the fact this place is making you quite uncomfortable and soon stops the banter as he's not exactly thrilled with the vibe of death and misery radiating from here either. It's late afternoon and in a couple of hours the graveyard is going to appear even less welcoming than it does now. While you're walking, you notice a boy of about five crouching outside of one of the crypt doors along the eastern edge of the cemetery with an Electrike. He's whispering to the little electric pup who is listening intently to its master and appears to be quite excited by his words. You also notice a girl of about thirteen kneeling by a headstone several rows down who is wiping tears from her eyes as she lays a bouquet of flowers in front of it. A few other people are leaving the grounds as it's getting quite late now and a distinct chill is settling in, and as you're wondering if you should perhaps leave as well to search out some shelter for the night you hear a &quot;Psst!&quot; coming from somewhere nearby. Looking around you see the boy next to the crypt looking at you before whispering, &quot;Hey, mister!&quot; Wondering what he wants you walk over and the boy grins at you. &quot;Mister, I need you to guard this door. It's hiding inside and will escape if I leave but I'll sneak back after bedtime so don't let it out ok?&quot; Just then the girl you'd noticed earlier approaches. &quot;Kevin! Come on, we have to go home now,&quot; she calls, looking you up and down curiously. &quot;Please excuse my brother,&quot; she says by way of apology before taking Kevin's hand. &quot;I'm sure he's been filling your head with stories of dangerous ghouls, but I can assure you he's just a boy with an over-active imagination. You know how kids are.&quot; As she leads him away with Electrike trotting alongside them, she looks back over her shoulder. &quot;See you around if the ghouls don't get ya!&quot; she laughs, before they disappear from view and leave you standing there wondering what they're talking about. Dangerous ghouls? Hardly. But then a loud crash from inside the crypt causes both you and Ralts to start. Looking at each other, you wonder if you should perhaps investigate. Kevin did ask you to stand guard, after all...</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Silver">&quot;Right, i'll keep that in mind, thanks,&quot; he replied to the girls comment, his sarcasm laced with clear hints of nervousness. It would have been absolutely fine however if not for the loud crashing noise coming from the crypt he had just been instructed to 'guard'. Now as much as he loved listening and being bossed around by five year olds, which quite frankly he found himself in this position often, he wasn't one to give in to their demands. Willing that is. It seemed a horrible time but the blond chose this moment in time to have a horrible flashback of his bratty younger brother who seemed to have a knack for getting him to do things against his will, most of which involved cookies, money or, well, more cookies. Though the boy, Kevin was it, seemed a great deal nicer and he seemed far more willing to accept his request. Though his older sister, she didn't see very nice at all. He was all for respecting those who respected the dead, as it seems like she had been visiting someone or something herself but something about her just put him straight off. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know, i'm still here,&quot; added Bix impatiently who had the utmost honour of being able to see each and every one of his trainers thoughts. No matter how emotionally unstable his trainer may be the small psychic-type refused to let their shared link the Ralts family had to their trainers get to him. Though admitidly he too was curious to what the little boy and slightly bigger girl had to say. Ghouls, ghosts, whatever she was on about it had Bix curious and if he knew his trainer he knew he'd be inching away from the place, right, about...<br />
&quot;Where do you think you're going?&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm chickening out and running away it seems,&quot; MTC replied casually, masking his fear with a casual laugh as if what he said was funny. To which it really wasn't. <br />
&quot;It seems rather counter-productive, you find somewhere of which you can proove yourself to be less of a coward but choose to continue your 'yellow' streak and run off. Not even subtly I might add...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, okay, yeah, i'm scared. Who wouldn't be? I mean, you heard that loud noise too, right? What kind of loud noises happen in the middle of a graveyard at this time, eh? Yeah, you know it too, ghosts, ghouls just like the girl said. Give me one good reason why I shouldn't just walk away. No, actually, give me one good reason why I'm not, at this moment, running away,&quot; MTC took a deep breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't need to be psychic to tell how you're feeling. You talk too much when you're nervous, that and you pretty much said it yourself,&quot; the psychic-type continued, &quot;You wanted one good reason why you should stay and see whatever comes? Well I think you already know the reason - Sam.&quot; <br />
MTC narrowed his eyes maliciously, &quot;Oh yes... Sam.&quot; he made sure to emphisize every single word in his sentance. <br />
<br />
Bix knew he had him, his trainer's rival always got the boy rilled up, &quot;Ha, I can only imagine what he'd be saying if he saw you now. Actually, I don't think he'd say anything.&quot;<br />
He knew exactly what the Ralts was on about. &quot;That laugh,&quot; his eye began to twitch in sheer frustration, half of which was layed on a little too thick. He raised his hand, extending his index finger to it's fullest, &quot;Right, let's go investigate that noise!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In the time it took you to decide that whatever's in there is probably long gone,&quot; Bix smirked<br />
&quot;Ah good, that means we don't have to go. Oh well, let's head to wherever those two were off...&quot;<br />
&quot;No, we're still going,&quot; the Ralts stated, very matter of factly.<br />
&quot;Remind me who's the Pokemon here?&quot; Bix decided to quiet down, taking this as a personal victory as MTC sighed, heading forward. &quot;Hold on,&quot; MTC stopped in his tracks, using any opertunity to prolong his entry of the forboding crypt. Quickly rustling through his bag he soon pulled out a round voltorb-like object. However, by the way the boy violently threw it forward it was obviously not a Voltorb. That or a Voltorb with a cracked head as the red and white object split in half, white light taking the shape of a small fluffy cloud-like bird.<br />
&quot;Swa swa,&quot; the small bird greeted the fresh air with an un-rivaled level of chipper naivety.<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, I got a new Pokemon,&quot; MTC announced out of the blue, puffing his chest out proudly. &quot;Her name is Tweeta.&quot;<br />
&quot;Tweeta... Bix... Tweetabix&quot; Bix glared at his trainer stupidity as he laughed at his own horrible naming scheme. &quot;She isn't coming with us is she?&quot;<br />
&quot;Of course she is, why else would I have let her out,&quot; MTC frowned, looking down to the hyper-active bird who was attempting to hug Bix much to Bix's dismay. &quot;Okay guys, looks like we've built it up enough, time for the climax, onwards we go!&quot; Seemingly forgetting the fear he had only minutes ago expressed.<br />
&quot;Idiot...&quot;<br />
&quot;Swaaaa~!&quot;<br />
At last, the tw- I mean, three headed forward, this time for sure.<br />
