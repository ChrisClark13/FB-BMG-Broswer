<b><u>TurtleKing</u>: </b><i>While I can understand your response as I'd most likely knock him out too given a real life situation, we try to refrain from getting involved with trainer brawls in FB. It's all about the PokÃ©mon...</i><br />
<br />
Enraged by the way this trainer has treated both of the Swinub, you're quick to instruct Grove to dive in and save the Swinub trapped in the sinking net while you go after the trainer himself. Your challenge has attracted his attention though so he has enough warning to dodge your fist, the unfortunate result of your forward momentum allowing him to stick his leg out and trip you which sends you reeling and heading straight into the hot spring. Landing with a splash, you find yourself in the steaming water with Grove and Swinub while the trainer cackles from the sidelines.<br />
<br />
&quot;That'll teach you to mess with The Master,&quot; he laughs, a sadistic grin twisting his expression into one of pure evil.<br />
<br />
Reaching for his belt, the trainer unclips a PokÃ©ball attached to it, throwing it forward to reveal a little Phanpy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let the weakling have it!&quot; he yells, pointing toward the first Swinub you had met who is standing by the hot spring, totally beside itself as the person who had come to help it is now in as much trouble as he was.<br />
<br />
Before Swinub has the opportunity to react, Phanpy charges at him, Tackling him and sending him flying into the water as well. Reaching out, you manage to grab Swinub before he goes under, and thankfully Grove has managed to keep the second Swinub above the water though he's having trouble getting it out, but the trainer doesn't appear to be going anywhere now.<br />
<br />
&quot;You after a fight, twerp?&quot; he asks, the arrogant tone in his voice angering you even further...</span></span>

<br />
Hiro sneered as he hopped out of the water, bringing along Grove and the other Swinub. He stared back at the Swinub and said, &quot;Let me and Grove take care of this. It seems that this guy isn't going anywhere anytime soon. We'll try to run him out, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
He stared back at the guy as he looked to Grove, &quot;Grove, front and center!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Grove, you're much faster than his Phanpy, judging on the statistics of all Phanpy. However, don't let that fool you. It's obvious that Phanpy make up for their lack of speed with their intense strength. So, let's use the hit-and-run strategy, okay? Now, start off by using <b>Leer twice</b> while running aroud him. I know it'll be hard to focus your stare on the Phanpy, but try your hardest. Then, when the time is right, hit'em with a <b>Pound</b> and run for it! It may seem cowardice, but think of it as a strategy. Go Grove!&quot;<br />

<b><u>Slick Rick</u>: </b>Knowing this is no joking matter, you quickly turn serious upon the realization of just how bad this situation is. Holding Sandsrew protectively you respond to Poochyena's threat instantly, releasing Staryu to ensure this little hyena stays well away from Sandslash's remains. Staryu doesn't look to be at all comfortable here in the desert heat but that isn't about to stop it from doing all it can to win this battle, especially after having seen Sandslash for itself. Poochyena begins snarling even louder and while Staryu is Hardening in preparation for the upcoming battle, Poochyena throws its head back and Howls for all it's worth. While the two face off, ready to battle, you can't help but glance at Sandslash again. Something doesn't seem right here, and while you're trying to work out exactly what it is that's out of place, Staryu and Poochyena move in on one another. Each use Tackle, colliding head on before facing off again, each as determined as the other to win this battle though for very different reasons...</span><br />

</blockquote><span style="color: darkorange"><span style="font-size: 9px">Ace scratched the back of his head, staring at the fallen Sandslash almost in a trancelike state. He was snapped back into reality though as Staryu and Poochyena came crashing to the ground following their midair collision. Staryu was still primed to fight and Poochyena didnât seem like it was going to back down. Ace quickly crouched down to Staryu.<br />
<br />
<b>Ace:</b> Alright Staryu, I want you to <b>Tackle</b> Poochyena again and then when it goes to attack you, use <b>Harden</b> just as it is about to collide. And if you can, <b>Tackle</b> it again after that.<br />
<br />
While Ace was crouched, however, he positioned Sandshrew to face the opposite direction and decided to get a closer look at the Sandslash.</span></span></div>

<b><u>Lady Demoonica Darkmoon</u>: </b>Luckily Pr-aA is naturally protective of his trainer and is already moving to intercept Glameow before you've even issued your instructions. Pr-aA Tackles Glameow mid pounce, knocking the blue cat onto the floor while you move back to get out of their way. Pr-aA has Glameow's attention now but for some reason his use of Leer isn't working on the strange kitty whose eyes are completely dull, void of any kind of emotion. Glameow, claws extended, leaps for Shinx who once again meets it with his Tackle though he doesn't get off as easily this time. Glameow strikes fast and hard, scratching Pr-aA's cheek as they meet mid-air. The two then back away from one another, squaring off as they each prepare to attack again...</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: gold">As the two engage in the start of their battle, Solo finally notices that the entrance has disappeared. <i>It can't just be gone...</i> Pr-aA lands the first hit, the Glameow having been focused on Solo herself, but his Leer attack falls on blind eyes... <i>Or unseeing eyes.</i> Solo thinks suddenly.<br />
<br />
The two cat Pokemon clash again, leaving her Shinx with scratches on his cheek. Pr-aA lands in front of her and paces back and forth, attempting to keep the Glameow from getting any closer as he waited for Solo.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, that's good, Pr-aA boy.&quot; She told the Shinx. &quot;Let's not worry about what doesn't work and keep up what does. The next time if it leaps to use an attack, I want you to run in under it and use your <b>Tackle</b> from below. After that keep it off balance with another couple of <b>Tackle</b> attacks. To avoid getting scratched again, try to stay to it's sides when you attack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ehnx.&quot; Pr-aA gave a small nod, his eyes staying on the Glameow.<br />
<br />
Solo watched the Glameow. <i>It's like it isn't under it's own control. Look... see... there's something else at work here.</i> She looks around, what else had changed?</span></span></div>

<b><u>TerminatorTotodile</u>: </b>Figuring the situation between Kaitlyn and her father really isn't any of your business, you leave the two to sort things out between themselves. Taking Kaitlyn's place under the old oak tree in the town square, you're saddened by the circumstances surrounding Kaitlyn and her father as you can't imagine what it would be like if you were forced into a situation in which you'd have to sell Corsola. A moment later, hearing Kaitlyn's scream followed by her father's panicked cry, you react on instinct alone. On your feet before your mind has a chance to catch up, you're racing down the alley within seconds of hearing their calls. At first seeing nothing, you're praying they're ok, when suddenly you see it - or at least him. Kaitlyn's father is on the ground, but Kaitlyn is nowhere in sight. Your first thought is that they must both have been attacked, but a moment later her father looks up and you realize he's not laying down because he's hurt, but because he's looking through a hole in the ground. Taking a closer look, you see it's a manhole sitting several feet above the sewerage tunnels that run beneath Mediville. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please help!&quot; Kaitlyn's father cries. &quot;Something dragged Kaitlyn down there, and I'm too big to fit through the hole!&quot;</span></span>

Noticing that Kaitlyn is missing, she looks around as she goes to check on Kaitlynâs father. Once he looks up, Mary realizes that he is fine, and immediately starts staring at the manhole that he was looking through.<br />
<br />
âPlease help! Something dragged Kaitlyn down there, and Iâm too big to fit through the hole!â Mary listens to Kaitlynâs father shout, and decides to take action.<br />
<br />
âDonât worry, Iâll help her.â Mary assures Kaitlynâs father, taking off her bright blue hoodie to make sure she can fit down through the manhole. She sets Corsola down by the edge of the manhole and puts the hoodie on top of Corsola, then beginning her decent. After a moment she reaches the bottom and calls back up to Corsola. âCome on down!â Corsola hops down into the manhole upon hearing the call, Maryâs hoodie still atop of her horns. Mary catches Corsola and starts putting the hoodie back on, looking around the sewer as she does so.</span></span></div>

<b><u>TerminatorTotodile</u>: </b>Without a second thought, you react instantly and are underground within moments. Now that you're actually down here, you begin to realize just how dangerous a situation you are in as there appears to be absolutely no means of escape. Looking back up at Kaitlyn's father who is staring down through the manhole, you can see the concern in his eyes not only for his daughter but for you as well. &quot;Be careful lass,&quot; he says concernedly. &quot;I'll find another way in and catch up with you.&quot; A moment later he disappears from view leaving you completely alone in a seemingly neverending stretch of dark, dank stone tunnel stretched out to either side of you. The smell is unpleasant at best, but considering what is down here that isn't really surprising. Since Kaitlyn needs to be found as soon as possible you're not going to back out now just because the odour isn't welcome, and so begin looking around for any signs at all that may give some clue as to which direction Kaitlyn was dragged off in. With nothing being immediately apparent you start walking, hoping you're going the right way. <br />
<br />
While you travel you notice the tunnel is quite dark and approximately two metres wide. The only light available is coming from small manhole covers overhead that are spaced at roughly fifty metre intervals which dimly illuminate the passageway at least enough for you to make out your surroundings. A waterway is running through the tunnel as well, taking up a good metre of the walkway to your right leaving you little room to navigate should you find yourself face to face with whatever has taken Kaitlyn. The stone walls are damp, much of it coated in a layer of filthy moss, and you can't help but feel it's about time this place is upgraded a little to suit the modern era. The sound of dripping water somewhere in the distance is somehow rather unnerving, as are your echoing footsteps as you walk along the long corridor. A few minutes later you hear a cry and, recognizing it as Kaitlyn's, break into a run. Unfortunately whatever has brought her here is alerted by the sound you are making and before you're able to reach the young girl, a shadowy form leaps out of a side tunnel and right in front of you causing you to come to a skidding halt so that you barge right into it...</span><br />

<b><u>Slick Rick</u>: </b>While Staryu and Poochyena face off, the niggling suspicion that something is out of place with Sandslash keeps gnawing at you. Relaying your instructions to Staryu, you shift Sandshrew so that it can't see its mother from where it's positioned, and take a closer look at Sandslash's tortured body. Judging from the injuries she has sustained you can tell that she fought a very hard battle, quite possibly to defend her baby, but upon closer inspection one revelation that hadn't been immediately apparent is that she had to have been fighting more than one PokÃ©mon. The scratches and bite marks certainly don't match that of Poochyena, and the size of the marks on her battered body don't match up either.<br />
<br />
Glancing back toward the battle, you watch while Poochyena and Staryu leap toward each other with their respective <b>Tackle</b>s, Staryu <b>Harden</b>ing itself at the last second to make Poochyena's attack hurt that much more. They collide with a sickening thud, Poochyena yelping in pain as the unforseen consequence of its previous <b>Howl</b>ing has not only increased its attack power, but also the damage taken from Staryu's hardened shell. Staryu doesn't waste a moment, using Poochyena's surprise to its advantage and immediately lunging forward to <b>Tackle</b> it again. Poochyena is knocked for a six, but quickly gathers itself together and retaliates with a <b>Tackle</b> of its own.<br />
<br />
Seeing that Staryu is handling itself quite well you look back at Sandslash, studying her closely. Judging from the size of the scratches and bite marks on her torso, approximately <i>three</i> different PokÃ©mon were responsible for this and Poochyena wasn't one of them. The only thing this Poochyena is fighting for is a free meal, but the brutality behind the attack on Sandslash sends a shiver up your spine despite the desert heat. Whatever had done this can't be too far away, and with the possibility of Poochyena's Howl alerting them to your presence you know it isn't safe to be sticking around here for very long. Glancing down into Sandshrew's anguished little face you can only hope it didn't witness its mothers demise. It's possible it had run for help before the lethal blow was struck, but that's something you'll more than likely never know for sure...</span><br />

<br />
<b><u>Lady Demoonica Darkmoon</u>: </b>Judging from the dull expression in Glameow's eyes, it doesn't take you long to realise that something out of the ordinary is taking place here. Add to that there doesn't seem to be a doorway where one was present only moments ago, and you <i>know</i> something else is at work. What that can be you have no idea, but there is only one way to find out. However, your first priority is ensuring there are no distractions and the only way to do that is to end this battle with Glameow as quickly as possible so you can find a way out of here. With Pr-aA's Leer being useless your only strategy is a full on offensive assault and so you relay your instructions to Shinx before turning your attention to the chamber itself, looking for some kind of clue that may help explain what is going on.<br />
<br />
The walls of the chamber are inscribed with many pictures and writings, some undecipherable due to them being written in a language since lost in time, and while you search for something that may help, the words from the previous riddle you'd seen come to mind. <i>&quot;Kings and Queens are buried here, their guardians you'll surely fear, but to reach them you must pass a test, or in this room forever rest...&quot;</i> It <i>has</i> to mean something, but there must also be more to it than simply defeating Glameow. It doesn't look to be the kind of guardian that kings and queens would use for protection, but then again looks can often be quite deceiving. Glancing back toward the PokÃ©mon, you watch while Glameow pounces at Pr-aA who quickly dashes toward and under it, changing his direction at the last second and leaping up to <b>Tackle</b> Glameow from below. Glameow yowls in protest, falling to the floor before reaching out and swatting at Pr-aA quite viciously, <b>Scratch</b>ing him again. <br />
<br />
Glancing back at the chamber wall, you notice one of the most odd occurrences you've ever seen. The surface of the sandstone block beneath the riddle appears to <i>swirling</i>, the strange phenomena causing your eyes to practically glue to it. In the next instance the swirling sand turns into letters which circle around one another before settling into a line of text to reveal the words, <i>&quot;Events are not always what they seem&quot;</i>. Though you're not sure what it means, that much has already become quite apparent which doesn't do much to help matters. Frustrated, you turn your attention back to the battling duo and watch while Pr-aA circles around and <b>Tackle</b>s Glameow from the side. The blue cat hisses a warning, its claws glinting in the flickering torchlight before it leaps forward to attack. Pr-aA is quick to dodge, staying well out of the way of frontal attacks and zipping around to Glameow's side again. The agile cat moves quickly, its dull eyes following Pr-aA's movements while he moves around the chamber. Realising Glameow isn't going to allow him another opportunity to catch it off guard, Pr-aA moves in to <b>Tackle</b> it again only to have Glameow wait for his approach and then wrap its paws around him at the last second. Though Glameow takes a hard hit, it's taking Pr-aA with it, and the two PokÃ©mon are now engaged in a rather vicious struggle while a lot of growling, hissing, and snarling is echoing throughout the tiny room. Looking back at the wall you see the swirling happening again and watch while it reveals the line, <i>&quot;Small actions unveiling the larger scheme&quot;</i>...</span><br />

<b><u>TurtleKing</u>: </b>Dragging yourself out of the water along with Grove and the two Swinub, you find yourself shivering in the chill air. The warmth of the hot spring was welcome, but now that you're soaked through, the cold is biting at your skin and chilling you to the bone. You know that if you don't change out of these wet clothes soon you'll end up very sick, but you can't do that until you've taken care of this rude, arrogant, and violent trainer. He stands by, smirking while you gather the PokÃ©mon together, obviously quite content in knowing he has this situation under complete control. You're eager to prove him wrong however, and relay your instructions to Grove who immediately springs into action, <b>Leer</b>ing at Phanpy before breaking into a run and circling around it. Unfortunately this immediately breaks eye contact, leaving Phanpy free to attack. Phanpy is having trouble following Grove's movements though, and while it tries to get a fix on him only find itself caught up in Grove's <b>Leer</b> attack for a second time giving Grove the perfect opportunity to attack. He changes direction and darts in toward Phanpy, leaping high and spinning in the air. His tail lashes around and comes in to land a hard hit on the little ground type, <b>Pound</b>ing it with quite a bit of force. Phanpy squeals in protest as it's sent rolling backward before coming to an abrupt halt as it smacks into a tree trunk, its trainer yelling abuse at it for failing to evade Treecko's attack. Upset after coming under fire from its trainer, Phanpy gets up and prepares to retaliate only to find that all of you have taken off into the woodland. While you're running just behind Treecko you hear loud, frightened squeaking from behind and look back to see the trainer grinning manically with one of the Swinub trapped under his foot while he reaches down to pick up the net holding the second Swinub. Oops, looks like you forgot to undo the netting...</span></span></div>

Hiro sneered and winced at the sight of the male trainer, having the nerve to press his foot down on one swinub and carry the other Swinub in a net, &quot;You know? You're really starting to get on my nerves. What did these Pokemon ever do to you anyway? I mean I'm confident, maybe overconfident. But you! You really take the cake and I'm going to have to take the cake back if you catch my drift!&quot; He looked down at Grove and nodded at him, &quot;Alright Grove. I know you haven't learned any Grass-type attacks, but that doesn't mean you can't beat Phanpy, understand? Now, what I want you to do this time is to get in close and <b>Pound</b> Phanpy. However, as you get in close, give'em a quick <b>Leer</b> straight in the eye. Afterwards, you can <b>Pound</b> him until you can't anymore. We have to save those Swinub!

<br />
<b><u>Slick Rick</u>: </b>While Staryu and Poochyena face off, the niggling suspicion that something is out of place with Sandslash keeps gnawing at you. Relaying your instructions to Staryu, you shift Sandshrew so that it can't see its mother from where it's positioned, and take a closer look at Sandslash's tortured body. Judging from the injuries she has sustained you can tell that she fought a very hard battle, quite possibly to defend her baby, but upon closer inspection one revelation that hadn't been immediately apparent is that she had to have been fighting more than one PokÃ©mon. The scratches and bite marks certainly don't match that of Poochyena, and the size of the marks on her battered body don't match up either.<br />
<br />
Glancing back toward the battle, you watch while Poochyena and Staryu leap toward each other with their respective <b>Tackle</b>s, Staryu <b>Harden</b>ing itself at the last second to make Poochyena's attack hurt that much more. They collide with a sickening thud, Poochyena yelping in pain as the unforseen consequence of its previous <b>Howl</b>ing has not only increased its attack power, but also the damage taken from Staryu's hardened shell. Staryu doesn't waste a moment, using Poochyena's surprise to its advantage and immediately lunging forward to <b>Tackle</b> it again. Poochyena is knocked for a six, but quickly gathers itself together and retaliates with a <b>Tackle</b> of its own.<br />
<br />
Seeing that Staryu is handling itself quite well you look back at Sandslash, studying her closely. Judging from the size of the scratches and bite marks on her torso, approximately <i>three</i> different PokÃ©mon were responsible for this and Poochyena wasn't one of them. The only thing this Poochyena is fighting for is a free meal, but the brutality behind the attack on Sandslash sends a shiver up your spine despite the desert heat. Whatever had done this can't be too far away, and with the possibility of Poochyena's Howl alerting them to your presence you know it isn't safe to be sticking around here for very long. Glancing down into Sandshrew's anguished little face you can only hope it didn't witness its mothers demise. It's possible it had run for help before the lethal blow was struck, but that's something you'll more than likely never know for sure...</span><br />

<br />
âWhatever did thisâ¦canât be far off.â<br />
<br />
Ace turns and notices the continuing battle between Staryu and Poochyena. Glancing at Sandslash and the whimpering Sandshrew, Ace continually gets weary of an incoming attack. The desert heat combining with the fear of impending doom gradually bears down on Ace and he begins to sweat profusely.<br />
<br />
âWe need to hurry up and get out of hear. Alright Staryu, we need to make quick work of Poochyena. Take him down with a <b>Tackle</b>, use <b>Harden</b> and then nail Poochyena with another <b>Tackle</b> with all youâve got!â<br />

<br />
<b><u>TerminatorTotodile</u>: </b>Without a second thought, you react instantly and are underground within moments. Now that you're actually down here, you begin to realize just how dangerous a situation you are in as there appears to be absolutely no means of escape. Looking back up at Kaitlyn's father who is staring down through the manhole, you can see the concern in his eyes not only for his daughter but for you as well. &quot;Be careful lass,&quot; he says concernedly. &quot;I'll find another way in and catch up with you.&quot; A moment later he disappears from view leaving you completely alone in a seemingly neverending stretch of dark, dank stone tunnel stretched out to either side of you. The smell is unpleasant at best, but considering what is down here that isn't really surprising. Since Kaitlyn needs to be found as soon as possible you're not going to back out now just because the odour isn't welcome, and so begin looking around for any signs at all that may give some clue as to which direction Kaitlyn was dragged off in. With nothing being immediately apparent you start walking, hoping you're going the right way. <br />
<br />
While you travel you notice the tunnel is quite dark and approximately two metres wide. The only light available is coming from small manhole covers overhead that are spaced at roughly fifty metre intervals which dimly illuminate the passageway at least enough for you to make out your surroundings. A waterway is running through the tunnel as well, taking up a good metre of the walkway to your right leaving you little room to navigate should you find yourself face to face with whatever has taken Kaitlyn. The stone walls are damp, much of it coated in a layer of filthy moss, and you can't help but feel it's about time this place is upgraded a little to suit the modern era. The sound of dripping water somewhere in the distance is somehow rather unnerving, as are your echoing footsteps as you walk along the long corridor. A few minutes later you hear a cry and, recognizing it as Kaitlyn's, break into a run. Unfortunately whatever has brought her here is alerted by the sound you are making and before you're able to reach the young girl, a shadowy form leaps out of a side tunnel and right in front of you causing you to come to a skidding halt so that you barge right into it...</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: lemonchiffon">Mary nods an assuring nod at Kaitlyn's father after being told to be careful. Unsure of which direction to go, she simply starts walking, attempting to peer through the dark of the damp and disgusting sewer. Doing her best to ignore the smell of sewage, Mary looks about for any sign of Kaitlyn or the thing that took her. The small amount of room in the sewer tunnel makes it hard to avoid any random sewage that is on the ground. After a little bit of walking, Mary hears the shrill scream of Kaitlyn, and dashes towards the sound, trying her best not to slip on the damp floor. Soon enough, the figure jumps out in front of Mary, who skids to a stop, the damp floor making it take longer, and bumps into the figure. Jumping back a few feet, Mary prepares herself to fight, whispering to Corsola, while at the same time tapping her foot so that the unknown figure would not hear her orders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I'm going to throw you at it, and I want you to <b>Tackle</b> it. Chances are it will retaliate, so use <b>Harden</b> when it comes at you.&quot; With that, Mary grabs Corsola in one hand, and reels her arm back, aiming at the shadowy figure.</span></span></div>

<br />
<b><u>Lady Demoonica Darkmoon</u>: </b>Judging from the dull expression in Glameow's eyes, it doesn't take you long to realise that something out of the ordinary is taking place here. Add to that there doesn't seem to be a doorway where one was present only moments ago, and you <i>know</i> something else is at work. What that can be you have no idea, but there is only one way to find out. However, your first priority is ensuring there are no distractions and the only way to do that is to end this battle with Glameow as quickly as possible so you can find a way out of here. With Pr-aA's Leer being useless your only strategy is a full on offensive assault and so you relay your instructions to Shinx before turning your attention to the chamber itself, looking for some kind of clue that may help explain what is going on.<br />
<br />
The walls of the chamber are inscribed with many pictures and writings, some undecipherable due to them being written in a language since lost in time, and while you search for something that may help, the words from the previous riddle you'd seen come to mind. <i>&quot;Kings and Queens are buried here, their guardians you'll surely fear, but to reach them you must pass a test, or in this room forever rest...&quot;</i> It <i>has</i> to mean something, but there must also be more to it than simply defeating Glameow. It doesn't look to be the kind of guardian that kings and queens would use for protection, but then again looks can often be quite deceiving. Glancing back toward the PokÃ©mon, you watch while Glameow pounces at Pr-aA who quickly dashes toward and under it, changing his direction at the last second and leaping up to <b>Tackle</b> Glameow from below. Glameow yowls in protest, falling to the floor before reaching out and swatting at Pr-aA quite viciously, <b>Scratch</b>ing him again. <br />
<br />
Glancing back at the chamber wall, you notice one of the most odd occurrences you've ever seen. The surface of the sandstone block beneath the riddle appears to <i>swirling</i>, the strange phenomena causing your eyes to practically glue to it. In the next instance the swirling sand turns into letters which circle around one another before settling into a line of text to reveal the words, <i>&quot;Events are not always what they seem&quot;</i>. Though you're not sure what it means, that much has already become quite apparent which doesn't do much to help matters. Frustrated, you turn your attention back to the battling duo and watch while Pr-aA circles around and <b>Tackle</b>s Glameow from the side. The blue cat hisses a warning, its claws glinting in the flickering torchlight before it leaps forward to attack. Pr-aA is quick to dodge, staying well out of the way of frontal attacks and zipping around to Glameow's side again. The agile cat moves quickly, its dull eyes following Pr-aA's movements while he moves around the chamber. Realising Glameow isn't going to allow him another opportunity to catch it off guard, Pr-aA moves in to <b>Tackle</b> it again only to have Glameow wait for his approach and then wrap its paws around him at the last second. Though Glameow takes a hard hit, it's taking Pr-aA with it, and the two PokÃ©mon are now engaged in a rather vicious struggle while a lot of growling, hissing, and snarling is echoing throughout the tiny room. Looking back at the wall you see the swirling happening again and watch while it reveals the line, <i>&quot;Small actions unveiling the larger scheme&quot;</i>...</span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: gold"><i>'Small actions?'</i> Solo wondered and brought her hand up to run over the swirling surface of the sandstone block. &quot;Pr-aA, it's getting weaker. I want you to continue to <b>Tackle</b> it with all you've got, never let you're guard down!&quot; She commanded the Shinx. She looked back to her hand on the wall. <i>'Perhaps there's a hidden switch? Or a Pokemon casting illusions... hn... could be anything really...'</i> She pressed her hand down against the sandstone block, hoping to find that she was right. If not, then she'd try something else.<br />
<br />
Pr-aA jumped back away from the Glameow, gathering his strength and circled around the enemy Pokemon. He lashed his tail from side to side, then rushed at it once more to engage it in battle.<br />
<br />
Solo didn't know how much longer either Pokemon could fight, but she did know that her Shinx had taken too many hits and they had to win this soon.</span></span></div>

<b><u>TerminatorTotodile</u>: </b>Not knowing who or what your enemy is you react on instinct alone, instructing Corsola to attack the shadowy form in front of you. She doesn't waste a moment, leaping straight out of your arms to land a successful <b>Tackle</b> on your unknown enemy. A pained grunt is the only sound you hear in response, and as you begin to overcome the initial shock of the surprise attack you start to make out the small form of what appears to be a tiny humpbacked creature. The thing retaliates by hurling something at Corsola, it's <b>Mud-slap</b> splatting all over her face and torso. Considering your environment, you have to wonder if the gunk it had hurled is actually <i>mud</i>, but prefer not to think about the possibility of it being... something else. Not really knowing what she's up against Corsola stays back, <b>Harden</b>ing her shell in preparation of the mystery creature's next attack. At first nothing happens, but then the thing in the shadows moves forward slowly, the reptilian yellow eyes and blue body of a Croagunk emerging into the dim light. It grins up at you with a challenging stare, and while your mind processes this new information a faint cry can be heard in the distance. &quot;Help meee...&quot; cries Kaitlyn's weak and frightened voice...</span><br />

<b><u>Slick Rick</u>: </b>A little wad of fear has planted itself in your gut, and with a sense of impending doom settling in you know you'll need to act fast if you want to avoid meeting the same fate as Sandslash. Though you don't know what has done this to her, you know you don't yet have the experience behind you to fight off whatever it was. A mother defending her offspring is a formidable opponent indeed, but Sandslash had been no match for her enemies regardless of the fact it's plain as day she had fought a hard and brutal battle. Instinctively cradling Sandshrew closer your gaze spans the desert sands warily, looking for any sign at all of immediate danger, but as yet there is nothing to be seen. This is little consolation however, for you're sure that Sandslash wouldn't have allowed herself and her baby to run into trouble if there had been any warning whatsoever. First priority - Poochyena. Second priority - Get the hell out of here. Returning your concentration to the battle between Staryu and Poochyena, you relay your instructions with a hint of desperation.<br />
<br />
Staryu, also sensing the danger, is well aware of the fact this battle needs to be wrapped up quickly and rams into Poochyena with a <b>Tackle</b> powerful enough to rival a PokÃ©mon twice its size. Whether sheer desperation is a factor behind the force of Staryu's attack or not, the dark pup takes quite a hit, yelping in pain as it stumbles to the ground. Quickly regaining its feet, Poochyena retaliates with its own <b>Tackle</b> only to be met with Staryu's extremely <b>Harden</b>ed shell. A gut wrenching crack fills your ears as Poochyena's skull makes contact, but this is no time to be pitying the little pooch especially considering you'll be facing far worse if you can't get away from it. Staryu wastes no time in following up, launching itself at Poochyena with all of the energy it can muster. Poochyena opens its mouth, ready to <b>Bite</b> down on Staryu, but the force of Staryu's <b>Tackle</b> sends Poochy flying before it can clamp down. Poochyena regains its feet, but is wobbly at best. Rearing its head back it opens its mouth and releases the <b>Howl</b> from hell, a cry you feel is far more dangerous than a simple attempt at helping it to boost its attack - this sounds more like a call for help...</span><br />

<b><u>Lady Demoonica Darkmoon</u>: </b>The two struggling PokÃ©mon finally break apart, panting heavily and both quite tired. Glameow's eyes are still glazed over while following Pr-aA who circles the blue cat, watching and biding his time while giving himself a chance to catch his breath. Instructing him to attack you turn back to the sandstone block waiting to see if any more text is about to reveal itself, but nothing happens. Wondering if there is perhaps a hidden switch, you press your hand against the block but once again nothing happens. Turning your attention back to the PokÃ©mon you watch Pr-aA lunge for Glameow with another <b>Tackle</b>. Glameow dodges the attack, swatting its paw at him as it does so and <b>Scratch</b>ing him once more. Pr-aA now has several scratch marks, but Glameow is looking pretty tired, so tired that its unable to evade Pr-aA's next <b>Tackle</b> when he circles back around and rams it from the side. Glameow hisses vehemently and at this point you notice out of the corner of your eye the strange swirling phenomena on the sandstone block. This time the text that appears reveals the words, <i>&quot;Use your head to pass this test&quot;</i> which doesn't do a great deal to put your mind at ease considering you're already trying to decipher the hidden meaning behind the riddle. Meanwhile, Glameow and Pr-aA are still battling it out, Pr-aA only just managing to avoid quite a lethal <b>Scratch</b> to the face before leaping at Glameow with a <b>Tackle</b>.<br />
<br />
The swirling starts again revealing the words, <i>&quot;To be rewarded with a larger quest&quot;</i> which from one viewpoint sounds quite interesting, but from another is the last thing you want right now. While the PokÃ©mon continue battling you watch as the sandstone swirls after each bit of damage Glameow takes from Pr-aA's neverending barrage of <b>Tackle</b>s. Both PokÃ©mon seem like they're about to pass out from exhaustion, but since it appears the words are only being revealed as Glameow becomes weaker and weaker, you continue to watch until the entire riddle is revealed as it's the only clue you have. Pr-aA soon finds himself wrapped in another of Glameow's death grips, the blue cat digging its claws in as deep as it can while they struggle on the floor, hissing and growling, until Pr-aA pushes his head forward with one quick, sharp movement, smacking into Glameow's skull. Glameow releases its grip along with a pained yowl that echoes throughout the room, leaping backward and sitting on the floor, apparently dazed. It shakes its head as though trying to clear itself of confusing thoughts, and when it looks up again you notice that its eye no longer have that glazed look they'd had before. Glameow in fact looks quite confused, as though it's not even sure where it is let alone how it got here or why its engaged in battle with total strangers, but when Pr-aA moves in to <b>Tackle</b>, it strikes back in defense with a hard <b>Scratch</b>. Looking back at the wall you see that the complete riddle has now revealed itself so you go over it in its entirety, trying to decipher its meaning.<br />

<div style="text-align: center"><i>Events are not always what they seem<br />

<b><u>TurtleKing</u>: </b>&quot;What have they done to me?&quot; the trainer sneers. &quot;NOTHING! That's what they've done!&quot;<br />
<br />
Pressing his foot down harder on the first Swinub which elicits a pained cry from the little Pig PokÃ©mon, the trainer looks disgustedly at it before turning his eyes back to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;This one here was supposed to fetch something that rightfully belongs to me while I look after his sister to make sure he comes back, but he couldn't even do that and now they both have to PAY! That kid had no right catching it after I spent MONTHS tracking it down! It's mine and I'm going to get it back with or without these useless PokÃ©mon!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, he kicks Swinub into the bushes and throws the net containing its sibling into the trees after it. His attitude is astounding, and although you're not quite sure what it is he's been tracking for months you're pretty sure that it's better off with whoever caught it than with this kid who doesn't seem at all fit to be a trainer. He then looks down at Phanpy and yells, &quot;What are you waiting for?! Get rid of them!&quot;<br />
<br />
Phanpy, seemingly more afraid of being in trouble with its trainer than with having its butt kicked, immediately rushes at Grove with a running <b>Tackle</b> only to be met with quite a forceful <b>Pound</b>. Both PokÃ©mon take some damage, but Phanpy isn't done yet. It rolls into a <b>Defense Curl</b> which puts a stop to Grove's <b>Leer</b> as he's unable to make eye contact. Phanpy spins on the spot for a few seconds, causing you to briefly wonder what it's trying to do, when all of a sudden it shoots forward with quite a stunning amount of speed behind it. Grove can do nothing to evade Phanpy's <b>Tackle</b> as the little Ground type uncurls in mid-air and barges into him, knocking them both over. Grove is quick to retaliate, regaining his feet and <b>Pounding</b> Phanpy for all he's worth. Phanpy is sent careening backward and straight toward the hotspring which you know is going to give you the win for this battle as there's no way Phanpy can survive a soaking after the damage it's already taken when all of a sudden the first Swinub you met comes racing out of the bushes and into Phanpy's path from an angle. Phanpy crashes straight into Swinub and though the two come very close to falling into the hotspring together, they manage to come to a tumbling halt just short of the edge. Swinub then looks up at Phanpy's trainer, squeaking angrily at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grah!&quot; he yells at Phanpy, frustrated. &quot;You're just as useless as your little friend. You can't even battle without them saving you! Pathetic! I need new PokÃ©mon, you're on your own.&quot; Turning around, the trainer walks off into the trees. &quot;Later,&quot; he says with a flick of his wrist, not even glancing back for one last look at the PokÃ©mon he's just abandoned. <br />
<br />
Looking down at Phanpy you see the sadness in its eyes which are welling up with tears. It looks devastated, perhaps not because it's sad to be free of the trainer who had treated it so badly, but because it feels rejected, not worthy of being trained after having fought as hard as it could and then being left behind regardless. Sniffing, Phanpy rises to its feet and slowly limps into the bushes in the opposite direction to which its former trainer had gone...</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Hearing the howl of the fallen Poochyena, Ace breaks out into a cold sweat and he realizes what was going on. Poochyena was calling in the troops.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's signaling distress. He's calling for help. We need to get this over with. Now.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ace cradles the Sandshrew in his arms before calling out to his starfish-warrior. The heat is increasingly getting more and more unbearable and he can feel it taking it's toll on Staryu just as much as he can feel it in himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry Staryu buddy, we'll finish this up soon.&quot; Ace said this reassuringly, though he too was beginning to wonder who would walk away from this battle alive.<br />
<br />
Ace's eardrums are again pierced by the Poochyena's howl and he can feel the Sandshrew quiver in his arms. Putting the heat aside, Ace prepares to finish off the battle before the Poochyena's cavalry arrived. Staryu was hurting, but so was Poochyena and Ace knew he could use this Howl to his advantage.<br />

&quot;Alright, Staryu, quick! While he's distracting himself! Let's do a <b>Tackle</b> then <b>Harden</b> then <b>Tackle</b> combination one more time! Rapid fire!&quot;</span></span></div>

Hiro watched in shock as he noticed the trainer literally abandon his Phanpy. Hiro, being a beginning trainer, had never experience a trainer, let alone a person, just walk away from something that was probably important to them. It was almost as if the trainer had no love for Phanpy to begin with.<br />
<br />
Hiro looked over at Grove as if to ask, &quot;What should we do?&quot; He then looked at the Swinub, recalling how they too were equally mistreated by the male trainer. Finally, he lay his gaze upon the Phanpy walking in the opposite direction of his former trainer. Being who he was, Hiro knew he had to do something. He wasn't just going to allow that Phanpy to be set into the wild with a broken haert.<br />
<br />
&quot;Phanpy! Wait!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hiro ran over and stopped the Phanpy. He kneeled in front of the Phanpy and extended his hand, &quot;Phanpy! You're awfully strong. Well not awfully. I mean it in a good way. You definitely held your own against Grove and I. I'm not going to just let your trainer disown you because you failed in battle. We all fail at times and we must learn from the failures. That said,&quot; he held out his hand as he stroked the Phanpy's head, &quot;I'd...I'd like for you to join my team.&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked over at the Swinub, thinking if he should ask them as well, unless they wanted to stay in their habitat. He'd definitely visit them if they decided to stay.<br />
<br />
Hiro reached into a pocket as he pulled out a <a href="http://bmgf.bulbagarden.net/showpost.php?p=497570&amp;postcount=1089" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fbmgf.bulbagarden.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D497570%26postcount%3D1089&amp;hash=5164912ee6ca2933c49369f42baf23f1" rel="nofollow noopener">Pokeball</a>. He extended it close to Phanpy's face, &quot;Please,&quot; he somewhat begged, &quot;come with me.&quot; He smiled slightly.<br />

<br />
<b><u>Lady Demoonica Darkmoon</u>: </b>The two struggling PokÃ©mon finally break apart, panting heavily and both quite tired. Glameow's eyes are still glazed over while following Pr-aA who circles the blue cat, watching and biding his time while giving himself a chance to catch his breath. Instructing him to attack you turn back to the sandstone block waiting to see if any more text is about to reveal itself, but nothing happens. Wondering if there is perhaps a hidden switch, you press your hand against the block but once again nothing happens. Turning your attention back to the PokÃ©mon you watch Pr-aA lunge for Glameow with another <b>Tackle</b>. Glameow dodges the attack, swatting its paw at him as it does so and <b>Scratch</b>ing him once more. Pr-aA now has several scratch marks, but Glameow is looking pretty tired, so tired that its unable to evade Pr-aA's next <b>Tackle</b> when he circles back around and rams it from the side. Glameow hisses vehemently and at this point you notice out of the corner of your eye the strange swirling phenomena on the sandstone block. This time the text that appears reveals the words, <i>&quot;Use your head to pass this test&quot;</i> which doesn't do a great deal to put your mind at ease considering you're already trying to decipher the hidden meaning behind the riddle. Meanwhile, Glameow and Pr-aA are still battling it out, Pr-aA only just managing to avoid quite a lethal <b>Scratch</b> to the face before leaping at Glameow with a <b>Tackle</b>.<br />
<br />
The swirling starts again revealing the words, <i>&quot;To be rewarded with a larger quest&quot;</i> which from one viewpoint sounds quite interesting, but from another is the last thing you want right now. While the PokÃ©mon continue battling you watch as the sandstone swirls after each bit of damage Glameow takes from Pr-aA's neverending barrage of <b>Tackle</b>s. Both PokÃ©mon seem like they're about to pass out from exhaustion, but since it appears the words are only being revealed as Glameow becomes weaker and weaker, you continue to watch until the entire riddle is revealed as it's the only clue you have. Pr-aA soon finds himself wrapped in another of Glameow's death grips, the blue cat digging its claws in as deep as it can while they struggle on the floor, hissing and growling, until Pr-aA pushes his head forward with one quick, sharp movement, smacking into Glameow's skull. Glameow releases its grip along with a pained yowl that echoes throughout the room, leaping backward and sitting on the floor, apparently dazed. It shakes its head as though trying to clear itself of confusing thoughts, and when it looks up again you notice that its eye no longer have that glazed look they'd had before. Glameow in fact looks quite confused, as though it's not even sure where it is let alone how it got here or why its engaged in battle with total strangers, but when Pr-aA moves in to <b>Tackle</b>, it strikes back in defense with a hard <b>Scratch</b>. Looking back at the wall you see that the complete riddle has now revealed itself so you go over it in its entirety, trying to decipher its meaning.<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center"><i>Events are not always what they seem<br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: gold">&quot;Well, I'd say it's 'lights' are on now, eh, Pr-aA?&quot; Solo chuckled. &quot;Leave it alone, I think it's not going to attack you unless you attack it now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh?&quot; Her Shinx looked up at her with a 'What?' kind of look.<br />
<br />
Solo repeated the lines outloud to her Shinx. &quot;It's light's are on, as in it's had it's senses knocked back into it.&quot; Pr-aA nodded in understanding and moved back away from the Glameow. &quot;Or I hope that's what the eerie swirly block is telling me! Pr-aA if you see anything like a new kind of 'light' tell me before I loose a hand to a well placed scratch, would ya?&quot; The Shinx sighed. &quot;Alright, let's see now... an orb, huh? Well then,&quot; she pulled free a Pokeball from her trainer belt, &quot;this is the only kind of orb I have.&quot;<br />
<br />
Solo walked a little closer to the Glameow and hunkered down. &quot;Come'ere kitty, we're not going to attack you again. I'm Solo and this Shinx is Pr-aA. Looks like you wandered into here too, didn't you?&quot; She held up the <a href="http://bmgf.bulbagarden.net/showpost.php?p=498061&amp;postcount=1092" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fbmgf.bulbagarden.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D498061%26postcount%3D1092&amp;hash=2f1a43029e7f2b3e7b2d633c14948ab9" rel="nofollow noopener">Pokeball</a>. &quot;Well, it's better to be with others even when lost, so would you allow me to catch you?&quot; She asked. Beside her Pr-aA, while tired and scratched up, tried his best to tell the Glameow that, too.</span><br />

<b><u>Slick Rick</u>: </b>With Poochyena's <b>Howl</b> ringing out across the desert, Staryu uses Poochy's distraction to its advantage, <b>Tackling</b> the pup hard. Poochyena is winded badly, but retaliates with a nasty <b>Bite</b> which results in a pained yelp as it cracks its teeth on Staryu's <b>Harden</b>ed body. Extremely uncomfortable in the desert heat, and very tired now, Staryu rams Poochyena with one last <b>Tackle</b> which finally causes Poochyena to drop to the ground, KOed. <b>Level up for Staryu.</b>.<br />

Relieved to finally be rid of the dark pup, you're about to run when Sandshrew leaps out of your arms, nattering away in PokÃ©mon language. It runs over to its mother and lays down on top of her, its pudgy little arms giving her the tightest cuddle it can while tears stream down its face. Though you can understand its distress you know you can't allow it the time it needs to grieve if you're all to get away safely, and when Staryu moves forward to talk to Sandshrew the little sand mouse looks tearily up at Staryu and nods. Reluctantly leaving its mothers side, Sandshrew begins digging into the sand and rock of the desert floor, and a minute later has made quite a deep hole. Scuttling out of the hole it returns to Sandslash's side and looks up at you pleadingly while pointing toward the hole. It appears this little one isn't prepared to go anywhere until its mother is shown the respect she deserves by being given a rightful burial...</span><br />

<b><u>Lady Demoonica Darkmoon</u>: </b>After reading over the riddle in its entirely, its hidden meaning suddenly hits home. <i>&quot;Small actions unveiling the larger scheme&quot;</i> must be referring to how parts of the riddle were being revealed as Glameow became weaker and weaker. <i>&quot;Look for light where there was none&quot;</i> obviously referring to Glameow &quot;waking up&quot; from its trance-like state and being able to think for itself. <i>&quot;Present to orb to show you've won&quot;</i> can only mean catching Glameow in a PokÃ©ball to demonstrate you've defeated it, but will Glameow's <i>willingness</i> to come with you rather than using the ball to forcefully capture it make any difference to the overall meaning of the riddle? You're about to find out.<br />
<br />
Putting a quick stop to the battle before either of the PokÃ©mon are hurt even more, Pr-aA seems a little confused as to why you'd do this considering the effort he's put in so far. Explaining it to him, he nods in understanding before sitting back and watching while you offer your PokÃ©ball to Glameow. The blue feline is too confused to really comprehend anything at all regarding what is happening as it has no idea at all of how it has ended up here, let alone who you are and why it is engaged in battle. Perhaps your speech has something to do with it, maybe Glameow is just too upset and confused to really care, or perhaps the fact that you seem friendly enough is a contributing factor, you're really not sure, but the end result is that the Lv.4 female Glameow accepts your offer, reaching out her paw and triggering the PokÃ©balls release mechanism before disappearing inside.<br />
<br />
Pleased with the new addition to your team you look around the chamber waiting for something to happen. For several interminably long moments, nothing seems to, but then you hear a sound and look to the far side of the chamber to see a hidden door reveal itself. <i>&quot;Only then can you move on to learn the secrets of those long gone&quot;</i>. Another path has revealed itself, one that is leading you deeper into the Ancient Tomb...<br />

<b><u>TurtleKing</u>: </b>Completely stunned by the harsh way the trainer had not only treated his Phanpy, but then proceeded to abandon it in front of an audience to even further degrade it, you watch helplessly as it limps off into the bushes. Looking to Grove for guidance, you do the only thing that seems humane, and call out for Phanpy to stop. Phanpy seems surprised, turning around and looking up at you curiously, its teary little eyes still full of misery. Trying your best to console Phanpy, you praise it on the way it had battled before gently stroking its head and offering it a PokÃ©ball along with a position on your team. Phanpy seems shocked, yet pleased at the same time, and after seeing how you'd gone out of your way to defend a couple of PokÃ©mon you didn't even know, is aware of the fact that if it travels with you it will never be mistreated again. It looks deeply into your eyes for a few seconds before letting out an excited little squeal and reaching its nose out to press down on the PokÃ©ball's release button. Phanpy is sucked inside, and while you watch the capture light turn green you can't help but be pleased the little Lv.3 female is now a part of your team. Swinub seems pleased as well, his little eyes glistening with pleasure before it nods toward the bushes where his sister is still tangled in the net. Looks like you have one final chore to see to before continuing on your journey...<br />

Putting a quick stop to the battle before either of the PokÃ©mon are hurt even more, Pr-aA seems a little confused as to why you'd do this considering the effort he's put in so far. Explaining it to him, he nods in understanding before sitting back and watching while you offer your PokÃ©ball to Glameow. The blue feline is too confused to really comprehend anything at all regarding what is happening as it has no idea at all of how it has ended up here, let alone who you are and why it is engaged in battle. Perhaps your speech has something to do with it, maybe Glameow is just too upset and confused to really care, or perhaps the fact that you seem friendly enough is a contributing factor, you're really not sure, but the end result is that the Lv.4 female Glameow accepts your offer, reaching out her paw and triggering the PokÃ©balls release mechanism before disappearing inside.<br />
<br />
Pleased with the new addition to your team you look around the chamber waiting for something to happen. For several interminably long moments, nothing seems to, but then you hear a sound and look to the far side of the chamber to see a hidden door reveal itself. <i>&quot;Only then can you move on to learn the secrets of those long gone&quot;</i>. Another path has revealed itself, one that is leading you deeper into the Ancient Tomb...<br />
<br />
<br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: gold">Solo's smile grew as the Glameow touched the Pokeball with it's paw. A red energy surrounded the cat like Pokemon pulling it into the ball, it shook for a few moments then a soft dinging told of the successful capture. Solo's Pokedex beeped as it registered the new Pokemon.<br />
<br />
Standing up Solo looked around, still hoping that this was what the riddle had meant. Pr-aA huffs and lays flat out on the floor, she really needed to get him into a shape that wasn't considered round ball of blue and blue-black fluff. Nothing seemed to be happening though, until the sound of sliding rock drew her attention. Looking she saw a door slid open.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it looks like we won't be resting in this room forever, eh Pr-aA?&quot; She asked the Shinx. He looked up at her with a 'Do we have to?' kind of look. Seeing this she moved over to the newly opened path. &quot;Well I guess it can't hurt to rest up some before moving on, but let's do it outside of this chamber, ja?&quot; At the doorway, Solo started fiddling with her Pokedex. She looked up from it, then down at Pr-aA. &quot;I'm gon'a let her rest in ball for now, but later you can properly meet our new member, <b>Katir</b>.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pr-aA considered it for a moment, then picked himself up off the ground, following Solo out of the room. He wouldn't like being locked back up in the room anymore than his trainer would.</span></span></div>

<b><u>TerminatorTotodile</u>: </b>Not knowing who or what your enemy is you react on instinct alone, instructing Corsola to attack the shadowy form in front of you. She doesn't waste a moment, leaping straight out of your arms to land a successful <b>Tackle</b> on your unknown enemy. A pained grunt is the only sound you hear in response, and as you begin to overcome the initial shock of the surprise attack you start to make out the small form of what appears to be a tiny humpbacked creature. The thing retaliates by hurling something at Corsola, it's <b>Mud-slap</b> splatting all over her face and torso. Considering your environment, you have to wonder if the gunk it had hurled is actually <i>mud</i>, but prefer not to think about the possibility of it being... something else. Not really knowing what she's up against Corsola stays back, <b>Harden</b>ing her shell in preparation of the mystery creature's next attack. At first nothing happens, but then the thing in the shadows moves forward slowly, the reptilian yellow eyes and blue body of a Croagunk emerging into the dim light. It grins up at you with a challenging stare, and while your mind processes this new information a faint cry can be heard in the distance. &quot;Help meee...&quot; cries Kaitlyn's weak and frightened voice...</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: lemonchiffon">Mary watched quietly as she made out the shape of the figure. When the creature flung gunk at Corsola, Mary couldn't help but gag at the thought that it wasn't mud, but quickly got her mind off the idea before she could throw up. She watches as the figure steps forward, revealing itself to be a Croagunk. Her mind races, trying to think up plans while processing this new information. After a little bit of thinking, Mary hears Kaitlyn's faint and distant cry. For a moment, her mind breaks away from the battle, and turns towards finding the direction Kaitlyn's cry came from.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry Kaitlyn! I'm coming!&quot; Mary screams, completely ignoring the Croagunk.<br />
<br />
&quot;COR!&quot; Corsola snaps immediately, bringing Mary's attention back to the battle.<br />
<br />
Once again Mary thinks, but only for a very short moment. She starts talking to Corsola, keeping her eyes fixed on the Croagunk so as not to get distracted again. &quot;Okay, try a <b>Confuse Ray</b> to distract it. Then, once that's done, use an <b>Icicle Spear</b>, and finish up with a <b>Bubble</b>.&quot;</span></span></div>

<span style="color: darkorange"><b><u>Desert of Illusion</u></b> - Please reply in <b>darkorange</b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Slick Rick</u>: </b>With Poochyena's <b>Howl</b> ringing out across the desert, Staryu uses Poochy's distraction to its advantage, <b>Tackling</b> the pup hard. Poochyena is winded badly, but retaliates with a nasty <b>Bite</b> which results in a pained yelp as it cracks its teeth on Staryu's <b>Harden</b>ed body. Extremely uncomfortable in the desert heat, and very tired now, Staryu rams Poochyena with one last <b>Tackle</b> which finally causes Poochyena to drop to the ground, KOed. <b>Level up for Staryu.</b>.<br />
<br />
Relieved to finally be rid of the dark pup, you're about to run when Sandshrew leaps out of your arms, nattering away in PokÃ©mon language. It runs over to its mother and lays down on top of her, its pudgy little arms giving her the tightest cuddle it can while tears stream down its face. Though you can understand its distress you know you can't allow it the time it needs to grieve if you're all to get away safely, and when Staryu moves forward to talk to Sandshrew the little sand mouse looks tearily up at Staryu and nods. Reluctantly leaving its mothers side, Sandshrew begins digging into the sand and rock of the desert floor, and a minute later has made quite a deep hole. Scuttling out of the hole it returns to Sandslash's side and looks up at you pleadingly while pointing toward the hole. It appears this little one isn't prepared to go anywhere until its mother is shown the respect she deserves by being given a rightful burial...</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Ace gives a faint smile and nods at the distressed Sandshrew. He crouches down next to the Pokemon and speaks with a soft tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I see what you want to do and I think it's a great idea.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ace heads toward Sandshrew's parent and lifts the mother Pokemon from the ground. He cradles it and slowly makes his way toward the hole which was dug by Sandshrew. He gently places the Sandslash into the grave and fills it, giving the Ground-type an appropriate burial. Once the burial complete, Staryu cast a water spout over the gravesite producing a beautiful rainbow in the hot desert heat as a sign to Sandshrew that it's mother will always be watching over it. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry you had to witness all this,&quot; Ace said to Sandshrew, &quot;but I want you to know that you did the right thing and that your mother loved you very much. And I'm glad that you found me, because I think you and me and Staryu can become great friends. What do you say? Would you like to come with us?&quot;<br />

<b><u>TurtleKing</u>: </b>Completely stunned by the harsh way the trainer had not only treated his Phanpy, but then proceeded to abandon it in front of an audience to even further degrade it, you watch helplessly as it limps off into the bushes. Looking to Grove for guidance, you do the only thing that seems humane, and call out for Phanpy to stop. Phanpy seems surprised, turning around and looking up at you curiously, its teary little eyes still full of misery. Trying your best to console Phanpy, you praise it on the way it had battled before gently stroking its head and offering it a PokÃ©ball along with a position on your team. Phanpy seems shocked, yet pleased at the same time, and after seeing how you'd gone out of your way to defend a couple of PokÃ©mon you didn't even know, is aware of the fact that if it travels with you it will never be mistreated again. It looks deeply into your eyes for a few seconds before letting out an excited little squeal and reaching its nose out to press down on the PokÃ©ball's release button. Phanpy is sucked inside, and while you watch the capture light turn green you can't help but be pleased the little Lv.3 female is now a part of your team. Swinub seems pleased as well, his little eyes glistening with pleasure before it nods toward the bushes where his sister is still tangled in the net. Looks like you have one final chore to see to before continuing on your journey...<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: lightsteelblue"><span style="font-size: 9px">Hiro grinned happily as he stared at his newly acquired Phanpy's Pokeball. His sights then were set on untangling the Swinub. Immediately, he and Grove ran over to the bushes, following the other Swinub sibling, &quot;Alright, before we leave, we better set ya free, right?&quot; He chuckled a bit as he grabbed the ends of the net, pulling them away from eachother until the net snapped open. The opening provided freedom to the Swinub.<br />
<br />
Hiro smiled even more, &quot;Alright. I guess this is where we cross paths. Grove, we better get out of here and get into some warm.&quot; Grove nodded silently as it also nodded at the Swinubs.<br />
<br />
The trainer and Pokemon proceeded to exit, waving goodbye to Swinubs, &quot;You two take care of one another, you hear?&quot;</span></span></div>

<b><u>TerminatorTotodile</u>: </b>Now that you have a better idea of what you're up against, you know you have a fighting chance of defeating it, but Kaitlyn's cry for help distracts you from the immediate situation long enough for Croagunk to make the first move. While you call out to the young girl to let her know help is on the way, Croagunk releases a war like cry in defiance and moves in to attack Corsola with <b>Astonish</b>. Corsola responds by calling your attention back to the battle which brings you back to the here and now. You can't get to Kaitlyn without getting past Croagunk which means you'll need to ensure you get rid of it as soon as possible before anything bad can happen to her. Considering you're not even sure what kind of immediate danger the girl is in, the faster you act the better as her voice already sounds quite weak. Relaying your instructions to Corsola the little Coral PokÃ©mon acts fast, launching a bright ray of light at Crogunk which in the dark confines of the tunnel has an astounding effect. Corsola's <b>Confuse Ray</b> works wonders, befuddling the little frog-like PokÃ©mon who sends a <b>Mud-slap</b> splatting into the tunnel wall. Using this turn of events to her advantage, Corsola proceeds to follow up by launching several small <b>Icicle Spear</b>s at Croagunk. The small, freezing projectiles bombard the frog, some even opening tiny cuts in its skin. It cries out in pain, refocusing upon Corsola before shouting loudly, <b>Astonish</b>ing Corsola who immediately stops bombarding Croagunk with her tiny spears of ice. Blinking with surprise, she releases several <b>Bubble</b>s which hit Croagunk and explode with a multitude of successive pops before she is almost blinded by a rather unpleasant <b>Mud-slap</b>ping to the face...</span><br />

<br />
<b><u>Slick Rick</u>: </b>Though you're well aware of the danger involved with staying here any longer, especially considering what could very well be on its way right now, there is no way you can deny Sandshrew its request. Glancing nervously across the desert you take the time to kneel down and smile at the little sand mouse, agreeing to grant Sandslash the dignity of a burial as a sign of respect not only for the fight she'd put up to protect her offspring, but to help Sandshrew to move on with the peace of mind coming from knowing that its mother has been properly put to rest. Lifting Sandslash from the ground, you gently place her into the hole Sandshrew has dug before filling it in. Staryu, touched by the moment, plays its part by spinning on the spot while spouting water into the air. In the desert heat, the water evaporates before it even hits the ground, but the misty spray leaves behind a beautiful little rainbow which hangs in the air just above Sandslash's grave. While you stand and watch, a shiver runs up your spine as you feel Sandshrew's little paw in your hand. Closing your fingers around it as a sign of consolation, you're surprised to see Sandshrew sitting silently by the grave with tears in its eyes as it looks up at the rainbow Staryu has made to signify that Sandslash will always be watching over her baby. So if it's not Sandshrew beside you, then what...? <br />
<br />
Looking down you find nothing is there but upon opening your hand you find a <b>Soft Sand</b> laying in your palm. Though this is a strange occurrence indeed, you have no doubt about the fact that while Sandslash may be gone in body, her spirit is lingering on and that she's grateful to you for having helped her baby. Turning your attention back to Sandshrew you offer it some kind words, assuring it that its mother had loved it very much and that you're happy it had found you in its time of need. Removing an empty PokÃ©ball from your pocket you hold it out to the little sand mouse, offering it a home. Sandshrew's teary little eyes look between your face and the PokÃ©ball several times before it smiles and nods. Turning back to its mothers grave, Sandshrew gently touches its paw against the tiny mound, saying goodbye to the parent who had sacrificed her own life to protect it before turning back to you and willingly triggering the release mechanism on your PokÃ©ball. Sandshrew is drawn inside by the red capture beam, and now that you know the <b>Lv.4 Sandshrew</b> is safe and sound inside of your PokÃ©ball you know it's time to get out of here, and as you're preparing to head off you hear a hair raising roar in the distance which you know is your cue to hurry along and leave <i>now</i>. Casting one final glance toward the rainbow covered grave, a light breeze passes over the sand causing it to shift and move into a pattern. Taking a closer look, the etched image in the sand creates the sign of Sandslash's paw pointing in the opposite direction to which you were about to head. Even in death, Sandslash will always be watching over her baby...<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>I loved your reply so much that I'm allowing you the choice of deciding Sandshrew's gender. I'm kind of hoping you'll hold on to this little one, but if not then I hope you've at least enjoyed your introduction to FB. Your capture has not only unlocked your rights to the Egg House, but also your release from the Arcane Realm. Upon replying to your update you're free to post in all areas of FB including mainstream zones. Please remember that to begin with you can only enter two of the four zones available (Serebii's Fizzytopia, Bulbagarden's Cascadia, or UPN's Cloud Garden and Twilight Realm). Good luck and best with your future FB adventures ^-^</i></span></span></div>
