</blockquote><span style="color: gold"><span style="font-size: 9px">Jamie and Volcape, his trusty Chimchar, had reached their destination: One group of areas known collectively as the Arcane Realm. Although the place was as alien as Sinnoh was when he moved there, Jamie nevertheless felt a surge of adrenaline fly through his veins at the thought of the adventures he would face. Volcape sat on his shoulder, squeaking happily as they reached the entrance to some place called the Ancient Tomb. Remembering from the studies of the realm that the tomb was supposedly full of treasure, he was ecstatic on entering the place and so the two walked warily into the entrance, wondering what could be inside as the outside light slowly faded to give way to the natural interior light, with the single major light source being the everlasting flame burning from the Chimchar's rear.</span></span></div>

Admiring Harumi's fighting spirit you absentmindedly run your fingers along the smooth surface of your second Pokéball, tempted to call Phoebe out should she be needed. Taking Harumi's guts into consideration though, you hold off for the time being, allowing her the opportunity to finish the battle she's begun. Harumi, panting a little after that last nasty hit, races in for another attack, leaping into the air and kicking her little legs forward to <b>Scratch</b> Poochyena right across the nose. Harumi squeals with delight in response to Poochy's pained cry, but the mangy mutt is quick to retaliate, lunging forward to slam into your little chicken with another <b>Tackle</b>. Harumi is looking rather sore and tired, the scratches on Poochyena appear to be stinging quite badly, and Poochy's trainer is smirking arrogantly. Meanwhile, Swinub looks up at you and squeaks, a pleading look in its eyes, as though asking for your help...</span></span>

Kasai looked toward the Swinub, trying to see if it could be released. She could not tell this far away. &quot;Harumi! You know what to do!&quot; Harumi moved toward the Poohcyena with less energy, but more determination. <i>What will come now? Will Harumi make it through this? What will happen to her? What will happen to all of us?</i> &quot;Harumi! FIGHT IT!&quot; Kasai screamed in tension, hurting her own ears.

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: limegreen"><b><u>Forest of Adventure</u></b> - Please reply in <b>limegreen</b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Trillim</u>: </b>Deciding the best way to start out on your Pokémon adventure is to travel to a forest known specifically for providing just that, you enter the lush green woodland with an air of excitement. With so much to look forward to there's no telling what may lay ahead, so your best bet is to take it as it comes. Sougawa seems to agree, and though he's way out of his element wandering through the forest, he's enjoying himself nonetheless. The sounds of nature surround you and though no forest creatures choose to let you see them you know they're around, watching your movements from a safe distance while they try to work out if you're friend or foe. It's not the Pokémon hiding in the forest that have your interest, however, as the steady beat of a drum somewhere in the distance has managed to snag your immediate attention. Sougawa looks up at you questioningly, wondering if you may have some answers as to what the sound may mean, but seeing as you're just as baffled as him, you can offer him no answers. The next minute a shrill scream cuts through the air like a knife, startling both of you, and from the sound of it, it's coming from the same direction as the drumbeat. Sougawa looks up at you again, this time wondering if you have any intention of investigating, both of you knowing full well that scream sounded very much like trouble waiting to happen should you decide to investigate.</span></span>

<br />
The sound, no matter how mysterious and unusual, was obviously just the thing they'd been waiting for. It certainly would mean trouble, Oza knew that, but trouble was just part of being on an adventure. And besides, what if the creature that had made that noise was in trouble? What then? They couldn't just let it be without at least giving it a cursory glance. &quot;Yeah, buddy,&quot; Oza announced to the questioning Pokémon, &quot;Let's go check it out! Sounds like trouble, I know, but isn't that part of being on an adventure?&quot;<br />
<br />
The little Buizel nodded once, his eyes just as keen as Oza's for the adventure before them, before they were off, marching to the beat of the resounding drum in the distance and trying to locate the source of that shrill cry. </span></span></div>

<b><u>allsystemsaredown</u>: </b>With Electrike now unable to use its most harming attack, Torchlight is pumped at the thought of showing the little pup what a real battle is all about. Something in its expression tells you it already knows its in trouble, for the disapproving look it had shot its boy trainer clearly conveyed the fact it doesn't particularly trust in his judgment. Whatever the case, Electrike follows the screaming child's instructions, whether due to obedience or knowing that this battle could teach the boy a lesson or two you don't know, but it races forward to <b>Tackle</b> Cyndaquil only to end up coughing up smoke as the thick <b>Smokescreen</b> Torchlight has just released to shield herself has helped to protect her exact location from her enemy. From amidst the cloud of smoke Torchlight listens carefully, honing in on where Electrike's coughing is coming from, before lunging forward and <b>Tackling</b> it. The two Pokémon come rolling out of the dense cloud to come to a stop before Pidgey who still doesn't appear to be one hundred percent after all of the damage Electrike's attacks had done to it. The frightened bird squawks weakly, wanting the battling duo to move well away from it, but before they can re-engage, Torchlight traps Electrike in his <b>Leer</b>ing gaze. Electrike is temporarily spellbound, unable to attack, while its trainer stomps the ground even harder, screaming for it to paralyze Cyndaquil. Seems the kid still isn't learning anything, but Torchlight certainly is...</span></span>

The girl realized that the Pidgey they had been fighting over was not too healthy itself. The girl felt sorry for it, but now was no time to think of such things. She realized that the boy was about two or three steps away from homicidal and that she needed to put him back into place before she could take her mind off the battle. The next step was to use the assault <u>first</u>, while Electrike was still scared of Cyndaquil and his menacing eyeballs. She had it all planned out. &quot;Torchlight, here's our plan. Tackle! Leer! Smokescreen!&quot;</span></span></div>

<b><u>Qball</u>: </b>Entering the mystical forest wonderland of the legendary Forest of Adventure with McCuddles lapping up the attention you're giving him, you wander along for several minutes taking in the beauty of your surroundings. This forest has a special aura about it, a distinct feeling of something ancient which makes your journey that much more special as you wonder what mysteries and adventures it has to offer. After several minutes you stop when you hear the faint sound of what you think is crying, and curious to know what there is to be upset about in such beautiful surroundings, you follow the sound to find a little Wurmple huddling over the limp body of a dead Beautifly. The Beautifly is obviously this little ones mother, and you can't help but feel pity for the poor orphaned bug, but before you have a chance to think about it, let alone react in any way, a rustling in the bushes catches your attention and you turn to see a Koffing floating by a nearby tree, staring angrily at you. It appears this toxic blob is the one responsible for Beautifly's untimely demise, and it doesn't seem to want you around to stop it from finishing off Wurmple as well..</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: limegreen"><span style="font-size: 9px">Hearing the sound of what seems to be crying, Abbi walks in the direction it is coming from. Spotting a small Wurmple huddling by the body of what appears to be its mother, Abbi begins to feel very sorry for the poor Wurmple, only to turn around to find the murderer itself floating by a tree and giving her an angry look. Immediately jumping into action without a single thought crossing her mind, Abbi stands directly in front of the Wurmple and the dead Beautifly so that the Koffing cannot get to them, tossing a Pokeball into the air to reveal her Rattata. Sitting up in attention, the Rattata gives the Koffing the same angry look that it's giving his trainer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, McCuddles, teach this thing a lesson. Get in there with a <b>Quick Attack</b>, then catch it off guard and use <b>Tail Whip</b> to distract it, then hit it with a <b>Tackle</b>.&quot; Barking orders at her Pokemon, Abbi looks back and forth between the Koffing, McCuddles, and the Wurmple, never moving her head but only her eyes.</span></span></div>

Though you would think the sudden attack upon your Pokémon will be something to be concerned about, a strange sensation rushes through you at the thought of finding yourself in your very first battle situation. Omega can certainly use the experience, and if you play your cards right you may even end up with a capture. Pushing all negative thoughts to the back of your mind you immediately issue your instructions, and although it takes Omega a moment to register what you've said due to his surprise at having suddenly become this little Natu's worst enemy, he reacts out of defense if nothing more. Scared out of his wits, he extends his claws, reaches out, and swats at the tiny bird, <b>Scratch</b>ing it. Natu is surprised, hopping backward and <b>Leer</b>ing threateningly at Omega, freezing him to the spot. It seems Omega has his work cut out for him with this little one...[/color]</span>

Potato grinned inwardly. This was absoulotuly thrilling, and he couldn’t imagine how much more it would be if he was commanding huge monsters, like Tyranitar or Wailord, instead of little forest creatures.<br />
<br />
Adrenalin still pumping in his veins, Potato quickly skated over his options mentally. Not that he had many. He finially decided he would stop the Natu from evading any of Omega’s possible future attacks, that attack. Then in the back corner of his mind he realized that his Sentret could learn Surf. He decided he would try that, but still scratch up the pshychic bird incase the surf didn't work.<br />
<br />
“Omega, you’re going to want to use <b>Foresight</b> first off!” Potato yelled “Then try and see if you can get a <b>surf</b> to come here to attack Natu with, then finish by <b>scratching</b> the bird incase our water idea doesn’t work!</span></span></div>

She was curious to find out whether the two villages that supposedly reside there were real or not, also to find out what kinds of Pokemon could live in such a harsh environment. Entering the desert it wasn't long before she began to regret her decision. Collapsing to the ground she said to the sky &quot;c'mon, just one little cloud to block out the sun...&quot;<br />
<br />
Not a single cloud in the sky, much to Alina's dismay. She looked over to see her Cyndaquil, Igneous, happily playing in the sand. He loved the heat and the surroundings, especially the fact that there wasn't a drop of water in sight. He was in his own little world rolling down small sand hills. Alina got back up and looked at her Cyndaquil halfway buried in sand now and said &quot;I really wish you were a water type right now.&quot; Igneous gave her a repulsed look as if saying &quot;how dare you wish me to be a water type?&quot; and continued to jump in the sand as Alina followed.</span></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: limegreen"> When Tyson stumbled upon the Forest of Adventure he decided to go and explore the fantastic things that could lay inside it. &quot;This place is so beautiful!&quot; were the only words Tyson could muster up to descrive the area he was in. He was so intriegued at the area around him that he decided Freeze should see it too. After reaching for his pokeball Tyson released his Sneasel to see how he would react. Out of a flash of red light appeared the Ice/Dark type.&quot;What do you think buddy, is this place awesome or what?&quot; <br />

After hours of stumbling through vegetation Tyson and Sneasel decided to take a break. Tyson decided that it was time for Freeze to return to his pokeball and rest.Then out of nowhere he heard a rumbling noise. &quot;Grrroowlllll&quot;. &quot;Thats my stomach, I'm starving.

<b><u>Empoleon Dynamite</u>: </b>While Brawly is struggling with Beedrill, you're drawn to Teddiursa whose complete change in temperament during the past minute has helped you to see it just as it really is - a very frightened baby bear. Knowing you can't just leave it here after the battle is over, you resolve to ensure it's alright before moving on, but for the time being your main priority is the ongoing battle. If Brawly is to have any chance at all of winning, he needs to get Beedrill onto the ground which is a lot easier said than done. A random thought pops into your mind though, and thinking about it, you realise it may just work. Relaying your instructions to Totodile, He nods vigorously, grabs hold of Beedrill's antennae as hard as he can and then yanks back on them with all his might. Beedrill is so shocked it doesn't know which way is up or down, the agony it's experiencing do intense that it temporarily forgets it needs to keep its wings moving. The two Pokémon drop to the ground, Brawly leaping off of Beedrill just before impact in order to avoid crashing headlong into the forest floor. Beedrill lands awkwardly, injuring its left wing and making it impossible to fly properly. It looks up at brawly, so enraged it quite literally sees red, before it unleashes a barrage of <b>Poison Sting</b> needles at Brawly who is so proud of himself that he forgets to dodge. The needles pelt into him, a couple piercing his skin and succeeding in poisoning him...</span></span>

<span style="color: limegreen">The poison Sting left Brawly in intense pain. Wes couldn’t help feel he was pushing his Totodile too far. <i>Using strategy may have helped alot, but maybe there could have been an easier way to go around this.</i> Brawly interrupted Wes’ thoughts with a heated growl: It was clear Beedrill had hit Brawly’s boiling point.<br />
“Time for an all out offence; Charge towards Beedrill and keep swipe it with your <b>Scratch</b> attack! If it tries to fly out of your reach, hit it with a powerful <b>Water Gun</b>!” Without hesitating, Brawly charged towards the Beedrill. Wes and Teddiursa were both eager to see which hot-headed Pokemon would triumph.<br />

<br />
<b>empoleon dynamite</b> ~ Clutching the tiny bear Pokemon to your arms you survey your ‘strategy’ in motion and whilst Brawly managed to down the vicious Beedrill he had paid for it. He had a warm red tone to his cheeks as poison seeped into his veins eating away at him from within. Teddiursa casts Brawly a sorrowful look as if it knew how bad a poisoning could feel and found strength and courage enough to make its presence known and cheered Brawly on. Brawly fights through the stinging pain gripping his body and let’s loose a hateful growl at the bee that was currently trying to fly to no avail. Brawly was now thorough ticked off and seemed to be itching to inflict some pain. Deciding that putting strategic battle plans aside for an all or nothing assault you instruct Brawly with what to do next. He lets loose a roar and charges towards Beedrill who looks up in time to see an eneraged Totodile bolting towards it and Brawly lets lose a vicious <b>Scratch</b> that leaves a large cut down Beedrill’s abdomen. Beedrill whines in pain but is not about to give up. With Brawly within a close distance it pulls back its spines before jutting them out striking Brawly hard once in his abdomen, once more in his head and one final time in his right thigh. That <b>Fury Attack</b> sure was fueled by fury and made it all the more powerful. Brawly was cringing with pain and grit his teeth before deciding to soak Beedrill anyway. The <b>Water Gun</b> hit Beedrill point blank and pushed it along the ground. It was looking a right sorry sight now and Teddiursa cheered from within your arms having cheered up at the sight of victory being near. Brawly grins but cries out as the poison builds in his body and saps his strength making him fall to one knee. It was true that Beedrill was looking sodden and beaten but Brawly was slowly succumbing to the poison, it was just of question of who was going to fall first. <br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Trillim</b> ~ The sound of drums was enticing enough to catch you and your Pokemon’s attention. Although you assumed the sound meant trouble, teamed with the scream how could it be anything else, it still sent a thrill of excitement running down your spine. This was going to be your very first adventure together and you were prepared to face whatever trouble you may encounter. Oza agrees to seek out the sounds and the both you using your senses following the constant thrum. The drum beat gets louder and louder as you move further through the lush forest until it seems like the only sound there. It’s almost intoxicating with its constant rhythm drawing you both ever closer. Another scream startles you as its pitch is higher and volume much louder than before, you must be close. <br />
<br />
Small orange lights and a sense of heat hits you and you crouch behind a bush pushing the leaves aside to get a view of what lies behind. It appears to be a large clearing with several small wood and mud huts built in the trees. A large fire burns in its centre, intricate designs etched into the dirt around it. Several Seedot dance around the fire with a few Nuzleaf hitting home-made drums of leaves and logs, they all appear to have mud painted on their bodies in similar intricate designs. They chant to themselves and in the centre of the clearing behind the fire stands a lone Shiftry looking solemn. The screams appear to be coming from a young girl tied to one of the trees with thick rope a small penguin Pokemon known as Piplup tied next to her. She fearfully eyes the grass Pokemon before trying to wiggle free of the ropes binding her. As if sensing you watching her gaze moves over to the bushes you hide behind and her brown eyes widen and fill with hope. It’s obvious that this young girl is in trouble but are you willing to help her? <br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Qball</b> ~ You glance from the orphaned Wurmple to the vicious Koffing and quickly jump into action leaping before the little worm Pokemon who remains nuzzling its mothers side soft tears falling from its eyes, cascading down its red cheeks. You aren’t about to let this brute kill off another innocent Pokemon. Koffing glares at you, its anger now directed away from the Wurmple and its mother towards you. You summon your starter Pokemon, a small Rattata named McCuddles who despite the large size difference stares down the Koffing with strong defiance and anger. Koffing meets his stare and its thick skin stretches to form a sickening grin. It lets loose a loud snort of laughter, apparently amused by such a tiny Pokemon challenging it however McCuddles is far from amused by Koffing’s actions.<br />
<br />
With his instructions received he leaps into action ready to exact some revenge on behalf of Wurmple and commence his very first battle. Koffing still laughing to itself manages to keep a close eye on your Rattata. McCuddles begins to quicken and with a boost of exordinary speed zips off out of sight before ramming into Koffing with a nice <b>Quick Attack</b>. Koffing floats backwards expelling some noxious gases from the impact, a small grimace on its face but it’s soon replace by that constant irritating grin. McCuddles continues on with his assault and leaps around whipping his tail in an effort to reduce Koffing’s defenses but Koffing merely floats forward and rams into McCuddles with a <b>Tackle</b> throwing the small mouse off balance. McCuddles shakes off the hard blow and prepares a <b>Tackle</b> of his own running forward to cover the distance between himself and the poison gas ball. Just as he hits Koffing a cloud of purple gas envelops them both. Koffing easily dodges Rattata’s attack and McCuddles falls to the ground a sick look in his face. That <b>Poison Gas</b> attack has left him looking rather ill, poison slowly trickling into his veins.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Pyschopath</b> ~ Upon your arrival to the Arcane Realm you find yourself standing in front of vast expanse of trees that is the Forest of Adventure. Deciding it’s as good a place as any to explore you enter the undergrowth and begin your journey. Inside you can see that large trees block out a lot of sunlight but let the odd bright beam filter through. Large bushes filled with flowers of all different colours and scents line the path you traverse making it quite a beautiful environment to explore. You decide that you should share this experience your starter Pokemon and release your Sneasel aptly named Freeze asking him what he thought of his new surroundings. Pleased enough to travel out of his ball Freeze walks alongside you through the vast forest and after a good few hours of walking you both decide to take a short rest. Just as you decide to return Freeze to his Pokeball to rest properly you hear a low grumbling noise that suddenly grows louder. Looking down to your stomach you laugh with embarrassment, it’s so loud it filled the forest, you must be hungry. Freeze rolls his eyes before following you further into the forest now in search of food. You travel for another hour and begin to lose hope of ever finding anything remotely edible and even start looking at Freeze with a hungry look in your eyes, one Freeze is hasty to remove. Suddenly an apple rolls by your feet and comes to a stop in front of you. Looking around you can’t see where it could have come from, there are no apple trees in this part of the forest; it just seemed to leap out of the bush … like it wanted you to eat it, how lucky! Excitedly you bend down to pick up the apple when you a hear a high pitched war cry come from the bushes and a white and blue blur flies out from the undergrowth and latches onto the apple for dear life. It casts its little black eyes up to you and glares as if saying ‘this is my apple, back off’ The Pachirisu is quick to pick up the apple keeping it in its death grip. You could leave this little squirrel to its meal and search for food elsewhere or maybe you want to fight for it, it did roll to you after all.</span><br />

<br />
<b>allsystemsaredown</b> ~ With the battle now swiftly in your favour and the condition of the poor downed Pidgey more worse than it first seemed you feel the need to take out this threat. The young boy who was your opponent was breathing heavily, as if he had just run a marathon his little face going red from anger, it seems though he hadn’t considered losing this battle. Running through a game plan in your mind you focus on assaulting the Electrike whilst it was still locked in Torchlight’s fierce Leer before adding a few more of Torchlight’s attacks into the mix. The smoke is starting to lift and anyone that would pass this part of town would wonder why there was an intermittent cloud of black fog appearing behind these trees. Torchlight drops his Leer and rushes the electric doggie striking him hard and the throwing him along the ground, with Electrike so distracted it had taken a lot more damage. Electrike is starting to pant now these repeated <b>Tackle</b> attacks leaving it bruised and wearing it down.<br />
<br />
“Sparky I said use your Thunder Wave, paralyse that stupid rat NOW. You hear me Thunder Wave NOW, NOW, NOW!!” The boy yells his face turning an ugly shade of purple. <br />
<br />
Electrike casts an annoyed glance back at its trainer, not happy to be constantly yelled at but summons electrical energy, well tries to. It digs deep and manages to pull a few sparks that zip towards Torchlight who prepares to dodge before it fizzles out not even reaching the Cyndaquil. Taking his opportunity Torchlight fixed the Electrike with another fierce <b>Leer</b> making the already dejected dog shiver in fear; it was beginning to doubt its own abilities. Cyndaquil breathes in and instead of a fog of black smoke a few small wisps leaves his mouth. He tries again with the same result. It seems that he’s now having the same problem as Electrike, using <b>Smokescreen</b> repeatedly has left him out of smoke to breathe, he’d need time to churn up some more. He clenches his little fists together irate that he had failed in that move and even more so when the boy laughs.<br />
<br />
“HA HA HA HA, not a strong as you thought. We’re still better and you and your fiery rat are gonna lose … LOSE. Go now Sparky; Tackle it hard and Tackle again even harder.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>RaunchyFad</b> ~ Pouting disappointedly at the disappearing sausages, those that were left in such a state it was unsanitary to eat, you and Rocky dejectedly walk on. You decide to continue the hunt for food and as your stomach roars for the world to hear you pick up a handful of acorns and begin to munch on them. They’re a far cry from hot tasty sausages but you eat them anyway only stopping when your mind begins to compare the taste of acorns to Rocky, a sick thought indeed. Following Rocky who knew nothing of your disturbing thoughts you head back into town on the search for food. It’s not long before the sumptuous smells of hot baking bread reaches your nostrils, the smells coming from a quaint little café with chairs and tables set up outside. Unbeknownst to you a pair of eyes follows you. You walk up to the entrance and peer inside to see several people dining on pastries and breads talking animatedly amongst them. The owner of the café spots you and beckons you inside. You hesitantly enter knowing that you had no money to purchase anything off their menu but are lead to table and you and Rocky sit at a chair each. He hands a lunch menu to you and you feel something push the tablecloth away and skirt past you leg. Taken off guard you look down and see nothing unusual. You look at the menu and feel your hunger grow at every item on it each one with a little descriptive picture that makes your mouth water. A young woman approaches you and asks if you want to order anything. Just as you are about to reply you feel another brush against your legs as a cream blur leaps out from under the table. A startled woman screams and swats away what looks like a cat trying desperately to eat her croissant. The owner storms out and crabs the cat by the scruff of its neck throwing it out onto the street a loud screech following as it hits the pavement. He walks over to you with an angry look in his eyes, maybe he knew you had no money for food. <br />
<br />
“Leave now, I’ll not have thieves in my café, you and your flea-bitten Pokemon can both stay on the streets,” he says before you’re ejected from the café. Looking down you can see a small and thin Meowth still with half a croissant in its mouth casting a fearful yet guilty look at you and Rocky. It drops its leftovers by your feet and mewls sadly in apology backing off to hide under a table outside. The owner must have mistaken this Meowth as one of your Pokemon and although it is the reason you lost another chance at a meal it does appear sorry and the half croissant is a peace offering.</span> <br />

<br />
<b>Furret</b> ~ Despite the fear gripping Omega’s body at his creepy environment and the sudden appearance of an enemy he still manages to fire off a scratch that makes the Natu wince. Your cheering is cut a little short though as Natu casts its eyes angrily at your Sentret in a scary Leer making his body lock up in terror. Both Pokemon seemed to be on even ground and despite the situation you can’t help but to grin, this was your first Pokemon battle after all, one you will always remember as such and therefore had you gripped with excitement. You let your mind drift off as you imagine yourself with a group of big and powerful Pokemon such as Tyranitar or Wailord at your side fighting all manner of seemingly unbeatable Pokemon … and winning of course. <br />
<br />
You move from the enticing thoughts as you hear Omega whimper still caught in Natu’s Leer and move onto thoughts of this battle. You want to try to gain an upper hand by preventing Natu from blocking any of Potato’s attack and order a <b>Foresight</b> firstly but there’s a problem, Potato can’t move. Natu can however and bounces forward striking Potato in the stomach with a harsh <b>Peck</b> knocking Potato from his shock. The Sentret shakes off his nerves and does as you say and fires off a beam of red light that covers Natu allowing you a somewhat clearer view of the bird now it had a slight red glow to it. Potato digs deep down and tries to summon a Surf, but all he manages to do it go a deep shade of purple as he holds his breath. He can’t bring forth water with none around to draw from. Potato receives another <b>Peck</b> to his belly for his troubles and Potato gets a little mad. He leaps forward and with claws drawn back swipes at the tiny bird with his <b>Scratch</b> leaving small marks along its feathers. Well it doesn’t seem if that plan went too well but hey, it is your first battle.</span> <br />

<br />
<b>Music Box ~</b> ~ Upon seeing the new pokemon having slowly waddled its over to you and your Totodile you pull out your new Pokedex and decide to scan it for further information. Your Pokedex tells you that Cacnea can be found in such an arid and dry area as this desert and through storing water in its cells can survive quite a while here. It blinks up at you and smiles happy to see someone new, not at all concerned about the foreign equipment you carry. You squint as you search the horizon and see no other Pokemon, even after a few minutes of scrutiny; it seems to be alone here. Squirt stops spraying his cooling mist of water, his attention drawn to the stranger. Cacnea pouts and jumps up and down pointing at Squirt and giving you both a pleading look. Cacnea seems upset to have lost that little bit of refreshment and locks its eyes on yours silently begging you for some more.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Artifical Dragon</b> ~ After consulting all the areas the Arcane Realm has to offer you finally decide on the arid, humid and vast Desert of Illusion, the lure of two mysterious villages enough to warrant the journey. You enter the desert full of excitement and hope and make your way through the thick sand as best you can. It’s not long however before the continual scolding weather grates on your nerves. Looking up to the sky you shield your eyes from the blistering sunlight and pray for some rain, hail, snow, a cloud or two, hell even a light breeze would be nice. Collapsing to the ground sighing at how hot and sweaty the heat’s making you already, you can see Igneous happily playing in the baking sands rolling down a nearby dune.

<b><u><span style="color: gold">Ancient Tomb</span></u></b><span style="color: gold"> (Please reply in <b>gold</b>)<br />
<br />
<b>Fishyfool</b> ~ It was a brand new day filled with promise and hope, a perfect time for an adventure. Your travels had taken you from your home in Sinnoh with your partner Chimchar to a land called the Arcane Realm. Though you were a far way from home you still felt the thrill of adrenaline run through your veins fuelling your excitement, the excitement only felt by a trainer about to embark on a new journey, a new adventure. Upon entering the realm you find yourself outside an Ancient Tomb, its stone arch embedded in the wall of a large mountain. The symbols carved into the stone are strange and unlike anything you’ve ever seen before and could very well be a warning to all trespassers but the rumours of treasures buried deep with the winding maze of the Tomb is enough of a lure for you. <br />
<br />
You enter the unlit passageway and are thankful for the small amount of light Volcape has coming from the fire on his backside. Volcape sits on your shoulders peering into the darkness squeaking every now and then, trying to keep a calmer demeanour. It’s not long though before the light from the entrance disappears as you make your way around a corner and the tiny flame Volcape provides doesn’t seem to cover much of the passageway and now you can only make out yourselves. Feeling the walls as you go, undeterred you carry on further into the maze of tunnels. Suddenly you feel the wall move away from your hand and realise that you must have made it to a clearing. Instructing Volcape to shed a little more light on your new surroundings, the little monkey Pokemon leaps off your shoulder and begins to make his way around the room. He stops at certain points where he makes out a new path before making his way back to you. He scurries back to you after nearly running into a wall and tells you about the paths he found. He leads you to each of them, each one with a symbol carved above the entrance. The first has a star, the second a diamond, the third a moon and the forth a skull. These symbols must relate to what you’ll find down each path making the skull a little worrying. Volcape looks up to you, waiting for a decision on the next route to take. </span><br />

<b><u><span style="color: lightsteelblue">Silverton Ranges</span></u></b><span style="color: lightsteelblue"> (Please reply in <b>lightsteelblue</b>)<br />
<br />
<b>Kasai</b> ~ You can’t help but to be proud of how well Harumi is faring against a Pokemon with more training and especially at her will and determination to fight despite the odds and the pain of multiple Tackle attacks. Harumi puffs up her chest defiantly and stares down the Poochyena. You ask if she can continue and she bristles at that comment, almost hurt that you’d think she’d give up when a fellow Pokemon was in danger and pain. She is feeling tired and her chest hurts with every breath but she would not give up easily. She nodded at your instructions and lets loose a loud and angry <b>Growl</b> but unfortunately is drowned out by Poochyena’s <b>Howl</b>, both noises cancelling each other out. You scream at Harumi to ‘FIGHT IT’ startling the small Swinub who whimpers in pain as it jars its legs caught in the trap and even making the Poochyena pause for a moment, and a moment is more than enough. Harumi charges forward and leaping up swipes her claws across the dark doggie’s face making it yelp and shake its head, that last attack having drawn a little blood. It whines a little drawing an irritated growl from its trainer before it rushes Harumi with all its strength knocking it over with its <b>Tackle</b>. Both Pokemon are looking exhausted and pained from the multiple attacks, it’s just a case of which Pokemon will hold on the longest as both are showing they’re pretty even.<br />
<br />
“Your chicken has a little more bite to it than it would seem child, but Poochyena will obliterate it very soon and then I’ll make you wish you never set eyes on us,” the trainer said smirking confidently but you can almost see a little concern in his eyes. Swinub is recovering from the trap biting further into its leg as it inches away from the mad trainer and his flea-bitten dog and a little further towards you still imploring you to help it.</span></span></div>

<b><span style="color: darkorange"><u>Desert of Illusion</u></span></b><span style="color: darkorange">(Please reply in DarkOrange)<br />
<br />
<b>Artifical Dragon</b> ~ After consulting all the areas the Arcane Realm has to offer you finally decide on the arid, humid and vast Desert of Illusion, the lure of two mysterious villages enough to warrant the journey. You enter the desert full of excitement and hope and make your way through the thick sand as best you can. It’s not long however before the continual scolding weather grates on your nerves. Looking up to the sky you shield your eyes from the blistering sunlight and pray for some rain, hail, snow, a cloud or two, hell even a light breeze would be nice. Collapsing to the ground sighing at how hot and sweaty the heat’s making you already, you can see Igneous happily playing in the baking sands rolling down a nearby dune. Igneous emerged from under his sand bed and you openly wish he was a water pokemon shocking the small fire type who wrinkles his nose in disgust before scurrying off to play on another steep dune.<br />
<br />
Begrudgingly you follow him trudging up the dune nearly collapsing again at the top. What you see as you reach the top and ever higher into the sun makes your eyes bulge out. A small but beautiful lake sits just at the bottom of the dune surrounded by luscious grass and small bushes, a little gem in the rough hiding behind several large dunes.

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Time seemed to stand still here, and she wasn't sure when her last drink of water was. Her mouth felt dry, her skin was burning, and she was getting even more frustrated with the desert with every passing minute. Climbing up the sandy hill her feet sunk into the sand and she stumbled constantly as she laboriously climbed up the dune. Finally, she reached the top. Nearly falling down again she thought to herself &quot;It would take a miracle to make it through this. Maybe we should turn back.&quot; Igneous was completely oblivious to Alina's misery as he played in the sand. Standing up straight on the hill she shielded her eyes from the sun as she looked out at the barren and desolate desert. It was completely lifeless-- No, wait, there was a small circle of blue out there... Straining her eyes she saw that it sparkled like... water! <br />
<br />
&quot;YES, THANK YOU&quot; she screamed to the sky. Igneous gave her a look saying &quot;She's finally lost it.&quot; Alina was nearly in tears of joy upon seeing the small oasis. She was running down the dune towards the lake when she thought that something was wrong with this picture. Slowing down she thought &quot;this could just be a figment of my imagination...&quot; Confused and somewhat disappointed she continued to walk towards the small, heavenly lake. Igneous's carefree playing in the sand added to her worries, since she was sure if it was real he'd notice it as well. Or maybe he was too preoccupied with his playing to care and she was just worrying too much. She was so thirstly... it couldn't hurt to take a look... They had nowhere else to go anyway. But if it wasn't real... <br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, don't think about that,&quot; she said to herself. Silently praying she dragged her feet through the sand, walking toward this small miracle in the middle of the most desolate place in the Arcane Realm.</span></span></div>

<b>RaunchyFad</b> ~ Pouting disappointedly at the disappearing sausages, those that were left in such a state it was unsanitary to eat, you and Rocky dejectedly walk on. You decide to continue the hunt for food and as your stomach roars for the world to hear you pick up a handful of acorns and begin to munch on them. They’re a far cry from hot tasty sausages but you eat them anyway only stopping when your mind begins to compare the taste of acorns to Rocky, a sick thought indeed. Following Rocky who knew nothing of your disturbing thoughts you head back into town on the search for food. It’s not long before the sumptuous smells of hot baking bread reaches your nostrils, the smells coming from a quaint little café with chairs and tables set up outside. Unbeknownst to you a pair of eyes follows you. You walk up to the entrance and peer inside to see several people dining on pastries and breads talking animatedly amongst them. The owner of the café spots you and beckons you inside. You hesitantly enter knowing that you had no money to purchase anything off their menu but are lead to table and you and Rocky sit at a chair each. He hands a lunch menu to you and you feel something push the tablecloth away and skirt past you leg. Taken off guard you look down and see nothing unusual. You look at the menu and feel your hunger grow at every item on it each one with a little descriptive picture that makes your mouth water. A young woman approaches you and asks if you want to order anything. Just as you are about to reply you feel another brush against your legs as a cream blur leaps out from under the table. A startled woman screams and swats away what looks like a cat trying desperately to eat her croissant. The owner storms out and crabs the cat by the scruff of its neck throwing it out onto the street a loud screech following as it hits the pavement. He walks over to you with an angry look in his eyes, maybe he knew you had no money for food. <br />
<br />
“Leave now, I’ll not have thieves in my café, you and your flea-bitten Pokemon can both stay on the streets,” he says before you’re ejected from the café. Looking down you can see a small and thin Meowth still with half a croissant in its mouth casting a fearful yet guilty look at you and Rocky. It drops its leftovers by your feet and mewls sadly in apology backing off to hide under a table outside. The owner must have mistaken this Meowth as one of your Pokemon and although it is the reason you lost another chance at a meal it does appear sorry and the half croissant is a peace offering.</span></span>

<br />
<span style="color: lemonchiffon">Stunned and a bit confused by the sudden expulsion from the quaint café, Paul clumsily turned around to try and explain himself to the offended shopkeep. He then noticed that the door had been closed behind him and decided that confronting the café owner at this time would not be one of his best ideas.<br />
Paul then turned his attention to the feeble mewl and looked down to see the croissant sitting slightly dusty upon the ground. He picked it up, blew on it, then stuffed the buttery pastry in his mouth, his eyes tearing up in pure bliss just moments after.<br />
&quot;Bobcats!&quot; Paul squealed as the meowth went to hide underneath one of the café tables. &quot;Jeez, man, you're better than all the other bobcats, no joke.&quot; <br />
Paul reached out his hand to try and coax the meowth out of hiding so that he could pet it, but was interrupted by Rocky who had been ignored since they were kicked out.<br />
She kicked Paul in the side, obviously feeling neglected, then walked out into the dusty street in hopes to find bigger and better things. Paul on the other hand didn't want to leave the generous meowth all alone, so he beckoned for it to follow while he was lead by his seedot back into town.</span></span></div>

<b><span style="color: limegreen"><u>Forest of Adventure</u></span></b><span style="color: limegreen"> (Please reply in <b>limegreen</b>)<br />
<br />
<b>Pyschopath</b> ~ Upon your arrival to the Arcane Realm you find yourself standing in front of vast expanse of trees that is the Forest of Adventure. Deciding it’s as good a place as any to explore you enter the undergrowth and begin your journey. Inside you can see that large trees block out a lot of sunlight but let the odd bright beam filter through. Large bushes filled with flowers of all different colours and scents line the path you traverse making it quite a beautiful environment to explore. You decide that you should share this experience your starter Pokemon and release your Sneasel aptly named Freeze asking him what he thought of his new surroundings. Pleased enough to travel out of his ball Freeze walks alongside you through the vast forest and after a good few hours of walking you both decide to take a short rest. Just as you decide to return Freeze to his Pokeball to rest properly you hear a low grumbling noise that suddenly grows louder. Looking down to your stomach you laugh with embarrassment, it’s so loud it filled the forest, you must be hungry. Freeze rolls his eyes before following you further into the forest now in search of food. You travel for another hour and begin to lose hope of ever finding anything remotely edible and even start looking at Freeze with a hungry look in your eyes, one Freeze is hasty to remove. Suddenly an apple rolls by your feet and comes to a stop in front of you. Looking around you can’t see where it could have come from, there are no apple trees in this part of the forest; it just seemed to leap out of the bush … like it wanted you to eat it, how lucky! Excitedly you bend down to pick up the apple when you a hear a high pitched war cry come from the bushes and a white and blue blur flies out from the undergrowth and latches onto the apple for dear life. It casts its little black eyes up to you and glares as if saying ‘this is my apple, back off’ The Pachirisu is quick to pick up the apple keeping it in its death grip. You could leave this little squirrel to its meal and search for food elsewhere or maybe you want to fight for it, it did roll to you after all.</span></span>

<span style="color: lemonchiffon"><b>allsystemsaredown</b> ~ With the battle now swiftly in your favour and the condition of the poor downed Pidgey more worse than it first seemed you feel the need to take out this threat. The young boy who was your opponent was breathing heavily, as if he had just run a marathon his little face going red from anger, it seems though he hadn’t considered losing this battle. Running through a game plan in your mind you focus on assaulting the Electrike whilst it was still locked in Torchlight’s fierce Leer before adding a few more of Torchlight’s attacks into the mix. The smoke is starting to lift and anyone that would pass this part of town would wonder why there was an intermittent cloud of black fog appearing behind these trees. Torchlight drops his Leer and rushes the electric doggie striking him hard and the throwing him along the ground, with Electrike so distracted it had taken a lot more damage. Electrike is starting to pant now these repeated <b>Tackle</b> attacks leaving it bruised and wearing it down.<br />
<br />
“Sparky I said use your Thunder Wave, paralyse that stupid rat NOW. You hear me Thunder Wave NOW, NOW, NOW!!” The boy yells his face turning an ugly shade of purple. <br />
<br />
Electrike casts an annoyed glance back at its trainer, not happy to be constantly yelled at but summons electrical energy, well tries to. It digs deep and manages to pull a few sparks that zip towards Torchlight who prepares to dodge before it fizzles out not even reaching the Cyndaquil. Taking his opportunity Torchlight fixed the Electrike with another fierce <b>Leer</b> making the already dejected dog shiver in fear; it was beginning to doubt its own abilities. Cyndaquil breathes in and instead of a fog of black smoke a few small wisps leaves his mouth. He tries again with the same result. It seems that he’s now having the same problem as Electrike, using <b>Smokescreen</b> repeatedly has left him out of smoke to breathe, he’d need time to churn up some more. He clenches his little fists together irate that he had failed in that move and even more so when the boy laughs.<br />
<br />
“HA HA HA HA, not a strong as you thought. We’re still better and you and your fiery rat are gonna lose … LOSE. Go now Sparky; Tackle it hard and Tackle again even harder.”<br />

The girl felt as though she had to punch something, and she had to punch it hard. This was very rare for her, as she had a firm belief against it. However, unlike her adversary, she was not going to push the Cyndaquil to do something it could no longer, as though it were a toy that was needed new batteries. She decided to wait until it could belch smoke again before she tried blinding her foe. <i>Three turns ought to do it for Torchlight,</i> the girl thought to herself. The girl cracked her knuckles and tried to work a way around Cyndaquil's weakness. All of a sudden, the girl came up with something. She decided to get Torchlight's attention. &quot;Torchlight, I realize that you can no longer belch smoke. Let's try a different tactic. Give him a good Leer and Tackle him twice while he's still scared of ya!&quot;<br />

<b><u><span style="color: gold">Ancient Tomb</span></u></b><span style="color: gold"> (Please reply in <b>gold</b>)<br />
<br />
<b>Fishyfool</b> ~ It was a brand new day filled with promise and hope, a perfect time for an adventure. Your travels had taken you from your home in Sinnoh with your partner Chimchar to a land called the Arcane Realm. Though you were a far way from home you still felt the thrill of adrenaline run through your veins fuelling your excitement, the excitement only felt by a trainer about to embark on a new journey, a new adventure. Upon entering the realm you find yourself outside an Ancient Tomb, its stone arch embedded in the wall of a large mountain. The symbols carved into the stone are strange and unlike anything you’ve ever seen before and could very well be a warning to all trespassers but the rumours of treasures buried deep with the winding maze of the Tomb is enough of a lure for you. <br />
<br />
You enter the unlit passageway and are thankful for the small amount of light Volcape has coming from the fire on his backside. Volcape sits on your shoulders peering into the darkness squeaking every now and then, trying to keep a calmer demeanour. It’s not long though before the light from the entrance disappears as you make your way around a corner and the tiny flame Volcape provides doesn’t seem to cover much of the passageway and now you can only make out yourselves. Feeling the walls as you go, undeterred you carry on further into the maze of tunnels. Suddenly you feel the wall move away from your hand and realise that you must have made it to a clearing. Instructing Volcape to shed a little more light on your new surroundings, the little monkey Pokemon leaps off your shoulder and begins to make his way around the room. He stops at certain points where he makes out a new path before making his way back to you. He scurries back to you after nearly running into a wall and tells you about the paths he found. He leads you to each of them, each one with a symbol carved above the entrance. The first has a star, the second a diamond, the third a moon and the forth a skull. These symbols must relate to what you’ll find down each path making the skull a little worrying. Volcape looks up to you, waiting for a decision on the next route to take. </span><br />

</blockquote><span style="color: gold"><span style="font-size: 9px">Having entered the huge tomb, Jamie began reminiscing about one tomb of the same name situated in Hoenn, rumoured to also contain many treasures, albeit one rumoured to be guarded by a powerful legendary pokemon. Setting these thoughts aside, he mused at the four symbols and their potential meanings. Firstly, the star. Taking into thought that this could remanate the treasures and guardians of them, the star path would likely test knowledge and have guardians related to the stars, such as Staryu: Something which would eat Volcape in seconds were he to try and fight. The Diamond would have valuable treasures, but guardians which would laugh off almost every attack, much like a diamond. The moon symbol could possibly relate to unearthly treasures, but would be testing the mind in terms of the guardians and puzzles, while the skull would test courage and be fraught with many dangers, yet yield the greatest prizes. Jamie thought long and hard for the whole shindig, before deciding against his better judgment to enter the doorway marked with the moon, with Volcape having a slight lead for a source of light.</span></span></div>

<b>Kasai</b> ~ You can’t help but to be proud of how well Harumi is faring against a Pokemon with more training and especially at her will and determination to fight despite the odds and the pain of multiple Tackle attacks. Harumi puffs up her chest defiantly and stares down the Poochyena. You ask if she can continue and she bristles at that comment, almost hurt that you’d think she’d give up when a fellow Pokemon was in danger and pain. She is feeling tired and her chest hurts with every breath but she would not give up easily. She nodded at your instructions and lets loose a loud and angry <b>Growl</b> but unfortunately is drowned out by Poochyena’s <b>Howl</b>, both noises cancelling each other out. You scream at Harumi to ‘FIGHT IT’ startling the small Swinub who whimpers in pain as it jars its legs caught in the trap and even making the Poochyena pause for a moment, and a moment is more than enough. Harumi charges forward and leaping up swipes her claws across the dark doggie’s face making it yelp and shake its head, that last attack having drawn a little blood. It whines a little drawing an irritated growl from its trainer before it rushes Harumi with all its strength knocking it over with its <b>Tackle</b>. Both Pokemon are looking exhausted and pained from the multiple attacks, it’s just a case of which Pokemon will hold on the longest as both are showing they’re pretty even.<br />
<br />
“Your chicken has a little more bite to it than it would seem child, but Poochyena will obliterate it very soon and then I’ll make you wish you never set eyes on us,” the trainer said smirking confidently but you can almost see a little concern in his eyes. Swinub is recovering from the trap biting further into its leg as it inches away from the mad trainer and his flea-bitten dog and a little further towards you still imploring you to help it.</span></span>

Kasai frantically tried to remember her supplies. No healing items. All her berries would be useless to Harumi. Potions were too expensive. Kasai brought herself back to attention. <i>&quot;Harumi,&quot;</i> she whispered, <i>&quot;Give him the cutest growl you can manage, and then start scratching like mad! Just wait a moment.&quot;</i> Kasai removed her blackglasses from her bag. At least she had those. &quot;What's that over there?&quot; she shouted, and then threw the glasses as far as she could, hoping to distract the hunter. Trying to lose no time, Kasai moved a little closer to the swinub and whispered, <i>&quot;Eat this. It might help.&quot;</i> She then dropped her <a href="http://bmgf.bulbagarden.net/showpost.php?p=586974&amp;postcount=45" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fbmgf.bulbagarden.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D586974%26postcount%3D45&amp;hash=2ffbd2f1d3f4142dda9af9b2c6ff350e" rel="nofollow noopener">babiri berry</a> onto the ground near the swinub. &quot;Now!&quot; Kasai commanded Harumi, who would hopefully withstand this...<br />

<b>empoleon dynamite</b> ~ Clutching the tiny bear Pokemon to your arms you survey your ‘strategy’ in motion and whilst Brawly managed to down the vicious Beedrill he had paid for it. He had a warm red tone to his cheeks as poison seeped into his veins eating away at him from within. Teddiursa casts Brawly a sorrowful look as if it knew how bad a poisoning could feel and found strength and courage enough to make its presence known and cheered Brawly on. Brawly fights through the stinging pain gripping his body and let’s loose a hateful growl at the bee that was currently trying to fly to no avail. Brawly was now thorough ticked off and seemed to be itching to inflict some pain. Deciding that putting strategic battle plans aside for an all or nothing assault you instruct Brawly with what to do next. He lets loose a roar and charges towards Beedrill who looks up in time to see an eneraged Totodile bolting towards it and Brawly lets lose a vicious <b>Scratch</b> that leaves a large cut down Beedrill’s abdomen. Beedrill whines in pain but is not about to give up. With Brawly within a close distance it pulls back its spines before jutting them out striking Brawly hard once in his abdomen, once more in his head and one final time in his right thigh. That <b>Fury Attack</b> sure was fueled by fury and made it all the more powerful. Brawly was cringing with pain and grit his teeth before deciding to soak Beedrill anyway. The <b>Water Gun</b> hit Beedrill point blank and pushed it along the ground. It was looking a right sorry sight now and Teddiursa cheered from within your arms having cheered up at the sight of victory being near. Brawly grins but cries out as the poison builds in his body and saps his strength making him fall to one knee. It was true that Beedrill was looking sodden and beaten but Brawly was slowly succumbing to the poison, it was just of question of who was going to fall first. <br />

Wes couldn’t bear to see his Pokémon suffer like that. “I’m sorry Brawly. I was wrong to push you so hard”. However, Brawly had no intentions of leaving the battle. He could see the determination in Brawly’s eyes – the young croc was standing taller than ever. Wes smiled, “Ok, if you can stomach another round I’m not gunna argue, show this Beedrill your full potential with a forceful <b>water gun</b> attack! It’s vital you dodge any attacks.” Totodile nodded, positive he wouldn’t let his trainer down. “If you can, try and finish him off with your <b>scratch</b> attack!”, Wes added – giving the Big Jaw Pokémon a reassuring smile in what would be his toughest round yet.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: LemonChiffon">As Verne and Spector rounded a bend, the vista of what was ahead of them unravelled itself. “Whoa, what a view!” Verne exclaimed, “drow-ZEE!” Spector burst out; he was not one to speak much, so the view must have been extra spectacular.<br />
<br />
As they continued walking, Verne thought to himself, this was the first time the two of them felt truly secluded, which wasn’t a bad thing, far from it! It felt great to escape of off the normal path of a trainer’s life and finally set off to create their own adventures. The unspoilt beauty of it all made them both filled humbled. <br />
<br />
Verne glanced down at his companion, he could see the excitement and anticipation in Spector’s face, and he was clearly ready for an adventure!<br />

<b>empoleon dynamite</b> ~</span> I’m very flattered you’ve read my adventures, you must have been bored XP<br />
<br />
<span style="color: limegreen">Brawly was suffering; the poison that ate away at his body bringing him great pain and you blamed yourself for it. You apologize to your Totodile who snorts at you as if saying that this wasn’t your fault, he knew what he was getting into when entering this battle with such a strong Pokemon. He kept his focus directly on his opponent who wasn’t looking too good either. Surprised you can’t help but feel proud of how determined your Pokemon and you smile deciding to let him continue, even if it is against your better judgment. Brawly gives you a forced grin, letting you know that he’ll be fine. You give what you hope to be the last orders for this battle, letting Brawly know that it is imperative that he dodges all attacks where possible. Not wanting to be hit with another poison attack Brawly is quick to agree. He breathes in deep and shoots out a strong gush of water that strikes the downed Beedrill pushing it even further along the ground. It let loose a low whine of pain as it flaps its clear wings feebly. Seeing his chance to finish the bee off, Brawly charges forward arms outstretched claws ready to strike. As he nears his target the bee gives a final assault, multiple purple spines flying towards Brawly in a <b>Poison Sting</b> attack. Brawly has no time to dodge and bracing himself charges right into the attack the spines striking his body, some sticking into his scales. With momentum driving him forward Brawly roars as he swipes his claws across Beedrill’s face before falling over next to it. You hold your breath as Beedrill falls back its eyes closed, out for the count. <b>Level up for Brawly</b>. Brawly picks himself up and hobbles over to you looking worn and pained, pulling out the spines stuck in his skin. He winces as the poison robs him of yet more health. Teddiursa crawls out of you arms and hugs Brawly, so happy to be rid of that menace. Brawly smiles at the tiny teddy and sits down to rest. You’ve won you’re first ever battle, and against a fully evolved Pokemon and all. But it was not over, Brawly was still poisoned and it wouldn’t be long now before he too fell, he was holding onto what little energy and health he had left, an antidote would be good right about now. Teddiursa seems deep in thought in a moment, a calmer demeanor exuded now the threat was removed. Suddenly it smiles and pulls on your leg pointing off into the forest. It limps off, still quite injured from its own battle and motions for you to follow it. You’ve not got long to heal Brawly, but Teddiursa seems intent on showing you something. <br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Pyschopath</b> ~ Bending down to be level with the little electric squirrel that was holding your apple hostage you begin to address it. Not exactly knowing what kind of Pokemon it is you whip out your Pokedex and scan it, telling you in a monotone voice small details about Pachirisu. You try to negotiate with Pachirisu who maintains its hard glare daring you to move closer. You ask it if it may possibly want something in your bag instead of the piece of fruit and even put you bag in front of you to make your point. Giving it a moment to ponder that you quickly change tone and threaten it with a battle if it doesn’t hand over what’s rightfully yours in your eyes. Pachirisu set its eyes on Freeze, sizing up the possible opponent before looking at you again. It holds the apple out to you and smiles obviously seeing reason. You move to take the apple from the small squirrel when it pulls it back and bites a huge chunk out of it swishing it around in its mouth, pieces of white half masticated fruit spilling out of its cheeks. It then sparks its cheeks before twirling around and smacking Freeze in the face with its tail. It grins manically around swollen cheeks, mocking both you and your Pokemon. It’s clear that this cheeky Pokemon would rather fight than hand its meal over. </span><br />

<br />
<b>allsystemsaredown</b> ~ You were beginning to get annoyed now, and it had something to do with the young boy perpetually yelling at you, your Pokemon and his own. Clenching your fists together you try to calm your frazzled nerves resisting the urge to beat some sense and respect into this kid. A little perturbed by how out of character you were acting you take deep breaths to calm down. Unlike you the boy you faced you were unwilling to treat your Pokemon with such disrespect and callousness. It was plain to see that Torchlight was out of smoke and unlike the ignorant lad; you knew not to try that move again for a while. It doesn’t take long for you to come up with a new strategy, hoping that you can finish off this battle soon with a few well placed attacks. With his orders Torchlight turns to face Electrike who’s charging towards him with as much speed as it can muster. Torchlight’s eyes flash an eerie red once more as it <b>Leer</b>s down Electrike and you can see hesitation in its eyes but it carries on anyway, its momentum carrying it forward more than anything. It barrels into your Cyndaquil knocking him off his feet taking a direct hit. Torchlight picks himself off wincing in pain at that hard attack and leaps at Electrike in a <b>Tackle</b> of his own. Both Pokemon stare each other down, both utterly tired from the fight and worn down from repeated attacks. The tension was thick as Pokemon stared down Pokemon and human stared down human, it felt like a showdown and everyone knows that only one comes out of those the winner. Electrike and Torchlight summon their last draws of energy and bolt towards one another. You hold in your breath as both Pokemon collide rolling into a mass of limbs before coming to a stop on the ground. Torchlight slowly makes his way to his feet stumbling a little, dizzy and thoroughly exhausted. Amazingly enough Electrike does the same, falling over his legs before steadying himself. They begin another stare down before Electrike sighs and passes out on the ground. <b>Level up for Torchlight</b>. Torchlight sits down smiling at his won fought victory. The boy’s jaw has hit the ground as he sees he’s lost the battle.<br />
<br />
“I-I lost? We lost?” he asks bottom lip trembling as he falls to the ground and balls his eyes out. “How could we lose? I thought we were the bestest, me and Sparky are a good team.” He covers his head with his hands and sobs uncontrollably “It’s not fair. We were winning, they must have cheated somehow, now we can’t catch that Pidgey.” He says making it to his feet and walking over to Electrike. He picks it up and it rouses giving its trainer a guilty look. He glares at you and yells at you in frustration.<br />
<br />
“You, you CHEATERS! We had that battle won. I-I-I’m gonna tell my mummy” he says running off into town. <br />
<br />
You stare at him rolling your eyes at his behaviour; it seems that he hasn’t learnt a thing from your battle. You congratulate Torchlight on a well fought battle and cast a glance over to the Pidgey. It looks relieved to see the boy and his Electrike gone and it gives you a thankful look before it changes to one of concern. It was still injured and as it tried to fly its wings locked up and it fell to the ground … maybe you were going to finish it off, though you had saved it. It seemed conflicted. You certainly had a decision to make here. <br />
<br />
<br />
<b>RaunchyFad</b> ~</span> If you think that’s long you should see some of my old updates. =p<br />
<br />
<span style="color: lemonchiffon">That was well rude, what had you done to warrant an expulsion like that? As the door slams behind you, you contemplate going back in there to give the owner a piece of your mind before you see sense and decide to just leave it be. Hearing a small mewl below you look down to see a small Meowth push the croissant in front of you before scurrying off under a nearby table. Bending down you pick up the pastry and brush off the dust. Rocky gives you a mildly disgusted look as you plop the buttery delight in your mouth moaning at how good it tasted. Suddenly remembering about the kitty now hiding from you, you squeal in excitement and bend down to be face to face with the Meowth that was looking rather nervous. This Pokemon was even better than the last one you encountered and it gave you food too! You reach your hand under the table to try and pet the kitty that shies away from your touch, still nervous that you may want to punish it for getting you thrown out. Rocky had had enough, you had ignored her since you were thrown out of the café and now you were fawning over this Pokemon. She kicks you in your side with her small foot and proceeds to march off. You know you can’t let her get too far away but still wanting to get to know this Meowth better. You stand up and start after you Pokemon before turning around, beckoning the kitty to follow.<br />
<br />
Running after your Pokemon you can see she’s quite ahead of you now, probably still sulking. Looking over your shoulder you see Meowth pop its head from underneath the table and slowly emerge from under the tablecloth to follow after you. It notices you looking at it and squeals running to hide behind a nearby restaurant sign. It’s obviously intrigued by you but still a little wary. Meanwhile Rocky was looking at all the little shops with disinterest, nothing seemed very exciting. Just as she passes a small alleyway she sees a shadow slip by into it making her turn around and peer down there. What was that? The shadow lingers at the end almost as if staring at her before turning around a corner. Now this was a little more interesting. She turned back and went into the alleyway. You see your Seedot toddle off down a small passage and sigh running up to catch up with her, hoping she’s not getting into trouble, well not without you anyway. Just as you’re about to enter the alley you cast one final look behind you noticing that Meowth was still softly padding its way behind you. You rush down the alley spotting Rocky turn a corner. As you run to meet her you barrel into her almost knocking her over. You apologize before noticing her worried look, staring straight ahead. Following her gaze you see several Glameow sitting on the walls surrounding you, their eyes locked onto you. A single form moves out of the shadows revealing a rather fat looking Pokemon. The Purugly has a malicious grin on its fat face and hisses at Rocky who shivers a little, this brute looked dangerous. You suddenly hear a squeal behind you and see that Meowth has caught up to you both. It stares at the several cats surrounding you with fear but also something else … recognition? The Purugly’s grin widens when it spots Meowth and it screeches loudly making the kitty hide behind your leg gripping it for dear life. It focuses on Rocky and looks ready to attack. <br />
<br />
<b>Concore</b> ~ </span>Its much better. The description in your last piece was wonderful but like enchantress said, self-updating is a major no-no. With time you’ll see you can put such description into a reply and still be within the rules.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: lemonchiffon">As you enter the beautiful Arcane Realm you find that you and Spector your faithful Drowsee head for Mediville. It was a lovely day; the sun was high in the sky with a few clouds spotted around not blocking the warm rays though. Walking along a cobble path you come to the town itself. Your feeling of seclusion soon vanishes as the hustle and bustle of the small town encompasses you. Lots of people have filled the streets going about their day, shop owners enticing travellers to buy their wares, many café’s and restaurants at their peek full with customers enjoying lunch. Its inhabitants leave their homes to talk animatedly to one another and small children playing safely in the streets. Spector looks in awe at all the different people and shops and seems keen on exploring some more. You slowly make your way through the streets taking in the sights and smells of the town, Spector stopping every now and then to peer into a shop window hoping you’d buy him something on this trip. After a short bumpy walk you find yourself in the centre of town. The square is an open area surrounded by shops with a large fountain in the centre. Approaching the fountain you can see it’s shaped into a Vaporeon spraying water from its mouth up into the air. Several children were playing in its cool waters, some of their Pokemon joining in. As you move to approach it you feel a small body push by you. A young girl looks up and apologises before walking off stopping to talk to various people around the square. Sitting down by the fountain Spector splashes some of the refreshing water onto his skin cooling off instantly. The young girl who bumped into you earlier passes by you and talks to a boy her age, you manage to catch some of her conversation.<br />
<br />
“Tommy have you seen Crystal, I’ve been looking everywhere for her?” she asks the young boy.<br />
“Sorry Caitlin, I’ve not seen Crystal today,” he replies before running off to play in the fountain with his Wooper. <br />
<br />
Caitlin sits down to your right and hangs her head, her blonde bangs covering her eyes as she softly cries.<br />
<br />
“Where could she have gone? Has she run away from me? I’ve looked everywhere … Crystal” she starts crying harder hugging her knees to her chest. It seems she’s lost someone very close to her.</span> <br />

<b>Artifical Dragon</b> ~ Truly pleased by the miraculous oasis right before your eyes you scream to the heavens, Igneous wondering what all the fuss about hoping you’ve secretly started to like your new environment. He carries on bounding up another sand dune as you start to cry in absolute joy at your saviour. You begin to run down the dune, practically falling really at its steepness before you slow to a halt now half buried in sand yourself. What if your mind was plying trick on you? There were such things as mirages and dehydration could be causing the heavenly sight. Digging yourself out of the dune and walking slowly to the oasis wishing that Igneous was here to confirm your queries, but this was too enticing to ignore, you simply had to see if it was real. You drag yourself through the hot sands and with every step you get closer to your salvation. Reaching out you hit the grassy banks of the oasis and swear you can feel a cooling breeze beginning to brew. Looking at the shimmering pool with unbridled need you leap straight for the waters … only to get a face full of sand. Sitting up to spew out the nasty substance you yell in frustration causing Igneous to come bounding over the sane dune to see what you’re making all that noise for. The oasis is now gone replaced by more sand and as you explain to him what you had just seen it’s obvious that he thinks you’ve gone mental. You’re about to begin your argument again when you hear a soft laughter. You look around for its source and spot two glowing lights hovering above the ground a little way away. The lights laugh again and an outline seems to flash around them before it fades away, it almost looked like a Pokemon! Whatever it is you bet it caused the mirage and it’s damn proud of itself.</span><br />

<b>Fishyfool</b> ~ As you contemplate your next path Volcape waits patiently by your side before making shadow figures on the wall. You reason that the star passage could be related to great treasure but be guarded by star Pokemon such as Staryu and Volcape wouldn’t fair so great against a water Pokemon. The diamond path could also indicate wondrous treasures but that guardians would be immensely strong. The Moon passage must relate to unearthly treasures but there would certainly be a test of mind up ahead. The Skull path could have treasure but its meaning alone meant a harsh battle was up ahead. Yes all paths must lead to treasure but which to take. Maybe you were reading too much into this and it was a lot simpler than you thought. Anyhow you chose the Moon path and your Chimchar with a route to move through stops his shadow puppetry and moves ahead of you lighting the way. You keep your hands on the walls as the light remains dim, feeling you way. As you move you feel patterns on the walls, most of them feel like circles or crescent shapes. The path seems to go on forever and you begin to lose hope of ever finding anything here before Volcape startles you by yelling at you and pointing ahead. As you move on you come to a small room, you only realise as the wall disappears again. Suddenly as you enter the walls light up, small eerie balls of pink energy floating in intervals. Intricately carved circles and crescent shapes line the walls of this room too and at the far end of the room is a raised square panel. Looking around you can see no other doors in the room, the only interesting thing here is the raised panel. Approaching it you can see it’s made of sand with no distinguishing features. A smaller panel sits underneath with writing on it. <br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center"><i> ‘The Moon path you have chosen,<br />
Though to continue the Moon shall not help you.<br />
This riddle you must answer,<br />
And sand is the paper that will open the way.<br />
<br />
What force and strength cannot get through, I with a gentle touch can do.<br />
And many in the street would stand, were I not a friend at hand.’</i>&#8203;</div> <br />
Volcape looks confused at the words there and looks up to you, hoping that you know what it all means. </span><br />

<b>Kasai</b> ~ Your lack of healing supplies is worrying especially considering how hot this battle was getting, you figured you’d just have to see this through to the end and hope that Harumi would come out on top. You give her your battle orders as you fish around in your bag for something. Finding a pair of Blackglasses you got when you first started as a trainer you ponder on a distraction technique. Looking innocent and yelling out at something interesting off to the right of the guy you were facing you lobbed the Blackglasses as hard as you could. He lets his gaze fall off you for only a moment to see the glasses land not to far away before snorting in amusement. However you had had enough time to sneak a babiri berry to Swinub who sniffed at it before swallowing it whole. It sure was sour and it wrinkled its little face in shock but it didn’t seem to make it feel any better, well it was the thought that counted right. Annoyed by your behaviour the man ordered his mutt to attack only to find that it was sniffing the blackglasses in awe. It tried to put them on its snout wanting to see how cool it would look. Harumi took this moment to act and let loose a cute <b>Growl</b> which was hard for the ruffled birdie but she managed it well enough. Poochyena however was too engrossed in the dark-boosting item to notice. Harumi puffed up in annoyance before bum rushing the Poochyena striking it across the face with a well aimed <b>Scratch</b>. Poochyena howled in pain and stumbled backwards, the glasses falling off its face. <br />
<br />
“What are you doing you stupid mutt, attack that chicken right now before I attack you,” the guy bellowed to his whimpering doggie. Harumi leapt forward and hit another <b>Scratch</b> that sliced along Poochyena’s side drawing blood. It howled painfully before half-leaping half-falling into a <b>Tackle</b> that knocked Harumi back on her butt. The trainer growled setting his steely glare on you, it seemed that you now had the upper hand as Poochyena was faring far worse than Harumi and this guy knew it. Swinub was looking more hopeful now; maybe you could really save it. </span></span></div>

<b>RaunchyFad</b> ~</span> If you think that’s long you should see some of my old updates. =p<br />
<br />
<span style="color: lemonchiffon">That was well rude, what had you done to warrant an expulsion like that? As the door slams behind you, you contemplate going back in there to give the owner a piece of your mind before you see sense and decide to just leave it be. Hearing a small mewl below you look down to see a small Meowth push the croissant in front of you before scurrying off under a nearby table. Bending down you pick up the pastry and brush off the dust. Rocky gives you a mildly disgusted look as you plop the buttery delight in your mouth moaning at how good it tasted. Suddenly remembering about the kitty now hiding from you, you squeal in excitement and bend down to be face to face with the Meowth that was looking rather nervous. This Pokemon was even better than the last one you encountered and it gave you food too! You reach your hand under the table to try and pet the kitty that shies away from your touch, still nervous that you may want to punish it for getting you thrown out. Rocky had had enough, you had ignored her since you were thrown out of the café and now you were fawning over this Pokemon. She kicks you in your side with her small foot and proceeds to march off. You know you can’t let her get too far away but still wanting to get to know this Meowth better. You stand up and start after you Pokemon before turning around, beckoning the kitty to follow.<br />
<br />
Running after your Pokemon you can see she’s quite ahead of you now, probably still sulking. Looking over your shoulder you see Meowth pop its head from underneath the table and slowly emerge from under the tablecloth to follow after you. It notices you looking at it and squeals running to hide behind a nearby restaurant sign. It’s obviously intrigued by you but still a little wary. Meanwhile Rocky was looking at all the little shops with disinterest, nothing seemed very exciting. Just as she passes a small alleyway she sees a shadow slip by into it making her turn around and peer down there. What was that? The shadow lingers at the end almost as if staring at her before turning around a corner. Now this was a little more interesting. She turned back and went into the alleyway. You see your Seedot toddle off down a small passage and sigh running up to catch up with her, hoping she’s not getting into trouble, well not without you anyway. Just as you’re about to enter the alley you cast one final look behind you noticing that Meowth was still softly padding its way behind you. You rush down the alley spotting Rocky turn a corner. As you run to meet her you barrel into her almost knocking her over. You apologize before noticing her worried look, staring straight ahead. Following her gaze you see several Glameow sitting on the walls surrounding you, their eyes locked onto you. A single form moves out of the shadows revealing a rather fat looking Pokemon. The Purugly has a malicious grin on its fat face and hisses at Rocky who shivers a little, this brute looked dangerous. You suddenly hear a squeal behind you and see that Meowth has caught up to you both. It stares at the several cats surrounding you with fear but also something else … recognition? The Purugly’s grin widens when it spots Meowth and it screeches loudly making the kitty hide behind your leg gripping it for dear life. It focuses on Rocky and looks ready to attack.</span></span></b></span>

<span style="font-size: 9px">OOC: I think I have seen some of your other updates. They're massive and intimidating. ;.; &lt;3<br />
<br />
<span style="color: lemonchiffon">At first Rocky felt intimidated by the giant feline and its slimmer comrades, but her mood softened as she thought more about her situation. Sure, she was confronting a large group of hungry felines, however she herself was a hard-bodied creature with all of her meaty flesh (if there even was any) hidden deep inside of her acorn shell. Her eyes narrowed and her mouthless face turned into what would be a smile. She looked back at Paul and saw the meowth clinging to his skinny leg and rolled her eyes. She really did find her master to be really annoying. Maybe she’d make the situation harder for him.<br />
Paul’s first reaction to the kitty horde was a raised eyebrow and a stroke to the goatee. Apparently humans were a minority in Mediville and the town was populated mostly (or even only) of cats. He then looked in the middle of cat horde and saw Rocky who was looking right back at him. He shrugged. He had seen The Birds by Alfred Hitchcock, and figured that all he had to do was walk into the middle of the cats and pick up his seedot and hopefully they wouldn’t do anything but click and chirp, well, meow and hiss while he walked away with his Pokémon. Yup. Just like the last scene of the movie.<br />
Unfortunately, when Paul took a step forward towards Rocky and the purugly behind her, the meowth on his leg let out a banshee-like screech and dug its claws through his ripped jeans and into his filthy skin. Paul clenched his teeth in pain, took a step back and flopped to the ground, trying to pry the meowth off his leg.<br />
Rocky smiled again. Now was her chance to do something really naughty. She turned her back to Paul who was still trying to pry the meowth off of his leg, then approached the purugly. After this, she started to rock back and forth, and kept full eye contact with the hulking cat. A few seconds passed until Rocky finally jumped up, lifted her leg and smacked the purugly in the face. She then darted in the other direction past Paul and giggled wildly.</span></span></span></b></div>
