<b>Music Box </b> ~ Banette was not at all pleased by your plan and neither were you watching as Squirt was battered by the last attack. But still, you were deterred by the failure of the last plan for you had another one locked away. Pushing down the panic at the injured state of your Pokemon you order Squirt to use his newest move, Squirt eager to give some retaliation as he picked himself up off the rubble. With a set of 3 moves planned Squirt set to work trying his hardest to get his protesting muscles to move. With all the strength he had left he leapt up curling his claw into a fist. Powering ice energy into it he roared a he slammed the <b>Ice Punch</b> into Banette’s face, the ghost screeching in pain and falling back. Your Croconaw pushing through his exhaustion stood tall and stared down Banette, his eyes flashing in a ferocious <b>Leer</b> only to stumble back and hold his ears in agony as Banette <b>Screech</b>ed for all it was worth. Banette looking tattered around the edges darted forward surrounded in dark energy hoping to finish Squirt off. Just as it was about to strike Squirt opened his jaws wide and clamped them down on Bannette just as it passed in a last ditch effort <b>Bite</b> attack, falling back as the <b>Knock Off</b> hit. Banette hit the ground sending up dust as it slid coming to rest by your feet. You rush over to check on Squirt to see him lying on the ground also. He opens one eye and grins at you before the same blue light surrounded him again. Before your eyes he reverted back to the Totodile that you knew. <i><b>Level up for Squirt</b></i>. You smile at the memory of Squirt in his evolved state and feel pride over how well he battled even with a different body. Cacnea jumped up and down running over to congratulate the crocodile on his victory. You gaze down at the cactus longingly; it was already a good friend, you were glad to have met it. <br />
<br />
Banette, recovered enough to float over to you nodded grinning silently thanking you for the battle. You could sense that it had been a long time since it had the opportunity. Honouring its agreement it raised its arms and the village was restored, the buildings ancient but intriguing in design, people milled about going about their everyday lives unaware of their death. The Pokemon from the pedestal were all there with their trainers, the Xatu looked deep in thought, Bronzong hovered near some children ring its bell for their enjoyment, Golem flexed its muscles and trained on a specially crafted gym set and Banette floated in and about playing hide and seek with some children. Real-time Banette looked at the scene with fondness in its eyes, its memory had brought the village back to life but now it was all that was left. It looked to you and drew a ‘5’ in the air signifying how long you had to look at the memory before it disappeared along with its owner. Cacnea and Squirt were looking through the village with interest. You have 5 minutes to see what you came to the desert for, better make the most of it.</span> <br />

<b>Lemon~Lime</b> ~ Once again mistaking a Pokemon as a precious ore you find yourself facing a tiny Aron along with several Lairon and Aggron all setting their harsh glares upon you and the Pokemon that hid behind you. Aggron looked particularly displeased to see the small Sableye with you and Klaus seemingly recognising the Aggron was trembling with fear. You apologise to the Aron who backs off to be closer to the Lairon nearest to it, it’s obviously not comfortable around humans. Picking up Klaus by the scruff of his neck, the gremlin struggling against your grasp and fixing you with a murderous look you tell the gathered group of steel Pokemon that he belonged to you now and as such followed your orders. You continue to tell them to pass on word that Klaus now was a trained Pokemon and meant no harm to any other Pokemon in this mine. Putting the struggling Sableye down you grip his arm tightly and the gremlin struggled against your grip trying to get further away from the mass of steel Pokemon. Aggron seemed intrigued by your actions and words. As you picked up a pick axe it took the opportunity to approach you the ground shaking with every step it took. It got right up close and personal that you could its hot breath washing over you and you feel a little less confident now. It sneered down at the Sableye who was pulling against your arm and trying to make himself as small as possible. <br />
<br />
Aggron pointed around the cavern trying to portray a message to you. It pulled a singular gem from somewhere within its armour and held it out. The ruby glinted in fragile beams of sunlight and Klaus’s eyes widened almost hungrily. Aggron pointed to the gem and shook its head. It pointed at Klaus and made an eating motion that made your heart sink. Was it saying what you think it was saying? Looking down to Klaus you can see that he has a sheepish look on his face before lowering his head and nodding. Unreal! Klaus had eaten every gem and ore in the mine!! No wonder he didn’t want you continuing further into the mine, he didn’t want you stealing his meals. It seemed that the ruby was the only thing left and Aggron was very protective of it. Aggron grinned wickedly at Klaus and the Sableye almost cried in fear. Aggron roared and three Lairon charged forward to surround you. It spoke to them and pointed back to where you came from. It seems that Aggron is extremely pleased to be rid of the menace that ate all the ores and gems of the mine and now that you had captured him, they could have some peace and cultivate what was left. The Lairon nudged you urging you to move making you drop the pickaxe. Begrudgingly you were escorted back the way you came and to the entrance of the mine. The Lairon fixed you with a look that basically said ‘don’t you ever come back, especially with that Sableye’. Well that trip for gems hadn’t worked out exactly like you had planned. </span><br />

</blockquote><span style="color: lightsteelblue"><span style="font-size: 9px">Mike sighed after the Lairon were out of view from the cave entrance. What an ordeal <i>that</i> had been! All that hard work, only to discover that Klaus had eaten everything in the mine except a ruby! &quot;Well, Klaus,&quot; he said, &quot;No more gem hunting for us, I suppose. C'mon, we should go back down to the base of the mountain. Scorpio still needs to get healed up.&quot; And with that, Mike's journey in the Silverton Ranges came to an end, having found no gems but acquiring a good addition to his team.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"> <br />

Your Croconaw pushing through his exhaustion stood tall and stared down Banette, his eyes flashing in a ferocious <b>Leer</b> only to stumble back and hold his ears in agony as Banette <b>Screech</b>ed for all it was worth. Banette looking tattered around the edges darted forward surrounded in dark energy hoping to finish Squirt off. Just as it was about to strike Squirt opened his jaws wide and clamped them down on Bannette just as it passed in a last ditch effort <b>Bite</b> attack, falling back as the <b>Knock Off</b> hit. Banette hit the ground sending up dust as it slid coming to rest by your feet. You rush over to check on Squirt to see him lying on the ground also. He opens one eye and grins at you before the same blue light surrounded him again. Before your eyes he reverted back to the Totodile that you knew. <i><b>Level up for Squirt</b></i>. You smile at the memory of Squirt in his evolved state and feel pride over how well he battled even with a different body. Cacnea jumped up and down running over to congratulate the crocodile on his victory. You gaze down at the cactus longingly; it was already a good friend, you were glad to have met it. <br />
<br />
Banette, recovered enough to float over to you nodded grinning silently thanking you for the battle. You could sense that it had been a long time since it had the opportunity. Honouring its agreement it raised its arms and the village was restored, the buildings ancient but intriguing in design, people milled about going about their everyday lives unaware of their death. The Pokemon from the pedestal were all there with their trainers, the Xatu looked deep in thought, Bronzong hovered near some children ring its bell for their enjoyment, Golem flexed its muscles and trained on a specially crafted gym set and Banette floated in and about playing hide and seek with some children. Real-time Banette looked at the scene with fondness in its eyes, its memory had brought the village back to life but now it was all that was left. It looked to you and drew a ‘5’ in the air signifying how long you had to look at the memory before it disappeared along with its owner. Cacnea and Squirt were looking through the village with interest. You have 5 minutes to see what you came to the desert for, better make the most of it.</span></span>

<span style="color: darkorange">After the intense battle between Banette and Croconaw, the beloved crocodile returned to it's lightweight form, Totodile. &quot;Squirt! I'm glad to see your okay!&quot; Tim said in relief while he was nearly suffocating Squirt in a hug. Just then, Banette floated over and showed everyone the village. &quot;Thanks Banette!&quot; Tim cried in happiness. After seeing that they had a time limit, Tim, Squirt, and Cacnea went off to check the village out. Tim spent most of his time recording information like what kind of merchant systems they had. How far back in time it is estimated to be and such. Tim watched as Squirt and Cacnea played with the children even though the children weren't really there. &quot;Those two, they make a good team...&quot; Tim said to himself as he looked through the inventory of a nearby stand. &quot;I... I wonder if I should ask Cacnea to join me here and now...&quot; Tim thought while trying to keep focused. Tim put down the fruit and began to turn around and walk towards the two pokemon. &quot;C... Cacnea!&quot; Tim began to say as the two pokemon stopped in their tracks to here what Tim had to say, &quot;I was wondering... will you join Squirt and I? On our journey?&quot; Tim said quietly wondering what will happen if Cacnea says no. So many different scenarios popped through his head that the more that came, the more Tim trembled. The pleasant little town would only be here for another minute by this time. Tim stared at Cacnea and pulled out a small <a href="http://bmgf.bulbagarden.net/showpost.php?p=600905&amp;postcount=1293" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fbmgf.bulbagarden.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D600905%26postcount%3D1293&amp;hash=3923f153da8c3bafdc412adfd7d04cba" rel="nofollow noopener">Pokeball</a> 1/1.</span></span></div>

<span style="color: lemonchiffon"><b>Concore</b> ~ Standing firm you watch as the dastardly duo argued amongst one another before the smarter one left hurriedly not wanting anything to do with this. You see Spector putting all his effort into holding Caitlin back so that she doesn’t get hurt. The man leers at you all and it takes all your effort to not walk over there and punch him for his actions. Taking a few calming breaths you take in the situation entirely. The man in the worn trench coat was obviously threatening you with a battle if you didn’t leave and forget about what you saw here; but that wasn’t an option. Crystal seemed elated to see her trainer but the way the man was treating her, chaining her up like a wild feral beast was disgusting, and all this talk about selling her, you were going to put a stop to this before it went any further. You doubted very much that the man would let you leave here in one piece anyway. You walk in front of both Spector and Caitlin and pat your Drowsee on the shoulder the action causing both parties to stop their actions. With a bold and adamant voice you tell the man that you think not that that Crystal was coming back where she belonged. The man sneered at you and half-snorted half-laughed, amused by your statement.<br />
<br />
“Is that so, well then I’ll make sure that we’ll all leave here together and it won’t be pretty for you three. Maybe I could sell your Drowsee too. Don’t think it would pick up much but it might be worth it for slave labour or maybe meat for someone” he said and laughed.<br />
<br />
You hold down your anger and disgust and ask Caitlin to stay back and let you and Spector handle this pathetic excuse of a human being. Caitlin cast one last look over to Crystal and nodded.<br />
<br />
“Please get her back for me,” she whispered to you.<br />
<br />
Spector stood before you ready to battle and hopefully beat the man senseless afterwards for his ruse remarks. The man grinned and pulled off the single Pokeball from his belt. Enlarging it he sent out his Pokemon that turned out to be much small than Spector. The Skorupi hissed angrily clicking its claws together. You look surprised, not only is he using a Pokemon smaller than Spector but it had a type disadvantage. Maybe this would be easier than you thought. <br />
<br />
“Skorupi, <b>Leer</b> and <b>Bite</b>,” the man ordered the small scorpion ready to attack.</span> <br />

<br />
<span style="color: LemonChiffon">Slightly angered and horrified at what the man said, Verne’s temper was being to fray, he could clearly see Caitlin was distressed, and this man’s hollow slurs were only worsening thing. Verne convinced her that he and Spector would give it their best, and gave her a reassuring wink, before turning back and getting down to business.<br />
<br />
Verne was taken aback by what man sent out, although hissing wildly, it was so small, “A Skorupi?, never seen one before, Bug and... Poison? ” Verne was deep in thought conjuring up a plan, and regretting not charging his Pokédex up “I would say... fast.. nippy... perhaps frail?”, but to be honest, he just wasn’t sure.<br />
<br />
“Ok Spector, for now, let’s play this one safe, subdue it using <b>Hypnosis</b>, and don’t give up until it’s asleep!” Verne commanded.</span></span></div>

Ralfil lounged atop his head, loving the desert air. Todd had chosen this location for his Trapinch, knowing the Ant Pit Pokémon would enjoy it. Although the Desert of Illusion was rumored to have two secret villages, Todd was interested mainly in pleasing his quirky friend, Ralfil. For the moment, Todd had stopped to let Ralfil play in the sand while he drank some water. The dryness of the desert easily dehydrated those not prepared. Recapping his water bottle, a poetic mood struck him as he viewed the surrounding desert. He put away his water bottle, positioned himself in a heroic stance, and began to rhyme:</span></span></span><br />

<b>Concore</b> ~ This brute of a man was not going to intimidate either Spector or yourself and you quickly prepared for battle. There was no other option, you would defeat him then free Crystal from her bonds. Spector seemed confident to be able to take on any opponent and fixed the man with a determined glare, awaiting the arrival of his foe. As the man sent out his Pokemon, a small purple scorpion creature you find yourself shocked. It was a tiny frail looking thing, yet a Pokemon you had yet to encounter. Wracking your brains you remember that its part bug and part poison; that gave you and Spector the advantage. Still you decide to play it safe and with his orders, your Drowsee set to work immobilising the bug.<br />
<br />
He concentrated on sending out hypnotic waves only to get startled by a fearsome <b>Leer</b>, suddenly that Skorupi didn’t looks so small anymore, its eyes looked huge and evil! Spector didn’t know what to do with himself and his Hypnosis was stopped before it even began. The man smirked his Skorupi matching his smile and scuttled over to Spector <b>Bit</b>ing down on his arm. What the?! That dragged Spector out of his daze as he ran back and forth crying out and trying to dislodge the bug from his arm. With a hefty wave he managed to throw Skorupi off looking down at the red teeth marks left in his skin. That had really hurt! Drawing away from the pain a moment he looked over at the Skorupi who was grinning evilly. Spector had to calm himself down or his hypnosis would never work. Concentrating again he felt the hypnotic waves released this time and now Skorupi wasn’t looking so happy. It yawned and promptly fell over on its side asleep. <br />
<br />
Well at least you had gotten it out of action for a moment. The man didn’t seem fazed by this though.<br />
<br />
“Oh what are we to do, Skorupi is asleep, we’ll never win now” he overdramatically cried out before laughing manically. “We’re not some stupid beginning trainer boy, we have some dirty tricks of our own. Skorupi <b>Snore</b> and when you wake up tear it apart with <b>Pin Missile</b>.”<br />

<b>Music Box </b> ~ With your reward in place for a mere 5 minutes you busy yourself taking in every sight and sound of the dead village. Squirt was still recovering from his intense battle with Banette but still had enough vigour to dart around the village, Cacnea hot on his tail. You take the opportunity to record what you can with what equipment you had on you wanting to preserve its memory as long as possible. Cacnea and Squirt had stopped exploring to play with the visionary children bringing a smile to your face; they seemed to get along really well considering the amount of time they’ve known each other. Suddenly your thoughts are torn away from the village and to the new found friend you had made. Cacnea was good Pokemon and would surely work well on your team; maybe you should ask it to join you? Putting away your equipment you slowly approached the two dancing Pokemon hesitantly asking it if it would join you on the rest of your journeys pulling out an empty Pokeball to emphasise the point. Cacnea looked up to you before staring at the ball. So deep in concentration on its decision you fail to notice the village blur and fade to rubble once again.

<span style="color: darkorange">Setting foot in the Desert of Illusion you at least seem to have come prepared, sand goggled preventing the dust stinging your eyes. A small orange ant pit Pokemon sat atop your head. This creature had a large head and small body and was very content to laze about enjoying the breeze from the height he was. This was your first adventure together and you feel you’ve chosen the right place to start. Walking through the hot and arid desert you think back to the rumours of this place, word had spread that there were some mysterious villages hidden in the deepest reaches but you weren’t particularly interested in that. What you really wanted to see were some of the Pokemon that lived around here, that and give your Trapinch a good time. Taking a swig of water you’re your cold bottle you found yourself feeling oddly poetic and proceeded to recite one taking up a strange pose whilst you did. Finishing your poem you see Ralfil looking up at you with an odd look on his face, were you dehydrated already and gone crazy? Chuckling you pick up the ant pit Pokemon and place him back on your head before making another move.<br />
<br />
Now you had that out of your system you trekked through the desert wiping the sweat from your head and neck as you went. They didn’t lie, it sure was hot here and even prepared you still felt the sweltering heat. Looking up to the sky you saw no cloud cover, just the large burning sun joyfully giving you its full attention. Ralfil seemed very content here; after all he was born to live in deserts. As you walk further on still you begin to here noises, was there really someone else out here in the desert? The sounds get louder and you make out a voice shouting in a panicked manner. As you gradually approach you can now see a boy about 13 years old yelling at a pair of Pokemon. The Pokemon become clear and you can see a pair of blue blurs rolling round and round in the sands surrounding a small Numel in the middle. Every now and then they’d break off and roll into Numel smacking it back and forth. Numel although a slow Pokemon was looking battered from the brutal attacks and had tears in its eyes. The boy seemed distraught not knowing what to do. When he approached he was blasted back. You don’t know why the blurs are attacking but you do know is that the boy and his Numel need help and fast.</span></span></div>

<b>Music Box </b> ~ With your reward in place for a mere 5 minutes you busy yourself taking in every sight and sound of the dead village. Squirt was still recovering from his intense battle with Banette but still had enough vigour to dart around the village, Cacnea hot on his tail. You take the opportunity to record what you can with what equipment you had on you wanting to preserve its memory as long as possible. Cacnea and Squirt had stopped exploring to play with the visionary children bringing a smile to your face; they seemed to get along really well considering the amount of time they’ve known each other. Suddenly your thoughts are torn away from the village and to the new found friend you had made. Cacnea was good Pokemon and would surely work well on your team; maybe you should ask it to join you? Putting away your equipment you slowly approached the two dancing Pokemon hesitantly asking it if it would join you on the rest of your journeys pulling out an empty Pokeball to emphasise the point. Cacnea looked up to you before staring at the ball. So deep in concentration on its decision you fail to notice the village blur and fade to rubble once again. Banette looking tired and worn hovers at the edge of the village watching your actions. Cacnea smiled and laughed before jumping up and grabbing you in a hug. Well it certainly seemed to have made its mind up. It slipped a thorny arm down and touched the Pokeball and was quickly absorbed inside. <b>Congratulations. You have captured a Level 04, Female Cacnea</b>. Banette smiled warmly at scene before it, fading out like the village.

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">&quot;HAHAHAHAHAHA!&quot; shouted Tim as Cacnea's ball glowed red marking a capture. Tim was so excited for Cacnea's capture that he didn't even care that the village was back to rubble. &quot;Well, it looks like our time is up, huh Squirt.&quot; Tim said to the Big Jawed pokemon. &quot;Toto.&quot; Squirt replied in glee. Tim began to look around for Banette to see him/her smiling. &quot;Thank you Banette, for everything...&quot; Tim said almost sad to leave. &quot;We'll have to battle again when we get stronger!&quot; Tim shouted while he was leaving. &quot;Okay Squirt, now to find our way out of this desert and to a cool pokemon center!&quot; Tim said while calling out their newest member, Thorn the Cacnea. &quot;Cacnea!&quot; shouted the small Cactus. &quot;Hey Cacnea, can you lead us out of here?&quot; Tim asked hoping for the answer to be yes. &quot;Cac!&quot; exclaimed Cacnea as she started running as Tim and Squirt followed.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Todd had not expected to see an assault in the desert, seeing as the probability of a chance encounter between even two people in a place this big were miniscule. It was obvious that the Numel needed help. Todd thought quickly about his possible actions. Since he was in a desert, it was only logical that he would meet ground Pokémon. Todd guessed that the two blue blurs were Phanpys. He could just be heartless and ignore the damage that was being inflicted, but that was against his morals and would earn him Ralfil’s enmity. He hurriedly dismissed that idea, astonished that it had even come into his thoughts. He knew that he needed to help the Numel. It probably belonged to the young boy. Still wondering why such a beating was being forced upon the defenseless Numel, Todd ran forward. This jostled Ralfil, who saw the situation with the same estimation as that of Todd. The Trapinch fell off of Todd’s head from the bouncing, but he was able to easily keep pace with Todd on the ground as they rushed forward. Sometimes it was surprising that the Ant Pit Pokémon could move so fast on such small legs. One couldn’t know how strong he was for all the time he spent on Todd’s head. But after all, he was a Pokémon in his natural environment. Todd yelled, “Ralfil! I need you to use Bite on those Pokémon harassing the Numel. They’re probably Phanpys. Try to get them to slow down so you can get a hit in.” The Ant Pit Pokémon nodded and charged toward the spinning attackers while Todd ran over to the boy and asked, “What happened? Why are those two Pokémon attacking the Numel?”</span></span></div>

<b>Ralfil</b> ~</span> Thank you<br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkorange">The sight that greeted you as you passed over a large dune was one you would not have expected to see. A young boy of 13 years was shouting at a pair of blue blurs that slammed relentlessly into a small tired and trembling Numel. The desert was certainly the last place you’d expect to find another trainer especially considering its vastness but this seemed good fortune for the boy who badly needed the help. You took a moment to survey the scene assessing how best to act. You guessed the blue attacking creatures to be Phanpy, the ground elephants which made sense. For a moment the dark notion of ignoring the boy’s plight and continuing on with your own adventure, leaving him to his fate crossed your mind; but you soon dismiss that idea. Deep down you knew that you were this only boys hope and needed to rescue his Numel before it passed out from the repeated painful attacks. <br />
<br />
With the easy decision made you ran forward down the dune causing Ralfil to fall off you head though he spotted where you were headed and quickly followed. As you approached the fight you shouted out some orders to Ralfil who running quite well on little legs nodded rushing past you to get in the action. The boy spotted you running towards him and picked himself back up rubbing the tears from his eyes. Numel was whimpering and had curled up to protect itself. Just as another blue blur had moved in to slam into it another time it yelp as a small ant pit Pokemon had bitten down on its back halting its movement. Numel looked up with teary eyes to see a Trapinch with its jaw firmly locked around one of the Phanpy’s back, the little elephant bucking to rid itself of the creature. You reach the boy and ask him what happened and why the Phanpy’s had attacked the Numel. The boy looked to you almost not believing that you were real before he spoke.<br />
<br />
“I’m Tom and Numel is my Pokemon,” he started as a means of an explanation, “Lumps and me were travelling through the desert looking for the secret villages that are supposed to be here. We came across a wild Pokemon playing and it when it saw us it challenged us so we started a battle. We won and I didn’t want to leave it injured so I captured it and just as we were going to continue on those Phanpy came from under that dune and started attacking Lumps. He was still hurt from his battle he couldn’t defend himself.” He explained looking over to his Numel who was trying to make his way to his trainer. Tom ran the rest of the way and dragged Lumps away from the action hugging his bruised and battered Numel. You spot Ralfil flying almost comically through the air as he’s dislodged from Phanpys back. He rights himself and moves to bite the other elephant when he’s struck and knocked back by an attack. The two Phanpy stare at the newcomers angrily eying up Numel and Trapinch as competition. Tom return’s Lumps to his ball and stands nervously behind you. <br />
<br />
“Do you think you and Trapinch could take them both?” he asked with concern. “They’re strong. I do have the Pokemon I captured but it’s still injured. If I have time to use a Potion on it I could help you.” He said waiting to see what you would do.</span></span></div>

<br />
<b>Fishyfool</b> ~ A chest! A chest! The treasure you were searching for, at last! You tentatively approached the chest remembering what happened at every turn you’ve made here and walk smack bang into an energy barrier that knocked you onto your arse; Volcape just about missed being squished by your derriere. Typical! It’s never simple is it. Reading the plaque near the barrier itself you turn to face the guardian and sigh, you should’ve guessed that the guardian would be a moon Pokemon and that such Pokemon was staring down at you right now. Volcape didn’t seem the least bit intimidated by the floating moon Pokemon and moves to stand before it, ready to face this challenge. Lunatone cast its red eye upon the small fire monkey and nodded, accepting him as the challenger. This was your first battle together and against such a strong looking Pokemon, it would certainly be a test of your strength and strategy. Working through a battle plan you give your instructions to Volcape who nods his understanding. He faces the Lunatone and gives it a terrifying <b>Leer</b> just as Lunatone <b>Harden</b>s its already rock hard skin, but it became startled by the attack non-the-less. Taking the opportunity Volcape let loose a small fray of flames that struck Lunatone head on leaving small black marks in their wake. The fire attack snapped Lunatone out of its stupor and it floats forward with unthought-of speed and slammed into Volcape with a hard <b>Tackle</b> that sent him tumbling backwards. Though Lunatone had taken a head on attack its type kept it quite healthy and with its hardened skin that Tackle had done more damage. You were both going to have to be innovative to beat this guardian.</span> <br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">Sorry about the delays, one was waiting for Volcape to come out of the MT when I suddenly got grounded for grumping.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: gold">Jamie watched with some worry at Lunatone's Tackle, and took a few things into account: Lunatone was a Meteorite pokemon, a rock and psychic type, which meant it was resistant to the two attacks Volcape knew naturally. It wouldn't be likely to have any rock moves, thankfully, but still had the adavntage that at a weight of 370 pounds, a Tackle from it would feel almost like getting smacked by a car for something like Volcape. Concerned, Jamie had a look at the moon pokemon, and at the eyes that seemed to be rather hypnotic, but also somewhat a bit saddened. Thinking about the opponent, he reckoned that him and Volcape were the firts visitors in possibly years, if not decades, and that it was likely bored and lonely at sitting around this room, guarding treasure it probably forgot what it actually was, and the more he thought about it, the more he realised that even if the chest contained enough gemstones to buy a decent-sized property, they wouldn't be as valuable as anything Lunatone would want more than some actual freedom.<br />
<br />
Pushing these thoughts aside, Jamie decided to act tactically and remembered the energy barrier and how painful it was to run into: It hurt a bit, and was just like a wall. That was it! With Volcape rising from the heavy tackle, he sneezed and let loose a few errant sparks of fire, which gave sudden inspiration to Jamie. He had completely forgotten that he had visited a person before coming to this realm who could teach the powers of the elements to pokemon, and remembered the special move Volcape had, one which was neutrally-damaging to Lunatone. Suddenly the battle was planned out perfectly!<br />
<br />
&quot;Volcape! Lunatone may be heavy, but we can use that against him. Give him some more love with <b>ember</b>, then sock him with that move you learned before we came here, <a href="http://bmgf.bulbagarden.net/showpost.php?p=633258&amp;postcount=226" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fbmgf.bulbagarden.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D633258%26postcount%3D226&amp;hash=ef02a8834ace6d417e32f5ff5cad32f7" rel="nofollow noopener"><b>thunderpunch</b></a>! Should he try and tackle you again, use your natural speed to move out of the way so he hits the energy barrier, then hit him with some more <b>embers</b> to try and burn him. Don't give up!&quot;<br />
<br />
As Volcape listened to this plan, Jamie remembered the stowaway he had, and knew that the youngster wouldn't be able to take on Lunatone, even with the neutrality. If push came to shove, however, then that Snover Arctacea would possibly see some action...</span></span></div>

<b>Fishyfool</b> ~ It was obvious that you were concerned about this battle, not only was it Volcape’s first but he was at a disadvantage. You analyse the situation and your opponent closely and speculate that the meteorite Pokemon looked sorrowful; being a guardian in the tomb must be lonely. After a few more assumptions your mind wanders back to the chest, it must contain some wonderful riches. Focusing back on the battle you think tactfully and remember how much the energy barrier smarted when you ran into it; maybe you could use that to your advantage. You suddenly remember that you taught Volcape a special move that might be of use in this battle. With a definite strategy worked out you give your orders to Volcape, both of you feeling confident at the plan. Volcape spun around sending more <b>Embers</b> Lunatone’s way the small wisps of fire running over its body doing little damage. It charges for Volcape the tiny monkey leaping out of the way just in time but fortunately for Lunatone it stopped before it hit the barrier. Volcape took his opportunity and leapt at Lunatone smacking his fist into its rocky hide, the <b>Thunderpunch</b> making Lunatone whine in pain and hit the barrier lightly the energy sparking over its body. Finally you had made an impact on it. Spinning around Lunatone faced Volcape each watching the other to see who’ll move first. Volcape takes the initiative and shoots more <b>Embers</b> at Lunatone but gasps in shock as they stop just in front of it. Luntone’s eye’s are glowing blue and the Embers head back where they came from striking Volcape making him wince but he yelps in shock as Lunatone continues on with its <b>Confusion</b> attack and throws Volcape into the barrier, your Chimchar falling to the ground from the impact. Whatever ground you may have gained you may have just lost. </span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><b><span style="color: darkorange"><u>Desert of Illusion</u></span></b><span style="color: darkorange"> (Please reply in <b>darkorange</b>)</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange"><b>Ralfil</b> ~</span> Thank you</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">The sight that greeted you as you passed over a large dune was one you would not have expected to see. A young boy of 13 years was shouting at a pair of blue blurs that slammed relentlessly into a small tired and trembling Numel. The desert was certainly the last place you’d expect to find another trainer especially considering its vastness but this seemed good fortune for the boy who badly needed the help. You took a moment to survey the scene assessing how best to act. You guessed the blue attacking creatures to be Phanpy, the ground elephants which made sense. For a moment the dark notion of ignoring the boy’s plight and continuing on with your own adventure, leaving him to his fate crossed your mind; but you soon dismiss that idea. Deep down you knew that you were this only boys hope and needed to rescue his Numel before it passed out from the repeated painful attacks. </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">With the easy decision made you ran forward down the dune causing Ralfil to fall off you head though he spotted where you were headed and quickly followed. As you approached the fight you shouted out some orders to Ralfil who running quite well on little legs nodded rushing past you to get in the action. The boy spotted you running towards him and picked himself back up rubbing the tears from his eyes. Numel was whimpering and had curled up to protect itself. Just as another blue blur had moved in to slam into it another time it yelp as a small ant pit Pokemon had bitten down on its back halting its movement. Numel looked up with teary eyes to see a Trapinch with its jaw firmly locked around one of the Phanpy’s back, the little elephant bucking to rid itself of the creature. You reach the boy and ask him what happened and why the Phanpy’s had attacked the Numel. The boy looked to you almost not believing that you were real before he spoke.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">“I’m Tom and Numel is my Pokemon,” he started as a means of an explanation, “Lumps and me were travelling through the desert looking for the secret villages that are supposed to be here. We came across a wild Pokemon playing and it when it saw us it challenged us so we started a battle. We won and I didn’t want to leave it injured so I captured it and just as we were going to continue on those Phanpy came from under that dune and started attacking Lumps. He was still hurt from his battle he couldn’t defend himself.” He explained looking over to his Numel who was trying to make his way to his trainer. Tom ran the rest of the way and dragged Lumps away from the action hugging his bruised and battered Numel. You spot Ralfil flying almost comically through the air as he’s dislodged from Phanpys back. He rights himself and moves to bite the other elephant when he’s struck and knocked back by an attack. The two Phanpy stare at the newcomers angrily eying up Numel and Trapinch as competition. Tom return’s Lumps to his ball and stands nervously behind you. </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">“Do you think you and Trapinch could take them both?” he asked with concern. “They’re strong. I do have the Pokemon I captured but it’s still injured. If I have time to use a Potion on it I could help you.” He said waiting to see what you would do.</span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote>My stupid computer was down for a while, so I couldn't post earlier. Sorry.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Todd had suspected that the Numel belonged to this Tom. The battle that Tom described gave ample reason for his Numel’s inability to resist the Phanpys. Though Todd was puzzled at the nickname for the Numel, he couldn’t really argue that his name made much sense to anyone else. If anything, Lumps definitely made more sense because it centered on the Pokémon’s physical characteristics. Knowing that Ralfil wouldn’t be able to beat two Phanpys at once, Todd felt that Tom’s offer of assistance was well-timed. If he just needed time to heal the captured Pokémon, Todd was sure that his Trapinch could hold out long enough. He decided to use tactics that would prevent the Ant Pit Pokémon from being tired out while avoiding injury. If Ralfil had been more experienced, he would probably have been able to fight off these wild Pokémon without trouble. Unfortunately, he was only level 5, and the Phanpys likely had a combined level that was higher. Todd nodded at Tom and said, “Ralfil can fight them, but I don’t think that he can defeat them both. Use the potion and we’ll battle together.” Todd was a little concerned since he didn’t know what Tom’s other Pokémon was, but beggars can’t be choosers. He smiled, trying to bolster Tom’s spirits, “Wild Pokémon won’t have a chance if we work in concert.” Tom turned to the Pokémon battling, still a little uneasy about not knowing what Pokémon his partner would use. He called out to the Trapinch, “Ralfil! This kid Tom says that he has a Pokémon he can help us with, but he needs time to heal it. Use Bite on the Phanpy when you can, but avoid their attacks. Disorient them in any way you can.” The Ant Pit Pokémon nodded at Todd’s instructions, keeping an eye on his opponents. He began to swerve around to confuse the wild Pokémon.</span></span></div>

<span style="color: gold">Jamie started to worry when he say his plan backfire horribly as Volcape went ass-over-teakettle into the barrier, and immediately knew that Lunatone likely had a lot more experience than Volcape at these things. Looking around the room, he knew that another combo like that could land Volcape in deep stuff, and the monkey already was struggling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Volcape! You okay there? You're doing great against a pokemon like him...&quot;<br />
<br />
Volcape rose slowly from the ground, nodding his head as though he was unsure about victory on this field, and Jamie knew this. He also wondered how Lunatone could afford all that energy, and suddenly had a small thought about the energy barrier.<br />
<br />
<i>What if that barrier was somehow tied to Lunatone...</i><br />
<br />
With his ideas running low, Jamie had to act fast, otherwise he would end up one pokemon down against a rampant floating stone banana intent on removing him from the tomb in several pieces. Forming his next plan, he decided to act somewhat defensively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Volcape, show him you're still in the game by <b>leering</b> at him, then try <b>scratch</b>ing the barrier to see if Lunatone reacts painfully in any way. If he does, proceed to wallop the barrier with a <b>thunderpunch</b>, but if not, then try and paralyze Lunatone by truning that <b>thunderpunch</b> towards him, and try aiming for the eye, as that's his soft spot!&quot;<br />
<br />
As Volcape prepared the next plan, Jamie examined the barrier and the room closely, looking for some way to bring the battle back into his favour.</span></span></div>

<b>Ralfil</b> ~Digesting all the information Tom gave you Ralfil glared at the two Phanpys slowly bearing down on him. Your Trapinch was outnumbered and you reasoned that if he was a little stronger he could probably manage the threat but as a beginner trainer with a young Pokemon it was a hefty task. Ralfil looked determined and although he facing greater odds he would battle by your side every time. Tom had offered to aid you in return you’re your help but would require time to heal his newly acquired Pokemon. You agree to Tom’s plan and hurry him to heal his Pokemon expressing your concern at Ralfil holding his own against the two mini elephants. Tom smiled and nodded hurriedly rooting through his bag for the Potion he needed. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile you let Ralfil in on the plan your Trapinch relieved at the thought of assistance his opponents whispering their own plan amongst themselves. With his orders Ralfil pushing his concerns aside and charged for the nearest Phanpy jaws open wide but the crafty elephants roll away leaving Ralfil spitting up sand. One rolls towards Ralfil and he manages to dodge it only to be <b>Tackle</b>d by the other from behind. Ralfil gets distracted by a <b>Growl</b> from one Phanpy only to get <b>Tackle</b>d again. Wincing at the bruises he’s now sporting Ralfil switched his view from one Phanpy to the other trying to keep track of their movements. One speeds towards him rolling after its <b>Defense Curl</b> and Ralfil leaps out of the way again but leaps to the side this time avoiding a Phanpy that charged up from behind and with his chance dug his jaws around its backside with a hard <b>Bite</b>. The Phanpy began racing around trying to rid itself of the Trapinch-shaped tail.<br />
<br />
Although he had taken a few hits Ralfil was hanging in there and had learnt from their pattern of attacks and had struck back. Peering over to Tom you see that he’s released his new Pokemon, a small Sandshrew. It was dotted with a few charred marks and bruises from the previous battle and Tom was carefully applying the Potion rubbing it in gently. He was informing the Sandshrew of the situation and asking for its assistance. Sandshrew seemed torn between its new trainer and the Phanpy, it was obvious that it knew them and didn’t want to attack them but it had a new trainer now and it knew that it had to obey his commands. You see Ralfil let go of his attack and grin at the teeth marks left on Phanpy’s bum the elephant turning around with tears in its eyes. You can only hope that Tom can talk Sandshrew into helping you. </span><br />

<b>Fishyfool</b> ~ Your face represents your shock as you see Volcape fly through the air smashing into the barrier from Lunatone’s Confusion. Volcape lay on the ground unmoving for a moment and you worried that he’s already out for the count but after a moment he slowly makes his way to his feet holding his shoulder. Volcape looked frazzled and seemed less confident than before. It was obvious that you were both facing a much more experienced Pokemon which should be obvious given its task. Lunatone hovered in place analysing its foe’s condition before slowly approaching daring Volcape to attack again. You hurriedly run tactics through your mind and wonder if the barrier could possibly be tied to Lunatone. You were running short on any other ideas and decided to act now whilst Volcape still had the energy and health to do so. <br />
<br />
With a plan or sorts organised Volcape began his next attempt. He <b>Leered</b> down at Lunatone making it halt in its movement. It seemed hesitant at Volcape’s ferocity even with his weakened condition. Volcape took the opportunity and turned around the <b>Scratch</b> at the barrier feeling tingles run down his paw and turns to see what effect it had on Lunatone … it seemed unaffected. The barrier didn’t seem linked to Lunatone, it must have been activated by a presence in treasure chamber. Lunatone seemed no weaker from the attack and had snapped out of its stupor enough to charge towards Volcpae who ducks just in time. Lunatone in its haste and overconfidence crashes into the barrier moaning as the energy crackles over its rocky hide. With Lunatone weakened Volcape takes the initiative and pulls back his fist, electrical energy sparking off it. With a roar he threw his <b>Thunderpunch</b> right into Lunatone’s eye making it cry out with a horrid soun in agony. It haphazardly floats back trying to shake the pain away and you notice’s its normally red eye seems a blackened colour. Now blinded in one eyes it turns to leave its good eye facing you both anger written in the red orb. Volcape holds his head suddenly in pain as Lunatone uses its <b>Confusion</b> this time to mess with his mind. When the assault is over Volcape pants hard. He’s beginning to really hurt mentally and physically but with has a small grin on his face. With only one good side Lunatone was at a major disadvantage and it too was really feeling the pain. There was a chance you could both still win this battle.</span></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: gold">Noticing the effect of the eye, Jamie could only wince at the pained cry it emitted, and realised that it would have difficulty noticing Volcape on that side, but would likely focus on Volcape with his good eye, and this could only mean one thing: This battle could go his way if possible. Running thoughts through his mind, Lunatone was part Psychic, and from the previous endeavours, had used Confusion both defensively with the previous attacks and offensively with this one, and as Volcape shook his head in pain, he realised that so long as it couldn't see, it would have trouble locating Volcape without expending energy fiinding him psychovisually. With these facts in mind, Jamie felt it more of a necessity to stop the battle before it ended up crippled for life, but also had a sense of mercy in that by finishing the battle, it's suffering would end sooner. Volcape too was faring poorly, but had the advantage of being sensually sound. Lunatone would likely cover defend his good eye from attack by using his psychic powers, but his need to see his foe would be a major weakness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Volcape, you're doing great against a pokemon like Lunatone, and I'm proud of your efforts. He'll be focusing on you, so run around him and close in on him, spitting <b>embers</b> at his eye to try and coax him into using his psychic powers, then deliver a <b>thunderpunch</b> to his good eye. If all goes well, he'll either be blinded by the embers or by the punch, but either way give him another dose of <b>ember</b> at his damaged eye.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he gave the orders, he looked at Lunatone and knew that it could likely have some form of telepathy, and as he stated this, Jamie thought a small message to the guardian, hoping it could hear him.<br />
<br />
'<i>Lunatone, I respect your ability to use your powers as well as your combat ability, but I feel that your life here must be pretty dull, guarding a treasure you couldn't care about from people who hardly every come here, never seeing the world outside that which you've spent here, and wondering what your old masters are doing. Im my views, you must be rather saddened here, and would probably want to travel around the world, seeing everything, so that when you eventually pass on, you may share the sights with your old masters. I believe that you are worth as much as the very treasure you guard as a warrior and a guardian, and I feel that you know this as well.</i>'</span></span></div>

<b>Fishyfool</b> ~ Although your goal was the beat the guardian defending the sacred treasure and you would go to any means in order to defeat it you still felt its pain. Its eye was looking swollen and a darker than red than before and Lunatone had a look of concern in its remaining good eye as it stared down your Chimc had a look of concern in its remaining good eye as it stared down your Chimchar. Now things were turning around in your favour you feel a tingle of excitement before you quell it to think over your next course of action. You reassess Lunatone’s condition and current abilities based on what you’ve seen. You come to the conclusion that Lunatone will try to keep its good eye protected and if it tried any further psychic attacks it would expend more energy in order to do so. You feel a guilt ebb away at you and want to end the battle as soon as possible for both Pokemon involved not wanting to cause any permanent damage if possible. With those thoughts and actions in mind you plan out the next phase.<br />
<br />
Volcape knowing that he needed to disable Lunatone’s sight spun around shooting off multiple <b>Embers</b> right at its eye only for Lunatone to spin around, the firey balls striking its injured side causing less damage. Lunatone glowed with a translucent sheen as it <b>Harden</b>ed its defences and its good eye glowed blue again a little brighter than before. Volcape suddenly collapsed holding his head as terrible images of pain destruction encroached on his mind. The attack stopped after a few seconds Lunatone finding it very draining and was looking increasingly tired. Luckily Volcape hadn’t been confused from the <b>Confusion</b> and just as he recovered Lunatone barrelled towards him leaving him little time to dodge. Sideswiped by the <b>Tackle</b> Volcape winced and fell back holding his side as well as his head. He too was nearing exhaustion and these multiple mental and physical attacks were wearing him right down. Picking himself up with adrenaline fuelling the movement he threw a wild <b>Thunderpunch</b> that unfortunately didn’t hit Lunatone’s good eye but still cracked into its rocky skin making it cry in pain again the noise becoming more heartbreaking as you almost feel its emotions run through you. Finishing off he fired off another slew of <b>Embers</b> striking Lunatone once more leaving it looking near defeat though Volcape would not manage too much more either.<br />
<br />
After you conveyed your empathetic message telepathically hoping that it someday gets its freedom and a chance to leave the tomb and view the world, Lunatone turned to face you. Its good eye seemed to gleam with understanding and regret. You get the feeling that Lunatone would like nothing more than you suggest but daren’t ask for such a thing as it knew its position was too important to abandon. Despite everything you seem to have made a connection with Lunatone.</span></span></div>

<br />
<b>Fishyfool</b> ~ Although your goal was the beat the guardian defending the sacred treasure and you would go to any means in order to defeat it you still felt its pain. Its eye was looking swollen and a darker than red than before and Lunatone had a look of concern in its remaining good eye as it stared down your Chimc had a look of concern in its remaining good eye as it stared down your Chimchar. Now things were turning around in your favour you feel a tingle of excitement before you quell it to think over your next course of action. You reassess Lunatone’s condition and current abilities based on what you’ve seen. You come to the conclusion that Lunatone will try to keep its good eye protected and if it tried any further psychic attacks it would expend more energy in order to do so. You feel a guilt ebb away at you and want to end the battle as soon as possible for both Pokemon involved not wanting to cause any permanent damage if possible. With those thoughts and actions in mind you plan out the next phase.<br />
<br />
Volcape knowing that he needed to disable Lunatone’s sight spun around shooting off multiple <b>Embers</b> right at its eye only for Lunatone to spin around, the firey balls striking its injured side causing less damage. Lunatone glowed with a translucent sheen as it <b>Harden</b>ed its defences and its good eye glowed blue again a little brighter than before. Volcape suddenly collapsed holding his head as terrible images of pain destruction encroached on his mind. The attack stopped after a few seconds Lunatone finding it very draining and was looking increasingly tired. Luckily Volcape hadn’t been confused from the <b>Confusion</b> and just as he recovered Lunatone barrelled towards him leaving him little time to dodge. Sideswiped by the <b>Tackle</b> Volcape winced and fell back holding his side as well as his head. He too was nearing exhaustion and these multiple mental and physical attacks were wearing him right down. Picking himself up with adrenaline fuelling the movement he threw a wild <b>Thunderpunch</b> that unfortunately didn’t hit Lunatone’s good eye but still cracked into its rocky skin making it cry in pain again the noise becoming more heartbreaking as you almost feel its emotions run through you. Finishing off he fired off another slew of <b>Embers</b> striking Lunatone once more leaving it looking near defeat though Volcape would not manage too much more either.<br />
<br />
After you conveyed your empathetic message telepathically hoping that it someday gets its freedom and a chance to leave the tomb and view the world, Lunatone turned to face you. Its good eye seemed to gleam with understanding and regret. You get the feeling that Lunatone would like nothing more than you suggest but daren’t ask for such a thing as it knew its position was too important to abandon. Despite everything you seem to have made a connection with Lunatone.</span></span>

<br />
<span style="color: gold">The battle was continuing, both on the field and in the minds of the three beings present at the site. Volcape, looking very poorly, had scored another hit on the floating moon, and the cry it emitted on the impact almost made the tears well up inside Jamie. He knew that if the battle didn't end hastily, then he'd likely break down emotionally, yet at the same time didn't want to cause any more unnecessary harm to Lunatone, nor push Volcape harder than he can handle.<br />
<br />
With another glance at the good eye of Lunatone, he felt that it was his job to put an end to the suffering and loneliness that it had endured for god knows how long, and looking at Volcape, he realised a small point that could help end this battle. With the natural agility that Chimchar have, as before when Lunatone first used Confusion, and the fact that Lunatone was a crescent moon, there should be enough space to grip him and leap off if he tried and tackling techniques. With this final plan sought out, Jamie wondered if Volcape would have the energy and stamina to pull it off, and as his hand casually wandered over Arctacea's ball, he felt the need to call Volcape back, but persevered, looking into the determined and tired eyes of his starter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Volcape! You've done me proud this battle, and have exceeded all my expectations of you, so don't feel down if you can't continue fighting anymore. When we get out of here, I promise to get you that banana split you like, but for now, stay a bit of a distance from Lunatone, it takes more energy to use psychic attacks on a distant foe, so he should likely charge at you. When he does, <b>leer</b> at him, then jump and grab onto his rocky hide before hitting him with another <b>thunderpunch</b>, aiming for his good eye, before jumping off and spraying <b>embers</b> if he's still conscious. Don't worry if you get beat up too much, if you feel you can't carry on the battle, then just run around the barrier, scratching it and I'll recall you, I won't force you to exert energy you don't wish to exert. I have told myself that, because pokemon aren't just for battles, they're <i>friends</i> that need care, just like people.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he gave his orders, Jamie felt a few errant tears cascade down his cheeks and quench the thirst of the dry stone below his feet as his emotional floodgates finally gave way.</span></span></div>

<b>Concore</b> ~ This brute of a man was not going to intimidate either Spector or yourself and you quickly prepared for battle. There was no other option, you would defeat him then free Crystal from her bonds. Spector seemed confident to be able to take on any opponent and fixed the man with a determined glare, awaiting the arrival of his foe. As the man sent out his Pokemon, a small purple scorpion creature you find yourself shocked. It was a tiny frail looking thing, yet a Pokemon you had yet to encounter. Wracking your brains you remember that its part bug and part poison; that gave you and Spector the advantage. Still you decide to play it safe and with his orders, your Drowsee set to work immobilising the bug.<br />
<br />
He concentrated on sending out hypnotic waves only to get startled by a fearsome <b>Leer</b>, suddenly that Skorupi didn’t looks so small anymore, its eyes looked huge and evil! Spector didn’t know what to do with himself and his Hypnosis was stopped before it even began. The man smirked his Skorupi matching his smile and scuttled over to Spector <b>Bit</b>ing down on his arm. What the?! That dragged Spector out of his daze as he ran back and forth crying out and trying to dislodge the bug from his arm. With a hefty wave he managed to throw Skorupi off looking down at the red teeth marks left in his skin. That had really hurt! Drawing away from the pain a moment he looked over at the Skorupi who was grinning evilly. Spector had to calm himself down or his hypnosis would never work. Concentrating again he felt the hypnotic waves released this time and now Skorupi wasn’t looking so happy. It yawned and promptly fell over on its side asleep. <br />
<br />
Well at least you had gotten it out of action for a moment. The man didn’t seem fazed by this though.<br />
<br />
“Oh what are we to do, Skorupi is asleep, we’ll never win now” he overdramatically cried out before laughing manically. “We’re not some stupid beginning trainer boy, we have some dirty tricks of our own. Skorupi <b>Snore</b> and when you wake up tear it apart with <b>Pin Missile</b>.”<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: LemonChiffon">Stunned at how quickly the tables had turned on him, Verne was flabbergasted. This Skorupi was running circles around Spector, “Perhaps this was a little too much” Verne thought, “We haven’t been in a battle this hard for...well, we haven’t been in much of a battle before!” He began to fear for Spector, seriously regretting what he had led them into. Looking at the Drowzee nursing his bitten arm, he watched the determination on his face grow, and he felt a great amount pride toward Spector. But the truth of the reality was that, Spector only knew two moves, so for now, their cycle of Hypnosis and Pound looked like their only battle plan they had, and Spector would just have to take the damage from Snore or...<br />
<br />
His thought was broken by the deafening sound of the Skorupi’s Snore, totally unprepared for how loud it was, Spector fell to his feet. That was enough for Verne, watching his friend being battered was no fun at whatsoever. For now, that Skorupi was still asleep, so “Spector quickly, <b>Pound</b>, <b>Pound</b>, <b>Pound</b> that thing and brace yourself for that Pin Missile!” He ordered.</span></span></div>

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange"><b>Ralfil</b> ~Digesting all the information Tom gave you Ralfil glared at the two Phanpys slowly bearing down on him. Your Trapinch was outnumbered and you reasoned that if he was a little stronger he could probably manage the threat but as a beginner trainer with a young Pokemon it was a hefty task. Ralfil looked determined and although he facing greater odds he would battle by your side every time. Tom had offered to aid you in return you’re your help but would require time to heal his newly acquired Pokemon. You agree to Tom’s plan and hurry him to heal his Pokemon expressing your concern at Ralfil holding his own against the two mini elephants. Tom smiled and nodded hurriedly rooting through his bag for the Potion he needed. </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Meanwhile you let Ralfil in on the plan your Trapinch relieved at the thought of assistance his opponents whispering their own plan amongst themselves. With his orders Ralfil pushing his concerns aside and charged for the nearest Phanpy jaws open wide but the crafty elephants roll away leaving Ralfil spitting up sand. One rolls towards Ralfil and he manages to dodge it only to be <b>Tackle</b>d by the other from behind. Ralfil gets distracted by a <b>Growl</b> from one Phanpy only to get <b>Tackle</b>d again. Wincing at the bruises he’s now sporting Ralfil switched his view from one Phanpy to the other trying to keep track of their movements. One speeds towards him rolling after its <b>Defense Curl</b> and Ralfil leaps out of the way again but leaps to the side this time avoiding a Phanpy that charged up from behind and with his chance dug his jaws around its backside with a hard <b>Bite</b>. The Phanpy began racing around trying to rid itself of the Trapinch-shaped tail.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Although he had taken a few hits Ralfil was hanging in there and had learnt from their pattern of attacks and had struck back. Peering over to Tom you see that he’s released his new Pokemon, a small Sandshrew. It was dotted with a few charred marks and bruises from the previous battle and Tom was carefully applying the Potion rubbing it in gently. He was informing the Sandshrew of the situation and asking for its assistance. Sandshrew seemed torn between its new trainer and the Phanpy, it was obvious that it knew them and didn’t want to attack them but it had a new trainer now and it knew that it had to obey his commands. You see Ralfil let go of his attack and grin at the teeth marks left on Phanpy’s bum the elephant turning around with tears in its eyes. You can only hope that Tom can talk Sandshrew into helping you. </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Todd winced in sympathy with Ralfil’s bruises. He was hoping Tom would hurry up a bit. At least the Trapinch was getting in some hits of his own. It was always embarrassing to get bitten on your butt. Todd felt a slight twinge of pity for the Phanpy, but was mainly happy that Ralfil had succeeded in his attack. It was worrisome that the Sandshrew knew the Phanpys. This could present a difficult problem. However, if the Phanpys recognized the Sandshrew, they might be less likely to attack it. If the Phanpys balked, Todd might be able to turn this into a less serious battle. He only had one Pokéball, and if he had to catch one of them like Tom had done, he didn’t want to leave the other one stranded. It was always so hard to know what would happen next. Todd glanced over at Tom while he was applying the potion. All ground Pokémon. This would be interesting no matter what. Todd spoke to Tom, “If your Sandshrew helps, we won’t leave these Phanpys to be victims of other wild Pokémon. We’ll make sure they’re safe before moving on. Think of it as a way to impress these Pokémon of your skills as a trainer.” If Todd was able to impress the Phanpys, one of them might be willing to join his team. They had certainly impressed him with their techniques. He needed to win first though. Todd turned back to the battle and called out to the Ant Pit Pokémon, “Good work Ralfil! Keep it up. Just keep using Bite.” That was about all he could say, considering that Ralfil’s only move was Bite. Ralfil nodded, acknowledging Todd’s encouragement and focused on his opponents.</span></span></div>

<br />
<span style="color: lemonchiffon">Your initial confidence at the type advantage you had disappears rather quickly as you see how the little scorpion battles. It was speedy and full of tricks but you should expect no less from a Pokemon with a trainer as mysterious and dastardly as it had. A flicker of panic runs through you and you worry if you’ve bitten off more than you can chew. This probably wasn’t the best idea for your first ever battle, facing off against a much more experienced trainer and one that would no doubt use every dirty trick possible to win. Spector was holding his arm, smarting from the Bite attack and was also sharing your concerns but on the outside appeared calm and collected, ready to strike back. Spector was limited to only two attacks but you’d both have to make the best of what was available. <br />
<br />
With orders to give Skorupi a good Pounding Spector leapt forward slamming his fist onto the tiny scorpions head. The force was impressive but Skorupi remained asleep. It suddenly lets loose a loud <b>Snore</b> that knocks Spector back on his butt holding his ears from the loud noise. Picking himself back up he <b>Pound</b>ed Skorupi again knocking it onto its side but still asleep. Acting quickly Spector threw a last <b>Pound</b> that rolled Skorupi over further onto its back. Skorupi was jolted from its sleep by the last strike and winced as it stood back up, the bruises from the repeated attacks only just being felt. It remembered faintly the last order and with Spector within close reach fired a slew of <b>Pin Missles</b> that struck your Drowsee hard and making him cry out stumbling back over to you. He pulls at the barbs stuck in his skin wincing at everyone that he removed.<br />
<br />
The man grinned at the pain your Drowsee endured and Skorupi despite its own pain grinned back too.<br />
<br />
“You made a grave mistake coming here today boy, not only will your Pokemon pay but you and the little girl will suffer too,” he said leering at Caitlin who hid behind you unnerved by his stare, her eyes wandering over to Crystal who shot a dirty look at the retched man.</span><br />

<b>Ralfil</b> ~ You can almost feel Ralfil’s bruises and wince at every hit he takes whilst holding off the current threat. You glance over to Tom who’s healing his newly acquired Sandshrew and silently wished he’d hurry up. Sandshrew looked longingly over a the Phanpy pair who had stopped their rolling attacks to stare back. Both sets of Pokemon had mixed emotions written over their faces and you wonder how this will affect the battle. If Sandshrew doesn’t heed Tom’s orders the battle could go serious wrong and Ralfil would be the one to pay the price. Ralfil who’s gaze was flitting between his new partner and his enemies was of same mind as you and he backed towards you leaving space between him and the Phanpy duo. Your thoughts drift away from the battle to the consequences, if you won the Phanpy would be wide open for any other trainers or Pokemon that come along to brutalise, capture, eat … just like Lumps after his battle and you did not wish to bring any more harm to them. You tell Tom that you plan on ensure the Phanpy’s safety after the battle and he meets you with a conflicted look before the sad eyes of his Sandshrew bore into his soul making him nod in agreement. Tom had finished healing his Sandhrew as you gave further instructions to Ralfil and he knelt down to be level with his Pokemon.<br />
<br />
“I know you’re friends with the Phanpy but I need you to help us.” Tom started as Sandshrew looked over at its friends with sorrow. “They attacked Lumps because I captured you, they really hurt him. It wasn’t a fair fight but now we have help. Our battle was fair and we both understood going in the consequences if I won,” Tom said his Sandshrew nodding solemnly. “I’m not a bad person and I hope we can become friends too very soon. I know what I’m asking is hard but please help us,” he pleaded tears in his eyes. Sandshrew stared deep into his eyes before sighing and nodding, it wasn’t happy about the decision but made it anyway.<br />
<br />
“We’ll do this quickly so the damage will be minimal,” he said as if to comfort Sanshrew who merely nodded again. “Use your Sand Attack on one of the Phanpys then hit with a Scratch,” he ordered and Sandshrew plodded towards the battlefield, a little more slowly than both trainers would like.<br />
<br />
The Phanpys stared at Sandshrew, the small rodent with its head down as it shuffled its foot in the sand. Ralfil looked back and forth before taking the opportunity to leapt forward and sink his jaws around the leg of one of the Phanpys in a <b>Bite</b> attack causing all 3 Pokemon to break eye contact. The Phanpy cried out and fell onto its back trying to dislodge Ralfil. Sandshrew went to aid it before it remembered which side it was on. Sighing it turned around and digging its paws into the ground shifting a good amount of sand that hit the other Phanpy right in the face making it gasp in surprise shaking its head to rid its eyes of the foreign substance. Sandshrew’s lip wobbled and it closed its eyes as it reached forward <b>Scratch</b>ing the Phanpy along its side. The other Phanpy rolled round and round rapidly throwing Ralfil off and upon seeing their friend attack its kin looked shocked before anger filled its face. It ran forward and <b>Tackled</b> the unsuspecting Sandshrew pushing it down into the sands. Phanpy sat atop Sandshrew and looked down at it with a hard look as the sand rodent looked a mixture of guilty and afraid. Before it could act further Ralfil leapt forth and <b>Bit</b> down into its back throwing it off Sandshrew along with Ralfil who couldn’t keep his grip this time. <br />
<br />
Sandshrew picking itself back up and rubbed its stomach where it had been hit staring at Ralfil who stood by its side, a silent thank you passing between them. Both Phanpys had recovered from their attacks but were looking less healthy than your Pokemon. They exchanged looks before staring hard at Sandshrew, it seemed like the gloves were off and the little sand rodent would just have to accept that.</span> <br />

<br />
<b>Fishyfool</b> ~ This battle was more than a test of strength of Pokemon and human but a test of heart and you felt a tears form in yours as Lunatone cried out melodiously at another strike on its form. Your emotions were raw and filling your whole being, your first battle and it was such a heart-wrenching one. Were they all like this? Would you break down every time you had to face a new opponent? For right now you wanted this battle done, over, finished … before anymore pain was inflicted on either Pokemon. Lunatone stared right at you its red eye betraying its strength and showing its emotions. It understood your need to fight it but your words had stirred something deep inside and it had a new longing that it had never felt before and it was conflicted. <br />
<br />
Tearing your gaze away for fear that the floodgates would open and tears that would never end would flow you manage to compose yourself enough to strategise. Volcape was a small yet agile monkey and could move faster than the bulky moon Pokemon. You could use that to your advantage and hopefully finish the battle quickly. Volcape was hunched over in pain and dripping with sweat, exhaustion wracking his body, he appeared in no condition to fight on yet his eyes were filled with the same determination that shone at the start of the battle. You feel your Snover’s pokeball by your side and wonder for a moment, would it be wrong to call her out? Volcape would be able to rest and heal but you may never be able to heal his pride for doing so. Such a decision you made to carry on may permanently affect your Chimchar but deep down you felt it the right one.<br />
<br />
Praising Volcape and promising him a delicious treat after the battle was done brought a smile to the Chimchars face as he held in a giggle. You could understand if he couldn’t continue on but this seemed to just fuel the fire of determination keeping him going and he stood tall. Proudly you smile feeling a few fresh tears escape your eyes and trek down your cheek. With a strategy formed you convey what you pray is the last onslaught for Volcape and he gives no signs of hearing your order, merely stared at Lunatone who focused on you with its good eye. Volcape backed up as per your instructions and Lunatone seemed deep within its own thoughts, pain shining in it’s eye from the attacks it had racked up. Its eye turned to a blue colour once more and both you and Volcape knew what was to follow. You stared worriedly at the spot Volcape was last at only to see him charging towards Lunatone, that wasn’t part of the plan! Volcape moved in a haphazard movement and you could see that Lunatone was having trouble focusing on him. Grinning at his ingeninuity you see him leap up and grab onto Lunatone sitting before his nose causing Lunatone to panic slightly and shake back and forth to knock him off. Holding on tight Volcape slammed a <b>Thunderpunch</b> into Lunatones good eye making it shriek in agony and you bite your lip feeling more tears flow. Lunatone crashes to the ground and with a final flurry of <b>Embers</b> from Volcape it lay unmoving, the light in its eyes diminished as it was KO’ed. <b>Level-Up for Volcape</b>. <br />
<br />
Volcape gave it a look a respect before tiredly walking over to you and collapsing in your arms. Lunatone disappears into thousands of bright pink lights and joins those dancing around the walls leaving only a small round pink orb behind with a moon symbol in white in its centre on the ground. You hear a crackle and buzz as the barrier behind you shattered the energy floating up to disappear into the ceiling. There was nothing between you and your treasure now. Upon closer inspection the chest had several lines leading to a round circular divot in its centre but no other locks. Now was the time to open it and receive your treasure.</span></span></div>
