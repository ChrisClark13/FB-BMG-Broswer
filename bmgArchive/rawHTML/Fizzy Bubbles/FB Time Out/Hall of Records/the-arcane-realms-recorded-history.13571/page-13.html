<br />
<b>Fishyfool</b> ~ Looking at the riddle you scratch your head and search for the answers. It was a strange riddle indeed but reading it through you felt that you had the answer. Volcape stared intently at you hoping that you understood exactly what it all meant because he sure as hell didn’t. A light flicked on in your mind and you grinned down at your monkey who grinned back, you had the answer, well what you thought was the answer. Sticking your finger into the warm sand you begin to write and shortly after you have written the word ‘SOUND’. You step back and wait to see what will happen. You see your word disappear into the sand to be replaced by a large ‘X’ … that can’t be good! You feel the ground shake and Volcape losing his cool yells out in shock leaping up onto your shoulder. The hard stable ground beneath you began to transform into thick sand and you feel yourself sinking into it. Panicking you look around to see that the way you came in was no longer there and every part of the ground was now sand. You feel your feet sink down and frantically try to pull yourself out. Volcape wrenched on your neck and you shout at him to stop before you realise he’s trying to grab your attention. Looking back up to the board of sand on the wall you can see a message written there.<br />
<br />
“ONE MORE CHANCE. THE CORRECT ANSWER WILL OPEN THE DOOR. THE SAND WILL SWALLOW YOU WHOLE IF YOU FAIL.”<br />
<br />
You better get it right this time or your time as a trainer would have been a very short one.</span><br />
<i>(If you’re really struggling for the answer PM me and I’ll give you a hint)</i></span>

<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: gold">Knowing his poor riddle ability, Jamie input his answer he thought of into the sand, and facepalmed when the large X appeared. Thinking as to what else it could be, the next sound he heard was someone shouting 'FUCK!!!' and a second later he registered it as his own as he felt somewhat heavier. Looking down at his feet, he noticed that replacing said metatarsal support systems was a rather thick sand, almost like a slow version of quicksand, and the wrench of fire monkey on neck wasn't helping much either. Jamie at that point decided to use the best thing he could do: Panic.<br />
<br />
After some wiggling around and futile attempt to release himsself from the sandy doom below him, he submitted to Volcape's pulling and loked at the wall, and repeated his previous expletive at the new words. He sincerely hoped that the final part about the sand swallowing him was partly a joke, and that below there would be another chamber where he would be given one last chance to survive, hopefully with a test of combat skills. Needless to say, that would be Volcape, and at that point he wondered just what was under all this sand. He had known a few pokemon with an ability called Arena Trap, which was used to hunt prey by thickening the ground they stood on to prevent their escape, and Jamie <i>prayed</i> that this sand trap was indeed of that variant and not some ancient defense mechanism for the purpose of punishing those who couldn't open the door...<br />
<br />
<i>open the door...</i><br />
<br />
At this point, Jamie was hit with a sudden realisation that if manifested into a physical form would likely knock him straight through the sand and rock and through to the other side of the FB realm. The riddle itself was to do with opening a door, not with something else. Recalling the riddle, he dissected it piece by piece. <i>What strength and force cannot get through, I can do with a simple touch...</i> must refer to a door being impossible to get through using sheer force without breaking the damn thing off the hinges, which is why most would have a handle to turn, opening the lock easily and allowing passage. <i>And where many people in the street would stand, were I not a friend at hand...</i> had to refer to the fact that people in the street wouldn't get into buildings without handles to put their hands on and turn or push to get into stores and homes. At this point, Jamie thought he had the riddle sussed...and ran into a metaphorical brick wall. A key also opens doors with ease, and is at hand, and thought deeply of the two answers.<br />
<br />
<i>But what if they're <b>both</b> wrong?</i><br />
<br />
Jamie summed up his situation: He was knee-deep in thick sand, either part of an ancient defense mechanism for those who prefer brawn to brains or a hungry pokemon trying to get a free meal, with the only way of freedom through this riddle, which he had only one chance left at, lest he be in one of two places: Utterly screwed in the depths of the sand, or in major trouble in a possibly hidden chamber under the sand. He sincerely hoped it were the latter, and felt some sympathy for Volcape on his shoulder, who was starting to shiver in fear. Taking out his ball, Jamie recalled him, knowing that a human's life is expendable, but that of a young pokemon is priceless, and that inside the ball the Chimchar would be safe. Clipping the ball to the belt, Jamie turned to the board and inhaled a heavy lungful of air, possibly his last one for a while or ever unless some cruel twist of fate decreed that the sand was a magical wormhole of transportation that would take him somewhere else in a month's time or so, in which case he fancied that Forest of Adventure place which is where he also wanted to visit, but brushed it aside and placed his finger on the sand.<br />
<br />
Scrawling the word &quot;Key&quot; on the board, he braced himself for either the sensation of being thrown up back onto solid ground...or that of suddenly plummeting into a Zero Isle Standard Pitfall Trap.</span></span></div>

<b>empoleon dynamite</b> ~ As you doggedly pursued Teddiursa your mind began to wander and it was a wonder how you managed not to run into a tree. You saw yourself at one end of a very impressive arena, the Elite 4 member Drake stood at the other. His Flygon was released and you released your own Pokemon, your Teddiursa. They began a fierce battle and you were suddenly brought back into focus by your irked Shroomish who was trying to look mad whilst holding back a grin at the leaves now stuck in your hair. He ushered you towards him and you sheepishly followed. You’re quite thankful that Fungi was at least able to keep up with the quick footed Teddy. As you enter the clearing you gasp in awe at the wonderful sight, a large Pecha Berry tree sat in its centre, its leaves tousled gently in the breeze. Teddiursa smiled at you as it ate a berry some of the juice running down its chin. Sending out Brawly, the Totodile stumbled a little on exit from his ball and held his stomach in pain. You pluck a ripe pink berry from the nearest branch and hold it out to Brawly urging him to eat it. Knowing that it would cure his poison Brawly took it a swallowed it whole taking a few bites before hand to get used to the sweet taste. He gave you a faint smile instantly feeling better though still thoroughly worn. You match his smile and return him to his Pokeball to rest some more. <br />
<br />
Turning to the sitting Teddiursa you heartily thank it for its help and it smiles at you, seemingly happy to have repaid the favour. Holding an empty Pokeball to your chest you notice Teddiursa switch its gaze to the sphere. You tentatively approach it and make it an offer. A battle with Fungi and Teddy realised that if it lost it would be captured. It looked away for a moment taking in the forest, its sights sounds and smells before facing you. It stood up and winced from its previous injuries. Nodding its head it moved to face your Shroomish. Not waiting for you to give a command it got its game face on and bull rushed Fungi swiping its claws across his face in a harsh <b>Scratch</b> attack. Though Teddiursa was clearly already injured it still had some fight left in it and it knew that it would have to fight hard to win.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Pyschopath</b> ~</span> You can use two Pokemon only they would be less likely to receive any levels from the battle.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: limegreen"> With both Pokemon so close to one another you take the opportunity to scan the angry squirrel hoping to gain an insight that would help you in battle. You realise why Pachirisu was so mad at you trying to take its food and why it was fiercely defending it. You begin to get very hopeful that this squirrel could lead you to more food if you defeat it, that is if you could rouse it afterwards. Freeze merely nodded not worrying about food currently more concerned with the irate squirrel sparking its cheeks at him. You feel confident that you’ll win this battle and Pachirisu seems offended by your words as if understanding what you said. Freeze jumped back and forth trying to keep Pachirisu off balance and keep it guessing. Pachirisu looked bored by Freeze’s dancing and crossed its arms and as Freeze <b>Leer</b>ed, it wasn’t even looking at him. Freeze growled angrily and pulled back his fist charging it with ice energy. Pachirisu noticing the shift of temperature in the air hunched over and glowed a faint red. Freeze launched his <b>Ice Punch</b> smacking Pachirisu right in its little body pushing it back but it remained standing looking pained. Freeze pulled his other arm back before swiping the squirrel across its abdomen with a harsh <b>Scratch</b> leaving small bleeding trails across its white fur; but still it remained standing panting in pain. Pachirisu suddenly grinned and gave you a hateful look before running right for Freeze the red aura surrounding it spiking with power as it slammed into Freeze and with amazing force throwing him right up into the air, the white Sneasel landing with a crash several metres away looking very hurt. That <b>Bide</b> had absorbed a lot of power and given back double leaving Freeze downed. This battle had suddenly swung in Pachirisu’s favour. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="color: lemonchiffon">With an expectant Harmony waiting for your answer you tell her exactly how your Pokemon and Pidgey came to be as injured as they were. She listened intently as you told her of finding the young boy zapping Pidgey with his Electrike before taking them on in battle with Torchlight. You tell her of your first victory, a very important one you feel and how the boy ran off to leave the defenceless injured bird alone. Not wanting to leave it in such a state you brought it with you wanting to get it healed. Harmony gasped and approached you looking you right in the eye before smiling.<br />
<br />
“What a wonderful thing you’ve done, helping an innocent wild Pokemon like that. The world needs more kind and caring people like you,” she said moved by your story. Suddenly the machine beeped and the board Pidgey was lying on moved forward. The tiny bird opened its eyes slowly taking in its new surroundings worriedly before spotting you. It got to its feet and stretched its wings marvelling at how good it felt. It chirped at you happily realising that you had healed it.<br />
<br />
“Well Pidgey seems full of energy now; let’s get your Cyndaquil healed up.” Harmony said taking your fiery echidna and placing him on the machine. You watched as it whirred to life and began its healing process all over again. Pidgey meanwhile was observing you with a keen eye, thoughts unknown to you whizzing through its mind. <br />
<br />
After another 10 minutes of waiting the machine beeped again and the board slid forward and Torchlight sat up giving you a beaming smile. You pick up your Cyndaquil and thank Harmony for healing him. <br />
<br />
“You take care now, I’ll make sure Pidgey get back home alright,” she says waving you off. As you leave the Pharmacy you hear a series of loud chirps before Pidgey flies out of the doors landing at you feet. Harmony followed shortly after and smiled<br />
<br />
“It seems that Pidgey wants to come with you, you must have made a good impression,” Pidgey gave you a hopeful look waiting to see what you would do.<br />

<b>RaunchyFad</b> ~ Coughing, your bruised ribs protesting with every gasp you took you sat up and yelled at the fat feline that had just attacked you. Purugly didn’t seem at all fazed by your yelling and merely grinned wickedly at your predicament. Peering towards Rocky you growl out at her and she widens her eyes. Did you just call her dumb? She wasn’t dumb merely an expert comedienne. Shaking off the attack she turned to face you and Purugly who was silently willing her to attack. Stomping on the ground startling the Meowth cowering next to her she tried to get your attention. This was her chance to prove herself in battle, and if it had to be you well that would have to do. It took a moment for you to get what she was hinting at but your eyes widened as you realised that she wanted to battle the ugly kitty. Playing into your acting skills you fearfully slid away from the Purugly whilst giving Rocky her orders in code. Having understood the command Rocky covered herself in a red aura calming herself and preparing her <b>Bide</b>. Purugly wasn’t quite sure what she was up to but was sure that she was planning something. It released a freaky <b>Growl</b> that shook up Rocky but she maintained her calm praying that it would attack her otherwise her Bide wouldn’t work. Seeing that Rocky had not been moves by its Growl, Purugly charged forward and leapt at her hitting her with a meaty limb in a <b>Scratch</b> attack dealing some good damage. Rocky unleashed her attack charging at the fat cat and hitting it with a spiking red aura that pushed it back very slightly. The Bide had done some damage but hardly enough to worry the cat. Rocky barely had time to <b>Harden</b> as another meaty limb was launched at her, the second <b>Scratch</b> causing less damage this time but hurt all the same. Now getting pissed at all the scratches marring her body Rocky released a <b>Leech Seed</b> that planted itself on Purugly’s back and began to weave its tendrils into its fur. Purugly merely sighed and moved backwards readying another attack. It didn’t seem concerned at the threat Rocky posed. Meowth meanwhile had scurried over to you to see how you were doing and hiding on your lap away from the action. </span> <br />

<b>Furrett</b> ~ Although still feeling regret for dragging your nervous Sentret into such a spooky environment you feel pride at how he has overcome his fears to take on this Natu. You ponder over battle plans wondering whether to go on an all out offensive or to play it safe and defend before attacking. Deciding on the former hoping that using 3 strong attacks would finish off your opponent you give your orders to Potato who nods his furry head with more confidence than before. He leaps at Natu and hits it with a good <b>Scratch</b> attack knocking the tiny bird back. Natu with as much determination hopped forward digging its beak into Potato with a <b>Peck</b> Both Pokemon stared each other down waiting for the other to make a move. Potato took the initiative and leap forwad for another attack but Natu was prepared for this. Its eyes glowed a fierce red <b>Leer</b>ing the young Sentret into place before it hopped forward once more striking with another <b>Peck</b>. Potato was beginning to get tired and very sore from the multiple attacks he had taken. Breaking free from the Leer he swiped at Natu catching it with one more <b>Scratch</b>. Both Pokemon were looking rough with multiple red scratches covering Natu’s feathery form and several small puncture wounds on Potato. It wouldn’t be long before one of them fell in this battle. </span> <br />

Utterly disappointed to find it in ruins you walk slowly through looking under each stone and rock hoping to find something hidden underneath the rubble. You turn to Squirt and signal him to give Cacnea what it wants and as your Totodile lets loose a gentle spray the small cactus dances in delight lapping up the cooling water. Sitting down you observe the village with annoyance almost blaming it for not being what you expected and hoping that you had not been drug on a wild goose chase. Maybe they were just rumours with no truth behind them. You sigh dejectedly before your stomach interjects with a loud rumble making you chuckle. You would have a proper look around after some nourishment. You approach Squirt and Cacnea and offer them food that you had brought with you. Squirt happily accepted and wolfed down his share whilst Cacnea observed the foreign substance with intrigue before taking a bite too. As you go to eat your share you are startled by something shoving into you from behind making you drop your food on the ground. Turning around you can see nothing but sand behind you and the Pokemon next to you are looking at you gone out, wondering if you’ve lost the ability to hold objects. Glaring at them you go to pick up the morsel before it amazingly floats off into the village. All three of you look at one another before running off after it.<br />
<br />
As you move through the ruins you reach what appears to be the centre of the village marked by a large stone alter. You hear a soft cackling near the alter and cautiously approach it. You can see several Pokemon carved into the stone including a Xatu, Golem, Bronzong and Banette. The cackling sounds behind you and turning around you can see a form appear happily munching on your food. The Banette opens its zipper mouth and sticks its long tongue out at you. Well it certainly seems pleased with its acquisition, and you wonder if it is related to the ghost on the alter. <br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Artifical Dragon</b> ~ Well you certainly weren’t thinking of that Pokemon when you saw the lights, you mused as the Baltoy danced through the sand happy with how its games were going. Disappointment gripped at you as you realised that it wasn’t a water Pokemon you following after all, even though deep down you knew that the chances were minimal. Igneous was fuming at being mocked, shaking the sand off his head. How dare that little doll laugh at him and throw him in a sand tomb. Freeing himself of the pit he resided in he bounded towards the Baltoy ready to give it a taste of his strength. You sigh, sitting down on the hot sands grimacing at how even through your clothes it burnt before the feeling of a breeze hit you. Putting things into perspective you began to find a new appreciation of the desert for its calm and isolation, you felt very free out here.<br />
<br />
Brought out of your meditation by Igenous squeaking at you and pointing after the Baltoy who was fading out again, you stand up and walk after them. Dragging your feet through the sand you thought that the Baltoy would surely hit you with another trick soon so Igneous shouldn’t be so worried about losing it. Your mind wandered again to the rumoured mysterious villages in this desert and pondered asking Baltoy about it but thought better of it, you doubted it would be too forthcoming anyway. Catching up to your Cyndaquil you whispered a plan in his ears, eager to give the Baltoy a taste of its own medicine and show it that you were done playing. Igneous nodded and kept a watchful eye on his surroundings.<br />
<br />
You kept on walking and walking and were wondering if Baltoy was on to you and had fled to play with something else when you felt the ground beneath you shift. Looking down you see you’ve walked into quicksand and are sinking fast. You yell at Igneous to help you who had a confused expression on his face. Hearing a laugh come from his right he shot out a cloud of <b>Smokescreen</b> in that direction the laughter changing to a squeak from within the black smog. Looking down you see the sand is normal and you weren’t sinking at all, another of Baltoy’s mind games and are really peeved now. Igneous waited for the smoke to clear before running full force and hitting the now solid Baltoy with a <b>Tackle</b> throwing it back. Igneous leapt forward again to strike only to stop midair surrounded by a blue aura. He squeaked in shock and his eyes bugged out as he was thrown back into a dune now embedded in the sand. Baltoy’s <b>Confusion</b> sure was an interesting attack and as it realised the games were over it was ready to fight. </span><br />

<br />
<b>Fishyfool</b> ~ As you sink further into the quicksand you looked at the sand board before you, seeing your last hope written within. Volcape was clinging to your neck furiously nearly strangling you in his panic. The sand board returned to its clear state ready for you to re-write the answer, the correct answer this time. You wracked your brains for the answer having been so sure last time. Maybe you were over thinking it and it was something simpler. As the sand drug you further down leaving you submerged to your knees you cursed yourself for going against your skills and choosing to answer riddles. You feel a brainwave as you read the words for the 3rd time and run it through your mind over and over becoming a little surer with each try.<br />
<br />
Mind made up you return Volcape to his ball, at least he wasn’t going to suffocate in the thick sands if you were wrong. By now the sand were encompassing your hips, any further you’d really have trouble to get out. Running your finger through the soft sand you scrawled ‘Key’ and waited with baited breath to see what your fate would be. The word disappeared and a key symbol appeared after glowing a bright pink. Shielding your eyes you can just about see the sand board melt away into the quick sand, the wall beneath turning to sand too leaving a round arch to pass through. Okay … now you had to just get there. As if reading your mind a thick rope fell from the top of the arch into the sand. Reaching over to grab it you hear a cracking noise behind you. Turning around you can see the quicksand quickly hardening into the rock floor it used to be and yelp in surprise. Grabbing the rope you pull frantically to get to the arch before you’re entrapped and only just get your feet on hard ground before the sand turns once more to stone.<br />
<br />
Sighing in relief and leaning against the wall for support you look down the newly created passageway. It was your only way so on you went. It’s not long, fumbling through the dark, that you find another small room. You can’t help but be cautious considering what happened last time. Slowly walking to the centre you can see several rock pedestals with different colour circles carved on the side. Counting you can see that there are 16 pedestals in total and on a lower level before them are 17 multicoloured orbs. Inscribed above the orbs are these words:<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center"><i>“To truly know one’s strengths requires that one understands their weaknesses.<br />
Every element has a weakness as well as a strength<br />
Each pedestal is a weakness and each orb a strength and each compliment the other.<br />
One strength will remain and open the way to treasure”</i>&#8203;</div><br />
Looking on top of the pedestals are small circular holes, obviously designed to hold an orb. At the far end of the room is an arch blocked by a rock shield with a singular hole inside. It seems that you have come across another puzzle to solve.</span><br />
<br />
<i>I’ve just realised that this is a little difficult so PM for help if you need it. When replying write something like ‘Placing the Fire Orb on the Grass Pedestal’ so I know how you’ve worked it. Here’s a clue, there’s no ‘Normal’ pedestal. You should be left with one orb at the end which goes into the rock shield.</i><br />

<span style="color: lightsteelblue">The ranger looked at you with a steely expression waiting for you to give an explanation of what occurred, either that or ready to take you into custody for Pokemon Hunting. You stammer nervously, eyes flickering back and forth between the ranger and his behemoth of an Onix trying to get your story sounding good enough for him to believe you. You explain that you were going to free it, and the ranger rolled his eyes, an easy argument for a hunter to make obviously. Suddenly you get an idea and show the ranger the set of footprints the real hunter made leading away from the scene and hoped that he would believe you. He studied the footprints before casting his eyes back on you.<br />
<br />
“So you weren’t alone in this and are trying to pin this all on your associate; you hunters are all alike,” he says and Onix roars in disapproval making you shake in fear. You pray that it won’t, crush, eat or maim you and plead with the ranger to believe you. He sighs retrieving a set of handcuffs from his pack and you back up hands out in a harmless manner. As he approaches you the Swinub squeaks drawing his focus. It looks at Onix and talks to it sounded pained with every word. Onix seemed to contemplate what it said before talking to the ranger in its loud gravely voice. Ranger narrows his eyes before looking at you his gaze softening.<br />
<br />
“Well it seems this Swinub backs up your story, it says that the real hunter ran away when you defeated his Pokemon in battle. I’m sorry I doubted you but there was very little evidence to back your story,” he said sounding a little sheepish at the end. He walked round Onix and retrieved what looked like a jack from his bag. Walking over to Swinub who looked nervous at the new man back up a little jarring its already injured leg, the ranger soothed it before prying the trap open freeing the tiny ice pokemon. He picked it up and walked over to Onix. Looking over his shoulder he spoke.<br />
<br />
“I’m going to take Swinub back to my cabin to get it healed up; you can come along if you want. I’ll get you some hot food to make up for my accusations earlier.” He offered. You could take him up on his offer or continue along the mountain path. <br />
<br />

<b>Lemon~Lime</b> ~</span> No problem hon.<br />
<span style="color: lightsteelblue">Having accidentally spotted the mine’s entrance you excitedly beckon Scorpio in wanting to a get a closer look. Scorpio was having none of it though and he flew off your shoulder and hovered around the mine’s entrance not at all happy to venture in with you. You try to convince him that it would be worth your while, the mine could still be full of valuable ores, maybe some cool Pokemon rested within but alas Scorpio had made up his mind and shook his head emphatically. Grinning to yourself you decide on a little reverse psychology and ask Scorpio if he’d be so kind to keep an eye out for the menacing legends that roamed these mountains, especially the Abomasnow. Scorpio’s eyes widened at the sounds of the icy grass pokemon, he wouldn’t last one second against one of those. As you go into gory detail of all their strongest moves and the devastation he would face Scorpio moved like a bat out of hell zipping inside the cave and onto your head claws digging in as he shook with fear. You had gotten him inside but now you had a Gligar glued to your head. Prying him off and repositioning him in a more comfortable position you think over how awesome your acting skills are as you move into the mine.<br />
<br />
Scorpio maintained his position on your head shivering with fear every now and then as you move further into the dark mine. It was easy to see that no-one has ventured inside for a long time as the lamps lining the walls are long dead, the only light from the entrance becoming dimmer the further you ventured. Just as the light had all but faded away you see a sparkle on a nearby wall. Approaching it you grin, not believing your luck, there were 3 gems stuck in the wall all yours for the taking. As you reach out to grab one you hear an angry hiss and see a pair of razor sharp teeth go for your hand. Backing away quickly, the gems turn around and you’re faced with two more light blue ones looking angrily at you. The creature scales the walls and sits by the ceiling warily watching you. It seems this Sableye isn’t too amused that you tried to thieve one of its jewels. </span></span></div>

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Kasai managed to respond, choosing to follow the ranger. She nearly fainted from relief after their encounter. Phoebe, however, stayed still. She looked up at the onix with curiosity, eyes wide. Her little, green gills twitched in thought. She continued staring until Kasai picked her up and carried her along.<br />
<br />
Harumi wasn't looking to great, either. Her feathers were ruffled and she looked pretty worn out. She still felt warm, which wasn't really surprising. Kasai decided to carry her as well, but was struggling to see around her two companions. She found her blackglasses and managed to place them back in her bag. &quot;Do you think the swinub will be all right?&quot; Kasai felt she had to ask. She had grown attached to it in this short time and didn't want to leave it. <i>It's a good thing Harumi didn't have to attack,</i> she thought. <i>And what did that hunter want? If he wanted to keep it, he wouldn't have a trap set. I'll never look at poochyena the same way again. The ranger can talk to Pokémon, too. How did that happen?</i> <br />
</span><br />
<br />
Question: How did a twelve-year-old get mistaken for a hunter? Does Kasai seem older than she is? (I'm the same way.)</span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: lemonchiffon"><b>RaunchyFad</b> ~ Coughing, your bruised ribs protesting with every gasp you took you sat up and yelled at the fat feline that had just attacked you. Purugly didn’t seem at all fazed by your yelling and merely grinned wickedly at your predicament. Peering towards Rocky you growl out at her and she widens her eyes. Did you just call her dumb? She wasn’t dumb merely an expert comedienne. Shaking off the attack she turned to face you and Purugly who was silently willing her to attack. Stomping on the ground startling the Meowth cowering next to her she tried to get your attention. This was her chance to prove herself in battle, and if it had to be you well that would have to do. It took a moment for you to get what she was hinting at but your eyes widened as you realised that she wanted to battle the ugly kitty. Playing into your acting skills you fearfully slid away from the Purugly whilst giving Rocky her orders in code. Having understood the command Rocky covered herself in a red aura calming herself and preparing her <b>Bide</b>. Purugly wasn’t quite sure what she was up to but was sure that she was planning something. It released a freaky <b>Growl</b> that shook up Rocky but she maintained her calm praying that it would attack her otherwise her Bide wouldn’t work. Seeing that Rocky had not been moves by its Growl, Purugly charged forward and leapt at her hitting her with a meaty limb in a <b>Scratch</b> attack dealing some good damage. Rocky unleashed her attack charging at the fat cat and hitting it with a spiking red aura that pushed it back very slightly. The Bide had done some damage but hardly enough to worry the cat. Rocky barely had time to <b>Harden</b> as another meaty limb was launched at her, the second <b>Scratch</b> causing less damage this time but hurt all the same. Now getting pissed at all the scratches marring her body Rocky released a <b>Leech Seed</b> that planted itself on Purugly’s back and began to weave its tendrils into its fur. Purugly merely sighed and moved backwards readying another attack. It didn’t seem concerned at the threat Rocky posed. Meowth meanwhile had scurried over to you to see how you were doing and hiding on your lap away from the action.</span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: lemonchiffon"><span style="font-size: 9px">Having smacked the purugly around a tad without much of a reaction, Rocky finally began to feel intimidated as the hulking cat barely seemed to feel the damage done to it. Since she was a feisty little acorn, however, she didn’t let herself feel too bothered by it despite her now aching face. She shook off the pain and blood, braced herself, looked the purugly in the eyes and let out a high-pitched “SeeeeEEEE!” in hopes to intimidate the fat cat right back.<br />
<br />
Paul meanwhile was huddled against the wall with his eyes closed shut. He clutched the meowth on his lap while trying to scuttle away from the depths of the alley where a group of pissed off glameows resided, but as he scuttled closer to the entrance of the alleyway (as well as the battle) he got the unpleasant surprise of a face full of fur as he passed by the purugly’s immense girth. At this point in time he was sincerely afraid. “AH, NO, SHIT! ROCKY!” were the only words he could muster while he gagged up a mass of hair that easily shed off of the cat’s body.<br />
<br />
The seedot’s posture immediately went from a confident pose to a look of utter embarrassment as her master appeared to be eating the purugly’s cottony underbelly. She looked up at the feline as if to say “Oh, sorry, ‘scuse me for a sec”, waddled over to Paul and smacked him in the face. This seemed to have calmed him down slightly though he was still very red in the face.<br />
<br />
“Thanks little buddy,” Paul said, flustered, then picked her up and returned her to the enemy. “Ah, attack, um, fast! Keep <b>hardening</b>, keep, um… attacking?” Rocky shook her head and got ready to keep strong while performing a series of <b>quick attacks</b>.</span></span></div>

<br />
<b>Artifical Dragon</b> ~ Well you certainly weren’t thinking of that Pokemon when you saw the lights, you mused as the Baltoy danced through the sand happy with how its games were going. Disappointment gripped at you as you realised that it wasn’t a water Pokemon you following after all, even though deep down you knew that the chances were minimal. Igneous was fuming at being mocked, shaking the sand off his head. How dare that little doll laugh at him and throw him in a sand tomb. Freeing himself of the pit he resided in he bounded towards the Baltoy ready to give it a taste of his strength. You sigh, sitting down on the hot sands grimacing at how even through your clothes it burnt before the feeling of a breeze hit you. Putting things into perspective you began to find a new appreciation of the desert for its calm and isolation, you felt very free out here.<br />
<br />
Brought out of your meditation by Igenous squeaking at you and pointing after the Baltoy who was fading out again, you stand up and walk after them. Dragging your feet through the sand you thought that the Baltoy would surely hit you with another trick soon so Igneous shouldn’t be so worried about losing it. Your mind wandered again to the rumoured mysterious villages in this desert and pondered asking Baltoy about it but thought better of it, you doubted it would be too forthcoming anyway. Catching up to your Cyndaquil you whispered a plan in his ears, eager to give the Baltoy a taste of its own medicine and show it that you were done playing. Igneous nodded and kept a watchful eye on his surroundings.<br />
<br />
You kept on walking and walking and were wondering if Baltoy was on to you and had fled to play with something else when you felt the ground beneath you shift. Looking down you see you’ve walked into quicksand and are sinking fast. You yell at Igneous to help you who had a confused expression on his face. Hearing a laugh come from his right he shot out a cloud of <b>Smokescreen</b> in that direction the laughter changing to a squeak from within the black smog. Looking down you see the sand is normal and you weren’t sinking at all, another of Baltoy’s mind games and are really peeved now. Igneous waited for the smoke to clear before running full force and hitting the now solid Baltoy with a <b>Tackle</b> throwing it back. Igneous leapt forward again to strike only to stop midair surrounded by a blue aura. He squeaked in shock and his eyes bugged out as he was thrown back into a dune now embedded in the sand. Baltoy’s <b>Confusion</b> sure was an interesting attack and as it realised the games were over it was ready to fight.</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">&quot;Hm, didn't expect <i>that</i>,&quot; she thought as she watched her Cyndaquil go flying through the air and gracefully land face first into a sand dune. Alina went over to help her Cyndaquil out of the sand dune, keeping a wary eye on the Baltoy. At least it wasn't laughing anymore. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Alina asked Igneous, slightly worried. Igneous was in a slight daze, surprised by the Baltoy's Confusion. His dazed face soon turned into an even angrier one. How dare the Baltoy even try to fight back? Alina put her Cyndaquil down on the ground again and rubbed the top of his head. &quot;Hey, good job, you hit that Baltoy pretty hard. He's not laughing now is he?&quot;<br />
<br />
Igneous tilt his head up high, rather proud of himself. Alina smiled and added, &quot;Don't be too happy, it's not over yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
She wished she had a few more moves to work with. A Quick Attack would come in handy, the Baltoy wouldn't even know what hit it. Some type of fire move would have been rather nice as well... but she had only seen Igneous puff smoke from his mouth, not a single ember. Baltoy was going to be an interesting opponent, but Alina felt that her Cyndaquil would put up a good fight and win this battle, despite his lack of experience in battle. &quot;Okay, here's what I want you to do,&quot; Alina said as she stood up. &quot;Start with a <b>Leer</b>, that should lower it's defenses a bit... then use a <b>Tackle</b> and another <b>Smokescreen</b>. Please be careful, try not to get yourself thrown like that again...&quot;<br />
<br />
She doubted the Cyndaquil could avoid a Confusion attack, seeing as he was stopped dead in his tracks and thrown away like that, but hell, saying &quot;be careful&quot; made her feel slightly more comfortable. She didn't want her Cyndaquil to get beaten up too badly... At least the ground here was covered in sand, that would cushion his fall if he was thrown through the air again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quil!&quot; Igneous responded to show that he understood his orders and ran off toward the Baltoy once more.</span></span></div>

<b>Pyschopath</b> ~</span> You can use two Pokemon only they would be less likely to receive any levels from the battle.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: limegreen"> With both Pokemon so close to one another you take the opportunity to scan the angry squirrel hoping to gain an insight that would help you in battle. You realise why Pachirisu was so mad at you trying to take its food and why it was fiercely defending it. You begin to get very hopeful that this squirrel could lead you to more food if you defeat it, that is if you could rouse it afterwards. Freeze merely nodded not worrying about food currently more concerned with the irate squirrel sparking its cheeks at him. You feel confident that you’ll win this battle and Pachirisu seems offended by your words as if understanding what you said. Freeze jumped back and forth trying to keep Pachirisu off balance and keep it guessing. Pachirisu looked bored by Freeze’s dancing and crossed its arms and as Freeze <b>Leer</b>ed, it wasn’t even looking at him. Freeze growled angrily and pulled back his fist charging it with ice energy. Pachirisu noticing the shift of temperature in the air hunched over and glowed a faint red. Freeze launched his <b>Ice Punch</b> smacking Pachirisu right in its little body pushing it back but it remained standing looking pained. Freeze pulled his other arm back before swiping the squirrel across its abdomen with a harsh <b>Scratch</b> leaving small bleeding trails across its white fur; but still it remained standing panting in pain. Pachirisu suddenly grinned and gave you a hateful look before running right for Freeze the red aura surrounding it spiking with power as it slammed into Freeze and with amazing force throwing him right up into the air, the white Sneasel landing with a crash several metres away looking very hurt. That <b>Bide</b> had absorbed a lot of power and given back double leaving Freeze downed. This battle had suddenly swung in Pachirisu’s favour. </span></span>

&quot;I don't want to see you get your butt wooped by that squirrel, or any other for that matter!&quot;Tyson said angry at what that squirrel had done to his first pokemon.</span></span></div>

<b>Furrett</b> ~ Although still feeling regret for dragging your nervous Sentret into such a spooky environment you feel pride at how he has overcome his fears to take on this Natu. You ponder over battle plans wondering whether to go on an all out offensive or to play it safe and defend before attacking. Deciding on the former hoping that using 3 strong attacks would finish off your opponent you give your orders to Potato who nods his furry head with more confidence than before. He leaps at Natu and hits it with a good <b>Scratch</b> attack knocking the tiny bird back. Natu with as much determination hopped forward digging its beak into Potato with a <b>Peck</b> Both Pokemon stared each other down waiting for the other to make a move. Potato took the initiative and leap forwad for another attack but Natu was prepared for this. Its eyes glowed a fierce red <b>Leer</b>ing the young Sentret into place before it hopped forward once more striking with another <b>Peck</b>. Potato was beginning to get tired and very sore from the multiple attacks he had taken. Breaking free from the Leer he swiped at Natu catching it with one more <b>Scratch</b>. Both Pokemon were looking rough with multiple red scratches covering Natu’s feathery form and several small puncture wounds on Potato. It wouldn’t be long before one of them fell in this battle.<br />
</span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: silver">Potato wasn’t really sure what to think. First he felt a tugging at his heartstrings for poor Omega, who would much rather be exploring a sunny town or Jungle than in a graveyard. But then of neither the Natu or the Sentret was going to be able to battle much longer, so he felt happiness for the first battle being so near to completion. And then the pride for his goofy little squirrel friend who had come so far in this battle without giving up. Potato made a quiet resoloution to give Omega twice as much food at the next meal and let him sleep as long as he wanted after this battle.<br />
<br />
Potato guilty realized that he probably shouldn’t be thinking about himself, but rather the battle. He quickly decided he would do what he had done before; three scratches. Anything else ran the risk of Sentret being hit by an unnecessary attack. <br />
<br />
“Omega!” yelled Potato, hoping to stir some excitement. “Same as before. Three <b>scratches</b>; boom, boom, boom. I know you’re tired. So let’s finish this!”</span></span></div>

<b>allsystemsaredown</b> ~</span> You may if you don’t get released from here first. If you do RP it logically into your reply by leaving Mediville first. <br />
<br />
<span style="color: lemonchiffon">With an expectant Harmony waiting for your answer you tell her exactly how your Pokemon and Pidgey came to be as injured as they were. She listened intently as you told her of finding the young boy zapping Pidgey with his Electrike before taking them on in battle with Torchlight. You tell her of your first victory, a very important one you feel and how the boy ran off to leave the defenceless injured bird alone. Not wanting to leave it in such a state you brought it with you wanting to get it healed. Harmony gasped and approached you looking you right in the eye before smiling.<br />
<br />
“What a wonderful thing you’ve done, helping an innocent wild Pokemon like that. The world needs more kind and caring people like you,” she said moved by your story. Suddenly the machine beeped and the board Pidgey was lying on moved forward. The tiny bird opened its eyes slowly taking in its new surroundings worriedly before spotting you. It got to its feet and stretched its wings marvelling at how good it felt. It chirped at you happily realising that you had healed it.<br />
<br />
“Well Pidgey seems full of energy now; let’s get your Cyndaquil healed up.” Harmony said taking your fiery echidna and placing him on the machine. You watched as it whirred to life and began its healing process all over again. Pidgey meanwhile was observing you with a keen eye, thoughts unknown to you whizzing through its mind. <br />
<br />
After another 10 minutes of waiting the machine beeped again and the board slid forward and Torchlight sat up giving you a beaming smile. You pick up your Cyndaquil and thank Harmony for healing him. <br />
<br />
“You take care now, I’ll make sure Pidgey get back home alright,” she says waving you off. As you leave the Pharmacy you hear a series of loud chirps before Pidgey flies out of the doors landing at you feet. Harmony followed shortly after and smiled<br />
<br />
“It seems that Pidgey wants to come with you, you must have made a good impression,” Pidgey gave you a hopeful look waiting to see what you would do.<br />

<b>Music Box ~</b> ~ Upon reaching the mysterious village that you had been searching for you can’t help but stare in disbelief at what remains. Utterly disappointed to find it in ruins you walk slowly through looking under each stone and rock hoping to find something hidden underneath the rubble. You turn to Squirt and signal him to give Cacnea what it wants and as your Totodile lets loose a gentle spray the small cactus dances in delight lapping up the cooling water. Sitting down you observe the village with annoyance almost blaming it for not being what you expected and hoping that you had not been drug on a wild goose chase. Maybe they were just rumours with no truth behind them. You sigh dejectedly before your stomach interjects with a loud rumble making you chuckle. You would have a proper look around after some nourishment. You approach Squirt and Cacnea and offer them food that you had brought with you. Squirt happily accepted and wolfed down his share whilst Cacnea observed the foreign substance with intrigue before taking a bite too. As you go to eat your share you are startled by something shoving into you from behind making you drop your food on the ground. Turning around you can see nothing but sand behind you and the Pokemon next to you are looking at you gone out, wondering if you’ve lost the ability to hold objects. Glaring at them you go to pick up the morsel before it amazingly floats off into the village. All three of you look at one another before running off after it.<br />
<br />
As you move through the ruins you reach what appears to be the centre of the village marked by a large stone alter. You hear a soft cackling near the alter and cautiously approach it. You can see several Pokemon carved into the stone including a Xatu, Golem, Bronzong and Banette. The cackling sounds behind you and turning around you can see a form appear happily munching on your food. The Banette opens its zipper mouth and sticks its long tongue out at you. Well it certainly seems pleased with its acquisition, and you wonder if it is related to the ghost on the alter.</span></span>

<span style="color: darkorange">After this major disappointment with the so called village, Tim was already in a slightly upset mood. So when the ghost type pokemon knocked down Tim's food, he was passed his boiling point. The three chased Bannette into the village, all Tim could think about was revenge for his poor lunch, eventually Tim and the two pokemon were able catch up to Bannette and Tim began to yell at the ghost pokemon. &quot;HEY!&quot;, yelled Tim in anger to the Bannette. He began to breath heavily and sweat trickled down the side of his face from the arid climate. Tim clenched his fists has he thought about what he should do. All of a sudden a smirk came across his face, &quot;Hey Bannette, how about a battle. I could use one to blow some steam right about now. So what do you say?&quot; Tim was confidant that he could take on Bannette with Totodile, and hey maybe some good can come from this battle.</span></span></div>

<b>Lemon~Lime</b> ~[/color] No problem hon.<br />
<span style="color: lightsteelblue">Having accidentally spotted the mine’s entrance you excitedly beckon Scorpio in wanting to a get a closer look. Scorpio was having none of it though and he flew off your shoulder and hovered around the mine’s entrance not at all happy to venture in with you. You try to convince him that it would be worth your while, the mine could still be full of valuable ores, maybe some cool Pokemon rested within but alas Scorpio had made up his mind and shook his head emphatically. Grinning to yourself you decide on a little reverse psychology and ask Scorpio if he’d be so kind to keep an eye out for the menacing legends that roamed these mountains, especially the Abomasnow. Scorpio’s eyes widened at the sounds of the icy grass pokemon, he wouldn’t last one second against one of those. As you go into gory detail of all their strongest moves and the devastation he would face Scorpio moved like a bat out of hell zipping inside the cave and onto your head claws digging in as he shook with fear. You had gotten him inside but now you had a Gligar glued to your head. Prying him off and repositioning him in a more comfortable position you think over how awesome your acting skills are as you move into the mine.<br />
<br />
Scorpio maintained his position on your head shivering with fear every now and then as you move further into the dark mine. It was easy to see that no-one has ventured inside for a long time as the lamps lining the walls are long dead, the only light from the entrance becoming dimmer the further you ventured. Just as the light had all but faded away you see a sparkle on a nearby wall. Approaching it you grin, not believing your luck, there were 3 gems stuck in the wall all yours for the taking. As you reach out to grab one you hear an angry hiss and see a pair of razor sharp teeth go for your hand. Backing away quickly, the gems turn around and you’re faced with two more light blue ones looking angrily at you. The creature scales the walls and sits by the ceiling warily watching you. It seems this Sableye isn’t too amused that you tried to thieve one of its jewels. </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: lightsteelblue"><span style="font-size: 9px">Mike warily walked down the passageway. As he ventured further and further down the mine, the light diminished until he could barely see two feet in front of him. &quot;Maybe this wasn't such a good idea after all...&quot; he murmured as he listened for any approaching danger. Suddenly, he spotted three glimmering gems in the wall beside him. &quot;Yes!&quot; he said to himself. &quot;Jackpot!&quot; As he reached out to try and pry one off, his hand was met with a pair of sharp teeth. Luckily, he managed to retract his hand in time. Upon hearing the sharp snapping noise, Scorpio nearly fainted from fear, somehow managing to keep his bearings, afraid that whatever made the noise would hear him and eat him in the blink of an eye. The Sableye, as it turned out to be, turned around and gave him an evil eye. It then crawled up the wall and took a place by the ceiling, looking quite annoyed. ‘Hmmm...” thought Mike. “Maybe this Sableye will know where some <i>real</i> gems or ores are.” He looked up at it and said with a reverent tone of voice “My greatest apologies. In this dim light, your pristine gems looked like they were stuck in that wall, and not part of you. We wish you no harm. Would you know if there are any gems or ores in this cave? If so, could you guide us to them?”. He then whispered an order to Scorpio in a hushed voice to make sure the Sableye didn’t hear. “If it attacks us, <b> three Poison Stings</b>, pronto.”</span></span></div>

<b>empoleon dynamite</b> ~ As you doggedly pursued Teddiursa your mind began to wander and it was a wonder how you managed not to run into a tree. You saw yourself at one end of a very impressive arena, the Elite 4 member Drake stood at the other. His Flygon was released and you released your own Pokemon, your Teddiursa. They began a fierce battle and you were suddenly brought back into focus by your irked Shroomish who was trying to look mad whilst holding back a grin at the leaves now stuck in your hair. He ushered you towards him and you sheepishly followed. You’re quite thankful that Fungi was at least able to keep up with the quick footed Teddy. As you enter the clearing you gasp in awe at the wonderful sight, a large Pecha Berry tree sat in its centre, its leaves tousled gently in the breeze. Teddiursa smiled at you as it ate a berry some of the juice running down its chin. Sending out Brawly, the Totodile stumbled a little on exit from his ball and held his stomach in pain. You pluck a ripe pink berry from the nearest branch and hold it out to Brawly urging him to eat it. Knowing that it would cure his poison Brawly took it a swallowed it whole taking a few bites before hand to get used to the sweet taste. He gave you a faint smile instantly feeling better though still thoroughly worn. You match his smile and return him to his Pokeball to rest some more. <br />
<br />
Turning to the sitting Teddiursa you heartily thank it for its help and it smiles at you, seemingly happy to have repaid the favour. Holding an empty Pokeball to your chest you notice Teddiursa switch its gaze to the sphere. You tentatively approach it and make it an offer. A battle with Fungi and Teddy realised that if it lost it would be captured. It looked away for a moment taking in the forest, its sights sounds and smells before facing you. It stood up and winced from its previous injuries. Nodding its head it moved to face your Shroomish. Not waiting for you to give a command it got its game face on and bull rushed Fungi swiping its claws across his face in a harsh <b>Scratch</b> attack. Though Teddiursa was clearly already injured it still had some fight left in it and it knew that it would have to fight hard to win.</span></span>

</div>
</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: limegreen"> Sooner had Teddiursa accepted the offer, he swiped Fungi, tumbling the Mushroom backwards. Fungi showed a face of protest: attacking him before he was ready felt unfair. Wes sighed; he knew he’d have problems battling a tough Teddiursa with his weak Shroomish. “This is no time to complain, you’re in a Pokémon battle”, Wes replied to Fungi. Wes was unsure what to do next <i>'Shroomish are pretty slow so I might need to play the defence. But how can I hurt Teddiursa whilst still keeping Shroomish in shape?'</i> Wes' face lit up as he deviced a strategy,“Wait for him to come close for another attack and use Absorb!” Wes grinned: The closer the Teddiursa came, the more damage absorb would do. Fungi nodded and braced itself for another attack.<br />

<br />
<b>Fishyfool</b> ~ As you sink further into the quicksand you looked at the sand board before you, seeing your last hope written within. Volcape was clinging to your neck furiously nearly strangling you in his panic. The sand board returned to its clear state ready for you to re-write the answer, the correct answer this time. You wracked your brains for the answer having been so sure last time. Maybe you were over thinking it and it was something simpler. As the sand drug you further down leaving you submerged to your knees you cursed yourself for going against your skills and choosing to answer riddles. You feel a brainwave as you read the words for the 3rd time and run it through your mind over and over becoming a little surer with each try.<br />
<br />
Mind made up you return Volcape to his ball, at least he wasn’t going to suffocate in the thick sands if you were wrong. By now the sand were encompassing your hips, any further you’d really have trouble to get out. Running your finger through the soft sand you scrawled ‘Key’ and waited with baited breath to see what your fate would be. The word disappeared and a key symbol appeared after glowing a bright pink. Shielding your eyes you can just about see the sand board melt away into the quick sand, the wall beneath turning to sand too leaving a round arch to pass through. Okay … now you had to just get there. As if reading your mind a thick rope fell from the top of the arch into the sand. Reaching over to grab it you hear a cracking noise behind you. Turning around you can see the quicksand quickly hardening into the rock floor it used to be and yelp in surprise. Grabbing the rope you pull frantically to get to the arch before you’re entrapped and only just get your feet on hard ground before the sand turns once more to stone.<br />
<br />
Sighing in relief and leaning against the wall for support you look down the newly created passageway. It was your only way so on you went. It’s not long, fumbling through the dark, that you find another small room. You can’t help but be cautious considering what happened last time. Slowly walking to the centre you can see several rock pedestals with different colour circles carved on the side. Counting you can see that there are 16 pedestals in total and on a lower level before them are 17 multicoloured orbs. Inscribed above the orbs are these words:<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center"><i>“To truly know one’s strengths requires that one understands their weaknesses.<br />
Every element has a weakness as well as a strength<br />
Each pedestal is a weakness and each orb a strength and each compliment the other.<br />
One strength will remain and open the way to treasure”</i>&#8203;</div><br />
Looking on top of the pedestals are small circular holes, obviously designed to hold an orb. At the far end of the room is an arch blocked by a rock shield with a singular hole inside. It seems that you have come across another puzzle to solve.</span><br />
<br />
<i>I’ve just realised that this is a little difficult so PM for help if you need it. When replying write something like ‘Placing the Fire Orb on the Grass Pedestal’ so I know how you’ve worked it. Here’s a clue, there’s no ‘Normal’ pedestal. You should be left with one orb at the end which goes into the rock shield.</i><br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: gold">As he scribed the answer in, Jamie's heart pounded out his chest as he saw the board shine a bright pink as the answer was correct, and gave a sigh of relief as he stopped sinking into the sand, and an archway appeared, likely leading further into the tomb. &quot;Thank god...now how the hell do I get out?&quot; he said to himself, and as though listening, a rope unfurled from the top of the arch to haul himself out of. As he grabbed it, a crack was heard and he hoped he hadn't broken anything, and as Jamie turned, he gave a coy shirk as the sand behind him started to return to rock, which as he remembered wasn't as easy to escape from as sand. Pulling with his might, Jamie escaped before he was stuck in a rock tomb instead of a sand tomb.<br />
<br />
Resting against the archway, trying not to enter anaphalyptic shock from the sudden energy exertion, Jamie eventually made his way through the arch, remembering to take Volcape out when he reached the end of the path and let him know both are alive. As he walked carefully...<br />
<br />
<b>THUMP!!</b><br />
<br />
&quot;Aargh, ya bastard...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie had naturally walked into a strange pillar in another room, and the jolt had knocked off Volcape's ball, releasing the fire monkey who was still frantically trying to stay above the nonexistant quicksand by the use of Fishy's leg before noticing that they were safe as the chimp gave a sigh of relief before pulling on Jamie's leg. Jamie looked around firstly at the room counting the pillars, including the one he ran into, and noted that there were sixteen of them, each one with a slightly strange air around them. Rubbing his head, he noted that all had holes in them before he gave the room itself, the floor in particular and roof a close examination, and noted nothing potentially fatal. Volcape gestured to a plaque before scampering up Jamie's back to the shoulder perch he used religiously as Jamie read it.<br />
<br />
He gave another sigh, this one filled more with contempt than dread, and gave a thought about it. Asking Volcape to feel around every pillar for anything that could help, Jamie thought about things and decided to try out the seventeen orbs on a lower level, as well as the other archway with the shield in it.<br />
<br />
Deciding to start with the orbs, Volcape ran and once again led to a heavy thump as Jamie's face had quality one-on-one time with the chamber floor, and with a torrent of curses he rose before listening to the Chimchar, interpretating the words spoken. Each pedestal seemed to consist of the seventeen main types, save Normal. Noting this, Jamie opted for the Fire pillar first. With the train of thought that the pedestals are defending types and orbs are attacking, he noted that Fire pokemon were weak to several moves, which were Water, also effective against Fire's other weaknesses, Ground and Rock. Ground was also effective on Electric, Poison, Rock and Steel, but notably Electric was useless against Ground. Rock was also effective against Ice, Flying and Bug pokemon.<br />
<br />
Taking this into account, Jamie decided to place the <i>Water orb on the Fire Pedestal</i>, seeing as it was a likely candidate. The Water Pillar itself had two weaknesses, Electric and Grass. Electric was a good move against flyers, and Grass moves were good against Ground and Rock types as well, but Jamie placed the <i>Electric orb on the Water Pedestal</i>, before moving to Electric's one, which was a no-brainer as he placed the single weakness that Electric had, the <i>Ground Orb, onto the Electric Pedestal</i>. The Grass Pedestal would be problematic, with it having no fewer than five weaknesses, them being Fire, Ice, Poison, Flying and Bug. However, Poison was only very effective on Grass, so Jamie placed the <i>Poison Orb on the Grass Pedestal</i>, before recounting the used orbs, which were water, electric, ground and poison.<br />
<br />
The Ice Pedestal was next, as Jamie recollected on the weaknesses there: Fire, Fighting, Rock and Steel, of all things. With Fire, Fighting and Rock having several other options left, Steel seemed the only other choice, it also being effective on Rock, which had weaknesses anyways, Jamie placed the <i>Steel orb on the Ice Pedestal</i> and moved onto the next in the typing hierarchy: Fighting, weak against Flying and Psychic. Flying moves also hit Bugs, while Psychics could take care of Poison, which was also weak against the used Ground, judicating the orb for Fighting as Jamie placed the <i>Flying Orb on the Fighting Pedestal</i>, and then put the <i>Psychic Orb on the Poison Pedestal</i>, moving to Ground, weak against the used Water and the unused Grass and Ice. Ice was effective against more, and Grass was only effective on Rocks aside, so Jamie placed the <i>Grass Orb on the Ground Pedestal</i> before recounting what he had left. He had used the water, electric, ground, poison, steel, psychic, flying and grass orbs, leaving the remaining nine, which were Normal, fire, ice, fighting, bug, rock, ghost, dragon and dark orbs.<br />
<br />
The next pedestal was the Flying one, which was weak to Ice and Rock. Ice was also the only type capable of defeating Dragons, aside from Dragon itself, while Rock was legible for defeating Bugs as well, so with this in mind, Jamie placed the <i>Rock orb on the Flying Pedestal</i>, moving to the Psychic Pedestal, and had a five-second train of thought before derailing it and putting the <i>Ghost Orb on the Psychic Pedestal</i>, seeing as Darks could take out Ghosts, but left that pillar for later as he moved to the Bug Pedestal, weak against Fire, Flying and Rock, two of which were being used as he put the <i>Fire Orb on the Bug Pedestal</i>, and moved to the Rock Pedestal, giving a sigh at the five weaknesses Rock also boasted.<br />
<br />
Furrowing his brow, he noted that of what was left, only Fighting was effective against Rock, and against his mind discovered that Steel's Pillar would have nothing on it. Swearing under his breath, he decided to think that perhaps he should play the next pillar, which was Ghost, placing the <i>Dark Orb on the Ghodt Pedestal</i>, and the <i>Ice Orb on the Dragon Pedestal</i>, before stumbling. He had only Normal, Fighting, Bug and Dragon left, with the <i>Bug Orb being put onto the dark Pedestal</i>, and the Rock and Steel Pedestals left. Sighing, he put the <i>Fighting Orb on the Steel Pedestal</i>, and ran his train of thought. Neither Normal or Dragon was effective against Rock, but Dragons were at least neutral, and so feeling this woud be regrettable, Jamie placed the <i>Dragon Orb on the Rock pedestal</i>, leaving the <i>Normal Orb for the Archway</i> and hoping that he had it right, or at least that the wrong orbs would simply career out and into him at several dozen metres per second as Volcape stood idle.</span></span></div>

<b>empoleon dynamite</b> ~ </span>Do remember that you can order more than one attack which will speed up the battle.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: limegreen">Although you were glad that Teddiursa had accepted your challenge for a battle, your Shroomish was far from feeling the same emotion as his face was sliced into. He tumbled backwards and the look of shock was replaced by anger at the premature hit. He looked up to you hoping you’d back him up but being realistic and far sterner than he’d like you reminded Fungi that he was in a battle and really he should expect assaults like that. Thinking over Fungi’s weakness’ you sought a way to overcome them; he was for instance quite a slow mover and maybe playing the defence game would be best. It doesn’t take you long to come up with a plan of action and Fungi now with his orders the two of you waited. Teddiursa waited too wondering what you were planning; it had seen you battle that fierce Beedrill and knew that you trained your Pokemon well. Although Fungi had taken the hit from its Scratch unknowingly didn’t bring down the bear’s guard, it knew not to underestimate its opponent. As both Pokemon stared each other down Teddy’s eyes glowed a deep red startling Fungi who didn’t know what to do anymore, unnerved by the <b>Leer</b>. Teddiursa ran forward and <b>Scratched</b> Fungi again making it begin to really hurt. Now with two sets of claw marks across its face Fungi angrily <b>Absorb</b>ed some health and energy back from the Teddy who winced in response. Both began their stare down again waiting for the other to make the next move.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Pyschopath</b> ~ Clearly impressed by Pachirisu’s determination and hardiness you glance down to Freeze who was slowly picking himself off the ground. He was feeling very sore from the powerful Bide attack but fuelled to win his battle, he wasn’t going to disappoint you. Quickly thinking over a strategy you come up with a plan which could be quite risky but if it worked would bring the fight back round to your favour. With some encouraging words you urge Freeze to continue on fighting, your show white Sneasel happy to oblige. With a surge of hidden energy Freeze pushes to his feet and launches himself at the Squirrel catching it with a sneaky <b>Scratch</b> leaving more welts across its already scarred abdomen. Pachirisu squeaked angrily and <b>Growled</b> loudly startling Freeze as he was powering up his Ice Punch. With its opponent’s hesitation Pachirisu ran at Freeze with great speed smacking him with its <b>Quick Attack</b> Freeze fell back holding his stomach, these repeated attacks were really taking their toll on him. Pachirisu grinned before speeding up again and heading round for another shot. Freeze stood tall and readied himself eager to use his ‘secret move’. Calming his nerves and focusing on the speedy squirrel he noticed that he could see it moving better than before. Just as Pachirisu leapt to attack Freeze dove to the side and grabbed its tail. Pachirishu squeaked in shock as Freeze rolled its arms over its head and launched the squirrel across the forest and into a large thick tree in an impressive <b>Counter</b>. Pachirisu lay at the foot of the tree looking truly beaten, bruises marring its flesh and fur. It struggled to get to up and on wobbly feet, hardly able to hold itself upright locked eyes with you, still determined, almost daring you to finish it off. </span><br />

<b>allsystemsaredown</b> ~ As you looked down at the hopeful Pidgey you took a moment to think over your decision. It was clear that the tiny bird had been impressed enough by your kindness and warm soul to want to travel alongside you but the question was did you want Pidgey as a team-mate? Torchlight looked up to you wondering what you were going to do and if he was going to have a new friend by his side. Having made your decision you pulled a Level Ball from your bag adding that you could always purchase more Pokeballs at a later date. As you held the enlarged capture device before you, Pidgey’s eyes a little fearful of the device but soothed by Torchlight’s happy expression you thought back to the battle you had with the young boy. Maybe you had been fighting over the Pidgey after all, but since the little bird wanted to be with you and not him the battle was won before it started. Throwing the ball at the bird it hit its side with a soft thud before drawing the Pokemon inside. It hardly wiggled before a solid ‘ding’ resounded letting you know what you had successfully captured your first Pokemon. Congratulations, you have captured a <b>Level 04, Female Pidgey</b>. Harmony smiled at you waved as you left.<br />
<br />
“Take care all of you, have fun in the rest of your adventures”<br />
<br />
<i>With Pidgey’s capture you’ve unlocked your rights to the Egg House and are hereby released from the Arcane Realm. Upon replying to this update you’re free to post in the mainstream zones (I know they’re currently un-manned but something is being worked out so fear not).

<b>RaunchyFad</b> ~ Rocky was not impressed that her attacks were having such little effect on the gargantuan beast she faced. Shaking off the pain she tried another tactic and let loose a high pitched yell eyes locked onto the Purugly’s throughout wanting to share the intimidation. Meanwhile you were holding onto the frightened Meowth trying to catch your breath. Hoping that you could scurry away from the battle you inched your way along the wall holding on tightly to Meowth all the time. As you neared Purugly however you seemed to get stuck by its immense girth and choke on a large amount of fur. Rocky cast you an utterly shocked look her face turning pale with embarrassment before she growled to herself for being stuck with such a useless trainer. Rolling her eyes she gave Purugly a quick look asking it to remain right there for a moment, Purugly grinning to itself and moving as to push harder on your body and really squish you. Waddling over to you she kicked you hard in the face pushing you away from the cat’s bulky mass and you thank her for the assist. Placing her back in front of the amused kitty you gave her some vague orders. Although your actions were embarrassing for all involved it provided a distraction for Purugly and it had halted its previous movement of an attack. Rocky ran forward and with amazing speed manage to smack right into Purugly with a sharp <b>Quick Attack</b> that changed the cat’s tune making it frown in annoyance. It moved forward slowly before it too disappeared landing right on Rocky in a <b>Quick Attack</b> of its own showing its uniqueness and strength. Rocky groaned from under the bulk of Purugly and <b>Harden</b>ed to lessen the pain. Purugly didn’t seem inclined to move from its position and Rocky using all her strength rolled out moving into a blur and <b>Quick Attack</b>ing the fat cat again making it wince this time. The collateral damage was beginning to build up and even a strong Pokemon like Purugly couldn’t help but feel it. Grinning it stared hard at Rocky who stared back equally in defiance. Meowth screeched at her to look away obviously knowing what was coming and wriggled out of your grasp the try and get her attention. Unfortunately Rocky didn’t want to back down but she began to feel very tired all of a sudden before falling asleep at the feet of the fat beast. Purugly laughed to itself proud of how its <b>Hypnosis</b> went. </span> <br />

<br />
<b>Furrett</b> ~ Running through the varying emotions filling your soul you observe as each Pokemon takes their last stand hoping to take down the other. You feel immensely proud of how Omega had fared overcoming his fear to take on this challenge and never backing down; you make a resolution to reward Omega for all his hard work after this battle. Tearing your thoughts away from yourself you concentrate on the last leg of the battle and decide upon a final charge, an all out assault in the hopes Omega’s strength would pull through. Yelling your orders to Omega you will him on to victory, your Sentret empowered by your confidence in him. Omega turned back to battle and charged at Natu who leapt at Omega both unleashing their attacks at the same time leaving more welts on each other’s bodies. Natu leapt back and <b>Leer</b>ed at Omega hoping to get the upper edge before it finished him off but Omega surprised you both. Fueled by a need to prove himself Omega leapt straight through the un-nerving glare and slashed at the tiny bird two more times making it topple back and flop to the ground unconscious. <b>Level Up for Omega</b>. Omega tiredly turns back to you a proud smile on his furry little face at his victory. You grin back and yell in joy at your first ever victory together. Just as you finish off celebrating Omega looks over your shoulder suddenly a ghastly white as he hides behind you. Turning around you see what has him so spooked and are shocked to see a faint image of an old woman hovering over a small gravestone smiling at you.<br />
<br />
“That was a wonderful battle you man, I haven’t had the chance to see a battle like that in a long time,” she echoed in an eerie voice. Well you did come to the Graveyard to find ghosts, it appears you’ve found your first. </span> <br />

<span style="color: darkorange">You stare aghast at the ghost that floated away with your food happily muching away at it as it went. Okay first the village turned out to be a bust and now this. Running after the cheeky Banette Squirt and Cacnea in tow you finally catch up to it to find it finishing off your meal. You yell out at it and it turned to face you a grin on its zipper mouth as it took in your haggard appearance. You wonder how you could get even with the naughty Pokemon before you smirk as you come up with an idea. You offer it up a battle eager to blow off some steam and Banette resists the urge to laugh not at all threatened by your challenge. It floated around the statue that houses a version of itself and seemed to think over your proposal whilst playing with its hands. It seemed to grow serious for a moment, but only a moment before it floated out and stopping right in front of you face making you lean back uncomfortably. It tilted its head studying you and you feel like its eyes are boring into your soul before it floats away and nods its head sticking out its tongue and putting its hands on its arms. It seemed quite full of confidence that it would win. Raising its arms above its head the village around suddenly came to life and the buildings returned to their former glory, people milling around before it all melted back to the ruins that remained today. Banette grinned at you, it seems like it’s offered you a reward if you win this battle. <br />

<b>Artifical Dragon</b> ~ Upon seeing Igneous extracting himself from a nearby sand dune you ascertain his condition your fiery echidna wobbling about a little dizzy from the toss. After clearing his senses Igneous turned in your grip with a furious expression on his face. You smile and congratulate him on a good start to the battle even if Igneous felt otherwise. Placing him back on the sand you observe the Baltoy who spun on the spot keeping its eye on Igneous the whole time, awaiting his next move. You curse Igneous’s limited move set at present and wished that he currently knew Quick Attack or a fiery type attack. Oh well you would have to both do the best with what you had. You knew that your Cyndaquil would put up a hell of a fight regardless of how little experience he had. With a fresh set of orders and a warning to be careful Igneous ran over to face Baltoy staring it down both ready for the other to move. Both acted at the same time and as Igneous <b>Leer[/]ed at Baltoy it <b>Harden</b>ed its smooth skin. Baltoy was distracted by the Leer but was thicker skinned and Igneous huffed in annoyance before running full speed at the spinning toy and whacking it good and proper with a hard <b>Tackle</b> that pushed it back into the sand. Baltoy moved to attack when Igneous let loose a cloud of black smoke that covered the opposing Pokemon making it hesitate. You grin at how well Igenous had performed before you gasp in shock as you see the smoke rising up as a hastily spinning Baltoy flew out of the dissipating cloud and hitting Igneous right back with its <b>Rapid Spin</b>. Well this toy has more than one trick up its sleeves but both Pokemon are still pretty evenly matched … for now.</b></span><b><br />

<b>Fishyfool</b> ~ You felt good to be out of harms way for the time being but this thought distracted you from where you were currently going and as you enter the small poorly lit room you walk right into a rock pillar. Cursing you held your bruised shin and danced around in pain causing Volcape’s Pokeball to fall onto the ground releasing the frightened monkey who clung to you leg to avoid the non existent quick sand. As you both recovered from your respective shocks you take in the room now lit by the same eerie pink lighting. Volcape brought your attention to the plaque before the pedestals and the orbs beneath and you both read through the vague instructions. Understanding what was required of you to open the door you pick up the blue Water Orb playing with it in your hand before putting it on the Fire Pedestal. Picking up the nest orb, this time a bright yellow Electric Orb you placed it on the Water Pedestal before moving on. You carried on like this choosing an orb and thinking through its strengths before placing it on hopefully the correct pedestal. At the end you observed your work and noted that you had one orb remaining as the plaque had said. Picking up the white Normal Orb you walk over to the door ready and place it in waiting to see what would happen. After a minute or so had passed you wondered if anything would happen but suddenly hear a whine behind you. Looking over your shoulder you notice some of the orbs begin to turn a dirty red in colour and notice that the Normal Orb turned the same shade. It appeared that you got some of the orbs incorrect. With a dejected sigh you walk back over to see where you had gone wrong. Only a few of the orbs had turned red. The normally vibrant red Fire Orb now on the Bug Pedestal was a dirty red colour, as was the Ice Orb on the Dragon Pedestal, the Fighting Orb on the Steel Pedestal, Dragon Orb on the Rock Pedestal and the Rock Orb on the Flying Pedestal. It appears that you’ll have to correct your mistakes before you can venture further. </span><br />
<br />
A very good try I must say. I do like the italics and if you could use it again that be great. Here’s a hint on where you have gone wrong. Rock isn’t weak to Dragon and Dragon has <i>more than</i> one weakness. Use serebii’s type chart, it’ll help <a href="http://www.serebii.net/games/type.shtml" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.serebii.net%2Fgames%2Ftype.shtml&amp;hash=3d5d375e01f3c14f9aa17f7484c863f0" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.serebii.net/games/type.shtml</a><br />

<br />
<b>Kasai</b> ~</span> Anything is possible in FB and Pokemon. Children from 10 can be trainers of vicious creatures which battle one another. Evil organisations recruit anyone willing to be part of their corrupt vision of life, its totally plausible that anyone of any age could be brought up to believe what their parents taught them (good or bad) so why not a 12 year old hunter? That and kids now-a-days seem much older than they are … I feel old saying that XD<br />
<br />
<span style="color: lightsteelblue">Relief flooded through you as you realised you were not going to be eaten by the gargantuan Onix and that the ranger believed you. You face the small Swinub sending a silent thank you to it for bailing you out. Picking up your thoroughly worn Torchic in your arms you approach the ranger who climbs up onto his Onix’s head. He beckons you up and you gulp at the prospect of mounting the rock Pokemon but after a moment’s hesitation climb onto its rocky back. Climbing up to sit next to the ranger who held Swinub in his arms you ask if he thinks it’ll be alright. The Ranger turned to face you and smiled.<br />
<br />
“I think it will, once we get back to the cabin I’ll make sure it’s healed right up,” she says making you feel a little better. Swinub casts its eyes on you smiling at your concern as Onix sets off shocking you with the jolt. You get a great chance to see the Silverton ranges from a high view and realise how beautiful the sight really is. After a short ride you reach a large wooden cabin set at the base of the mountain you were on. Gingerly getting off Onix with Harumi in your arms you follow the Ranger inside. He sets down his pack and walked over to a small bed lying Swinub down. Walking into another room he retrieves some medical supplies before washing the deep cut with antiseptic and water making the small ice pig squeal in pain. Stroking its soft fur it calms at your touch and you marvel at how warm it feels despite its type. The ranger set to stitching the wound together before bandaging its leg. After the ordeal was over Swinub hopped gingerly over to your lap before snuggling next to you and falling asleep. The Ranger smiled warmly at the pair of you.<br />
<br />
“I think you’ve made a life long friend there. It takes someone with a big heart to go out of their way to help a Pokemon that wasn’t theirs. It shows your true character.” Looking to your bag and spotting a Pokeball he looked you deep in your eyes. “I think you would be a good partner for Swinub,” he suggested winking at you before walking to a kitchen to make you a drink. Its not like rangers to suggest the capture of Pokemon, you must have really impressed him.<br />

<b>Lemon~Lime</b> ~ As you walked along the mine tunnel you begin to get a little nervous, the light was beginning to fade and you had yet to find anything of interest. Maybe there was nothing here at all. Just as thoughts of turning back entered your head you spot the 3 gems in the nearby wall. Excitement fills you as you greedily imagine what you could do with those gems. Reaching out you yelp in shock drawing your hand back as razor sharp teeth attempt to take a chunk of your flesh. The creature scuttles up the walls and casts it light blue gem-like eyes on you. Scorpio was only just holding onto your neck at this point having nearly passed out with fear at the sight. As you see the Sableye take up it position near the ceiling of the mine a few cunning ideas run through your mind. Maybe this Pokemon could lead you to more treasures deeper within the mine, real treasures! You apologise to the Sableye and tell it that you mean it no harm and the dark type appears to relax a little. Felling better about the situation now you ask it if there are any more gems or ores in this mine and Sableye understanding what you ask hisses at you in anger no longer relaxed making Scorpio fly off your shoulder in alarm and panic. It bares it silver teeth and shakes it head, well it seems that you offended by hunting for gems, maybe it was protecting some? Scorpio who hovered near your head heard your order to attack if Sableye should attack first. Scorpio gulped and faced the the gremlin shaking a little. Sableye’s blue eyes turned red in a frightening <b>Leer</b> making Scorpio shake violently before it leapt off the wall and slashed its claws across the Gligar’s body in a <b>Scratch</b> attack. Scorpio cried out in pain and hovered back searching for the Sableye who had retreated to the darkness. Seeing a flash of blue he fired off a wave of <b>Poison Stings</b> that bounced of the ground missing their target. From the darkness a shriek came scaring Scorpio as the Sableye leapt out of the shadows claws bared. Scorpio yelled but managed to fire off another <b>Poison Sting</b> attack that struck Sableye hard but not slowing its momentum causing it to crash into him both Pokemon downed. Sableye was the first to get up pulling the spines from its purple body glaring at you both hard. This Pokemon was going to make sure that you ventured no further into the mine. </span></b></span></div>

<b>Fishyfool</b> ~ You felt good to be out of harms way for the time being but this thought distracted you from where you were currently going and as you enter the small poorly lit room you walk right into a rock pillar. Cursing you held your bruised shin and danced around in pain causing Volcape’s Pokeball to fall onto the ground releasing the frightened monkey who clung to you leg to avoid the non existent quick sand. As you both recovered from your respective shocks you take in the room now lit by the same eerie pink lighting. Volcape brought your attention to the plaque before the pedestals and the orbs beneath and you both read through the vague instructions. Understanding what was required of you to open the door you pick up the blue Water Orb playing with it in your hand before putting it on the Fire Pedestal. Picking up the nest orb, this time a bright yellow Electric Orb you placed it on the Water Pedestal before moving on. You carried on like this choosing an orb and thinking through its strengths before placing it on hopefully the correct pedestal. At the end you observed your work and noted that you had one orb remaining as the plaque had said. Picking up the white Normal Orb you walk over to the door ready and place it in waiting to see what would happen. After a minute or so had passed you wondered if anything would happen but suddenly hear a whine behind you. Looking over your shoulder you notice some of the orbs begin to turn a dirty red in colour and notice that the Normal Orb turned the same shade. It appeared that you got some of the orbs incorrect. With a dejected sigh you walk back over to see where you had gone wrong. Only a few of the orbs had turned red.

It appears that you’ll have to correct your mistakes before you can venture further. </span><br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">OOC: Ah, good, just some terminally-glowing orbs instead of deathly lasers. Ah well, safe enough.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: gold">BIC: Watching the door, Volcape studied, ready to alert Jamie should it disappear as the human scanned the area looking for signs of impending doom, and after a short while, Jamie came to the realisation that this room was perhaps more merciful than others. Turning, Jamie noticed the archway wasn't changing, and the sudden whine, sounding much like that when crystals glow before firing lasers capable of slicing through the hide of Steelix, instantly made him and Volcape jump as the Normal Orb suddenly turned a rather dirty red, and the trainer realised that the room was being rather merciful.<br />
<br />
&quot;So we were wrong...but I expected this.&quot; Jamie sighed as he turned, hoping that the sixteen orbs wouldn't turn the same shade, and gave a slight smile as he saw only a few give the same glow. The five pedestals with the wrong elements were somewhat clear as he removed all the dirty red orbs and watched them revert to their original shades, before racking his brain once more.<br />
<br />
The Normal, Fire, Ice, Fighting, Rock and Dragon Orbs were left, and the five pedestals were the Bug, Flying, Dragon, Steel and Rock ones. Knowing that Fire wan't correct with Bug, Jamie scanned the five remaining types and realised that the only one left was Steel as he placed the <i>Fire Orb on the Steel Pedestal</i>, confident that it wa correct this time. Ice had failed with Dragon, and Jamie mentally facepalmed as he realised that Dragon destroys Dragon as he placed the <i>Dragon Orb on the Dragon Pedestal</i>, with the other four orbs left between Bug, Flying and Rock. Since Rock failed against Flying, Jamie opted to have a think with the remainder, and then placed the <i>Ice Orb on the Flying Pedestal</i>, with the remaining three, Normal, Fighting and Rock, between the Bug and Rock pedestals. Jamie had a realisation that Rocks beat Bugs and Fighters crush Rocks, and that the Normal Orb was perhaps right after all, but the others had to be in as well. Placing the <i>Fighting Orb on the Rock Pedestal</i> and the <i>Rock Orb on the Bug Pedestal</i>, Jamie then replaced the <i>Normal Orb on the Arch Shield</i> and watched with some confidence that the few orbs left were correct as Volcape sat in slight thought.</span></span></div>

<b>Artifical Dragon</b> ~ Upon seeing Igneous extracting himself from a nearby sand dune you ascertain his condition your fiery echidna wobbling about a little dizzy from the toss. After clearing his senses Igneous turned in your grip with a furious expression on his face. You smile and congratulate him on a good start to the battle even if Igneous felt otherwise. Placing him back on the sand you observe the Baltoy who spun on the spot keeping its eye on Igneous the whole time, awaiting his next move. You curse Igneous’s limited move set at present and wished that he currently knew Quick Attack or a fiery type attack. Oh well you would have to both do the best with what you had. You knew that your Cyndaquil would put up a hell of a fight regardless of how little experience he had. With a fresh set of orders and a warning to be careful Igneous ran over to face Baltoy staring it down both ready for the other to move. Both acted at the same time and as Igneous <b>Leer[/]ed at Baltoy it <b>Harden</b>ed its smooth skin. Baltoy was distracted by the Leer but was thicker skinned and Igneous huffed in annoyance before running full speed at the spinning toy and whacking it good and proper with a hard <b>Tackle</b> that pushed it back into the sand. Baltoy moved to attack when Igneous let loose a cloud of black smoke that covered the opposing Pokemon making it hesitate. You grin at how well Igenous had performed before you gasp in shock as you see the smoke rising up as a hastily spinning Baltoy flew out of the dissipating cloud and hitting Igneous right back with its <b>Rapid Spin</b>. Well this toy has more than one trick up its sleeves but both Pokemon are still pretty evenly matched … for now.</b></span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange"><b>While Igneous was following orders Alina stood there and observed the Baltoy. Very clever, this little guy was. Her Cyndaquil didn't seem tired yet, which was good, but Alina could tell how frustrated he was. He probably expected this to be a simple and quick battle. As she watched her Pokemon charge toward the Baltoy something hit her: if she could catch this Baltoy she could make it show her the way to one of the villages, if they exist. But if they didn't exist, then it could at least lead her to the closest exit. Besides, it would be stuck with her anyway, it might as well do what she says. She felt stupid after -just- thinking that up, maybe it was the heat or something. But anyway, the Baltoy could make an excellent addition to her team, if they got along all right. <br />
<br />
At that moment she saw a huge cloud of smoke rising through the air and her jaw dropped. She watched the clay doll come spinning towards Igneous which sent him stumbling back. The tiny echidna was even more frustrated now, but he didn't look seriously damaged, thank God. Alina ran her fingers through her hair and sighed; no defensive attack was working. It was able to negate the leer and the smokescreen... those two attacks were nothing to the Baltoy except a minor distraction. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let's try something different,&quot; Alina said. &quot;How about <b>three Tackles</b>, so far our offensive moves have been serving us well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course, there was always that Confusion attack, but that seemed unavoidable. Igneous was more than happy to beat it to a pulp rather than just Leering and Smokescreening it, so he charged forward to begin his new assault. </b></span></span></div>

<b>Lemon~Lime</b> ~ As you walked along the mine tunnel you begin to get a little nervous, the light was beginning to fade and you had yet to find anything of interest. Maybe there was nothing here at all. Just as thoughts of turning back entered your head you spot the 3 gems in the nearby wall. Excitement fills you as you greedily imagine what you could do with those gems. Reaching out you yelp in shock drawing your hand back as razor sharp teeth attempt to take a chunk of your flesh. The creature scuttles up the walls and casts it light blue gem-like eyes on you. Scorpio was only just holding onto your neck at this point having nearly passed out with fear at the sight. As you see the Sableye take up it position near the ceiling of the mine a few cunning ideas run through your mind. Maybe this Pokemon could lead you to more treasures deeper within the mine, real treasures! You apologise to the Sableye and tell it that you mean it no harm and the dark type appears to relax a little. Felling better about the situation now you ask it if there are any more gems or ores in this mine and Sableye understanding what you ask hisses at you in anger no longer relaxed making Scorpio fly off your shoulder in alarm and panic. It bares it silver teeth and shakes it head, well it seems that you offended by hunting for gems, maybe it was protecting some? Scorpio who hovered near your head heard your order to attack if Sableye should attack first. Scorpio gulped and faced the the gremlin shaking a little. Sableye’s blue eyes turned red in a frightening <b>Leer</b> making Scorpio shake violently before it leapt off the wall and slashed its claws across the Gligar’s body in a <b>Scratch</b> attack. Scorpio cried out in pain and hovered back searching for the Sableye who had retreated to the darkness. Seeing a flash of blue he fired off a wave of <b>Poison Stings</b> that bounced of the ground missing their target. From the darkness a shriek came scaring Scorpio as the Sableye leapt out of the shadows claws bared. Scorpio yelled but managed to fire off another <b>Poison Sting</b> attack that struck Sableye hard but not slowing its momentum causing it to crash into him both Pokemon downed. Sableye was the first to get up pulling the spines from its purple body glaring at you both hard. This Pokemon was going to make sure that you ventured no further into the mine. </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: lightsteelblue"><span style="font-size: 9px">Mike recoiled as the Sableye let out a deep hiss, Scorpio flying off his arm in fear. Its <b>leer</b>ing eyes nearly pushed Scorpio's mind off the deep end, and to make matters worse, the demonic little thing gave him a <b>Scratch</b>. Scorpio barely managed to fire off two waves of <b>Poison Stings</b>, the first bouncing off the floor, the second hitting the Sableye. It charged out of the shadows in rage as the second one hit, knocking into Scorpio. The Sableye got up, still enraged and obviously not going to let them go any farther into the cave. Mike decided he was going to have to use some quick thinking to get out of this. immediatly, he had an idea. &quot;Scorpio!&quot;, he yelled. &quot;Fly up and grab those <i>gems</i>,&quot; adding a wink here to make sure Scorpio got the plan,&quot;on that <i>wall</i> over there, then fly out near the entrance of the cave, where I'll be, and where the <i>light</i> is. Then we can <i>get away</i> with the <i>gems</i> we <i>stole from this cave</i>. That Sableye'll <i>never</i> follow us there. It'll have <i>failed miserably</i> at its <i>job</i>, unless it <i>follows</i> us into the <i>light</i>. Anyway, shoot <b>three Poison Stings</b> at it when you're at the edge of the cave with me.&quot; Scorpio looked at Mike quizzically, wondering why he was stressing so many words, then suddenly smiled and winked back. Mike ran to the cave entrance, hoping his plan would work out.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"> <br />
(OOC: He's trying to fool the Sableye into thinking he stole a gem to bring it out into the light, where it has a disadvantage.)</span></div>

<b>Pyschopath</b> ~ Clearly impressed by Pachirisu’s determination and hardiness you glance down to Freeze who was slowly picking himself off the ground. He was feeling very sore from the powerful Bide attack but fuelled to win his battle, he wasn’t going to disappoint you. Quickly thinking over a strategy you come up with a plan which could be quite risky but if it worked would bring the fight back round to your favour. With some encouraging words you urge Freeze to continue on fighting, your show white Sneasel happy to oblige. With a surge of hidden energy Freeze pushes to his feet and launches himself at the Squirrel catching it with a sneaky <b>Scratch</b> leaving more welts across its already scarred abdomen. Pachirisu squeaked angrily and <b>Growled</b> loudly startling Freeze as he was powering up his Ice Punch. With its opponent’s hesitation Pachirisu ran at Freeze with great speed smacking him with its <b>Quick Attack</b> Freeze fell back holding his stomach, these repeated attacks were really taking their toll on him. Pachirisu grinned before speeding up again and heading round for another shot. Freeze stood tall and readied himself eager to use his ‘secret move’. Calming his nerves and focusing on the speedy squirrel he noticed that he could see it moving better than before. Just as Pachirisu leapt to attack Freeze dove to the side and grabbed its tail. Pachirishu squeaked in shock as Freeze rolled its arms over its head and launched the squirrel across the forest and into a large thick tree in an impressive <b>Counter</b>. Pachirisu lay at the foot of the tree looking truly beaten, bruises marring its flesh and fur. It struggled to get to up and on wobbly feet, hardly able to hold itself upright locked eyes with you, still determined, almost daring you to finish it off. </span><br />

<b>RaunchyFad</b> ~ Rocky was not impressed that her attacks were having such little effect on the gargantuan beast she faced. Shaking off the pain she tried another tactic and let loose a high pitched yell eyes locked onto the Purugly’s throughout wanting to share the intimidation. Meanwhile you were holding onto the frightened Meowth trying to catch your breath. Hoping that you could scurry away from the battle you inched your way along the wall holding on tightly to Meowth all the time. As you neared Purugly however you seemed to get stuck by its immense girth and choke on a large amount of fur. Rocky cast you an utterly shocked look her face turning pale with embarrassment before she growled to herself for being stuck with such a useless trainer. Rolling her eyes she gave Purugly a quick look asking it to remain right there for a moment, Purugly grinning to itself and moving as to push harder on your body and really squish you. Waddling over to you she kicked you hard in the face pushing you away from the cat’s bulky mass and you thank her for the assist. Placing her back in front of the amused kitty you gave her some vague orders. Although your actions were embarrassing for all involved it provided a distraction for Purugly and it had halted its previous movement of an attack. Rocky ran forward and with amazing speed manage to smack right into Purugly with a sharp <b>Quick Attack</b> that changed the cat’s tune making it frown in annoyance. It moved forward slowly before it too disappeared landing right on Rocky in a <b>Quick Attack</b> of its own showing its uniqueness and strength. Rocky groaned from under the bulk of Purugly and <b>Harden</b>ed to lessen the pain. Purugly didn’t seem inclined to move from its position and Rocky using all her strength rolled out moving into a blur and <b>Quick Attack</b>ing the fat cat again making it wince this time. The collateral damage was beginning to build up and even a strong Pokemon like Purugly couldn’t help but feel it. Grinning it stared hard at Rocky who stared back equally in defiance. Meowth screeched at her to look away obviously knowing what was coming and wriggled out of your grasp the try and get her attention. Unfortunately Rocky didn’t want to back down but she began to feel very tired all of a sudden before falling asleep at the feet of the fat beast. Purugly laughed to itself proud of how its <b>Hypnosis</b> went. </span> </span>

</blockquote><span style="color: lemonchiffon"><span style="font-size: 9px">Rocky stumbled backwards, let out a small squeak then collapsed at the feet of the monster feline, much to Paul’s dismay. Of course, Rocky was a bit of an early bird and never slept for long, but even a few minutes of being knocked out on the ground could cause substantial problems. This drove Paul into a cold panic, especially since he himself began to feel sleepy. He wasn’t exactly sure what the purugly had done, but he knew very well that he was now a rabbit caught in the mystifying dance of a predatory stoat.<br />
<br />
“Hey… hey li’l bobcat?” Paul yawned as he began to ask the meowth a question. “Could you, uh… could you fill in for Rocky, man?” Paul was clearly unsure about what the meowth’s reply would be, especially after it had tried so hard to evade the purugly upon their first meeting. He then began to bite his wrist and smack himself in the face to keep himself from nodding off completely. It then dawned onto him that if he regained some strength he could maybe get up onto his feet and take on the purugly himself, though the drowsiness and fear of being crushed prevented him from doing so. Rats.<br />
<br />
It seemed that all he could do was look down upon the cat in his lap and mumble orders to his fast-asleep acorn. If the meowth decided not to help, he would find himself to be in quite the pickle.<br />

<br />
<b>Kasai</b> ~</span> Anything is possible in FB and Pokemon. Children from 10 can be trainers of vicious creatures which battle one another. Evil organisations recruit anyone willing to be part of their corrupt vision of life, its totally plausible that anyone of any age could be brought up to believe what their parents taught them (good or bad) so why not a 12 year old hunter? That and kids now-a-days seem much older than they are … I feel old saying that XD<br />
<br />
<span style="color: lightsteelblue">Relief flooded through you as you realised you were not going to be eaten by the gargantuan Onix and that the ranger believed you. You face the small Swinub sending a silent thank you to it for bailing you out. Picking up your thoroughly worn Torchic in your arms you approach the ranger who climbs up onto his Onix’s head. He beckons you up and you gulp at the prospect of mounting the rock Pokemon but after a moment’s hesitation climb onto its rocky back. Climbing up to sit next to the ranger who held Swinub in his arms you ask if he thinks it’ll be alright. The Ranger turned to face you and smiled.<br />
<br />
“I think it will, once we get back to the cabin I’ll make sure it’s healed right up,” she says making you feel a little better. Swinub casts its eyes on you smiling at your concern as Onix sets off shocking you with the jolt. You get a great chance to see the Silverton ranges from a high view and realise how beautiful the sight really is. After a short ride you reach a large wooden cabin set at the base of the mountain you were on. Gingerly getting off Onix with Harumi in your arms you follow the Ranger inside. He sets down his pack and walked over to a small bed lying Swinub down. Walking into another room he retrieves some medical supplies before washing the deep cut with antiseptic and water making the small ice pig squeal in pain. Stroking its soft fur it calms at your touch and you marvel at how warm it feels despite its type. The ranger set to stitching the wound together before bandaging its leg. After the ordeal was over Swinub hopped gingerly over to your lap before snuggling next to you and falling asleep. The Ranger smiled warmly at the pair of you.<br />
<br />
“I think you’ve made a life long friend there. It takes someone with a big heart to go out of their way to help a Pokemon that wasn’t theirs. It shows your true character.” Looking to your bag and spotting a Pokeball he looked you deep in your eyes. “I think you would be a good partner for Swinub,” he suggested winking at you before walking to a kitchen to make you a drink. Its not like rangers to suggest the capture of Pokemon, you must have really impressed him.</span></span>

Kasai could not help daydreaming again at the sight of the passing Silverton ranges. She remembered her arrival and how she nearly had Harumi attack the swinub. Now, with the small creature nearby, Kasai remembered her home, the appearance of a piloswine, often leaving its hair all over the carpets. The ranger's words slowly sunk in as Kasai attempted to contain her excitement. She stroked the back of the little Pokémon, knowing her decision. She took a Pokéball out of her bag and held it in front of the swinub. How it would fit inside, she would never know. &quot;Do you want to come with me?&quot; she asked, running her hand through its fur. It felt so soft, so alive. &quot;You can live with Harumi and Phoebe,&quot; Kasai continued. &quot;I would love to have you come with me.&quot; Kasai paused, still holding the Pokéball, waiting for the swinub to respond. Harumi chirped, her turquoise feathers still ruffled. Phoebe just stared shyly.</span></span></div>

<b><u><span style="color: lemonchiffon">Mediville</span></u></b><span style="color: lemonchiffon"> (Please reply in <b>lemonchiffon</b>)<br />
<br />
<b>allsystemsaredown</b> ~ As you looked down at the hopeful Pidgey you took a moment to think over your decision. It was clear that the tiny bird had been impressed enough by your kindness and warm soul to want to travel alongside you but the question was did you want Pidgey as a team-mate? Torchlight looked up to you wondering what you were going to do and if he was going to have a new friend by his side. Having made your decision you pulled a Level Ball from your bag adding that you could always purchase more Pokeballs at a later date. As you held the enlarged capture device before you, Pidgey’s eyes a little fearful of the device but soothed by Torchlight’s happy expression you thought back to the battle you had with the young boy. Maybe you had been fighting over the Pidgey after all, but since the little bird wanted to be with you and not him the battle was won before it started. Throwing the ball at the bird it hit its side with a soft thud before drawing the Pokemon inside. It hardly wiggled before a solid ‘ding’ resounded letting you know what you had successfully captured your first Pokemon. Congratulations, you have captured a <b>Level 04, Female Pidgey</b>. Harmony smiled at you waved as you left.<br />
<br />
“Take care all of you, have fun in the rest of your adventures”<br />
<br />
<i>With Pidgey’s capture you’ve unlocked your rights to the Egg House and are hereby released from the Arcane Realm. Upon replying to this update you’re free to post in the mainstream zones (I know they’re currently un-manned but something is being worked out so fear not). The two zones per trainer rule will still apply when you do. Good Luck in all your future adventures ^-^</i></span></span>

<span style="color: Lemonchiffon">The girl looked at her first capture and tried to think up a good name. She went through a couple ideas before she finally chose one. &quot;Volante,&quot; she said, staring at the Level Ball. That's what I'll call you.&quot; She then turned to Harmony, waving goodbye and saying &quot;Hey, Harmony! Thanks for helping us out! We'll see you soon!&quot; She opened the Level ball and whistled. &quot;Volante!&quot; The bird responded and flapped its way over to the girl. &quot;There we go. Something tells me that this is off to a good start.&quot; The girl scratched Volante on the head, and the three left for new lands, the girl, the bird, and the Cyndaquil...</span></span></div>
