<span style="color: gold"><b><u>Ancient Tomb</u></b> (Please reply in <b>gold</b>)<br />
<br />
<b>Fishyfool</b> ~ This battle was more than a test of strength of Pokemon and human but a test of heart and you felt a tears form in yours as Lunatone cried out melodiously at another strike on its form. Your emotions were raw and filling your whole being, your first battle and it was such a heart-wrenching one. Were they all like this? Would you break down every time you had to face a new opponent? For right now you wanted this battle done, over, finished … before anymore pain was inflicted on either Pokemon. Lunatone stared right at you its red eye betraying its strength and showing its emotions. It understood your need to fight it but your words had stirred something deep inside and it had a new longing that it had never felt before and it was conflicted. <br />
<br />
Tearing your gaze away for fear that the floodgates would open and tears that would never end would flow you manage to compose yourself enough to strategise. Volcape was a small yet agile monkey and could move faster than the bulky moon Pokemon. You could use that to your advantage and hopefully finish the battle quickly. Volcape was hunched over in pain and dripping with sweat, exhaustion wracking his body, he appeared in no condition to fight on yet his eyes were filled with the same determination that shone at the start of the battle. You feel your Snover’s pokeball by your side and wonder for a moment, would it be wrong to call her out? Volcape would be able to rest and heal but you may never be able to heal his pride for doing so. Such a decision you made to carry on may permanently affect your Chimchar but deep down you felt it the right one.<br />
<br />
Praising Volcape and promising him a delicious treat after the battle was done brought a smile to the Chimchars face as he held in a giggle. You could understand if he couldn’t continue on but this seemed to just fuel the fire of determination keeping him going and he stood tall. Proudly you smile feeling a few fresh tears escape your eyes and trek down your cheek. With a strategy formed you convey what you pray is the last onslaught for Volcape and he gives no signs of hearing your order, merely stared at Lunatone who focused on you with its good eye. Volcape backed up as per your instructions and Lunatone seemed deep within its own thoughts, pain shining in it’s eye from the attacks it had racked up. Its eye turned to a blue colour once more and both you and Volcape knew what was to follow. You stared worriedly at the spot Volcape was last at only to see him charging towards Lunatone, that wasn’t part of the plan! Volcape moved in a haphazard movement and you could see that Lunatone was having trouble focusing on him. Grinning at his ingeninuity you see him leap up and grab onto Lunatone sitting before his nose causing Lunatone to panic slightly and shake back and forth to knock him off. Holding on tight Volcape slammed a <b>Thunderpunch</b> into Lunatones good eye making it shriek in agony and you bite your lip feeling more tears flow. Lunatone crashes to the ground and with a final flurry of <b>Embers</b> from Volcape it lay unmoving, the light in its eyes diminished as it was KO’ed. <b>Level-Up for Volcape</b>. <br />
<br />
Volcape gave it a look a respect before tiredly walking over to you and collapsing in your arms. Lunatone disappears into thousands of bright pink lights and joins those dancing around the walls leaving only a small round pink orb behind with a moon symbol in white in its centre on the ground. You hear a crackle and buzz as the barrier behind you shattered the energy floating up to disappear into the ceiling. There was nothing between you and your treasure now. Upon closer inspection the chest had several lines leading to a round circular divot in its centre but no other locks. Now was the time to open it and receive your treasure.</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: gold">Jamie's heart missed a beat when Lunatone struck the ground unconscious, Volcape victorious against a foe who it had a type disadvantage against, and as Volcape staggered over and collapsed in his arms, exhausted but triumphant in the way that someone carrying a baby from a burning building smiles in spite of the horrific burns taken to save the life, and Jamie could only smie back at him, proud of the achievement. What happened next, however, took the happiness from the victory and burned it in the lava of despair as they watched Lunatone disappear into mere lights, almost as though the tomb willed the expiry of it as punishment for failure, and leaving a small orb behind. Took shocked to move, Jamie looked at the orb and at Volcape, who returned the sort of look that he wasn't the only pokemon he had. With nothing but a nod and a sudden flash, Arctacea the Snover stook in front of them, wondering where he were as he turned to the trainer and the injured but victorious Chimchar, surprise in his eyes.<br />
<br />
The look in the eyes of Jamie, however, told him that a battle had been through and Volcape was successful, as Arctacea gave a little round of applause, the sound of the limbs knocking together like two logs clunking throughout the area. As the three turned to the barrier, it shattered and Arctacea's eyes lit up like baubles at the chest in the centre. Looking at it and the emotional wreck of Jamie and Volcape, it knew that the two were in no state to really argue about anything as he lumbered to the orb Volcape looked at with sorrow, and jubilantly plucked it from the ground as though it were just an orb, before handing it to Jamie as he hoisted the exhausted Volcape's arm over his shoulder for support as the pair grinned at each other. Examining the divot and the orb, which seemed warm to the touch, Jamie knew exactly what it was for as he walked to the chest, the sound of Lunatone's cry in his heart as he slowly placed the orb into the divot, his body trembling at the sight of watching a pokemon's life end suddenly and mysteriously.</span></span></div>

<b>fishyfool</b> ~ Feeling your heart in your throat as Lunatone struck the ground you truly begin to see the consequences of the battle. Volcape collapsed in your arms weary and beaten but still the victor, a wide smile on his face upon seeing the proud look on yours. You smile soon vanishes along with Lunatone who disintegrates into hundreds of shiny pink lights that danced their way over to the wall to join their companions. All you could think was how unfair it was that Lunatone had met such a fate, as if it was punished for its loss by whatever great force resided within the Tomb. You can all but stare at the small pink orb left, your body in shock over the loss of Lunatone. Volcape gave you brief look and you found your second Pokemon, Arctacea the Snover standing by your side. He looked about in bewilderment wondering where he was and seemed unnerved by your lack of motion and Volcape’s current state. You give him a quick cursory glance and Arctacea puts two and two together and applauds Volcape’s success in his first ever battle despite the fog of sorrow in the air. It’s after the loud noise echoing through the small room that you hear the barrier shatter and the energy absorbed into the ceiling. Arctacea spotted the chest and his eyes grow huge and full of longing. He was keen to get a closer look at it but you and Volcape were both deep in thought and shaken that you had yet to move. He ambled forward and picked up the fragile pink orb and tottered back over to you placing the small object in your hand. Seemingly woken by the cold of the orb in your hands you spot Arctacea supporting Volcape as they moved closer to the chest. <br />
<br />
Following them you kneel down before the chest your mind not on the treasure at all. Trembling you place the orb within the divot gasping as the moon within shone bright. Bright pink lines ran from the orb through the chest illuminating the whole room before the lock clicked and the lid lifted. The light died down and the orb had seemed to turn a dull grey colour. Pushing open the lid to the chest you’re surprised to see a lone Moon Ball on a pink cushion within. This was the treasure? Sat before the lone Pokeball was a small plain card and curiously you picked it up. Flipping it in your hands you wondered what it meant before gold writing started to form almost making you drop the card in shock. Still shaking you read the inscribed words.<br />
<br />
<i>“Treasure Hunter<br />
Your quest here has ended and you have defeated all trials<br />
As reward you find your wondrous treasure.<br />
For this treasure is greater than gold and jewels,<br />
This treasure survives the ravages of time,<br />
This treasure is unique and unlike any other,<br />
This treasure is both for you and given by you,<br />
This treasure … is friendship. <br />
Intelligent of mind, kind of heart and brave of soul<br />
Protect this treasure as we once did.”</i><br />
<br />
You are beyond curious now and shaking with anticipation you pick up the Moon Ball feeling the weight within. A tingle of excitement flows through you as you press the release on the ball, a bright white light filling the room before it dissipates. Rubbing your eyes you feel fresh tears form again and hold back a sob as you see Lunatone floating before you full of health looking bewildered. It spotted you and the Moon Ball in your hand and its eyes grew wide and full of emotion. <b>Congratulations. You have a new partner in the form of a Level 06, Genderless Lunatone</b>. You don’t even see the room shimmer and fade as you’re brought back to the entrance too caught up in your emotions. Lunatone whirls around its eyes full of wonder at the light streaming through the entrance of the Tomb, it had been a long time since it had seen it. It faced you a single tear fallng from its eyes and you feel warm happiness flood your senses as Lunatone psychically shares its feeling with you. You have been given a great treasure and a new challenge: to raise and protect your new Pokemon.</span><br />
<br />
<i> With Lunatones’s capture you’ve unlocked your rights to the Egg House and are hereby released from the Arcane Realm. Upon replying to this update you’re free to post in the mainstream zones , the two zones per trainer rule will still apply when you do. You need not provide a Pokeball for Lunatone as its homed in the Moon Ball. Good Luck in all your future adventures ^-^</i></span></div>

It’s after the loud noise echoing through the small room that you hear the barrier shatter and the energy absorbed into the ceiling. Arctacea spotted the chest and his eyes grow huge and full of longing. He was keen to get a closer look at it but you and Volcape were both deep in thought and shaken that you had yet to move. He ambled forward and picked up the fragile pink orb and tottered back over to you placing the small object in your hand. Seemingly woken by the cold of the orb in your hands you spot Arctacea supporting Volcape as they moved closer to the chest. <br />
<br />
Following them you kneel down before the chest your mind not on the treasure at all. Trembling you place the orb within the divot gasping as the moon within shone bright. Bright pink lines ran from the orb through the chest illuminating the whole room before the lock clicked and the lid lifted. The light died down and the orb had seemed to turn a dull grey colour. Pushing open the lid to the chest you’re surprised to see a lone Moon Ball on a pink cushion within. This was the treasure? Sat before the lone Pokeball was a small plain card and curiously you picked it up. Flipping it in your hands you wondered what it meant before gold writing started to form almost making you drop the card in shock. Still shaking you read the inscribed words.<br />
<br />
<i>“Treasure Hunter<br />
Your quest here has ended and you have defeated all trials<br />
As reward you find your wondrous treasure.<br />
For this treasure is greater than gold and jewels,<br />
This treasure survives the ravages of time,<br />
This treasure is unique and unlike any other,<br />
This treasure is both for you and given by you,<br />
This treasure … is friendship. <br />
Intelligent of mind, kind of heart and brave of soul<br />
Protect this treasure as we once did.”</i><br />
<br />
You are beyond curious now and shaking with anticipation you pick up the Moon Ball feeling the weight within. A tingle of excitement flows through you as you press the release on the ball, a bright white light filling the room before it dissipates. Rubbing your eyes you feel fresh tears form again and hold back a sob as you see Lunatone floating before you full of health looking bewildered. It spotted you and the Moon Ball in your hand and its eyes grew wide and full of emotion. <b>Congratulations. You have a new partner in the form of a Level 06, Genderless Lunatone</b>. You don’t even see the room shimmer and fade as you’re brought back to the entrance too caught up in your emotions. Lunatone whirls around its eyes full of wonder at the light streaming through the entrance of the Tomb, it had been a long time since it had seen it. It faced you a single tear fallng from its eyes and you feel warm happiness flood your senses as Lunatone psychically shares its feeling with you. You have been given a great treasure and a new challenge: to raise and protect your new Pokemon.</span><br />
<br />
<i> With Lunatones’s capture you’ve unlocked your rights to the Egg House and are hereby released from the Arcane Realm. Upon replying to this update you’re free to post in the mainstream zones , the two zones per trainer rule will still apply when you do. You need not provide a Pokeball for Lunatone as its homed in the Moon Ball. Good Luck in all your future adventures ^-^</i></span>

<br />
<span style="color: gold">As the light from the crescent shone brilliantly, Jamie and his pokemon had to shield themselves from the burst of light it emitted as they watched the act of the chest being unlocked with a click so cliched it was almost as though the chest was a normal box covered in fancy clothing. With the sort of anticipation expected from most people upon finding the room of treasure, Jamie opened the chest, with Volcape and Arctacea gazing into it, and the Snover's face went from curious wonder to adject neutrality as the chest's contents were revealed: One Moon Ball and a piece of blank card. Picking up the card, wondering just what sort of joke was going on, Jamie's eyes widened in shock as gold writing popped up as though it were being burned on, and as he read the message aloud, Volcape picked up the ball as Arctacea pondered just what sort of tomb the place was.<br />
<br />
Handing the ball over, Volcape and Arctacea watch with eagerness as to their new partner's identity as Jamie hefted the ball and looked at it with some curiosity before activating the release system on it, and giving a gasp of surprise and emotion as Lunatone's form emerged from within, and as it turned, a teardrop struck the ground as it hopped off Jamie's cheek as the two red eyes it had before they were disabled were restored, and upon noticing the Moon Ball in his hand, Lunatone too started to cry in joy, while Volcape stood in amazement at the first pokemon he fought now being an ally, leaving Arctacea to be the only one obivious to the whole shindig and therefore subject to a sudden exhalment of methanous air from the behind as the room shimmered around the four to the entrance of the tomb, sunlight screaming into his retinae and making the Snover topple over in flinching. As Lunatone gazed around the outside world, it's eyes lapping up the newfound freedom and light it hadn't seen for years, a crimson tear rolled off his rocky exterior as Volcape and Jamie felt the urge to cuddle it, and resisted out of the fact that Arctacea would likely give a snarky comment about bestiality.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lunatone, I think you'd like the name Meteos. Let me introduce you to the guys. Here is Volcape, you would know him already, while the Snover there is Arctacea,&quot; Jamie introduced his new friend to his other pokemon, &quot;And I'm Jamie, but you can call me Fishy. How do you like your freedom? I think we can go a long way together, guys. Now let's go get that dessert I promised!&quot;<br />
<br />
With the mention of dessert, Volcape and Arctacea perked up, the former's eyes evaporating the tears of happiness and the latter's belly giving a squeal of approval, and Meteos, noticing the ecstacy in the area, gave a happy glow as the four of them left the tomb and headed for new adventures.</span></span></div>

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange"><b>Ralfil</b> ~ You can almost feel Ralfil’s bruises and wince at every hit he takes whilst holding off the current threat. You glance over to Tom who’s healing his newly acquired Sandshrew and silently wished he’d hurry up. Sandshrew looked longingly over a the Phanpy pair who had stopped their rolling attacks to stare back. Both sets of Pokemon had mixed emotions written over their faces and you wonder how this will affect the battle. If Sandshrew doesn’t heed Tom’s orders the battle could go serious wrong and Ralfil would be the one to pay the price. Ralfil who’s gaze was flitting between his new partner and his enemies was of same mind as you and he backed towards you leaving space between him and the Phanpy duo. Your thoughts drift away from the battle to the consequences, if you won the Phanpy would be wide open for any other trainers or Pokemon that come along to brutalise, capture, eat … just like Lumps after his battle and you did not wish to bring any more harm to them. You tell Tom that you plan on ensure the Phanpy’s safety after the battle and he meets you with a conflicted look before the sad eyes of his Sandshrew bore into his soul making him nod in agreement. Tom had finished healing his Sandhrew as you gave further instructions to Ralfil and he knelt down to be level with his Pokemon.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">“I know you’re friends with the Phanpy but I need you to help us.” Tom started as Sandshrew looked over at its friends with sorrow. “They attacked Lumps because I captured you, they really hurt him. It wasn’t a fair fight but now we have help. Our battle was fair and we both understood going in the consequences if I won,” Tom said his Sandshrew nodding solemnly. “I’m not a bad person and I hope we can become friends too very soon. I know what I’m asking is hard but please help us,” he pleaded tears in his eyes. Sandshrew stared deep into his eyes before sighing and nodding, it wasn’t happy about the decision but made it anyway.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">“We’ll do this quickly so the damage will be minimal,” he said as if to comfort Sanshrew who merely nodded again. “Use your Sand Attack on one of the Phanpys then hit with a Scratch,” he ordered and Sandshrew plodded towards the battlefield, a little more slowly than both trainers would like.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">The Phanpys stared at Sandshrew, the small rodent with its head down as it shuffled its foot in the sand. Ralfil looked back and forth before taking the opportunity to leapt forward and sink his jaws around the leg of one of the Phanpys in a <b>Bite</b> attack causing all 3 Pokemon to break eye contact. The Phanpy cried out and fell onto its back trying to dislodge Ralfil. Sandshrew went to aid it before it remembered which side it was on. Sighing it turned around and digging its paws into the ground shifting a good amount of sand that hit the other Phanpy right in the face making it gasp in surprise shaking its head to rid its eyes of the foreign substance. Sandshrew’s lip wobbled and it closed its eyes as it reached forward <b>Scratch</b>ing the Phanpy along its side. The other Phanpy rolled round and round rapidly throwing Ralfil off and upon seeing their friend attack its kin looked shocked before anger filled its face. It ran forward and <b>Tackled</b> the unsuspecting Sandshrew pushing it down into the sands. Phanpy sat atop Sandshrew and looked down at it with a hard look as the sand rodent looked a mixture of guilty and afraid. Before it could act further Ralfil leapt forth and <b>Bit</b> down into its back throwing it off Sandshrew along with Ralfil who couldn’t keep his grip this time. </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Sandshrew picking itself back up and rubbed its stomach where it had been hit staring at Ralfil who stood by its side, a silent thank you passing between them. Both Phanpys had recovered from their attacks but were looking less healthy than your Pokemon. They exchanged looks before staring hard at Sandshrew, it seemed like the gloves were off and the little sand rodent would just have to accept that.</span> </span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">It was disheartening to see the emotional pain that the Sandshrew was going through. Whenever friends were forced to fight each other, it was agonizing to watch. Todd realized this, but was thankful that the Sandshrew was helping Ralfil. The Trapinch and Sandshrew had gotten in some good hits while the Phanpys were surprised, but clearly they had now adjusted. They were going to attack even harder now that they felt betrayed by their friend. Todd sighed. Then he straightened up and set his shoulders. If they were going to fight harder, so would him and Tom. Todd glanced at Tom and said, “Those Phanpys are going to fight harder now, so we need to step it up. Let’s make it a good battle.” He then looked back over at the Pokémon. The Trapinch and Sandshrew were standing side by side facing the Phanpys. Todd called out, “Alright Ralfil, you’re wearing them down! Work with Sandshrew and keep using Bite.” Maybe Ralfil would be able to get stronger from this battle. </span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Ralfil acknowledged Todd again. He was glad that Sandshrew was could work with him, but he wished the Pokémon would try a little harder. Friendship aside, those Phanpys had attacked a helpless Numel. The Trapinch had come to stop that, and now he would beat them. The Ant Pit Pokémon prepared to attack again.</span></span></div>

<b>Ralfil</b> ~ Although seeing the emotional struggles of Sandshrew and the Phanpy was tugging at your heartstrings you knew that this battle would have to be ended one way or another. The Phanpy had taken hits from Ralfil and Sandshrew and appeared ready to fight back, you only hoped that Sandshrew would soon show the same resolve. You were more than ready to give it your all and Ralfil was staring his foe’s down with determination, the proud Trapinsh wasn’t going to give in now. Looking over to Sandshrew you could see that it was still torn though deep in thought, possibly over its actions. Tom seemed pleased by Sandshrew’s obedience even if a little concerned at its original hesitance. You give the order to keep on biting and Ralfil chomps his jaws ready to attack again. Sandshrew eyed him wearily before sighing and facing the Phanpy.<br />
<br />
Ralfil watched to see what Sandshrew would do and Sandshrew cast an eye over to Ralfil realising that working together would be beneficial at this point. The Phanpy snorted at the duo and growled angrily at Sandshrew before charging towards it in duel <b>Tackles</b>. Tom shouted at Sandshrew to use <b>Defense Curl</b> and the little rodent immediately obeyed, not wanting to get hurt again. The faster, more energised Phanpy hit it head on but with its defenses raised it only rolled it back towards its trainer. Ralfil took the opportunity and leapt forward catching the other in a <b>Bite</b> as it missed its target. It fell into the sand sending the golden earth to fly into the air. Ralfil had lost his grip in the tousle but his attack had been effective. The poor elephant had teeth marks all over and was stumbling about in pain. The other Phanpy rolled forward with great speed through the sands and hit Ralfil in retribution with a <b>Tackle</b>. <br />
<br />
Sandshrew had recovered from its hit and with an order to <b>Scratch</b> the injured Phanpy gave a moments pause before scurrying through the sands and slashing the elephant across its abdomen making it fall back and cry out in pain. The other Phanpy seeing its friend in trouble gave out a tiny roar and charged for Sandshrew again but found itself rather slow as Ralfil had recovered and was chomping down on its hind leg. It cried in anger and shook its leg repeatedly. Seeing an open opportunity Sandshrew gave a blast of <b>Sand Attack</b> to its face making it falter and fall over trying to rub its eyes with its trunk. Sandshrew winced at what it had done and sighed but it had no choice it kept telling itself. It recoiled at the praise from its new trainer, it just wanted this battle over with.<br />
<br />
One Phanpy taken a good beating and it hurting quite bad, the other is still healty energy wise but with Ralfil on its leg and sand in its eyes it may struggle to manage much more of the battle. Sandshrew is healthy still and on your side now but Ralfil has been worn down by repeated Tackles and using Bite is wearing him down, his jaw is really starting to ache now. </span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Sandshrew had recovered from its hit and with an order to <b>Scratch</b> the injured Phanpy gave a moments pause before scurrying through the sands and slashing the elephant across its abdomen making it fall back and cry out in pain. The other Phanpy seeing its friend in trouble gave out a tiny roar and charged for Sandshrew again but found itself rather slow as Ralfil had recovered and was chomping down on its hind leg. It cried in anger and shook its leg repeatedly. Seeing an open opportunity Sandshrew gave a blast of <b>Sand Attack</b> to its face making it falter and fall over trying to rub its eyes with its trunk. Sandshrew winced at what it had done and sighed but it had no choice it kept telling itself. It recoiled at the praise from its new trainer, it just wanted this battle over with.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">One Phanpy taken a good beating and it hurting quite bad, the other is still healty energy wise but with Ralfil on its leg and sand in its eyes it may struggle to manage much more of the battle. Sandshrew is healthy still and on your side now but Ralfil has been worn down by repeated Tackles and using Bite is wearing him down, his jaw is really starting to ache now. </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">The battle was showing a disturbing note. One Pokémon on each side was clearly taking a majority of the damage. Even though he was going against it in battle, Todd felt sorry that the weakened Phanpy had to take so much damage. It was clear to Todd that Ralfil was getting worn out. He wasn’t surprised, considering the hard battling that the Trapinch had been doing. Even so, the battle was shifting decidedly in their favor. One Phanpy was almost defeated and the other was struggling with Ralfil and Sandshrew. If the Ant Pit Pokémon had to stop fighting, it might come down to a staring contest between the two remaining healthy Pokémon. However, Todd didn’t want Ralfil to faint, so he decided to see if he could end the battle with a more direct method. He didn’t think a Phanpy would fight past its limits, but he had heard stories about Tailows who did. He didn’t want that kind of damage to happen to any Pokémon. He looked over at Tom and said, “I don’t want to hurt them more than is necessary. Maybe this can end now.” Todd then strode a little closer to the battle, not enough to be in it, and asked in a loud voice, “Do you yield?” </span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Ralfil’s eyes widened at this question, but he saw Todd’s face and knew that he would have to fight even harder if the Phanpys indicated otherwise. It was going to be difficult. He was getting so tired even with the adrenaline rush that a battle brings on.</span></span></div>

<br />
<b>Ralfil</b> ~ The battle was getting intense and two particular Pokemon were bearing the brunt of it. Ralfil having been fighting the longest had taken a fair few attacks leaving him bruised and aching, particularly his jaw from the repeated Bite attacks. On the other side of the field there was the Phanpy one you felt especially sorry for despite the situation. Lying in the sands taking soft gasping breathes it looked a pitiful sight; it had taken too much damage and could hardly move. It tried to stand but slumped back into the hot sands giving a soft sigh almost resigning itself to its fate. The battle had most definitely swung in your favour and both Phanpy knew this. Sandshrew looked disheartened by the injuries sustained by all in the battle and knowing that it helped cause it. It looked sorrowfully at the downed Phanpy, its friend, before tearing its gaze away ashamed to have caused such pain.<br />
<br />
You sensibly want the battle to end sooner rather than later, not wanting Ralfil to pass out from the culmination of his injuries. You figure you’d try an alternate method, one that require no further pain should it succeed. Impassionedly you tell Tom you want to cause no more hurt and pain to the Phanpy and he looks at you taken aback. Turning to face the scene before him he could see why. Sandshrew was looking sorrowful over its actions, one Phanpy was too injured to continue and another was limping after the vicious Bite attack Ralfil had given. Looking to his partners Pokemon he could see that he was suffering too and nodded at you in agreement; although they had seriously hurt Lumps he would be no better to do the same to them.<br />
<br />
Walking further onto the battlefield Ralfil looking worriedly your way you ask in a loud and bold voice if the Phanpys yield, offering them a chance to surrender rather than lose the battle. Both elephants look over to you in confusion before the healthier one growled insulted by the offer. Sandshrew saw hesitance in the injured Phanpy’s eyes and slowly approached it. It looked towards it friend with mixed emotions. Sandshrew pleaded with it to stop fighting, it pointed towards Tom and spoke in its own language. Ralfil translated a little to you but from its body language and emotion you could guess at what it was saying. It said that Tom was not a bad person and it had been captured fairly. It had fought Numel with pride and honour and lost and that made it no weaker. To attack Numel that was already tired and injured was unfair and this whole battle had started because of that. Its eyes misted with tears as it sat down and held its hands out wide. It said that it didn’t want to fight and only did so at the order of his new trainer. It wanted to cause no more pain to its friends and yes they would still be friends in its eyes. It knew that things couldn’t go back to the way they were before but they could move on from this and be stronger. They would always be friends no matter what happened or how far apart they were. It sniffed and wiped at its tears “Please stop fighting, I won’t fight anymore” it whispered as the Phanpy sat listening, tears in its own eyes that were streaming down its face. It nodded and smiled at Sandshrew before holding out its trunk. Sandshrew wiped its tears away and smiled the first sign of happiness shown and shook its trunk before hugging the little elephant tenderly. <br />
<br />
Tom beamed at the two Pokemon as the made up and smile at you happy that you had helped them get to this point. Ralfil looked relieved if a little disappointed that the battle was already over. The other Phanpy however had heard the plea of its friend and witnessed its family forgive it and seethed. How could it forgive so easily? That Sandshrew had been tainted by a trainer and was no longer a friend. It looked at its family and snorted disgusted that it gave up rather than continue to fight. It suddenly charged forwards towards its own kin as Ralfil looked on not fast enough to stop it. Sandshrew and Phanpy broke apart to see the elephant angrily charging towards them. Sandshrew begged it stop before trying to move its friend. Phanpy ran as fast as it could with a limp and leapt forth with a <b>Tackle</b> one that hit Sandshrew as it protected its friend throwing it back into the sands. Phanpy cried as its friend was struck and could only look on as its kin leapt up again and <b>Tackled</b> Sandshrew once more whilst it was pinned beneath it making it cough and hold its abdomen. Tom cried out for its Pokemon looking horrified as Phanpy continued to assault Sandshrew.<br />
<br />
Though your plan had worked the battle was still not over and if you did not act fast Sandshrew would pay the price. </span></span></div>

<b>Concore</b> ~</span> <i>I will RP all attacks of both Pokemon, please don’t start doing it yourself as it falls into self-updating.</i><br />
<br />
<span style="color: lemonchiffon">Your initial confidence at the type advantage you had disappears rather quickly as you see how the little scorpion battles. It was speedy and full of tricks but you should expect no less from a Pokemon with a trainer as mysterious and dastardly as it had. A flicker of panic runs through you and you worry if you’ve bitten off more than you can chew. This probably wasn’t the best idea for your first ever battle, facing off against a much more experienced trainer and one that would no doubt use every dirty trick possible to win. Spector was holding his arm, smarting from the Bite attack and was also sharing your concerns but on the outside appeared calm and collected, ready to strike back. Spector was limited to only two attacks but you’d both have to make the best of what was available. <br />
<br />
With orders to give Skorupi a good Pounding Spector leapt forward slamming his fist onto the tiny scorpions head. The force was impressive but Skorupi remained asleep. It suddenly lets loose a loud <b>Snore</b> that knocks Spector back on his butt holding his ears from the loud noise. Picking himself back up he <b>Pound</b>ed Skorupi again knocking it onto its side but still asleep. Acting quickly Spector threw a last <b>Pound</b> that rolled Skorupi over further onto its back. Skorupi was jolted from its sleep by the last strike and winced as it stood back up, the bruises from the repeated attacks only just being felt. It remembered faintly the last order and with Spector within close reach fired a slew of <b>Pin Missles</b> that struck your Drowsee hard and making him cry out stumbling back over to you. He pulls at the barbs stuck in his skin wincing at everyone that he removed.<br />
<br />
The man grinned at the pain your Drowsee endured and Skorupi despite its own pain grinned back too.<br />
<br />
“You made a grave mistake coming here today boy, not only will your Pokemon pay but you and the little girl will suffer too,” he said leering at Caitlin who hid behind you unnerved by his stare, her eyes wandering over to Crystal who shot a dirty look at the retched man.</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">Apologies, I wanted to try and get the character's reactions to each of the attacks, as they were happening. <br />
<br />
<span style="color: LemonChiffon">Verne gasped as he saw the pin missile flew into his friend straight on, he was ready to run over and help him out, but he thought against it, doing so would undermine the tough façade they were putting on to somewhat calm Cailtin, as well as destroy Spector’s pride, “Shake it off buddy, we still need you!” He shouted, trying to fire up Spector.<br />
<br />
He watched the Drowzee wince as he plucked out each one of the remaining barbs shot in his arm, Skorupi and his owner seemed to be revelling in the pain they’ve inflicted. “Best not to barrage Spector with another order of physical attacks, it’s just going to put him in more pain” Verne contemplated, “This just is isn’t working, with the way it’s going, Spectors going down before Skorupi does, we need to something new” He had an idea, but in the current situation, an idea was good enough. Only guessing that it would work, he beckoned Spector over, “Spector your doing great, <b>Hypnotise</b> it again, make sure its asleep, but this time try and read what it’s dreaming, get inside it’s head and destroy it there!”(<b>Dream Eater</b>).</span></span><br />

<br />
<b>Concore</b> ~</span> The best way is to do what I do when RPing, recap what happened in your last update in your own words then you can add your reactions.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: lemonchiffon">Spector was not amused by the acupuncture treatment he received, pulling at each and every needle wincing at the pain as they were removed. You were eager to step in to protect your partner but at the risk of injuring yourself, Spector wouldn’t want that. You decide its best not to have Spector go all out with another barrage of attacks, it would only wear the Drowsee down further. Analysing the situation and the health differences between both Pokemon by the way they held themselves you could see that Spector was suffering more. He would probably be the first to fall if you didn’t plan this carefully. But what could you do that was different, Spector only had two moves to utilise, or did he? With an idea brewing you decide to go with it, what other choice did you have? Spector looked at you expectantly not wanting to stay motionless for too long lest Skorupi attack again. <br />
<br />
With orders in place and a new attack to try out Spector seemed to perk up and readied himself. Skorupi noticed the change in attitude and frowned, it was supposed to have the upper hand why did Spector look so confident? The man hadn’t noticed the change and ordered his bug to attack, and attack it did. It moved forward before fading away ands Spector had a momentary flash of panic across his face which changed to shock as the bug reappeared slamming into him with its <b>Faint Attack</b> doing some very nasty damage. Spector struggled to get up and Skorupi laughed at its struggle leering down at him. With a perfect opportunity Spector still lying on the floor stared right at it and used his <b>Hypnosis</b>, the light pinks waves hitting Skorupi right in the face. Its trainer growled in annoyance at watching his Pokemon fall asleep again.<br />
<br />
Spector slowly sat up looking about ready to pass out with the pain and beg him to try his new attack. Nodding he concentrated on Skorupi and saw deep into its dreams, it was dreaming about beating up baby Pokemon; what a sick creature. In the dream Drowsee appeared and the babies evolved and ganged up on the frightened Skorupi beating it to a bloody pulp. Drowsee grinned and pink energy crossed between their heads and he felt immensely better already. Skorupi’s trainer yelled at his Pokemon seeing it writhe in pain from an unseen nightmare losing health from the super effective attack. As Drowsee finished his meal he stood back up feeling much healthier and ready to finish off the Skorupi who was waking up shaking in pain.<br />
<br />
“Stupid creature, stupid Drowsee. We’ll make you all pay for this,” the man said almost sensing defeat around the corner. “Skorupi, attack the boy and girl, kill them both!” he screamed as his Pokemon got back to his feet, bloody murder in its eyes, but now the targets were you and Caitlin. </span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange"><b><u>Desert of Illusion</u></b> (Please reply in <b>darkorange</b>) </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange"><b>Ralfil</b> ~ The battle was getting intense and two particular Pokemon were bearing the brunt of it. Ralfil having been fighting the longest had taken a fair few attacks leaving him bruised and aching, particularly his jaw from the repeated Bite attacks. On the other side of the field there was the Phanpy one you felt especially sorry for despite the situation. Lying in the sands taking soft gasping breathes it looked a pitiful sight; it had taken too much damage and could hardly move. It tried to stand but slumped back into the hot sands giving a soft sigh almost resigning itself to its fate. The battle had most definitely swung in your favour and both Phanpy knew this. Sandshrew looked disheartened by the injuries sustained by all in the battle and knowing that it helped cause it. It looked sorrowfully at the downed Phanpy, its friend, before tearing its gaze away ashamed to have caused such pain.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">You sensibly want the battle to end sooner rather than later, not wanting Ralfil to pass out from the culmination of his injuries. You figure you’d try an alternate method, one that require no further pain should it succeed. Impassionedly you tell Tom you want to cause no more hurt and pain to the Phanpy and he looks at you taken aback. Turning to face the scene before him he could see why. Sandshrew was looking sorrowful over its actions, one Phanpy was too injured to continue and another was limping after the vicious Bite attack Ralfil had given. Looking to his partners Pokemon he could see that he was suffering too and nodded at you in agreement; although they had seriously hurt Lumps he would be no better to do the same to them.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Walking further onto the battlefield Ralfil looking worriedly your way you ask in a loud and bold voice if the Phanpys yield, offering them a chance to surrender rather than lose the battle. Both elephants look over to you in confusion before the healthier one growled insulted by the offer. Sandshrew saw hesitance in the injured Phanpy’s eyes and slowly approached it. It looked towards it friend with mixed emotions. Sandshrew pleaded with it to stop fighting, it pointed towards Tom and spoke in its own language. Ralfil translated a little to you but from its body language and emotion you could guess at what it was saying. It said that Tom was not a bad person and it had been captured fairly. It had fought Numel with pride and honour and lost and that made it no weaker. To attack Numel that was already tired and injured was unfair and this whole battle had started because of that. Its eyes misted with tears as it sat down and held its hands out wide. It said that it didn’t want to fight and only did so at the order of his new trainer. It wanted to cause no more pain to its friends and yes they would still be friends in its eyes. It knew that things couldn’t go back to the way they were before but they could move on from this and be stronger. They would always be friends no matter what happened or how far apart they were. It sniffed and wiped at its tears “Please stop fighting, I won’t fight anymore” it whispered as the Phanpy sat listening, tears in its own eyes that were streaming down its face. It nodded and smiled at Sandshrew before holding out its trunk. Sandshrew wiped its tears away and smiled the first sign of happiness shown and shook its trunk before hugging the little elephant tenderly. </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Tom beamed at the two Pokemon as the made up and smile at you happy that you had helped them get to this point. Ralfil looked relieved if a little disappointed that the battle was already over. The other Phanpy however had heard the plea of its friend and witnessed its family forgive it and seethed. How could it forgive so easily? That Sandshrew had been tainted by a trainer and was no longer a friend. It looked at its family and snorted disgusted that it gave up rather than continue to fight. It suddenly charged forwards towards its own kin as Ralfil looked on not fast enough to stop it. Sandshrew and Phanpy broke apart to see the elephant angrily charging towards them. Sandshrew begged it stop before trying to move its friend. Phanpy ran as fast as it could with a limp and leapt forth with a <b>Tackle</b> one that hit Sandshrew as it protected its friend throwing it back into the sands. Phanpy cried as its friend was struck and could only look on as its kin leapt up again and <b>Tackled</b> Sandshrew once more whilst it was pinned beneath it making it cough and hold its abdomen. Tom cried out for its Pokemon looking horrified as Phanpy continued to assault Sandshrew.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Though your plan had worked the battle was still not over and if you did not act fast Sandshrew would pay the price. </span></span>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Todd knew he had to act quickly or. He suddenly remembered a <span style="color: silver"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange"><span style="color: silver"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana'"><span style="color: darkorange"><a href="http://bmgf.bulbagarden.net/showpost.php?p=649076&amp;postcount=14" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fbmgf.bulbagarden.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D649076%26postcount%3D14&amp;hash=60a085dc05a5d978f9fa59010b7d0ce3" rel="nofollow noopener">Pika Plushie</a></span> </span></span></span></span></span></span>he had gotten at a Halloween party a while back. Rummaging through his bag, worried that Sandshrew would be hurt worse than before, he found it and pulled it out. It would teach a paralyzing move called Voodoo Bugaloo to the first Pokémon that hugged it. He had been saving this for some other time, but right now it seemed there was a great deal of need for it. The Phanpy was attacking Sandshrew and Ralfil needed to stop it before too much damage was done. Todd tossed the Pika Plushie to Ralfil yelling, “Catch!” The Trapinch jumped and caught the red-eyed plushie in his jaws, biting down with the equivalent of a hug. As sudden knowledge of a new attack flowed into him, Todd shouted, pointing at the Phanpy attacking Sandshrew, “Now use Voodoo Bugaloo on that Phanpy and follow it up with another Bite!” </span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Ralfil dropped the plushie in the sand (they could pick it up after the battle) and readied himself. He was determined to stop the awful treatment that the Phanpy was giving Sandshrew. At least he still got to continue to battle. Disappointment at the ending of the battle vanished as the Ant Pit Pokémon now began to focus its newfound Psychic move on the unforgiving Phanpy.</span></span></div>

<b>Ralfil</b> ~ As Sandshrew took a beating from its old friend you search your bags for something, anything that could help. You remember a certain doll you received from a party recently that may help and hastily try to find it. Finally finding it you pull it free looking to see that Sandshrew was holding its paws across its body as Phanpy charged towards it once more. Tom was begging it to move, attack do anything just not get hurt. Throwing the Pika Plush to Ralfil you wince as he catches it in his jaws and only hope he didn’t damage it. With the Plush in his jaws his eyes widened as information travelled into his mind weaving the tendrils of a new move into his DNA. With the new attack imbedded in his mind you shout out for him to use it followed by what you hope is a finishing blow.<br />
<br />
Ralfil concentrated hard used hidden Psychic abilities to form a hazy Voodoo Doll and as a small glowing pink pin appeared he rammed it into the doll’s abdomen. You look up to see Phanpy stop and fall to the sands before it can reach Sandshrew a look of shock on its face over it predicament. Ralfil ran over to it and leapt forth chomping down on its side causing it cry out and small lines of blood drawn from the wound created. Phanpy was panting hard in pain and its eyes seemed glazed over as it neared its limit but it hung on with all it remaining strength. Ralfil looked worried as Phanpy started to get feeling back in its body and began to slowly move. Unable to hold on any longer with his jaw in agony he slid off and looked back at you, sorry to have let you down. Phanpy just managed to get back to its feet, its eyes locked on Sandshrew when the small mouse narrowed its gaze angrily and throw a vicious <b>Scratch</b> attack across its face dropping it to the floor as dead weight. <b>Level up for Ralfil</b>.<br />
<br />
You sigh in relief and move over to assess Ralfil’s injuries. Tom had ran over to Sandshrew and was hugging it hard the mouse seemingly a little more comfortable in his grasp, looking back at the bloodied Phanpy with a blank gaze. Releasing it Tom bent down to the still conscious Phanpy who was looking down to its family with concern.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry all of this happened Phanpy. I didn’t mean to rob you of your friend.” He said impassionedly and Phanpy nodded already understanding from Sandshrew’s speech earlier. “I won’t be responsible for separating friends again,” he says pulling a Pokeball from his bag. “Travel with Sandshrew, Lumps and I, there’s always room for more friends on my team,” he asked and Sandshrew’s eyes widen shining with happiness and it looked to its friend silently begging it to join them.<br />
<br />
It seems that Tom had taken your words to heart, and with the one Phanpy left were you going to follow suit, even with its nasty temperament?</span></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Todd sighed as he saw the Sandshrew Scratch his old friend. Doing something like that had to hurt him emotionally. It was good that Ralfil had leveled up, and he was relieved that Tom had a Pokéball to take one of the Phanpys in. He looked at the more aggressive one, who it now seemed wouldn’t have its friend or family any more. Compassion filled his heart as he realized that, no matter what, the Phanpy’s life would never be the same. While Tom spoke with the first Phanpy, Todd approached the second. He looked down at it and said, “I realize that you are angry. You have just lost a battle as well as your friend. However, your determination was something that could not have been easily gained. You fought well.” At this Todd pulled out his Heavy Ball. “I would be honored if you would join my team.” Todd then held out the Heavy Ball in offering.</span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Ralfil, very tired, walked over to the fallen plushie and slumped in the sand. The Trapinch had leveled up, but that didn’t change how hard the battle had been. It was also exhausting having used a brand new move that he did not have much experience with. When Todd offered the Phanpy a place on their team, The Ant Pit Pokémon glanced at it, trying to determine its feelings on the matter.</span></span></div>

<b>Ralfil</b> ~ You were certainly glad that Ralfil wasn’t in the position that Sandshrew found itself in, attacking a friend to protect a stranger. However Phanpy went down and didn’t stir, the only movement was its chest rising and falling. You watched as Tom approached his newest Pokemon embracing it before offering the Phanpy that had reconciled its friendship with Sandshrew a place on his team. Drawing your attention back to the other Phanpy you sigh, the tiny elephant looked so pitiful, a darker shade of blue and black from the bruises it sustained along with the hefty bite and scratch marks along its skin. You were not willing to leave it there injured and defenceless and approach it, an offer in mind. It stirred slightly as you bent down praising on its determination and fortitude and tell it that you’d be honoured to have it on your team. Phanpy stared hard at you now conscious enough to understand your words and you cannot read its emotions; its face was a blank slate. <br />
<br />
Leaving the Heavy Ball on the ground you look back over to Tom to see his Phanpy touch the offered Pokeball with its snout before it was absorbed. Tom picked up the ball housing his new team-mate and Sandshrew launched itself at his legs hugging them tight, overjoyed and thankful to have its friend travelling with them. Tom grinned happy to have the foundations of their bond strengthening and hugged the mouse Pokemon back. He nodded over to you and carrying his injured Sandshrew he walked over to you.<br />
<br />
Hearing a grunt coming from Phanpy’s direction you turn to see it stare angrily at Tom before directing its hatred towards you. You feel you skin prickle at the rage and sadness in its eyes like it blamed you for everything. It swiped at the ball with its trunk with what energy it had left knocking it back towards you. You sigh but hear Phanpy gasp and its eye widen in shock as it was turned into red energy and absorbed inside, it must have hit the capture button! The ball wiggled back and forth and you wondered if it would break free but after a few moments the ball ‘dinged’ and sat still. Well, you now had a <b>Level 06, Male Phanpy</b> whether he wanted to join you or not. <br />
<br />
“Well we both did as promised, although Phanpy didn’t seem happy to join you, that’s unfortunate,” Tom said holding onto Sandshrew tight. “Thank you so much for your help today, you helped me to make a new friend, gain Sandy’s trust and got me out of that sticky situation.” He said holding out his hand to shake and you grasp it. “I’ve been thinking and I’ve decided to train ground Pokemon, with the 3 I have now they’ll grow stronger with me I promise and I’ll make them proud to be my Pokemon like your Trapinch is with you,” he said as Ralfil smiled tiredly up at you. “Its not much, but please take this as a token of thanks” he finishes as he hands you a Chesto and Pecha berries. <br />
<br />
“I hope to see you again sometime Todd, next time we’ll have to battle each other,” he said walking off into the distance waving at you with Sandy giving you a small wave too.<br />
<br />
With Tom gone you walk back through the desert, it was probably a good idea to get your Pokemon healed, you have a lot of bonding with your new Phanpy before he’ll be happy with the idea of being your newest partner.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange"><b>Ralfil</b> ~ You were certainly glad that Ralfil wasn’t in the position that Sandshrew found itself in, attacking a friend to protect a stranger. However Phanpy went down and didn’t stir, the only movement was its chest rising and falling. You watched as Tom approached his newest Pokemon embracing it before offering the Phanpy that had reconciled its friendship with Sandshrew a place on his team. Drawing your attention back to the other Phanpy you sigh, the tiny elephant looked so pitiful, a darker shade of blue and black from the bruises it sustained along with the hefty bite and scratch marks along its skin. You were not willing to leave it there injured and defenceless and approach it, an offer in mind. It stirred slightly as you bent down praising on its determination and fortitude and tell it that you’d be honoured to have it on your team. Phanpy stared hard at you now conscious enough to understand your words and you cannot read its emotions; its face was a blank slate. </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Leaving the Heavy Ball on the ground you look back over to Tom to see his Phanpy touch the offered Pokeball with its snout before it was absorbed. Tom picked up the ball housing his new team-mate and Sandshrew launched itself at his legs hugging them tight, overjoyed and thankful to have its friend travelling with them. Tom grinned happy to have the foundations of their bond strengthening and hugged the mouse Pokemon back. He nodded over to you and carrying his injured Sandshrew he walked over to you.</span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Todd felt worried when the Phanpy tried to hit the ball away, but only somewhat relieved when it accidentally captured itself. He turned to Tom and listened with a smile on his face, thinking, “He’ll make a great trainer.” Putting the berries in his bag with one hand, he waved back with the other as Tom left and turned back to the Heavy ball. Crouching, he picked it up like a primed grenade. He spoke to it, addressing the Phanpy inside, “You may not like this right now, but change happens in everyone’s life. You are on my team now.” He paused a moment to think. “I’ll call you Liffnarl. It is a fitting name, and you are too important for me to refer to you only as Phanpy.” He then shrunk the Pokéball and put it on his belt next to Ralfil’s. with that taken care of, he went over to Ralfil and knelt by the Trapinch. He removed the Ant Pit Pokémon’s Pokéball from his belt and said, “You fought well Ralfil. I’m proud of you. Would you like to rest in your Pokéball or on my head?” </span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Ralfil glanced up at his trainer, glad that he had gained more respect from his trainer. He looked at the Pokéball. Some Pokémon stayed out of their Pokéballs all the time, but the Trapinch knew that was stupid. He reached his head up and touched the Pokéball, glowing red and entering it with a smile.</span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">Todd returned the Ant Pit Pokémon to his belt and picked up the now battered plushie. He inspected it, making sure it was not overly damaged, and returned it to his bag. He then surveyed the surrounding desert. It looked different somehow after the battle. He realized that it was because it had showed him some of what the world had in store for him and held a promise of more to come. A poem came to mind on the spot,</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">While we traverse this world</span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">We make friends out of enemies.</span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">So we can only ask of the Pokéball hurled</span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">That our new friends we will please.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">It was shorter than his earlier one, but just as appropriate. Todd now strode forward again, in search of new adventures.</span></span></div>

A snow-capped mountain range where many wild Pokémon reside. Many old mines litter the mountainside from the days when silver was heavily mined, but due to the often below zero temperatures, they were eventually abandoned. Rumor has it however, that there are still many valuable ores hidden within the mountains.</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: lightsteelblue"> <span style="font-size: 9px">&quot;Too many freakin’ pages...&quot; <br />
<br />
The sixteen year old murmured, hunched over as he sat on a wooden bench of a large modern train station, flipping through a thick, black guide book titled <i>Super Awesome Adventure Guide 2!</i> engraved into the front of the book in gold text. The green eyed boy continued fingering the pages, reading bits and pieces of info and then turning to another page, almost as if he was flicking through channels on a TV. The noise of hundreds of people in movement and the trains coming and going filled his ears, but it did not break his concentration from the pages of the informative scriptures laid before him. Until now. <br />
<br />
“My word! Why is that little boy carrying his excrement in a bucket?”<br />
<br />
Roy, hearing the words “little boy” uttered in his presence, dropped the guide book down on the floor, next to his “bucket of excrement”, and without hesitation, his eyes darted to the source of his new found vexation. <br />
<br />
The source appeared to be an elderly man, skinny as a tooth pick and dressed in luxurious garments consisting of silks and colored in lavender. He was holding the hand of what most would think to be his wife, who appeared in contrast to her husband, though dressed in the same fashion as her consort and appearing very old, was round in shape and rather chunky. Both looking down with faces of disgust and pity and waving their hands as if fanning away fumes, at the small statured teen currently sitting with a look of annoyance spread across his face and a large, metal bucket full of purple sludge nestled near his feet. <br />
<br />
“Shouldn’t you be keeping your fucking Wailord in a Pokeball!? Trains have to get through you know, guy?” Roy sniped at the pair loudly, with some on goers looking at the scene with confusion, while others with concealed laughter on their faces, as Roy stood up and looked into the old man’s eyes menacingly. <br />
<br />
“Well... I never!” The old man stammered, and with haste, both the old man and his “Wailord” scurried off, obviously embarrassed and astonished from the once thought poor little boy . Leaving Roy with a impish grin forming from ear to ear and a sense of self-satisfaction washed over his once wrath induced demeanor. He began to bend over for the large black book currently residing on the floor, next to his black sneakers and a now stirring pile of purple goo, solidifying itself into a form outside of top the bucket. <br />
<br />
“Grimer... Mer?” the newly formed slime pile spouted out of its ever gapping mouth. Its glazed and blank eyes peered out towards his trainer, most likely awoken by Roy’s recent standoff. <br />
<br />
“Well! Good mornin’ sunshine!” Roy beamed sarcastically, forgetting about the book and began to reach for the Pokeball attached to his belt. Presenting the Pokeball to his Grimer and cracking a cheesy smile, negotiations began. “Too noisy for you guy? How about you move your ass into this ball here? It would be a lot less noisy, don’t ya think?” <br />
<br />
Sadly, Roy’s “professional” negotiation skills didn’t take, as the Grimer was unresponsive and most likely unimpressed. The pile of sentient goo assumed his usual state once more, a thick purple liquid filling a bucket. <br />
<br />
“I oughta... Roy murmured, as anger built up inside his gut once more, but was replaced with a heavy sigh. Roy had encountered this time after time. He had no idea why the sludge-like mass loved that damn bucket so much, but over the course of the couple of weeks they had been paired together, he could still not get the lazy Pokemon into his Pokeball. Reading up on it on some training guide he “picked up” before he started his journey, Roy’s interpretation was that his old tricks of threatening and physical discipline wouldn’t work, nor would it help the “trainer-Pokemon connection” the book continued to repeat almost on every page. Also forcing an action not comfortable with a Pokemon would wreck the bond as well, so forcing the Pokeball on Grimer was out of the question. Maybe if he read past 10 pages he would have hit the threatening tactics chapter...<br />
<br />
Anyways, after Roy’s disappointing defeat, Roy put away the Pokeball he tried to convince the bucket monster into, picked up the guide book of the tile floor and began flicking through the pages again, trying to find a suitable place to start his journey... <br />
<br />
“What’s this?” After mere seconds of thumbing through the pages, a few words caught his eye. “Rumor has it however, that there are still many valuable ores...” Roy repeated quietly to himself, a thought of making a quick buck out of some ores intrigued him, as anything screaming profit does. Reading further, he realized the location was called Silverton Mountain (the name might as well read Money Mountain), which only increased his fascination. It also mentioned the area having many wild Pokemon to possibly aid his career as a trainer. Though one thing bugged him about the whole place. It was cold. Back in the slums, they had winters too. Roy remembers hating them. Though Roy could afford proper attire now for such conditions, he really didn’t want to spend the cash unless he was guaranteed to strike some kind of profitt there. Was the cold really... Suddenly jubilation set in. A break through out of nowhere. <br />
<br />
<br />
“Cold...” Roy mumbled in awe. His head turning in the direction of his little bucket friend, a smile of mischievous nature was drawn upon Roy’s visage. And with that, an idea was set in motion. <br />
***<br />
<br />
<br />
“Damn, I didn’t know it would be this far or this cold.” <br />
<br />
Roy stepped out onto the mountain path (decked out in a light black jacket most would of used for late fall and some black snow pants with a pair of snow boots that were used and on sale). He put down the goo burden in a bucket that he carried the ENTIRE way (from the train’s scheduled stop to the start of the path), onto the light snow that covered the path at this point. He could feel the purple slime jiggling with cold already... <br />
<br />
“Grimer? Grimer!” The purple goop appeared out of the top of the bucket as fast as Roy put him down. His... appendages that resembled “arms” were wrapped around his sludge-like body, and he began shaking vigorously, looking upon Roy with distress. <br />
<br />
“Ya, I picked this place to start out our journey. Pretty nice, don’t ya think, guy?” Roy spoke smugly, grabbing the Pokeball attached to his belt and beginning to roll it around in one hand, staring almost hypnotically at it, taunting the shivering pile of goo before him. “I hope your not cold, they didn't have any bucket warmers or...” Roy’s little sarcastic tirade was interrupted by a feeling in his right leg. Looking down to investigate, what he saw touched him in many ways. <br />
<br />
The cold slime ball had his appendages around Roy’s leg, hugging Roy for warmth, maybe for mercy, as Grimer’s eyes were closed in anguish. The Pokemon’s body began shaking against Roy’s leg because of the cold. Roy’s feelings were a mix. At first disgust, for it was a large blob of sludge gripping his leg. Then surprise, as this was one of the few times Roy has ever seen the bucket monster out of its shell. But after all that, Roy felt something he couldn’t ever describe. It was not pity, nor was it satisfaction, but a feeling he had never felt or known in the harsh world of the slums. What ever it maybe, a smile was produced on Roy’s lips. <br />
<br />
“Stay warm, little guy.” And with those words, he returned his cold Pokemon into his Pokeball for the first time. Picking up the bucket, Roy initially wanted to throw the hunk of metal away. But instead, tied the handle to his bag. And with that, he started on the path, letting the previous moment warm him through the unforgiving, cold snow. </span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: gold">Zack was sitting down on a park bench looking over a map of places that were suggested for beggining trainers to travel to. &quot;Man, I can't decide where to go. What do you think Wipeout?&quot; Asked Zack as he handed the map over to his faithful monkey-like companion Chimchar. Wipeout the Chimchar started looking over the map. He pointed to a watery place and started shaking it's head. Zack understood and said &quot;Don't worry Wipeout we won't go to any place with water.&quot;<br />
<br />
After an hour of mulling it over they both decided that they would go to an ancient tomb supposedly filled with treasure. They travelled to the region the Ancient Tomb was in and they tried to find a way to travel there because supposedly there was no known way to get to the Ancient Tomb directly but they didn't believe that and tried everywhere. After a while they came to a train station and Zack called his Chimchar back into it's pokeball. He walked up to the ticket booth and asked &quot;Can I get a ticket to travel somewhere near the Ancient Tomb.&quot; The Clerk shook his head with a stern face and said &quot;Sorry kid, there's no way to get to there from this station.&quot; <br />
<br />
Zack walked away wondering what to do when he realized what the clerk just called him. &quot;Hey you jerk I'm not a kid, i'm 14!&quot; He yelled back at the clerk but then he looked and he realized nobody was there anymore. He walked back over to the desk and jumped back as a gastly appeared. The gastly was ready to attack him when a Pokemon Ranger appeared and pulled out his styler. The ranger caught the gastly in no more than 5 seconds. The ranger released the gastly and let it go on it's way. The ranger then said &quot;are you okay kid?&quot; &quot;How many times do I have to say I'm not a kid! I am 14!&quot; Exclaimed Zack. After Zack got over his anger he told the ranger what happened and the ranger said &quot;If you want to head to the Ancient Tomb I was about to head over that way myself so I can get my partner Staraptor to drop you off on the way. But be warned, that tomb is a dangerous place. To get out you must find an escape rope inside and an ancient curse prevents you from bringing an escape rope inside beforehand.&quot; <br />
<br />
Zack then said &quot;Thanks a bunch dude. I read up on the temple and the curse so you don't have to tell me twice. By the way do you know what's in the tomb?&quot; The ranger replied &quot;Sorry but, I have no idea. If you're actually planning to go in there you would be the first in 10 years to try to go in and get out alive. You better be...... nevermind, I can see in your eyes that you are determined beyond words. I can take you there as soon as I make sure nothing else is going on.&quot; The ranger left Zack to plan his strategy for getting out of that tomb with the treasure of the many kings who were kept inside. The only thing that would ever creep Zack out would be if he actually found the departed kings decayed bodys. The ranger came back a few minutes later and asked Zack &quot;Do you have everything you need for the temple because you need to remember to find some kind of escape rope to get out when things go bad. There may even be an insanely powerful pokemon guardingthe treasure if there is any. I hope you succeed because I don't want your death on my concience.&quot; Zack replied by saying &quot; You don't have to worry! My Chimchar and I are both ready for this!&quot;<br />
<br />
The ranger told his Staraptor where to go and got on. The Staraptor started building power and when it was ready it flew at top speed toward Zack and picked him up with it's claws. The Starapor flew for a few hours and finaly came to an old looking city. In the middle of the city was the Ancient Tomb. <br />
<br />
When the got to the Tomb the ranger wispered something into Staraptor's ear and in the next second Staraptor released it's claws while still high up in the air. &quot;Aaaaaaaaah&quot; Zack screamed as he was dropped above the tomb. Staraptor caught Zack right before he landed and let him slide off. &quot;Next time just set me down!&quot; Zack yelled angrily as the ranger laughed. The ranger started flying off as Zack released Wipeout. &quot;Alright Wipeout we're here.&quot; Zack stated as the duo stepped into the temple.</span></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: lemonchiffon">Kori had been putting foot to dirt road since day break. Waking up at the crack of dawn, Kori welcomed the fresh new day, the cool and crisp air, the dew covered grass, everything brought Kori the sweet, sweet promise of a new day. With a song in his head and a smile on his face, Kori pulled out his Pokeball and released the tiny chick Pokemon from inside. <br />
<br />
&quot;Torchic, chic, chic, chic!&quot; chirped the little orange bird as it happily flapped it's small wings as if to say good morning to Kori.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning to you too Torchic!&quot; smiled Kori. &quot;Breath it in cause this is what life is all about. Two buds out on the open road, not knowing whats ahead of us, making the best out of each day.&quot; he said. The little Torchic chirped in agreement when it's little stomach made a small squeaking sound. The Torchic looked down at it's stomach as if to quiet it's gut. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hehehe, sounds like your hungry little guy&quot; laughed Kori. The Torchic bowed it's head in a bit of embarrassment when suddenly an even louder grumbling, growling sound came from Kori's stomach. Kori looked down at his stomach as if to quiet his gut and and said &quot;Sounds like we both need a little breakfast, huh?&quot; Kori rummaged through his backpack and found a can of Vienna Sausages. The Torchic stared at the little can with his brows furrowed. Kori got the message immediately. &quot;Yeah, I know it isn't much but it's all we have right now. If you can wait a little longer though, I saw a sign down the road that said that there was a town just a little further up. A place called Mediville. I'm sure we can get some grub in there!&quot; said Kori. The Torchic chirped in agreement and flapped it's little wings over to it's master. Kori extended his hand over to the little bird and put him on his shoulder, Torchic taking up a comfortable position and enjoyed the ride. <br />
<br />
It didn't take long till Kori reached the entrance to the town. Turning to his partner, Kori petted his little Pokemon and said &quot;We're here buddy, now we can get some food and shut that beast in our stomachs up.&quot;cheerfully as he made his way into town. </span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><b>Re: The Arcane Realm - FB Training Zone</b><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><i>Good Evening folks, I'll be updating the three of you. The remaining eight trainers will be updated by either Arc Angel or Enchantress. Before I get on with the updates, allow me to post a little about myself as even if you've been following FB for a while, you probably won't know who I am. <br />
<br />
My name is LC (or Rob, if you'd prefer) and I've recently returned to FB after a (very) long time away. I originally joined FB back when it set up on UPN, probably around 2003. I stuck around for about two years and during that time I was a ZA in the old Mountain Zone, led by FB Admin Arnold. In those days FB had an awful lot of members and so the lengths of the roleplays we could do were quite restricted, so the new style longer replies are something I'll need to get used to- I've just spent around three hours writing these and they seem tiny one I've pasted them in and formatted them. Still, as you are her to learn, so I am to an extend, or at least to remember.<br />
<br />
As you probably already know, you are here in the Arcane Zone until you make your first Pokemon capture, at which point I shall release you into the wild world of Fizzy Bubbles' other zones. While you are here, please abide by the rules in the first post of this zone, and above all, enjoy yourselves. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them with your posts or just PM them to me.<br />
<br />
And now, on with the fun:</i></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: LightSteelBlue"><u>Silverton Ranges (Please reply in LightSteelBlue)</u><br />
Fuuten: Trudging along the snow covered path, bucket in one frostbitten hand, the other buried inside your black jacket; you can be forgiven for wondering why you decided to come to such a harsh environment for your very first adventure with Grimer. Of course, Grimer himself is tucked away happily now inside a Pokéball, leaving you to tackle the inclement conditions alone. As you head on up the path it begins to get steeper and you begin to climb up towards the Mountains ahead, looking around to survey your surroundings.<br />
<br />
With the snow still falling overhead, visibility is severely limited and what Pokémon there would normally be around seem to have taken shelter elsewhere to avoid the rapidly falling temperatures. You can see a little way further up the past as it slopes ever further upwards, and with a deep breath, you draw your clothes around you and, with the bucket clunking along, increase the pace of your walking, hoping to get to higher ground<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
After a good hour or so of trudging up a seemingly never ending path in increasingly bitter conditions, you can now look down and see the mountain stretching down below you, seemingly endlessly into the mist, high enough up now not see the ground . At your own level though, things are starting to get a bit more interesting, with the debris from a Mine spread along the side of the path, small piles of rocks, broken pick-axes and helmets buried in the snow, looking slightly more recently discarded than those seen further down the mountain. Surprised to see the signs of activity, you consult your guidebook to the area, which confirms your suspicion:<br />
<br />
Silverton Mountains: Once these Mountains were heavily mined, but around twenty years ago the mining stopped completely after temperatures dropped considerably in the area. It is unknown what caused the sudden drop in temperatures, but rumours of the uncovering of an ancient Pokémon by over inquisitive miners are widespread in the area. With the Mines gone, the area is now rarely travelled and anyone wishing to explore the area is advised to take warm clothes and strong Pokémon.<br />
<br />
If the Mines closed 20 years ago, the debris around was very well preserved as it certainly didn’t look like that. With your interest piqued, you begin to follow the loose trail of mining equipment, deviating slightly from the beaten path, the signs of mining become a little denser, and you can see what looks like a light in the distance as you approach a crossroads. The crossroads presents you with a choice; follow on down the fork to the left where the equipment leads, or the right fork, which continues still further up the mountain, getting steeper as it goes. <br />
<br />
Which way will you go?<br />
</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: Gold"><u>Ancient Tomb (Please reply in Gold)</u><br />
Pokemonxd4<img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite8" alt=":D" title="Big Grin    :D" data-shortname=":D" />usting yourself off from the unorthodox drop off, you look up to see the Ancient Tomb in front of you, stretching out far to both sides, and the hairs on the back of your neck begin to stand up. The tomb is undoubtedly imposing but it is equally disturbing, and you feel uncomfortable even looking at it. Still, with faithful Wipeout by your side, you approach the Ziggurat, aiming towards the ornately runed gates. As you draw nearer, you can see that the gates are open, but yet things still feel unusual, as if the building itself is not keen to welcome visitors. Casting aside your doubts, you stride through the gates into the building itself, with Wipeout clinging to your right leg, looking slightly apprehensive about the forthcoming exploration.<br />
<br />
As you walk into the building, a thick layer of dust makes conditions underfoot spongy and you kick up a fair bit of dust as you take another step. Behind you, the door slams shut of its own accord with a deafening crash which causes both you and Chimchar to jump out of your skins. With the doors closed, you are trapped inside the labyrinth in very low light conditions, with the only sources of light being a few lightly burning flames in torches on the wall and of course Wipeout’s own tail flame. Looking around, you can see that you are in a reasonably tight corridor, the floor, as previously mentioned, is thick with dust, but the walls are of stone, encrusted with gems and designs which make it appear that a thousand eyes are staring at you out of the semi-darkness.<br />
<br />
Feeling mildly intimidated, Chimchar jumps into your arms to be closer to you, holding out his tail in front of the two of you to light your way as you begin to tread softly and slowly further into the Tomb, keeping a keen eye on the shadows surrounding the walls, looking for the slightest sign of movement. With nothing jumping out at you, the two of you feel a little more comfortable and begin to speed up a little as you head into the labyrinth itself, turning left and right through narrow identikit corridors.<br />
<br />
After a short while, you turn a corner into a room which looks different to those that came before. A reasonably large square room with a door in the middle of each side, so three doors in addition to the one you’ve just walked through. This room is considerably better lit than those that have come before, and you can make out that above each door is a gemstone of a different colour; a large emerald above the door to your left, with a ruby facing it on your right and directly before you a sapphire, which reflects a faint blue light from a flame. Chimchar looks from doorway to doorway and then looks at you, head leaning to one side. His question is clear:<br />
<br />
Which doorway will you follow?<br />
</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: LemonChiffon"><u>Mediville (Please reply in LemonChiffon)</u><br />
Kori Gotcha: Deciding, perhaps wisely, to venture to one of the less intimidating areas of the Arcane Zone, yourself and Torchic walk into Mediville, unnoticed in the bustling streets, looking for somewhere to eat. Walking down the cobbled streets, you can see a variety of shops to either side, selling a variety of uncooked foods and goods, as well as a Pokémart retailing a variety of goods. There are a few Pokémon around, but they seem to be already owned, helping out stallholders or simply strolling along with their trainers in the same way that you and Torchic are enjoying your morning walk.<br />
<br />
Just around the first corner, you spot a small restaurant serving human and Pokémon food. By this point, the two of you are beginning to get seriously hungry, so you decide to make a stop here for a meal. The two of you enter the restaurant, which is pleasantly decorated if a little dusty, and survey the scene. There are only two other customers in at the moment, a young couple sat in the far corner of the restaurant drinking Tea and eating biscuits while their Nidoran eat below the table. The pair don’t look up from their food as you walk in, but a waitress approaches you and shows you to a seat, handing you a menu at the same time. The waitress looks maybe only two years older than you, a plain looking girl in a cream apron, who smiles as you order a drink for yourself and Torchic.<br />
<br />
As the waitress returns to the bar to make your drinks, you peruse the menu and both yourself and Torchic peruse the menu, salivating at the selection of food on offer. Once your drinks are delivered, you select a meal which probably involves far too much fat, salt and all sorts of nutritional nasties, but the both of you are too hungry to mind, and that too arrives within a short period as the restaurant is quiet. When delivering your food, the Waitress stops to talk to you:<br />
<br />
“What brings you to Mediville then?” she asks, introducing herself as Kiera. You explain that you were passing by on the start of your adventure with Torchic, and she mentions that she also wishes to begin an adventure, having been given a Pokémon for her Birthday by her father, who had went travelling in his younger days. The two of you get talking for a while and Kiera pets Torchic, who seems rather keen on the attention, forgetting his empty stomach and full bowl of food to lap up the stroking and petting. <br />
<br />
“Why don’t we go and see if we can capture a Pokémon after I finish my shift? I get off in a few hours and I’d feel more comfortable having a go at making my first capture with a bit of assistance. Don’t worry if you’d rather go it alone, but if you would?”<br />
<br />
How will you answer?<br />

Pokemonxd4<img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite8" alt=":D" title="Big Grin    :D" data-shortname=":D" />usting yourself off from the unorthodox drop off, you look up to see the Ancient Tomb in front of you, stretching out far to both sides, and the hairs on the back of your neck begin to stand up. The tomb is undoubtedly imposing but it is equally disturbing, and you feel uncomfortable even looking at it. Still, with faithful Wipeout by your side, you approach the Ziggurat, aiming towards the ornately runed gates. As you draw nearer, you can see that the gates are open, but yet things still feel unusual, as if the building itself is not keen to welcome visitors. Casting aside your doubts, you stride through the gates into the building itself, with Wipeout clinging to your right leg, looking slightly apprehensive about the forthcoming exploration.<br />
<br />
As you walk into the building, a thick layer of dust makes conditions underfoot spongy and you kick up a fair bit of dust as you take another step. Behind you, the door slams shut of its own accord with a deafening crash which causes both you and Chimchar to jump out of your skins. With the doors closed, you are trapped inside the labyrinth in very low light conditions, with the only sources of light being a few lightly burning flames in torches on the wall and of course Wipeout’s own tail flame. Looking around, you can see that you are in a reasonably tight corridor, the floor, as previously mentioned, is thick with dust, but the walls are of stone, encrusted with gems and designs which make it appear that a thousand eyes are staring at you out of the semi-darkness.<br />
<br />
Feeling mildly intimidated, Chimchar jumps into your arms to be closer to you, holding out his tail in front of the two of you to light your way as you begin to tread softly and slowly further into the Tomb, keeping a keen eye on the shadows surrounding the walls, looking for the slightest sign of movement. With nothing jumping out at you, the two of you feel a little more comfortable and begin to speed up a little as you head into the labyrinth itself, turning left and right through narrow identikit corridors.<br />
<br />
After a short while, you turn a corner into a room which looks different to those that came before. A reasonably large square room with a door in the middle of each side, so three doors in addition to the one you’ve just walked through. This room is considerably better lit than those that have come before, and you can make out that above each door is a gemstone of a different colour; a large emerald above the door to your left, with a ruby facing it on your right and directly before you a sapphire, which reflects a faint blue light from a flame. Chimchar looks from doorway to doorway and then looks at you, head leaning to one side. His question is clear:<br />
<br />
Which doorway will you follow?<br />

</blockquote>cool update. I hope you like my replys as this adventure continues. also can you tell me what I need to work on if it isn't too much trouble.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: gold">Zack looked at the three doorways with different coloured gems and looked down at Wipeout who was still clinging to him but looking at him questioningly. Zack knew Wipeout wanted him to choose what door to go through. He looked over all three doors and started getting nervous. The three gems could mean types of pokemon that way, it could mean what pokemon type is good or badfor that doorway which made things a little complicated.<br />
<br />
Zack continued to ponder the meaning of the doors but Wipeout started shaking vigirously. Wipeout wanted to get out of there as soon as possible. Zack, who understood his partner finally decded. He then said &quot;Wipeout I want to go through the door with the saphire above it if you don't mind?&quot; Wipeout still shaking did not seem to care about what door to go through but, just wanted to get it over with. <br />
<br />
Zack walked slowly and carefully toward the saphire doorway holding Wipeout with it's tail pointed in front of Zack for sight. As he approached he grew hesitant wondering if this was a good idea or not. He had no idea what was lying behnd any of the doors but he had to go through one. If it was the wrong choice what would happen though? With all these thoughts in mind Zack continued to approach the door and as he apprached the flame of chimchars tail seemed to make the area around him glow blue as he entered the door.<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkorange">The sunlight shined bright in Ricks eyes as he stepped into what could only be thought of as the first day of the rest of his life. It would take a while to venture from his hometown, Viridian City, to the world of Fizzytopia, but that could only be seen as a good thing in Ricks eyes, as it gave him plenty of time to think over the various options for his starting adventure. Grabbing onto the railing, Rick glanced over the side of the ferry he was taking, and stared down at the waters bellow. He had been travelling for four days on the ship now, and from what the announcements were saying, it would only be a few hours before he would arrive in Fizzytopia, at which point he would go his separate ways with many of the passengers and find the location for his first adventure. The tension was getting to him; he had been waiting for such a chance for a long time. Glancing at the waters once more, he then turned and made his way down some of the ships narrow stairways, heading for his cabin at the bottom.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t the nicest place to stay for almost a week, but it did exactly what it needed to, but at the same time it did only what it needed to. There was a small bed against one of the tiny, sickly white walls of the cabin, with a single pillow and a mattress and cover. No bedposts. On the other side of the room, there was a plastic desk, a plastic chair, a small phone, and one of those tiny little hotel style fridge’s which you had to pay for use of. Strolling over to the desk, he slowly sat down, letting his previously windswept black hair fall back into what was generally its usual position during most times of the day, a heap of untidy mess. Grabbing a comb from the interior of his backpack, he slowly combed down all of the sticking up hairs to make it look fairly average. This was simply because Rick despised his hair getting in the way when he was reading, and combing it out the way seemed a simple method to stop such a problem.<br />
<br />
Reaching for his backpack once again, Rick placed his Guide to Fizzytopia down on the desk, and stared at it thoughtfully. On the front cover itself, Rick could see a variety of different places, including a picture of a cloud filled sky, a picture of a beautiful tropical beach, and a picture of a tribal village all of which arranged to show the best of the places they were advertising. Rick smiled and began to flick through his guide. He went through section by section, slowly ruling out different areas due to the fact that they were too far away, too hard for beginning trainers, or illogical like the Ocean of Mystery. After about an hour of looking through the individual guides, he narrowed it down to three options. The Graveyard, The Desert of Illusion and the Silverton Ranges. Scratching his head in puzzled ways, he reached for his belt, and slowly gripped the pokeball residing there. “Right then, looks like I’ll need a bit of help choosing. Come on out Belle.” He exclaimed to nobody in particular as he pressed the center button on the pokeball, a flashing red light spraying out of it instantly as the appearance of his starter Pokemon arrived.<br />
<br />
Quite an unorthodox starter Pokemon due to its tiny moveset and rarity, Ricks Combee happily flew out of the pokeball and fluttered her wings a bit, flying around the cabin in search of what Rick could only assume is honey. It seemed that since being captured, Combee still can’t get over the fact it’s a honeybee, and the Pokemon searches for it at any opportune moment. Rick reached out and grabbed the bee Pokemon, turning it around to face the guide. “Belle, I’m going to need your help choosing a suitable location to start our travel. I’ve narrowed the choices down to three, and decided that you probably deserved a say in it too.”<br />
<br />
“Bee, Com” The three heads of Belle replied as they stared down at the pages bookmarked by Rick. They glanced quickly at each of the locations, and then pointed with both wings at the Desert, flying around and chirping happily. Rick nodded, and although shocked at the Combees quick decision, he put his guide away in his bag, as well as the comb from earlier. Tidying his desk quickly, and putting all his possessions away, he left his room for what he assumed would be the last time, opening the cabin door and making his way back up to the top floor of the boat. Looking out from the front of the boat, Rick saw that they still had two or three hours to go, so sat down on the floor and began to play with his starter Pokemon to make the journey fly by.<br />
<br />
Eventually, the boat Rick was sitting on docked in Fizzytopia, and Rick stepped out onto the shores of adventure…or something like that. Looking around the area, he looked for any signposts at all regarding where the Desert existed. Returning Belle to her pokeball, Rick walked towards what appeared to be an information desk and began to speak to the woman that was sitting behind it. After a fairly short conversation, Rick gathered he wasn’t able to get any form of train to the area, and in fact, he would only be able to get there via walking or getting a taxi driver willing to go that far. Sighing, he walked towards the main road, and began to walk down it slowly, heading towards the place suggested by the book.<br />
<br />
*<br />
<br />
Rick stared slowly towards the horizon, his eyes attempting to see any sort of shapes or buildings in the distance. He saw none. Managing to reach the desert had been an easy task in the end compared to the actual journey across the desert. He’d been walking for a few days through the sands now, attempting to find some form of shelter in the huge empty wasteland. Grabbing his pokeball, he grabbed the ball attached to his belt, and pulled it out in front of him. Tapping the center of the pokeball, his partner emerged into the air in front of him, flapping her wings happily as she enters the area. Rick smiled to his partner slowly.<br />
<br />
“Well then, we’re here. What shall we do then?”</span></span></div>
