<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslateblue"><b><u>Dark Fire</u></b><br />
Having turned the tables around into a two-against-one situation, you're only more determined than ever to overcome this obstacle with your trusted teammates. Leaving her comrade spinning aside, the now mentally mute Drought blasts forth a raging <b>Flamethrower</b> from her mouth, but with a screech Honchkrow raises its wings from its perched position. A <b>Heat Wave</b> rushes forth from the pyrokinetically charged feathers, prickling your skin with experiences of scorching warmth as fire attack meets fire attack, but it doesn't take long for Drought to prove her control over fire is superior. As Honchkrow shrieks from the flames, Plague slices his <b>Razor Wind</b> at his target, causing a localised explosion as the hardened, focused air cuts into the blast of heat.<br />
<br />
Picking up on the opening, both Drought and Plague dart towards the shady raven; Drought relying on her <b>Quick Attack</b> to match with Plague's speedier agility, before the two of them crash in unison onto the Honchkrow. Left with barely enough time to squawk, Honchkrow is left lifeless on the ground as Drought and Plague leap back to admire their combined handiwork. A spray of red sparks, reminiscent of those Haunter had left behind earlier, catches your attention before the bird's body is consumed in the mysterious energy, and as the crimson blips dissipate into the night sky you're shocked to see nothing left behind on the ground. <b>Level-up for Drought and Plague</b>.<br />
<br />
&lt;<i>It's nothing like I've ever seen before.</i>&gt; Briefly startled by the return of Drought's voice, you realise the conclusion of battle lifted the seal on her mental energy. &lt;<i>Those Pokémon were alive, but... it was as though they were possessed, or poisoned, and were corrupted from within... Could it be that red light?</i>&gt; Reminded of the phenomena that had taken Haunter and Honchkrow in their defeat, you can't help but wonder if you haven't stumbled upon the tip of a very, very sinister iceberg, but as it is you still have very little information to work with. Leading the way you advance towards the house in the middle of the forest clearing, and as your fingers meet the wooden door it slowly swings open like a dying man stretching out on his deathbed.<br />
<br />
A powerful, rotting stench reaches your nose, causing the three of you to instinctively cringe for a moment before you gingerly step into the room. Bits of bodies far too broken and damaged to ascertain their identity lie in various piles in the dilapidated abode like grotesque decorations, spattered with faded papers and dangerously sharp shards of what appears to be scientific equipment. Bloodstains and other fluids streak across the walls not lined with dishevelled bookcases, and every now and then you spot deep scars of unknown origin dug into the floor, so deep you can almost feel the impact left behind. All in all, along with the distinct signs of violent struggle, you feel the strong stench of death emanate from the house, and even Drought and Plague move about more edgily than usual.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm honoured... you could come.&quot;<br />
<br />
The voice, while little more than a whisper, seems to break the apprehension in your mind like a shattering mirror, drawing your attention to the furthest end of the cottage where a tattered workbench stands. Bright twinkles of power, manifesting out of nothing, gather above the table, eventually forming the figure of a brunette woman; her flowing hair suspended beautifully along her sparkling dress of white, her deep green eyes shining at the sight of you but also holding a profound sense of sadness within.<br />
<br />
&quot;Evelyn,&quot; she speaks in introduction, &quot;And what am I to call you?...&quot;</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: DarkSlateBlue"><span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua'">Rayne stood on the sideline and watched as the final stages of this challenging fight were carried out. After relaying his commands, Plague swiftly zoomed off to his left, leaving a clear path for Drought to roast the Honchkrow. Even before Plague was completely out of the way, Drought began charging her flamethrower, unleashing a powerful stream of flame on a direct route to the dark type. Instead of dodging, however, the Honchkrow attempted to counter with a fire attack of its own; its wings lit with fire energy and an intense Heatwave was unleashed with a single flap. The wave of fire clashed with Drought midway between the battling pokemon; Rayne smirked. Somehow he thought this move to be futile; and indeed, Drought stepped on the burner, adding more juice to the attack, finally breaking through the Heatwave attack, and engulfing the bird in fire. <br />
<br />
“Now Plague!” Rayne commanded. The mantis slowed its spiralling motion, and with two swipes of his blades sent two razor sharp pockets of wind at the burning avian. The blades spun around each other in a mesmerising dance, before slamming with force into the flames, causing a massive explosion to light up the night sky. The intensity of the explosion caused enough heat to force tears in Rayne’s eyes, not to mention lighting up some of the trees in the vicinity. The heat was so intense now Rayne had to turn away for a second, protecting his face from the high heat. Just as he turned back he witnessed the final touches of the fight. Drought body was just a blur as she sped towards the wavering Honchkrow, and Plague was zooming in fast from above. Simultaneously they drilled the bird, causing it to faint. <br />
<br />
“Yes! Well done guys.” He cheered as he ran up to meet his pokemon, but what happened next stopped him in his tracks. The Honchkrow hit the ground, and just like the Haunter before, burst into red sparks, before its body dissipated into that same mysterious energy he thought was a Grudge attack earlier. More surprising still was the fact that the bird was gone! No where to be seen, as if the body was swallowed by the ground. Rayne slowed his march, confused about what he had just witnessed. How could a solid, living pokemon just disappear like that? The Haunter he could understand, being a ghost type, but now he was questioning even the ghastly being’s vanishing act. “The hell was that?” He asked as he finally got to his fatigued pokemon. As he did that he reached into his bag and pulled out some water and grub to reenergize his troopers. <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… It's nothing like I've ever seen before. Those Pokémon were alive, but... it was as though they were possessed, or poisoned, and were corrupted from within... Could it be that red light? …&gt;</i> Drought remarked, answering him with the familiar mind meld. <i>&lt;… Yes. The grudge let up after the fight. …&gt;</i> She added before Rayne could ask her the question. <br />
<br />
“Ha. But yeah, this is so strange. You think someone or something is controlling them? What for I wonder? This is probably what that woman was trying to get us to destroy, whoever is using these pokemon. What do you think Plague?” Rayne asked.<br />
<br />
“Sky! Scyther, scy.” Rayne looked at Drought for the translation.<br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… He says those pokemon were real. Like the three of us are real. But something was horribly wrong. …&gt;</i> This answer raised so many more questions, and certainly worried Rayne. He felt like he was just sucked into a dark, gloomy situation, and he didn’t feel right. A knot in his stomach told him to just turn around, this was something best avoided. But like any adventurer, the voices in his head, the thirst for adventure, screamed for him to go on; and this impulse was far stronger than the hesitant, worrisome pit in his stomach. <br />
<br />
“Alright guys. Rest up for a bit.” He said calmly, thinking about the mysterious pokemon, and their even more mysterious disappearances. While they drank and ate, Rayne walked over to where the two pokemon vanished into thin air. Nothing. Aside from the still burning trees on the edges of the clearing you would never have guessed a battle occurred here. Stumped he walked back to his pokemon and leaned against a tree, watching them carefully for any serious injuries; they were fine. <br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Half an hour had passed since they defeated the possessed team of Haunter and Honchkrow, and at this point his two pokemon were getting back to healthy conditions. As the three of them sat around the fire Drought had created, they discussed what they should do next, and of course tried to figure out the mystery of the evaporating adversaries. Rayne even attempted to extend his thoughts into Plague’s head, and this time he found the ordeal much easier, but just as he got into the Scyther’s head, Plague shot him an angry glare; apparently Plague did not enjoy having his mind pick pocketed. Laughing, Rayne stood up, and pulled out a pokeball as he did so.<br />
<br />
“Alright buddy. Thanks for all the help. You rest up for now, k? I’m sure we’ll call on you again before this is all over.” Understanding the importance of resting up, Plague nodded, before stretching out his scythe. Rayne pounded it, just like they had done before, as the light engulfed Plague. <br />
<br />
“Let’s go Drought.” The Ninetales stretched out her back, cracked her neck, and put out the fire with her mind (apparently her psychic abilities allowed her to even manipulate individual oxygen molecules away from a flame). It didn’t take them very long to find the house; an old, decrepit thing, looking as if it would fall apart with a single gust of wind. Tentatively they walked up to the door, and ever so slowly pushed it open. The screech that ensued was blood curdling, as if someone had been awoken from death, someone who did not want to be back. Chills crawled up his spine, his hair stood on end, and goose bumps lined his arms. This place did not feel safe. Drought was on edge too; teeth exposed, fur on end, and in hunting posture. As the door swung open the stench almost overwhelmed Rayne. It was as if every person that had ever died in the forest was brought here to be decomposed. Fighting the urge to vomit Rayne took the first step into the old cottage, and the sight that awaited him was not pleasing, and yet not surprising. Dead bodies, torn apart, broken and hung up as grotesque décor. Blood streaked the floor and walls, splattered around in patterns that brought vile images to mind. Clearly this was no tourist destination. <br />
<br />
Rayne scanned the room for clues, and more importantly some hint of life, when a voice broke the eerie silence: “I'm honoured... you could come.” It was barely a whisper, and yet loud enough to change the mood completely. From the farthest corner of the cottage sparkling bursts of energy came together to assemble the visage of a gorgeous brunette woman, her hair gracefully flowing over a pearly white dress. Her deep green eyes stared deep into Rayne’s, and filled him with sadness. Something about this woman made him feel safe, but the sorrow he felt made his soul shake in empathy. <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… Careful. Don’t let your guard down. …&gt;</i> Drought reminded him. <br />
<br />
“Evelyn,” She introduced herself as. “And what am I to call you?...” She added. <br />
<br />
“My name’s Rayne.” He answered firmly, looking straight into her intense green eyes, trying his best not to waver. “Evelyn … what happened here? Why are you here? What’s going on in the forest?” He asked, hoping this woman could help him unfold the mystery a bit. He continued looking into her eyes …</span></span></div>

The premise of another battle, compounded with the certainty that you've well and truly lost your way, doesn't paint a very rosy situation for you, but nevertheless you now have a new situation that demands prompt attention. Releasing the third member of your team, you send Grinder into combat with Volante, both Aipom and Pidgey promptly kicking up a <b>Sand-Attack</b> with the abundant dirt from the forest floor. Not having expected the irritant attack both Nuzleaf cry out in surprise and indignance, wildly rubbing at their faces while Volante continues to kick up a second dose of her <b>Sand-Attack</b>.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cormag, go for it! Strike the male Nuzleaf with your <b>Drill Peck</b>!&quot; calls Duessel, and as Volante arcs into the air the Murkrow dives at the Nuzleaf with the larger leaf on its head, spinning like a miniature tornado as he slams his beak into the Wily Pokémon's chest, soon followed by Volante as she <b>Fli</b>es past its head, slashing at him with her talons. Aside, Grinder tears at the other Nuzleaf, jumping on her head agilely as he <b>Scratch</b>es her all over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuzleaf!&quot; Holding their hands to their craniums, both Nuzleaf appear to cringe when you notice the sunlight above reflecting off a light sheen on their bodies. &quot;<b>Harden</b>, eh? Missy, call your Pokémon back for now.&quot; At Duessel's suggestion, you gesture to Grinder and Volante to fall back from their close range, as Cormag flies about them to face the Nuzleaf from afar. &quot;<b>Icy Wind</b>, Cormag!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Krow murkrow!&quot; Waving his wings, Cormag launches a wave of freezing air and snowflakes at both enemies, and a smile lights everyone's faces as rime begins to form across the Nuzleaf's woody dermic layers, slowing down any further movement that might come. Far too soon, however, both Nuzleaf rear their heads as their leaves spiral about, launching a combined <b>Razor Leaf</b> that slices at your skin along with everyone else. Looks like these two won't go down easy...</span></span>

She put her arms out, aiming to protect her face, her jugular, and portions of her shirt she really didn't want to lose. She crouched to protect her stomach as well as the rest of her clothing. As worried as she was about her bloodstream, she would be mortified if she had her clothing shredded in polite company. She turned her head and shouted &quot;Volante! Grinder! Both of you use Sand-Attack. Volante, go for the female with two rounds of Fly! Grinder, two-rounds of Scratch on the male!&quot; The whole time, she prayed that she would not wind up proving that those science fiction films had basis in truth...</span></span></div>

&quot;Save the act, boy. You're not fooling anyone with that story of yours,&quot; sighs the stranger, and as he rolls his eyes you're somewhat relieved to find he's more bemused than angry. &quot;And where would you expect to go on that Abra of yours? Elsewhere on this island, to be sampled by another local specimen of feral wildlife? The way I've seen you make decisions, you'll end up doing more harm to yourself than I ever intended.&quot; While you find that you can't appreciate the attitude of this man, the good news is, at least, he bears no ill will towards you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ogden. Patrick Ogden,&quot; he introduces gruffly. &quot;Been looking for a couple of my close associates, James and Evelyn. The word is, they were last sighted headed for this island at least a decade back, and that was the last time anyone ever heard of them since I lost contact with them twenty years ago. The folks in Rivieria warned me not to come and, while I'm not particularly worried about my safety, I've found no sign that anyone's lived here long-term, at least not for at least half a century, and I can't imagine why anyone'd want to be here. The way the local variety of Pokémon are behaving just doesn't sit right; they're uncharacteristically feral even without being disturbed... I simply can't fathom why James and Evelyn would ever come here.&quot;<br />
<br />
A deep frown lining his forehead, Ogden turns his attention back to you; while no longer indiscriminately fierce you feel that for the most part he's still trying to figure you out. &quot;That's my story. I don't suppose you'd be kind enough to tell me yours?...&quot;</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'"><i><span style="color: DarkSlateBlue"><span style="font-size: 9px">&quot;Save the act, boy. You're not fooling anyone with that story of yours,&quot; sighed the stranger, the lie Pepper had fabricated had been seen right through like it was batheed in Windex. Being discovered made him very uneasy. &quot;And where would you expect to go on that Abra of yours? Elsewhere on this island, to be sampled by another local specimen of feral wildlife? The way I've seen you make decisions, you'll end up doing more harm to yourself than I ever intended.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ouch, that one stung abit, didn't it?&quot; Pathos giggled, the insult the stranger had slung amused him, being that it was true. &quot;He's right you know.. You aren't exactly the brightest Laturn in the sea.&quot;<br />
<br />
The lack of confidence his Abra had in him had struck a nerve. &quot;Okay look,&quot; Pepper began, growing somewhat impatient. &quot;I know I haven't had made the best decisions in the past, but at least we have never gotten ourselves killed. You of all 'people' should be greatful, with almost turning us into Absol chow and all! And another thing...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ogden. Patrick Ogden,&quot; introducing himself gruffly, interrupting the little quarrel the trainer was having with his abra. &quot;Been looking for a couple of my close associates, James and Evelyn. The word is, they were last sighted headed for this island at least a decade back, and that was the last time anyone ever heard of them since I lost contact with them twenty years ago. The folks in Rivieria warned me not to come and, while I'm not particularly worried about my safety, I've found no sign that anyone's lived here long-term, at least not for at least half a century, and I can't imagine why anyone'd want to be here. The way the local variety of Pokémon are behaving just doesn't sit right; they're uncharacteristically feral even without being disturbed... I simply can't fathom why James and Evelyn would ever come here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew you chose this place for a reason,&quot; the Abra grumbled, before hopping back down on the forest floor. So it seemed he had stumbled across an everyday joe looking for his long lost friends. Abit tragic, being lost for so long. Pathos took a few steps forward, before glacing back at Pepper. &quot;This place is filled with bad mojo and you were out looking for it, weren't you! Why are you always doing this to me, and somehow it always ends up being my fault. Absol this, Articuno that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's my story. I don't suppose you'd be kind enough to tell me yours?&quot; Patrick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jack's the name, Pepper Jack.&quot; he bowed slightly, &quot;And this silver haired fox is Pathos, my partner in crime. A bit of a handful, really. I'd be more than happy to explain how we've arrived here.&quot;<br />
<br />
He stood there in a few moments of silence, he couldn't help but wonder if this was the right decision now. A part of him felt like asking him to join forces and investigate the Castle, which looked to be screaming with fun. Then again, his inexperience wasn't exactly the most appealing quality about him. <br />
<br />
&quot;I've traveled here all the way from the sunny shore's of Seaside in hopes to capture a rare and beastly trophy 'mon from this region,&quot; He began his tale, &quot;You see, while I was visiting the local watering hole, I ran into this elderly trainer going on about tales of a great evil sealed somewhere in Riveria, but to be honest the old kook looked one penny short of a piggy piggy bank. I decided to take a quick look around before decidiing whether it was worth my time,&quot; Pathos stomped his foot and glared, knowing full well where his trainer was taking this conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;The fates have brought us together to uncover the truth behind this place, I'm sure of it!&quot; exclaimed the trainer, proceeding to stick his tongue out at his Abra to provoke him even more. &quot;So I think we can help each other out. I promise I'm not total goober, I have <i>SOME</i> athletic abilities. Whaddya say, we can search the castle for clues and junk?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why am I always around for the troubled times,&quot; Pathos whined.</span></span></i></span></div>

<b><u>Tetyth Lake Depths</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Cod of War</u></b><br />
&quot;Think nothing of it, Jamie. It's not something we expect outsiders to immediately appreciate or grasp. We seek only to assist others on their way, not to judge those ways.&quot; Clearing his throat, Eriden continues, &quot; Now that the local Tentacruel have been possibly alerted we have to prepare ourselves for any potential assault, and there are few of us who can traverse both underwater and above it; even fewer are willing to wade near the waters around the ruined city. For certain if you had been travelling with other human companions we would have to escort you away from Tetyth Lake posthaste, but we can aid your quest as we see fit. We will, however, not allow you to commit anything we deem as potentially detrimental to our community, to our own discretion; as it is we might come under swift retaliation now that the Tentacruel population might have been alerted. Still, I suppose the two of us would not constitute an overly negative result to our defences, while hopefully providing adequate protection for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So that's settled then, Eriden? You could always have told him yes, y'know,&quot; pouts Seroba, before she gigglingly takes you by the hand. The soft, supple feel of her fingers surrounds your palm as she begins kicking upwards, lifting you off the bed of marble. Soon enough you find yourself being pulled along for a ride through the lake waters, allowing you to take in the sights of the underwater settlement of hybrids. Various families of half human, half Pokémon bustle amongst houses constructed of rock, coral and marble, and every so often you spot droves of children merrily swimming in playful frolics, kicking their fishtails energetically as they chase each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're he-ere!&quot; Seroba announces in a sing-song voice, as you break the water's surface a split second later. Lifted onto a series of stepping stones, you feel Seroba's protective bubble pop as your foot is raised out of the water, giving you a few moments to catch your land-legs back as Eriden points ahead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Carnea. From the outer district we'll have to find a way inside,&quot; notes Eriden. Wading to the edge where water gives way to stone, the two locals heft themselves onto the ruined marble on their lower Pokémon limbs; even with apparent familiarity to terra firma you note that Eriden's flippered abdomen and Seroba's feet won't be making for a very quick journey in comparison to you...<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like we're not alone.&quot; As Eriden raises his arm halting your advances, you spot movement from the ruined buildings ahead. Clicking its smaller pincer a Kingler crawls out of its hiding place, waving its larger claw at you threateningly while an Octillery slithers up from a pothole in the road; neither appears happy to see the three of you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seroba! Secure the rear end!&quot; Eriden calls, as ice begins to surround his hands, forming a helmet shaped exactly like a Walrein's cranium, complete with crests of frozen froth which he places on his head. &quot;I hope you're ready to do battle, Jamie...&quot;</span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: aqua">Note that the Tentacruel population may have been alerted by his entry to the lake struck the human as troubling news, considering the difficulty he had with the one on the surface of the lake, but as Eriden continued his response, he had the feeling that it was a reluctant yes, to which Seroba cheerfully giggled before taking his hand and kicking off into the waters, the trainer couldn't help but marvel somewhat at the underwater community, aquafolk going around their daily business and youths playing gleefully with each other, and the undying thought that a Tentacruel would suddenly burst through a room before making a ravenous beeline for him making him feel slightly uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
However, the call of the Azumarril guiding him snapped him out of his trance as he realised that his ride was over, finding himself in a marbled ruin, the merciful air above notification that travel for him would be easier. Hearing the note that he'd have to make his way to Tetyth on foot from Carnea was merely a slight hitch as he gazed around, his legs once more confirming they were on solid ground and not within a bubble a blessing. Looking back towards his allies, however, he noticed that their aquatic pokemon tails, while adapted for life in the waters, weren't as suited for land travel, a fact that didn't bother him as much as the clacking of a pincer nearby.<br />
<br />
As expected, the welcoming party seemed less than friendly, with a Kingler waving its other larger pincer with menace while an Octillery squeezed up from a manhole. As Eriden managed to conjure a helmet not unlike a Walrein's head, Jamie gazed towards his aquatic foes. <i>Considering both are water types, it seems unwise to use Penance or Volcape, meaning there's really only a couple of options left,</i> he thought as his hand hovered over Wraith's ball before contracting once more, the injured Swampert likely being at a flaw against two foes such as these. <i>On the other hand, Walrein are at ease in the cold, and Kingler have the flaw of freedom of movement...</i><br />
<br />
A flash of light later, his dozy Snover sat before him, chewing idly on his fruit before noticing the large crab before him, to which Arctacea hopped up, prepped for battle. Ever since he heard of the Cortoza incident, the Snover had been itching for a fight, and with the crab before him as an enemy, had little reason to wait much longer, even as Jamie felt the surrounding temperature start to dip, the natural effect of <b>snow warning</b> coming into effect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Got it. Arcy, time to shine. Start by <b>seed</b>ing that Kingler, keeping your distance so you're not swiped by that claw of his, and let said seed begin <b>leech</b>ing away at him, before getting in some sudden <b>growth</b> and chilling the crab with some <b>icy wind</b> to try and slow him down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Staring at his opponent, his mind scouring information, he noticed that he chose a suitable opponent, as he remembered an Octillery on television scorching a Steelix with a flamethrower, the octopus being unusual for its ability to harness fire.</span></span></div>

&quot;The Grim Angels.&quot; The name carrying off the woman's lips like a soft breeze, you watch as your unlikely saviour casts a sad look across the sinisterly desolate landscape of suspended stone and metal. &quot;The truth about the Grim Angels, especially where it came to their origin, has varied in Riviera's history. No one truly knows whether they were divine or enchanted beings, or simply normal humans like you and I who were affected by phenomena that, perhaps, no one will ever come to know. What is certain is that they followed the collective bidding of -- well, <i>someone's</i> judgement. Could have been a revered individual or organisation, though the legends point towards the gods. The Grim Angels followed the commands of the gods to pass judgement as the gods saw fit, mowing down whoever stood in the way of accomplishing that end. For this the Grim Angels were granted great power of their own and a Pokémon familiar to aid them... but in return, as legends stated, they had to give up something of their own.<br />
<br />
&quot;After the last Great War that the Grim Angels brought onto Riviera -- Heaven's Gate itself is testament to that grand battle -- it was stated that some of the surviving Grim Angels never returned to Heaven, but lived amongst people and Pokémon. The Grim Angel Ein, who gave up his wings for his power, was said to have been the first amongst them to fall in love with a mortal woman, and from then on Riviera held some lineage that historians have tried to trace back to the original Grim Angels,&quot; she continues. &quot;Millenia have passed since then, though; you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who's more than a distant relative... but that girl is an exception. She was descended from the Grim Angel Alycos, who gave up her sanity in exchange so she could also meet the objectives required of her -- with no psyche to hurt or damage she would not be deterred by assignments given to her. She became fused with the Pokémon that was given to her as a familiar; Mawile, the Deceiver Pokémon.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a plan that worked... far too well. Varying accounts have existed about Alycos, but they neither praised nor criminalised her as a whole. With no sanity to restrain her she was a danger to her allies as well as enemies, and this was as long as there were loose ends to tie, blood to spill. Eventually after the last Great War, some accounts say, the gods exiled her to Earth as they could no longer control her, while others say that what little of her mind remained made her choose self-exile as an option, but all confirm that at some point she fell in love with a mortal man who reciprocated her feelings and empathised her situation.&quot; At this the woman sighs, a terrible wince across her face. &quot;You know how female insects tend to eat the male after... well, suffice to say, that's what happened according to the archives. Alycos' uncontrolled half claimed another sacrifice to sate her innate bloodlust. The man's family, it was recorded, were beyond furious and distraught. Alycos was forced out of civilisation, doomed to forever wander the badlands and wildernesses of Riviera, even as she carried the child of her beloved... and after she was born, it is said she left her child in the care of a kind and understanding hamlet before she died.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since then the violent and bloody legacy of Alycos has been repeated through the ages. The power of the heavens, and the curse that came with it, lives on even now in that girl. Each generation a poor man falls head-over-heels in the single descendant of Alycos, resulting in more mindless bloodshed and misery. Everywhere the descendants of Alycos go, they bring destruction and death by the cast of their shadow... as <i>she</i> did to my village five years ago. Little more than a humble, quiet town that specialised in metallurgy; she simply appeared one day and torched the place to the ground... I was the only survivor.&quot; Bowing her head as she says this, you feel a pang of guilt and pity as the woman recounts her difficult memories. &quot;Like it was nothing but dust in the wind. Since then I've been doing my research and hunting her down, such that the legacy of Alycos could end... but I still can't match up to her strength, even though she comes here every now and then. I wait for the chance to strike in her most vulnerable stages, but... well, you saw what happened. There were times that I barely lost my life to her, if not for my Skarmory and his dedication to me.&quot; Weakly she cracks a smile at the roosting bird behind you, her gaze briefly meeting your own guilt-ridden expression. &quot;It's alright. It wasn't your fault,&quot; she whispers gently, placing a comforting hand on yours, &quot;None of this has to do with you. You were just in the wrong place at the wrong time... but this is my story. You've nothing to do with it, and I've seen too much death to risk seeing yours.<br />
<br />
&quot;...I'm sorry, but that's all I can tell you. About her, about me.&quot; Standing up, the woman picks up her scythe as though preparing for battle. &quot;I'm going to patrol the surroundings, just in case. For now you need to rest from your wounds; we can't risk sending you back to the Riviera Barrier if you haven't fully recovered.&quot;<br />
<br />
Watching the warrior lady leave through a doorway of rubble, you see her vanish amongst the rough roads of rocks linked by chain, information still running full course in your head. The adventure you hoped for certainly hasn't been anything like you ever guessed it might be, but what will you do now?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: Red"><span style="font-size: 9px">As the lady walked off to patrol, LC could not help but think over the huge volume of information he had just been told...of the sacrifice and fall of the Grim Angels, of Alycos the Deciever and of the lady's past and the destruction of her village. To think that the seemingly helpless young woman he had seen hours before could be a remnant of something so basely evil was bizzare, but, LC thought, that was probably how she and her ancestors had lured those unfortuneate enough to be chosen to continue the line of death and destruction reaped across time. It was easy to imagine how such a vulnerable looking creature could elicit nough sympathy to be taken in by a village, unaware of the true nature of a beast which would make them regret their kind natures bitterly, feeding off them and destroying all that it saw. Such a vicious, primal creature could not be reconciled with society, LC had no doubt in agreeing with the Warrior-Lady on that point, regrettable as it was. <br />
<br />
How the lady had hoped to defeat a creature directly descended from a powerful Grim Angel, LC had no idea. He had never encountered a Mawile, but knew of its reputation as a cunning creature, luring its prey in with a docile appearance before striking without mercy or compassion. With grim realisation, he noted that the creature displayed these same characteristics, the worst of Pokemon and Angel combining to form a horrific monster. It needed to be stopped, of that there was no doubt, but how he could help stop it? His interference had already nearly led to his own death, a well of that of his eventual saviour and their Pokemon. Thinking about the events of the last few hours, his view hardened. He would help, and this time he would be prepared, and with Marowak's abilities combined with those of the warrior lady, they could do it. At least, he had to hope so.<br />
<br />
Walking over to assess how Marowak and Skarmory doing, LC awaited the return of the lady from her patrol. He would offer his help then, for it was the least he could do after the damage he had already done. But first, to check on the Pokemon... </span></span></div>

Time ticks by quietly, punctuated only by the odd howling gust of wind and the subsequently creaking of stone and chains, as you watch over Marowak and Skarmory. Reflecting on what had happened and what the warrior lady had just told you, you're certain of one thing: the odds, to say the least, aren't particularly bright. What more can be said about an adversary commanding ancestral, celestial lineage and enough combat capability to kill several times over? Studying the resting forms of the Pokémon you note that while Marowak has several bruises, Skarmory's metallic body bears distinct signs of severe burning. Skarmory must have taken the main force of the Fire Blast earlier, you reason, and you sadly gaze at its shielded face, winced from pain even in slumber.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Maro?&quot; The sound of Marowak, weak but definitively alive, catches your attention. Looking downwards, you see your trusted lead operative raise a hand at you, which you grasp gratefully -- while both more than a little shattered, you both know that you'll certainly live to fight another day so long as you have each other. Though you're still rather weak to form coherent words Marowak simply clutches your hand a little tighter in understanding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is everything alright?&quot; Silent as she went, the woman's voice suddenly from behind startles you a little, turning back at the announcement of her return. &quot;We should be safe here, at least for a while. I don't know if that girl will come looking for us; she's never hunted me down specifically but the descendants of Alycos have... what is it?&quot; The colour seems to drain from her complexion as she reads your intent from your gaze. &quot;You're not... thinking of trying to help me, are you?&quot; she whispers, traces of fear clear in her tone as your quietude answers in your consent for you. For a moment she opens her mouth as if to say something in protest, but then turns to gaze troubledly into the distance, and awkward silence seems to consume the area.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I'm sorry. I just... You look so much like him; I don't want any danger to come to you.&quot; you barely hear her murmur, as she brings up a hand to wipe away her forming tear. &quot;Things won't be easy for us whatever path we take now. The way Skarmory has been scorched, I heavily doubt he can carry my weight, let alone ours. ...Marowak is your strongest Pokémon, isn't he? It's what I would have done myself, leading with the strongest Pokémon I have when going into unknown territory, that is if I had anyone else besides Skarmory... In any case, I don't think we can risk another confrontation. We could make it back to Riviera for proper medical attention and supplies, but risk getting seen; or we could bide our time in the deeper parts of Heaven's Gate.&quot;<br />

&quot;Rayne... A gentle, yet steadfast name.&quot; A smile lights the shining face of the woman before her morose expression resumes itself. &quot;You remind me so much of my dear James. Loyal, caring, everything a girl could want in a husband. He was one of two I forever remain indebted to in my life. But your queries need to be answered, as does the curse upon me must be destroyed... You can see for yourself, Rayne, I no longer belong to the realm that you refer to as the living.&quot;<br />
<br />
&lt;<i>That much was obvious,</i>&gt; Drought mutters, and you can half hear the roll of her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fifteen years ago I lost my life in a break-in. A band of thieves had forcibly entered the house when my husband was out on business, and took my life to ensure no witnesses would remain... James was anguished, to say the least. He could not accept my passing. For five years he spent his resources attempting to discover a way so he could restore me. When the sciences could not provide him with answers he turned to arcane study; research long forgotten and forbidden...&quot; Pausing for a moment as she idly touches her hair, she continues, &quot;I believe you witnessed a mysterious red energy during your journey here?&quot; A moment goes as you answer in the affirmative.<br />
<br />
&quot;Many forms of energy exist in this world, <b>Malice</b> being one of them: a red light borne of ill intent, anger, unfulfillment and other forms of darkness. James chanced upon an ancient manuscript known as Emigré, in which the road to resurrection was revealed; suffice to say, it required a massive accumulation of the energy known as Malice,&quot; sighs Evelyn. &quot;Nearly ten years ago James, having performed his search to an exhaustively satisfying degree, moved to Rosalina Island for the Emigré ceremony. He had heard of Lacrima's bloody history; how a great battle had been waged in which many innocent beings were slaughtered. The anger and vengeance left behind, along with the great number of corpses left to be buried by time and sediment, laid a great foundation of Malice... to this, James procured other bodies to sustain its power. How he did so I do not know; I can but fearfully guess. It was not until five years ago that he performed the ceremony in the castle's depths, after various experiments he carried out within this shack... he never left the castle alive. His attempt had raised my body, but the Malice had turned it into a lifeless shell bearing only my appearance, bent on death and destruction as is the path that Malice lays out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since then Rosalina Island, more so Lacrima Castle itself has been a bastion of monstrosity. Even normally docile Pokémon have taken to hunting wandering travellers unlucky enough to stumble here; their minds and bodies poisoned over time by the stench of Malice that permeates the island, turning them into soulless beasts existing only to kill... For years, I've tried to get help from the world outside, but I am bound to haunt these grounds. The most I could do was utilise mere fragments of Malice to reanimate a few of the bodies lying around, using them as brief puppets to pass on my message...&quot; She looks sadly at you, as you recall the blonde woman you had earlier encountered in the forest. &quot;I know not what she died of; only that her last moments were spent in most horrific tragedy... You were the first, after all this time, to reach this place. Every other adventurer who reached the boundaries of the forest and castle outskirts, I sensed, fled the island believing it was haunted. Others foolish enough to breach the castle's heights lost their lives at the hands of that monster, adding to the plague of darkness surrounding us... Rayne, I need you to destroy my body. The foul monster that haunts the castle, spreading its darkness throughout the island. James had erred in his attempt to bring me back, and now his mistake can only be corrected by you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Uneasily you gaze at the otherwise speechless Drought, who mirrors your own glance. &quot;I'm afraid this is all I can provide you with. It is a monumental task to be certain, and even I am unsure of how the creature might be defeated... but if you would try, there is something I must give you.&quot; Raising her sleeved arms the spirit of Evelyn brings her hands together where swirling energies and lights meet, coming together in a jewelled talisman the shape of a claw; the gem at the wide end gleaming in a beautiful sapphire shade. &quot;This was James' gift to me on our wedding day, a token of the love he held onto for me, that he would protect me forevermore... now its everlasting message will protect you from the effects of Malice, along with others around you. There are others on this island at this very moment... perhaps they might be kind enough to assist you. For certain the trials you face, if you tread deeper into Rosalina Island, will only get tougher and more brutal...&quot;<br />
<br />
What will you choose to do?<br />

&quot;Clues, you say... If you're looking for treasure or rarity, Pepper, I doubt you'll find it here. I combed the castle's insides as best I could and found no hint of any such riches. Granted, though, the investigation might be called cursory at best. I sensed a dreadful energy within the castle while I explored; Pokémon jumped out at me every now and then for my blood, and I swear that some presence lurked in the walls, watching my every move as I moved between tower to tower.&quot; Scratching his hair in mild annoyance, Ogden continues. &quot;That was a week ago. I barely escaped from a swarm of rabid Duskull that looked like they would have torn me to shreds given the chance, even in their indeterminate form. I've been nursing my wounds since then, attempting to formulate a plan under this accursed night sky from which there is no daybreak.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you would wish to attempt an entry into the castle, even if we were to combine our efforts, I cannot profess confidence that we will go far, let alone succeed. We must... Hold on a minute, Pepper.&quot; Carefully wielding his weapon, the adventurer treads towards the path you had earlier taken, and following him you find your way back onto Wilheim Path, where Ogden kneels down with his fingers to the soil in quiet observation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone else was here. I can't sense the negative energy like I sensed off the wild Pokémon here from these prints, and they've moved in the direction of the forest not far from here,&quot; he mutters, almost to himself. &quot;Meaning, there's someone else on this island besides us. Recently passed this way, too, by the looks of the markings... If we're going to embark on a journey into the castle it might be worthwhile to join forces with others. What do you say, Pepper?&quot;<br />
<br />
What <i>do</i> you say? It doesnt seem like you'll be immediately headed into the castle, but you've had a first hand experience at how perilous things might be, and Ogden certainly seems experienced enough if a bit distant towards you...</span><br />

Holding your ground as best as you can, you press on in your defence against the dark botanic pair. A storm of <b>Sand</b> almost erupts from the ground as both your Pokémon vigorously send their attack rippling across the field, covering the Nuzleaf in almost a wave of undergrowth sediment. Taking up the lead of your Pokémon, Cormag dives in as his beak glows from his <b>Peck</b> technique, slamming against the male of the Wily duo. Vigorously flailing his arms, the male Nuzleaf attempts to strike Cormag down with a <b>Pound</b>, but the multiple doses of lowered accuracy prove to have taken at least a significant toll as the Murkrow cawingly dodges to the side, allowing Grinder to leap onto the male's head for a round of his frenzied <b>Scratch</b>ing. Faced with similar impediment against <i>her</i> opponent, the other Nuzleaf is equally helpless as Volante strikes the side of her head in a timely <b>Fly</b> manoeuvre.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cormag, round about and strike with <b>Astonish</b>!&quot; commands Duessel, at which the allied Dark-type in question performs another of his coordinated aerial arcs, slicing past the Nuzleaf's cranium while Grinder continues lashing away. Almost in mimicry you spot Volante perform a curve on her end before veering back to Nuzleaf, but in horror you see that the subsequent <b>Pound</b> attack meets its mark, strengthened by the blind waving of the female Nuzleaf. As she skids to your feet you worriedly pick up your Pidgey; while not knocked out you find that she's got a good part of the wind slammed out of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Odd... given by how much we've attacked its head, we should have a reaction right about now. Nuzleaf are particularly protective of their leaves; why would... oh, no.&quot; The alteration in Duessel's tone catches your attention immediately; at the older man's indication you spot a red aura surrounding the Nuzleaf Grinder has perched upon.<br />
<br />
&quot;<b>Bide</b>,&quot; Duessel speaks, confirming your worst suspicions. &quot;This one's going to be big...&quot;</span><br />

No sooner than you send Arctacea into battle the effects of Snover's unique ability come into play; instantly you feel spatters of hail fall against your back while Eriden looks on, mildly surprised at your choice of the stubby fir tree against the enemy. Nevertheless, he seems to otherwise approve, and you soon understand why as he pulls down his helm: slowly the ice raining down on the both of you begins to build up around his muscular body. Bringing two fingers to his mouth the half-Walrein starts breathing an impressive <b>Blizzard</b> from between his lips, and under the weather conditions you created the attack hits both Octillery and Kingler squarely in the faces. Cheerily Arctacea jumps about, lobbing a <b>Leech Seed</b> in Kingler's direction. Too chilled by the freezing zephyr to react in spite of resistance, Kingler helplessly lets the parasitic pod bean it on its crest, which soon wraps its siphoning tendrils about its carapace.<br />
<br />
&quot;...!&quot; Tensing his muscles in apparent anticipation, Eriden gestures forward as both enemy Waters wave their appendages in annoyance; soon enough issuing <b>Bubblebeam</b>s from their mouths in response. Not one to be outdone, clearly, the merman blows a <b>Powder Snow</b> ahead this time, freezing the incoming orbs of water in mid-air. Weighed down by the latent change from liquid to solid the bubbles crash to the floor, harmlessly breaking into smithereens. &quot;Attacking by wild instinct... an effort doomed to failure, for certain,&quot; declares the experienced warrior, and you affirm to yourself that he's definitely not an individual to be messed with, as Arctacea launches into a phase of <b>Growth</b>. Blips of energy, wrung from Kingler's essence, fly through the air towards their intended recipient, and noting this Octillery appears to slither in front of its battlemate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm?&quot; Not having expected the defensive tactic, Eriden watches as Kingler begins a <b>Harden</b> from behind Octillery, the latter raising its tentacles up and down in a ritualistic pattern. &quot;<b>Focus Energy</b>, I see. Combining its immovable traits and its sniping ability to help protect its comrade... But even such plans are not free from falling astray.&quot; While Arctacea blasts the octopus with his <b>Icy Wind</b>, you turn to Eriden who has taken to clapping his hands in a mystic rhythm at which you find yourself tapping your feet to.<br />
<br />
&quot;<b>Encore</b>,&quot; explains the warrior, &quot;Now we know what the enemy will be up to next, as well as created an opening in the battle. With Octillery's <b>Suction Cups</b> blocking the way we need to take every chance we get to eliminate this obstacle as swiftly as possible.&quot;<br />

</blockquote><span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua'">Ah, awesome! Thanks Shadow. This storyline is working perfectly with Drought’s character development. I’m loving it.<br />
Sorry about the length =/, you really don’t have to read the text between the asteriks seeing as it has nothing to do with the plot and is simply meant for me to unfold some of Drought’s past; I just couldn’t pass this perfect opportunity to finally uncover her mysterious abilities and such. <br />
<br />
<span style="color: DarkSlateBlue">Rayne stood still as Evelyn reminisced about her past. Apparently he reminded her of her husband, which made him feel uneasy for some reason; he had a strange feeling that told him her husband was man better not to be likened to. Rayne set aside the thought and continued listening to Evelyn’s tale. <br />
<br />
“You can see for yourself, Rayne, I no longer belong to the realm that you refer to as the living.” She said softly; sadly.<br />
<br />
<i>&lt;…That much was obvious …&gt;</i> Interrupted Drought, rather rudely.<br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… Shut up for a second, will you? …&gt;</i> He snapped back, Drought snorted her disapproval but obeyed nonetheless. Evelyn glanced over at the nine tailed fox, looking her over, as if scanning her inner soul with those penetrating green eyes. Drought looked uneasy, turning her head away to avoid eye contact with the spirit. A brief pause ensued as Evelyn finally turned her attention back to the matter at hand. After a quick sigh Evelyn began her story, a story that dated back fifteen years, a story much too dark to be told by someone so elegant and innocent. Without hesitation she recounted how her home was broken into by band of thieves while James was away. She did not miss a single detail, telling Rayne how she was murdered by these thugs to ensure no witnesses remained. This bit was rather gut wrenching, a terrible tragedy. Rayne couldn’t bare to look into her eyes, grief overwhelmed him. <br />
<br />
Evelyn continued, telling Rayne about her husband’s depression and insane plot to resurrect her. It was at this point that he understood where this story was headed; he knew that James had done something terrible, an unnatural act that went against every law of nature. He looked up again, swallowed the lump in his throat, and motioned that he was okay to listen to the rest of the tale. His suspicions were confirmed soon after. Apparently James had spent every waking moment, depriving himself of any comfort, for <i>five</i> years in an attempt to get his Evelyn back. After five years of failure he finally exhausted his scientific patience, and reverted to much darker, more sinister techniques; arcane magic. <br />
<br />
“I believe you witnessed a mysterious red energy during your journey here?” Evelyn asked. Rayne head flooded with images of the defeated Haunter and Honchkrow. He nodded that he had indeed seen the red lights. “Many forms of energy exist in this world, Malice being one of them: a red light borne of ill intent, anger, unfulfillment and other forms of darkness. James chanced upon an ancient manuscript known as Emigré, in which the road to resurrection was revealed; suffice to say, it required a massive accumulation of the energy known as Malice.” Rayne now understood what possessed those pokemon from before, but he still didn’t know why. He also couldn’t help but wonder whether he had ran into this form of energy before; a Shadow Claw attack often emitted strange bursts of red light, could that be Malice being released by pokemon? He doubted it, most pokemon were not malicious … or so he hoped.<br />
<br />
Evelyn paused, sighed and continued. She told him about how James had found a way to resurrect her by harvesting Malice. He specifically moved to Riviera’s Lacrima Castle because of its disastrous past. Rayne recalled the stories he was told in Riviera’s main library. In the past many battles were waged on the grounds surrounding the castle, and even within. Hundreds, thousands of people perished on Lacrima’s grounds. Innocents, soldiers, knights, kings, pokemon alike; they all died. They’re vengeful spirits were said to haunt the entire island; now Rayne understood how. It was the Malice. James had used this Malice for several experiments in this very shed, explaining the dismantled bodies and overall gruesome condition of the place. Finally, having harvested enough Malice, and feeling his experimenting fulfilled he attempted to bring Evelyn back via the Emigré ceremony. He succeeded, but not entirely. James lost his life in the castle, and after all that Evelyn was still just a spirit, now bound to the physical world with no way to leave. She was a ghost, an apparition of her former self, stuck here, haunting the island for the rest of time … that is what Malice wants; chaos and destruction. Evelyn’s body was the physical reanimation of Malice itself … <br />
<br />
Rayne felt woozy, remembering how he had that gut feeling telling him to turn back, and wondering whether he should have listened. He dived head first into a dark magic mess not completely realising it. Before he could think about any further Evelyn went on. She told him how it was her that controlled the woman he ran into in the forest. This woman was most likely used as a subject in James’ insane experiments, dying a gruesome death; maybe her use as a puppet was in fact a way to avenge this terrible death, she was used by Evelyn to draw Rayne to the cabin, maybe her death was not a complete tragedy. Evelyn informed him that he was the first person to ever make into the shack since James’ had used it as a laboratory, and how all other trainers fled in fear or perished in vain because of their arrogance. <br />
<br />
“I didn’t flee, even though I thought about it. I guess that must mean my arrogance is going to cost me my life here. Fantastic.” Rayne said sarcastically. Evelyn paid this comment no heed, urging him to find her body and destroy it, thereby lifting the curse of the island. Rayne breathed in heavily, understanding the monumental task ahead of him, but before he could utter another word, Evelyn added one last bit to her story. She pulled back the sleeves of her dress and brought her arms together above her head. A dance of energy surrounded her hands, and when they settled a fabulous talisman could be seen wrapped around the spirit’s wrists. Slowly she walked over to Rayne, revealing the talisman to be in the shape of a claw; with a majestic sapphire gem embedded at the wide end. <br />
<br />
“This was James' gift to me on our wedding day, a token of the love he held onto for me, that he would protect me forevermore... now its everlasting message will protect you from the effects of Malice, along with others around you. There are others on this island at this very moment... perhaps they might be kind enough to assist you. For certain the trials you face, if you tread deeper into Rosalina Island, will only get tougher and more brutal...” Rayne took the talisman from her, when his hand made contact with Evelyn’s he was amazed at how warm it felt. She felt alive, as if blood was still pumping through her veins. That put a faint smile on his face, as he grasped the talisman. Drought looked on from the side carefully, keeping vigil in case something were to happen, but nothing did. Rayne put the talisman around his neck, and tucked it under his t-shirt; he felt rather underdressed next to Evelyn’s marvellous dress. <br />
<br />
“I … I’m … well … uhm … I … I’m sorry …” Rayne hesitated, trying to find the right words. “I’m sorry about what happened to you. You didn’t deserve that fate. No one does. I wish James …” He cut himself off, he wasn’t going to finish that sentence, it wasn’t fair. “I’ll help you. I’ll destroy Malice. You just hold tight.” Rayne said affirmatively. Evelyn smiled, bent down and stroked Drought’s dark mane. Rayne could tell she felt uncomfortable by this gesture, but for some reason, she let the ghost touch her. Normally Drought would have bitten the hand off a person who touched her; this was strange. <br />
<br />
“Protect your trainer, mighty Ninetales. Your relatives are wishing you well from the other side.” Evelyn said quietly. Rayne was dumbfounded, not so much by the fact that Evelyn could communicate with the dead, but by what happened next. Drought’s fur turned completely black for a moment, except the tips of her tails which remained the same colour. Rayne shook his head in wonder, but by the time he opened his eyes again she was her normal self again. Same old Ninetales, with pearly white fur, except her mane of course, which was jet black. “Now go on. I will continue waiting.” Rayne nodded, and motioned for Drought to follow. <br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Rayne was relieved to be out of that tragic, foul building and back in the comfort of the death trap of a forest it was nestled in. He looked up into the night sky, where the moon was shining brightly, like it always did on Rosalina Island. He quietly went over the conversation he just had with Evelyn, dissecting every little word she mentioned, thinking about the best plan of action. His best hopes lay in meeting up with the other trainers Evelyn mentioned; safety in numbers. He felt safe with his squad, after all they were almost all veteran fighters, some of which had attained the pinnacle of their training, but he couldn’t be sure about the others. Should he seek them out? Would they even agree to take on this seemingly suicidal mission? Would they believe his tale? Evelyn’s tale? It was worth a shot. He would find them, and fill them in, then they could make their choice. If they declined in helping him, he would enter the castle himself, fight his way deep, and purge this place of this never ending curse. <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… Are you so sure? …&gt;</i> Asked Drought, after he finished his train of thought.<br />
<br />
“No….. I’m not sure at all. But I’ll try, and with you guys at my back I feel confident we can succeed. Hopefully … without dying.” He responded.<br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… And what if you die? What is to happen of us? What if one of your pokemon died? This place is haunted by a terrible energy Rayne. This isn’t a friendly adventure to Cloud Garden anymore. This is dangerous. …&gt;</i> She retorted sharply.<br />
<br />
“I know. But we’ll get through this. You heard Evelyn, this talisman will protect us. I’m not sure how, but I believe her.” Was the weak response from her trainer. <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… Fine. Let’s get on with it. I’m ready to rip more Malice apart. …&gt;</i><br />
<br />
“You got it!” He said more cheerfully. “Hey, but first. What was that about in the shed there? What was Evelyn talking about? Why did she call you mighty?”<br />
<br />
<i>&lt;... Not sure. But when she said that, I could see my parents, and siblings. They were all talking to me, telling me that I have to help Evelyn … to avenge their death. …&gt;</i><br />
<br />
“What? Avenge their death? How does that at all connect with helping Evelyn?” Rayne was majorly confused. <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… I’m not entirely sure. I’ve never met my parents. …&gt;</i><br />
<br />
“That I do know. You were hatched to a trainer, and then traded to me. I was walking by this trainer when you hatched. She wasn’t sure how she felt about keeping you, so I offered her a trade. She accepted.” <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… I know. It was all very strange. I didn’t know what to do at first, but there was no denying it, they were my parents; Ninetales with jet black fur, and my siblings were all there too. Four Vulpix in all, they were calling out to me, told me they looked up to their youngest sister. …</i><br />
<br />
“Wait! Did you say their fur was jet black? Like their entire body?” He asked.<br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… Yes. Their entire body. Solid black, just like my mane. …&gt;</i><br />
<br />
“Are you serious? I don’t know if you noticed this, but I could have sworn for a second your whole body turned black too. It looked like the pigment from your mane spread over your body until it was solid black. What does that mean? How did that happen? I thought that odd pigmentation happened because of that charcoal that you were holding when you evolved.” When Drought and Rayne felt the time was right for her to evolve Rayne went out and got a Fire Stone. Much like any other stone evolution, contact with the stone was necessary, and so he touched her forehead with it, and that tell tale white light engulfed her. When she came out of the metamorphosis her mane, unlike any Ninetales he had ever seen, was the deepest black. The only explanation he could come up with was that in that crucial moment of gene shuffling, the charcoal that Drought had hidden in the fur around her neck caused a hyperpigmentation in the affected region. Sure it was an unlikely theory, but what else could have caused the black fur? Moreover the charcoal which Drought used to boost her fire attacks was gone after the evolution; no matter how deep Rayne dug he could not find it buried in her mane. <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… You mean … My whole body was covered in dark fur too? …&gt;</i> <br />
<br />
“Yeah. How strange. Well I guess you were related to those Ninetales and Vulpix. You don’t figure they lived here do you? I mean, when we were just walking into the forest you muttered something about this forest being just like home.” Suddenly it all clicked. “Wait! You know what it is? Your family probably lived here. In Rosalina Forest, that’s why you had that odd flashback maybe. What if they … what if they were used in James experiments, or were killed by a possessed pokemon …” <br />
<br />
All of a sudden Rayne’s vision blurred with Droughts and he was looking at himself through the eyes of his Ninetales. Then they were plunged into nothingness. It felt like the ground beneath them gave way and they were free falling. Then they came to a sudden stop. They were still in the familiar grounds of Rosalina Forest, but no longer in the same spot; together they looked up, the position of the moon confirmed that they were in fact no longer at the same spot. By their estimation they were much deeper in the forest, looking away from the Castle. <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… Luna. Are the kids sleeping? …&gt;</i> A deep voice cut into their mind, a voice they didn’t recognize. <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… Yes. They’re all well in the burrow. …&gt;</i> They answered. Speaking for Luna? Wait, they were Luna? They were looking through Luna’s eyes? Luna’s head swivelled to the left, just in time to see a black furred Ninetales walk through a tight gap in the trees.<br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… Perfect. How’s Drought? …&gt;</i> The Ninetales asked, this was the same Ninetales as before. Drought’s father, and he already knew her name. This was all very confusing to Rayne and Drought. <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… Same as before, …&gt;</i> She responded sombrely. <i>&lt;… what’s the matter with Sol? …&gt;</i> She asked him.<br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… I’m just worried about her. All the others have long hatched, they’re even beginning to develop their psychic abilities, yet Drought isn’t even kicking. You don’t think she’s …&gt;</i><br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… Don’t dare say it Sol! She’s alive. I don’t know why she’s not hatching, but she’s alive. …&gt;</i> It was at this point that Rayne realised that Luna’s voice and anger sounded and felt just like Drought’s; carbon copies of each other. <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… I’m sorry. You’re right. Forgive me. Anyhow, Elder Cronos has called a meeting, there have been more vanishings, and earlier today they found Maximillion gutted at the edge of our territory. They still don’t know who’s doing this, but the whole colony is panicking. A bunch of families have fled the shelter of the Sphere, but somehow I don’t think they made it very far. …&gt;</i> Sol sounded very troubled as he recounted the news to Luna.<br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… Maximillion? Oh poor boy. He was so young. His mother must be devastated. That her second son who’s been found this way. How many more sentinels will be killed before they all decide to abandon their posts? …&gt;</i> So far Rayne and Drought figured they have been teleported back to her parents time, and were seeing things through the eyes of Luna, her mother. Some great catastrophe had occurred in their community, and now they were headed to the colony center where the Elders were to deliberate on what to do next. As they stepped into a large clearing the sight that awaited them was astounding; a gathering of Ninetales, hundreds of them, all with jet black fur. Head to toe, every single one was solid black. The two of them were amazed at what they saw. Even more astounding was the fact that they were all communicating telepathically with each other; so great was their psychic skill that Luna could easily pick up dozens and dozens of separate conversations; she could hear each one separately as they developed in real time, even adding her two cents in conversations when she felt it was appropriate. Overall the message was clear; the colony of psychic fox were all distressed by what was going on outside the Sphere (the Sphere was a protective bubble that kept the colony segregated from the rest of the forest; a psychic bubble powered by the Elders). <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… Silence! ...&gt;</i> Boomed a voice; authoritative yet wise. From the canopy above an old looking Ninetales stepped out in the moonlight. He was standing above all the others on a massive porch like extension of a massive tree; a tree whose trunk spanned the width of the clearing. <i>&lt;… Most of you know why I called you here. Our colony, and the whole forest is in danger. Something sinister is brewing on Rosalina Island, and its consuming the forest. …&gt;</i> The mass of Ninetales began panicking and bickering between themselves. <i>&lt;… Silence! We must remain calm, our abilities should keep us safe through these dark times, so long as we stick together and stay within the Sphere! For every fully grown Ninetales that leaves the Sphere, the Sphere loses power. If you leave the colony, you are not only jeopardizing yourself, but all your brethren as well. …&gt;</i> Just as he finished a disturbance to the right of the colony shifted the focus away from the elder. It was another Ninetales, but unlike the rest, only his mane was black, the rest was white as snow; just like Drought. <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… Elder Cronos … Elder Cronos …&gt;</i> The young Ninetales’ voice overwhelmed the combined thoughts of the colony. <i>&lt;… It’s coming … It killed the rest of them. The rest of the scout team, even the adults, it got them all. I barely escaped alive, I got lucky. The rest are dead. It’s coming to get us now. …&gt;</i> Apparently young Ninetales were only partially black, whereas fully developed Ninetales had an entire coat of dark fur. This young Ninetales was badly hurt, three of his tails were missing, and he had a deep gash on one of his legs. Before the Elder Cronos could enquire further a huge shockwave burst through the colony, and darkness enveloped them all. <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… The Sphere is gone! I am sorry. We are safe no longer. Save the infants. Make sure they live on. Our colony is doomed. I am sorry my children …&gt;</i> The whole colony burst into action, and telepathic chaos. Everyone darted into the woods, headed for their burrows. <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… Luna? Luna! Get the young. I’m going with the rest to fight this thing. …&gt;</i><br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… Sol! Don’t leave me. Let’s take them and leave this place. Don’t do this. …&gt;</i> <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… I’m sorry Luna. We’ll buy the females time. You must save the young; our colony cannot go extinct here. I … lov … ou … una …&gt;</i> Sol’s voice trailed off, as he diverted his thoughts to fending off the mysterious entity that was engulfing the colony. Luna’s eyes watered, her head ached, but she ran on, towards her burrow. When she finally got there, she found the place as she left it. But that quickly changed as rabid pokemon came crashing through the trees. Berserk Ursaring, evil Golbat, all running towards the clearing they had just left; something was possessing them she sensed. The noise woke her sleeping pups, and one by one they came out of the burrow, wondering what had happened. Desperately she dove in, pulling out Drought’s dormant egg, and shuffled backwards to get out again. As she did so a Honchkrow swooped down, and swooped up one of the Vulpix pups; flying off into the dark sky. <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… No! Mara! No …&gt;</i> Luna was clearly upset, her head trembled with grief. But even then she continued. Motioning the rest of her brood to follow. With tears clouding her eyes she led them to a slow moving river. She quickly dismantled a tree with a psychic attack and built a makeshift raft out of the sticks, using vines as rope. Next she stripped the leaves off another tree and padded the raft before placing Drought’s egg in there. Lastly she cast as many protective attacks as she knew on the raft, before finally kicking the raft away, letting the river take the egg to safety. Drought’s egg made its way to the sea, where it was found by a fisherman, who in turn passed it on the daycare center. The couple that ran the center were so amazed that the egg did not hatch after twelve years they decided to hand it off to an expert, where it was finally induced to hatch to a trainer, who never really knew what was within. Drought’s parents never made it out of the forest. The same fate met her siblings too. The sight of her young dying sent Luna into a frenzy, which ultimately destroyed her. Sol, as the rest of the male Ninetales that fought, also never made it out alive. <br />
<br />
With this tragic end of what was an otherwise insightful visit to the past Rayne and Drought were spit back up in their time. Rayne looked around, and spotting the cabin, realised that ordeal was over with. He looked at Drought who was trembling at what she had just seen. <br />
<br />
“Hey … are you alright?” He asked gently. <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… I think so. That was … difficult to watch … but I’m alright. …&gt;</i> Rayne was glad she wasn’t cast into some sort of depression, but he could tell she was grieving her parents and siblings and the rest of the colony. Even though the two of them had never seen any of these Ninetales, they couldn’t help but feel like they knew them personally. Rayne stood over Drought for a while, as she paced around slowly. <i>&lt;… So that really explained a lot. This made sense of a lot of questions wouldn’t you say? …&gt;</i> She finally spoke. He nodded. It did for sure, now he knew why she had those abilities, where her family grew up, why she had dark fur. <br />
<br />
“How did I know to name you Drought?” Rayne asked.<br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… I named myself Drought, Rayne. I beamed it into your head when, you had no idea though. …&gt;</i> That also made sense. Rayne remembered how his had a splitting headache when he tried to come up with a name for his Vulpix. <i>&lt;… I just knew my name was Drought, right as I was born, interesting how that happened. We should get going, let’s not delve here too much longer. …&gt;</i> Rayne nodded. <br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
“Right. Tag this place with some form of psychic energy that you can locate later, just in case we need to find this place again. Anyway, Andromeda, come on out.” A bright flash once again filled the forest, as Rayne Salamence was called out. “Fly us back towards that cliffside path please.” Andromeda beat her wings excitedly, happy to get the chance to fly her trainer again. Last time they attempted this … well let’s say it almost ended in a terrible accident. Drought climbed onto Andromeda’s back, her claws digging into the Salamence’s scaly skin slightly. Rayne followed close behind, before Andromeda began beating her wings with a tremendous force. Soon they were airborne and flying back the way they had come from. With a last look over his shoulder Rayne watched as the haunted shack disappeared in the tangle of trees … his gaze slowly drifting towards the eerie castle in the distance. Just a matter of time now before he was squaring off with Malice itself… </span></span></div>

<b><u>Wiese Forest</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Excessive Spare Time</u></b><br />
Holding your ground as best as you can, you press on in your defence against the dark botanic pair. A storm of <b>Sand</b> almost erupts from the ground as both your Pokémon vigorously send their attack rippling across the field, covering the Nuzleaf in almost a wave of undergrowth sediment. Taking up the lead of your Pokémon, Cormag dives in as his beak glows from his <b>Peck</b> technique, slamming against the male of the Wily duo. Vigorously flailing his arms, the male Nuzleaf attempts to strike Cormag down with a <b>Pound</b>, but the multiple doses of lowered accuracy prove to have taken at least a significant toll as the Murkrow cawingly dodges to the side, allowing Grinder to leap onto the male's head for a round of his frenzied <b>Scratch</b>ing. Faced with similar impediment against <i>her</i> opponent, the other Nuzleaf is equally helpless as Volante strikes the side of her head in a timely <b>Fly</b> manoeuvre.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cormag, round about and strike with <b>Astonish</b>!&quot; commands Duessel, at which the allied Dark-type in question performs another of his coordinated aerial arcs, slicing past the Nuzleaf's cranium while Grinder continues lashing away. Almost in mimicry you spot Volante perform a curve on her end before veering back to Nuzleaf, but in horror you see that the subsequent <b>Pound</b> attack meets its mark, strengthened by the blind waving of the female Nuzleaf. As she skids to your feet you worriedly pick up your Pidgey; while not knocked out you find that she's got a good part of the wind slammed out of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Odd... given by how much we've attacked its head, we should have a reaction right about now.

&quot;Clues, you say... If you're looking for treasure or rarity, Pepper, I doubt you'll find it here. I combed the castle's insides as best I could and found no hint of any such riches. Granted, though, the investigation might be called cursory at best. I sensed a dreadful energy within the castle while I explored; Pokémon jumped out at me every now and then for my blood, and I swear that some presence lurked in the walls, watching my every move as I moved between tower to tower.&quot; Scratching his hair in mild annoyance, Ogden continues. &quot;That was a week ago. I barely escaped from a swarm of rabid Duskull that looked like they would have torn me to shreds given the chance, even in their indeterminate form. I've been nursing my wounds since then, attempting to formulate a plan under this accursed night sky from which there is no daybreak.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you would wish to attempt an entry into the castle, even if we were to combine our efforts, I cannot profess confidence that we will go far, let alone succeed. We must... Hold on a minute, Pepper.&quot; Carefully wielding his weapon, the adventurer treads towards the path you had earlier taken, and following him you find your way back onto Wilheim Path, where Ogden kneels down with his fingers to the soil in quiet observation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone else was here. I can't sense the negative energy like I sensed off the wild Pokémon here from these prints, and they've moved in the direction of the forest not far from here,&quot; he mutters, almost to himself. &quot;Meaning, there's someone else on this island besides us. Recently passed this way, too, by the looks of the markings... If we're going to embark on a journey into the castle it might be worthwhile to join forces with others. What do you say, Pepper?&quot;<br />
<br />
What <i>do</i> you say? It doesnt seem like you'll be immediately headed into the castle, but you've had a first hand experience at how perilous things might be, and Ogden certainly seems experienced enough if a bit distant towards you...</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><i><span style="color: DarkSlateBlue">&quot;Clues you say?&quot; Ogden responds.<br />
<br />
Pepper nodded his head, &quot;Yes, Clues. Like blues clues? That was a really great show.&quot; Patrick ignored his comment and continued talking. How could it that a man that seemingly has no pokemon could explore a castle thats supposedly filled with riches and evil survive so long, and how long could he have been searching. It shouldn't take fifteen years to up and discover yours friends have gone missing. Something didn't feel right, though he was the only other person that he could trust at this time.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you would wish to attempt an entry into the castle, even if we were to combine our efforts, I cannot profess confidence that we will go far, let alone succeed. We must... Hold on a minute, Pepper.&quot; He paused, whipping his body toward the path the trainer had taken to get to the Garden. Without warning Patrick started up the path, leaving Pepper and Pathos behind, confused as ever.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know about you, but I'd feel safer with him!&quot; exclaimed his abra before dashing his way behind Patrick. So it seemed that his little Pathos found himself a crush, and in the stranger danger Mr Ogden. The little pitter patter of Pathos footsteps trailed along those of Patricks.<br />
<br />
It was silent. &quot;ZOINKS! Hey fella's wait up!&quot; Pepper called out, realizing that he'd been left fat behind. Thoughts of fairy tales and dragons soon filled his head. Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Jack and the Bean Stalk, and Smurfs even. With every castle comes a story, and this was his. &quot;I can only imagine,&quot; he muttered to himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone else was here. I can't sense the negative energy like I sensed off the wild Pokémon here from these prints, and they've moved in the direction of the forest not far from here,&quot; he mutters, almost to himself. &quot;Meaning, there's someone else on this island besides us. Recently passed this way, too, by the looks of the markings... If we're going to embark on a journey into the castle it might be worthwhile to join forces with others. What do you say, Pepper?&quot;<br />
<br />
'How could this person know anybody was here at all?' He thought to himself. &quot;Well I would sure would feel alot more comfortable with an extra trainer or two in our group if trekking through the castle is what we plan to do, but I can tell you could care less about my response... You said something about exploring each tower, yes? Maybe this evil lies deep within the dungeon, like most monsters of myth. Hmm.. Before I forget, I was wondering if you had any pokemon at your disposal? Just a tad curious, you haven't mentioned any so far,&quot; Pathos clung to him, like a little puppy dog humping its newly adoptive master leg.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bugger off, Pee! With a <b>CALM</b><b>MIND</b>, I want you to <b>DETECT</b> how far off this other stranger is. Then if you can, use your telepathy to try to make contact with them.<br />
<br />
Pathos dug his face into his Patrick's pant-leg, &quot;B-but I might not be able to establish a connection with the others, I don't share that bond with them as I do with you.. I'm not experienced enough,&quot; his muffled sniffles gaining no sympathy from his trainer.. &quot;You can always try.&quot; Pepper replied coldly.</span></i></span></div>

<b><u>Crystal Caverns</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Handymankg2</u></b><br />
With little choice left to you for transport and the other choice a no-go as a result of your limited options, you find yourself headed for the Crystal Caverns once more. It doesn't take you long before the subterranean labyrinth's entrance comes into view, as well as Triz who appears to have been waiting for you.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had a hunch you'd come, so I decided to wait out here a bit longer before rejoining the others. You'll need to be quick; I don't want the others knowing,&quot; he mutters, beckoning at you to follow him as he darts down the stairway. As Bellatrix buzzes behind you, the sounds of your footsteps ring through the caves as you try keeping up with the teenager, barely spotting him round a corner you hadn't noticed earlier when you went near the cavern stream. With each stride into the new route you find less of the crystals' calming glints; most of them apparently removed from mining processes, leaving only blank rock. The only light ahead you can see is a bizarre diagram on the stone floor, illuminating Triz's silhouette from below as he waves at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a Teleport Circle,&quot; explains Triz as you near. &quot;To put it simply, it's an area in space and time where the remnants of a Pokémon's Teleport attack have been isolated and focused, granting a psychic gateway between dimensions to allow anyone to travel between places instantaneously. The problem is, using the Teleport Circle creates a noticeable disturbance where both gateways are -- meaning, you'll risk alerting the Pokémon on Rosalina Island to your presence; some species are particularly sensitive to the presence of others and may attack. Usually Miss Adryd would have carried pacifiers for the expedition, except... well, I think you get the idea. I'm afraid there's little else I can tell you... just remember, Rick, be careful out there above all else. Now all you need to do is focus on the thought of reaching your destination. Good luck!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding as you step inside the runic pattern, you close your eyes with the image of an island shrouded darkness and mystery filling your mind. Even with your eyelids closed you can feel light rising from the ground around you, giving your body the strange sensation of being lighter than air...<br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkslateblue"><div style="text-align: center"><b><u>Lacrima Castle</u></b>&#8203;</div><br />
<b><u>Wilheim Path</u></b><br />
<br />
The advent of a warm breeze, filled with the strong scent of salt, greets your nose as you suddenly feel the weight return to your body. Opening your eyes, you find that your surroundings have changed quite dramatically; while there isn't much in the way of light the ground below you is grassy instead of bare, and every now and then the sounds of local Pokémon chittering can be heard. Buzzing, Bellatrix points you at the sea where you can just about make out the mainland of Riviera in the distance, obscured by distant mist... or is it a miasma unique to Rosalina, almost sealing off the island from the world? Certainly, you don't remember journeying this late into the night; it was still light when you left Elendia, and yet the full moon shines above you casting light off the melancholy road ahead.<br />
<br />
&quot;SKREEEE!&quot;<br />
<br />
As you journey up the cliffside road from the circle, however, it becomes clear that Triz wasn't joking about the inhabitant Pokémon as a screeching Tangela suddenly lunges at you from the shrubbery; its vines swinging and pulsing about in a most alarming manner...</span><br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">Really, really sorry about not replying sooner. I realise that I probably should have made it a priority, not replying since the 30th, but NaNoWriMo and various other things have prevented me from doing so. I’d love to continue this adventure if you let me, and will try to remain active. <a href="http://bmgf.bulbagarden.net/showpost.php?p=1191156&amp;postcount=128" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fbmgf.bulbagarden.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D1191156%26postcount%3D128&amp;hash=dbb0def3689ee6cb70b9c83d02ebf2ce" rel="nofollow noopener">Vespiquen reached level 50</a><br />
<br />
<span style="color: lemonchiffon">The man from before, Triz, was waiting for Rick as he arrived in the Crystal Caverns again, standing there and ready to help Rick obtain the goal for the Magic Guild. He muttered to Rick quickly, and Rick knew that he would have to keep as quiet as possible. Whatever he was about to do, he knew that it wasn’t something that really needed revealing, and Rick was fine with being secretive. He wouldn’t be lying if nobody asked him, right? Anyway, it was time for Rick to follow Triz, Bellatrix floating alongside Rick as he sped through the caves, Ricks footsteps being a bit too loud for Ricks comfort. If he was caught doing this, whatever this was, he may well be asked to end this adventure of his, and he certainly didn’t want that to happen. Not only would it damage his reputation strongly, but it would also mean he would never get to see the beauty of the flower he was going to obtain, which would sadden him deeply, the nature loving side gained from his mother wanting to have a turn in his journey, rather than his fathers brute force ideals. Rick barely noticed him go round a corner, and realised that he hadn’t actually noticed it earlier when he went past. Walking into the new route, he noticed that mining obviously did happen after all, less and less of the crystals glints being in sight as he went deeper and deeper towards the end of the tunnel, heading to wherever Triz was taking him without a fuss. Bellatrix was slightly disturbed by the lack of the comforting glints, but was managing okay, not being really that fond of claustrophobic spaces, her species being born as free creatures in the calming air. Or, perhaps she would be stuck in a Combee hive all day if she was a wild pokemon. That would be something she’d definitely dislike, doing nothing all day and being pampered for wasn’t really her style. <br />
<br />
Eventually, it gets so dark that the only light he could see was a bizarre diagram on the stone floor. It illuminated Triz silhouette as he waved, but other than that, not much light was provided really. He waved at Rick, and Rick waved back, unsure if Triz was actually able to see him at this point, but when he started speaking, Rick knew that he obviously could see him. Apparently, the device was called a Telelport Circle. He listened to the explanation with much curiosity. They were able to isolate a Pokemons attack like that? Did that mean, possibly, they had a device that was able to imitate a Dittos transform attack? That would be an amazing technological feat, being able to shift someones body into that of a Pokemon, even if it was just on the circle on the ground. Apparently, though, the teleportation circle risked alerting the Pokemon to his presence, and some Pokemon may well attack him on the other side. He didn’t mind, though, he had a perfectly good team of Pokemon to disperse the opponents with. Now all Rick had to do was focus his thoughts on the location he wanted to be at. Nodding and stepping on the pattern, he closed his eyes, imagining the island that he wished to go too. Even with his eyes completely closed, he could still feel the circle working around him, and he soon felt almost weightless, light around his body giving him a very strange experience and feeling. He wasn’t quite sure if he enjoyed the feeling, though. It was nice, but he wouldn’t want to experience it more than a few times. Soon, however, he would be heading to the natural Rosalina Island, and his journey would begin…</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkslateblue">-<br />
<br />
Opening his eyes, he found himself in a completely different place to that which he had come from. A warm breeze went past his legs, and a strong scent of salt seemed to blow through the area. Suddenly, Rick felt his weight return to his body, and what a bizarre feeling that was, a sudden gain from being lighter than air itself. He almost toppled over from the strain, but managed to keep himself upright. Now, the ground below Rick was grassy rather than the bare cave floor, and the sounds of local Pokemon chattering surrounded him as he stood there. A buzz emerged from Bellatrix, and Rick looked towards the location she pointed out. It was apparently the sea, and across it Rick could just about see the mainland. A mist seemed to obscure his sight, though, or was it a mist at all? It seemed that the entire island was dark, but Rick certainly didn’t leave this early in the day for his journey. The full moon shone from above, and Rick couldn’t help but feel unnerved. A cry came from nearby, and Rick soon saw that Triz wasn’t lying about the Pokemon, a screeching Tangela lunging from the shrubbery, its vines swinging wildly. “Belle, go for a <b>Signal Beam</b> to start. Hopefully it will scare the Pokemon away.”<br />

Winds of destiny billow through the sombre atmosphere surrounding Rosalina Island; somewhere, in a distant realm beyond mortal ken, intertwining paths of fate and destiny come together. With a resolute promise made to Evelyn and others long gone, the one known as Rayne mounts another of his closely trusted teammates. A proud roar issues from her draconic voicebox as she takes to the air, shredding any offending branches with hide hardened even further from her stages of evolution, erupting into night sky like a breath of fresh air. Cruising above the forest, the Salamence guided by Drought's psychic vision, Rayne can't help but cast a glance at the heaving forest trees below; even metres above, they portray a distinct impression of hellish ghouls, grasping for quarry slipping away from above them. Meanwhile...<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool your jets, gentlemen; we're no longer alone,&quot; mutters Ogden, even as Pepper and Pathos bicker amongst themselves, before pointing at a distant shape flying over the cliff forest that takes the other two a bit of squinting through the darkness to catch an eye of. A final frown from Pepper elicits a wince from his tinged Abra before Pathos puts his hands to his head, focusing a message forward in the rough direction Ogden indicated.<br />
<br />
&lt;<i>Rayne. There's someone signalling to us. Mentally.</i>&gt; The message is enough for Rayne to signal for landing procedures to Andromeda, and with an almighty but professional arc the Salamence careens into view of the other two men, landing with a few flaps of her wings to make for as little bumps as possible. Dismounting, Rayne almost opens his mouth to speak, but pauses for a moment. What might he say? That the local Pokémon were being poisoned by an energy known only to legend? Both strangers looked outlandish at first glance, and one of them seemed heavily armed and otherwise, not particularly friendly.<br />
<br />
&lt;<i>You call that a message?</i>&gt; Pawing aside her Trainer, Drought beams over a response to the silver Abra. &lt;<i>It was so shaky I could barely tap on the same frequency to keep it going. First timers, hm?</i>&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;<i>You be quiet, you,</i>&gt; replies Pathos, little more than a squeak than a retort.<br />

<b><u>Handymankg2</u></b><br />
<br />
Instantly troubled by unfriendly locals upon your first steps into Rosalina territory, you quickly call for brief combat tactics from your starter, who buzzingly seems to dismiss the flailing Vine with a bit of disdain. Energy burning behind her eyes, Bellatrix looses a <b>Signal Beam</b> at the Tangela's feet, blasting dirt clods and damage in its wake as Tangela is knocked flying. Huffily Bella brings her arms akimbo as Tangela coughs, looking at you before screeching up a new storm that almost sounds like crying this time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Skree! Skreeeeh! SKREEEEEEH!&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsure of what to do you try moving forward, only to feel your feet caught tightly in unknown material. A few moments of swinging your arms lands you in the dirt path flat on your back, and before you know it you feel flat tendrils curl about your wrists and fingers, locking them to the ground before you can so much as struggle. Hearing a gaggle of murmurs and shrieks you bend your neck to get the best look ahead as you can, shocked to notice not one, but seven swathing creatures of vine headed towards you, waving their weedlike flagella in vindicated anger. Forced into your current position you won't be able to access your other PokéBalls, but what the wild Pokémon might lack in level, they're certainly making up for it in numbers...</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: chartreuse"><div style="text-align: center"><b><u>Nelde Ruins</u></b>&#8203;</div><br />
<b><u>Wiese Forest</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Excessive Spare Time</u></b><br />
<br />
Pressured only further by the situation, your desperation shows as you call for further instructions on putting the female Nuzleaf out of the battle. With the other Pokémon under Bide, however, the tactic of shunning him as a target is a wise if not given choice, and all too eagerly Volante and Grinder lunge for the offending female. Even with her foes at close range there is little that the female can do with a Pidgey and Aipom mauling her without mercy, and Cormag wastes little time in joining the slugfest, <b>Peck</b>ing the female without abandon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aipom!&quot; &quot;Murkrow!&quot;<br />
<br />
With a sudden blast of energy Cormag and Grinder are tossed from the Nuzleaf's torso, flung backwards in unison as they hit the dirt, still conscious but otherwise a little shaken and surprised. &quot;<b>Seed Bomb</b>... derived from Nuzleaf's <b>Nature Power</b>!&quot; realises Duessel, just as Volante comes in screeching for another of her <b>Fly</b> performances. A strike to the back of her head sends shudders through the evolved acorn, and after teetering for a while she finally gives up the ghost, crumpling to the ground in an unceremonious cloud of dust.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuz-LEAF!&quot; Punctuating the tense ambience with a warrior's cry, the forgotten male Nuzleaf releases the energy he accumulated from his <b>Bide</b>d time, to your horror striking down Volante with a malicious laser of crimson. A choked squawk is ripped from her feathered chest as she lands like a jet with engine failure, crashing by the roots of a tree. Running to her aid you scoop up your Pidgey, cradling her in your arms; while alive, the damage and overall exhaustion have taken far too much of a toll on her. Behind you, Aipom yelps a cringe of his own -- although with less damage taken, the continual combinations are wearing him out, more surely than slowly as the moments pass...</span></span></div>

You probably all saw this coming, but we have a double adventure in the house. Dark Fire, no problem at all, although the self-updating is a little bit no-no. Glad to see how it works for you, though; players familiar with a series for the Playstation may recognise where it's going.

</blockquote>Oi, sorry about that. I knew that was boderline self updating, but figured I wasn't making Deoxys appear out of thin air, so I went ahead anyway. Won't happen again, promise.<br />
And I'm not quite sure where this adventure is heading actually ... but it's all good. I'm stoked!<br />
Also, seeing as this is a double adventure now, I'm guessing you don't have any issues with SW and I having back and forth replies to develop our conversations. Right?</span><br />

</blockquote><span style="color: DarkSlateBlue"><span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua'">Rayne’s eyes watered a bit as the humid night air whistled past his not so aerodynamic body. Below, the forest canopy whizzed by at a tremendous pace, looking as if it was but a shaggy rug being pulled from underneath the airborne trio. Andromeda, guided by Drought’s mental vision of the cliff path, beat her wings in a steady rhythm, producing the only sound that broke the spooky silence about them. Somehow this rather ordinary flight seemed so much more; driven by fate or maybe even bad luck. In either case, Rayne scanned the horizon with determination, trying to spot the trainers Evelyn had mentioned … nothing.<br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… Rayne. There's someone signalling to us. Mentally. …&gt;</i> Drought’s thought projection broke his concentration. <br />
<br />
“Friend or foe?” Rayne asked briskly.<br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… I can’t tell. The message was, well, weak. It came from the cliff path though. Right where we entered the forest, I may add. …&gt;</i> Was Drought’s calm response. <i>&lt;… I’m letting Andromeda know. …&gt;</i> The dragon sprang into action almost immediately after Drought uttered those words. Andromeda’s back muscles flexed, her wings spread wide and arched in such a way that sped them up even further. Rayne had to lay flat on her back, least he be blown right off. With a mighty flap of her wings she sent her body into a wide arc, before nose diving straight for the forest’s edge. Rayne shut his eyes; he never liked Andromeda’s landing procedures, but never doubted her abilities. Just as suddenly as she had shifted her body to pick up some speed, Andromeda yet again used her powerful muscles to slow their descent. It only took several beats to have them just about hovering in one place. Rayne peeked over Andromeda’s shoulder and noticed two trainers, who were reciprocating his curious stare. Slowly the Salamence brought them back to earth, landing lightly for someone her size. <br />
<br />
Rayne dismounted his Salamence, patting her on the side as he walked towards the two strangers. He was just about to speak when he once again felt insecure about revealing what he had found out. Drought had no such problem, nudging her trainer as she walked past him. <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… You call that a message? It was so shaky I could barely tap on the same frequency to keep it going. First timers, hm? …&gt;</i> She beamed over at the Abra, which Rayne only noticed just then … it was silver! Rayne couldn’t help but smile a little. What were the chances both their psychicly endowed pokemon were discoloured? Rayne could tell the Abra responded to Drought’s condescending comment, but couldn’t make it out, the link was not strong enough; perhaps it was still in the early stages of its mental development. <br />
<br />
A few more moments of silence ensued, and Rayne was beginning to feel uncomfortable. He looked up at the Abra’s trainer and to his surprise, recognized him. Sort of. He had seen this trainer around; before going on his hiatus. He was certain of it; maybe it was at the Bar, or the Cable Club, or maybe the Daycare. Rayne had definitely seen him before, but was not familiar with his name. His mind raced to try to come up with a name to no avail. Stumped, he looked at the other man; this man he had never seen before. He sent off a strange vibe, and judging by that lance he was carrying probably was a little kooky. <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… Drought. See if you can tap the strange guy’s thoughts. Be discrete. …&gt;</i> Rayne commanded. <br />
<br />
“Uhm … hey … guys.” Rayne started out, not quite sure of what he was going to say. “I’m Rayne. This here is Drought … don’t touch her … she’ll bite your hand off. And that’s Andromeda.” He said pointing at his Salamence, who in her excitement of being mentioned started flapping her wings and beating her tail, uprooting the unfortunate trees which were within its range. “She’s a bit excitable.” As he said that he snapped off her pokeball and recalled her, knowing full well he’ll call on her again in the near future.<br />
<br />
“Anyway … I’m pretty sure I know you, or rather, I’ve seen you around before. I can’t say I remember your name though.” Rayne said, looking over at the Abra’s trainer. “What are you guys doing here?”</span></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: DarkSlateBlue"><i><span style="font-size: 9px"><i>Pepper grumbled. A short capture and flee adventure was turning into something alittle more than he bargained for. All in all, he couldn't help but feel sympathetic towards Ogden and his missing friends. Somewhere on this island a great evil must have taken place, but what could it have been.. and could it still be lurking in the shadows. He turned toward Pathos, who was attempting send a message to unknown danger, and wondered if he'll ever reach his true potential. If he only knew the power he could posses if he only dedicated himself. Maybe destiny brought them here to push them to the limit, forcing both trainer and pokemon to grow, learn, and find some kickass treasures.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm beginning to think we're in over our heads, Path.. I mean, we could be leading some serial killer or granny strangler straight to us,&quot; Pepper was breathing heavily. He knew that this world was built on the unexpected, and it should be expeceted. If Abra fainted, Ogden would not hesitate to bludgeon the both of them. 'Watch yourself, now.. I don't exactly like the idea of putting our entire trust in this stranger..' he whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool your jets, gentlemen; we're no longer alone,&quot; mutters Ogden, pointing at a distant shape flying over the cliff forest Pepper couldn't figure out what it could be. <br />
Whatever it was, it was closing in fast. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think they got my message,&quot; mumbled the silver fox. &quot;and it gave me a gosh darn headache doing so. Please, don't make me do that again, I'm just to fragile..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fragile my foot! If you only knew the incredible power you have at your disposal, but you constantly whine and moan about pointless matters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I moan about anything it's all your doing, fool. I'm beginning to thing you're taking advantage of me, and I don't like it!&quot;<br />
<br />
*THUMP* Before either of them could notice the creature seen flying in the distance revealed itself to be a Salamence, the Dragon Pokemon. And riding on it's back was a young man, no older than himself, and a Ninetales also. A shiver shot down his spine. Pepper looked at Pathos as he eyed the Fire Type, noticeably unnerved. &quot;You be quiet, you,&quot; he squeaked.<br />
<br />
Pepper sighed, &quot;Whaa the fhuuuhh.. I didn't say anything to you,&quot; he said with a small whine. &quot;I think you two should let me handle the introductions. You give off this child molester vibe, Patrick, no offence or anything,&quot; he said smiling sweetly at him. &quot;I think I've seen this person before, on television or in the FizzyBee Bar.. I don't know for sure,&quot; Pepper said trying his best to remember where he could have met the trainer. Through the years he has met many trainers from many parts of the world, it wouldn't be much of a shock running into a familiar face in this realm.<br />
<br />
It started out with a few seconds of awkward silence before the stranger spoke, oddly before Mr. Ogden. &quot;Yo yo whats up homeboy, the names Rayne. This here is Drought … don’t touch her … she’ll bite your hand off. And that’s Andromeda.” He said pointing at his Salamence, who in her excitement of being mentioned started flapping her wings and beating her tail, uprooting the unfortunate trees which were within its range. “She’s a bit excitable.” As he said that he snapped off her pokeball and recalled her, knowing full well he’ll call on her again in the near future.<br />
<br />
“Anyway … I’m pretty sure I know you, or rather, I’ve seen you around before. I can’t say I remember your name though.” Rayne said, looking over at the Abra’s trainer. “What are you guys doing here?”<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew it! Your that weather man from the channel six news, Rainy Stormyweathers?&quot; he said talking for the first time whilst looking intently at Drought. Pathos seemed deep in thought reading over what could be shared thoughts between the two ... did he even understand what they all said? Just as Pepper was about to speak Pathos pointed a clawed finger at his pokeball, withdrawing himself with his psychic abilities ... . Pepper glared at him and he grinned back sheepishly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot; And so, The Diddler plunged into his tale.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Pepper and the man to my right is Mr. Ogden. I heard rumors about the wild and feral pokemon that inhabit this land and decided to hunt down a beast or two. Patrick here lost his friends Evangeline and John, apparently they went missing here some time ago.. When I first arrived I was met by a wild golbat that didn't seem all to friendly, though what golbat ever is. This scruffy fellow decided to play hero and swipe the bat with his fancy weapon there and then we made our way here, after he informed me that there was another person on this island, strangled enough I have no clue how he knew you were here..&quot;</i> <br />

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray"> <i>♪ ~ Ding ding dingdingding! ~ ♪</i> The PokeCenter’s HP Restore Machine whistled a familiar tune as it went through its well-rehearsed task of healing energy-depleted Pokemon. Six lights flashed on-and-off rhythmically, keeping perfect time with the whirring machine. On a cushioned bench in the nearby waiting area, a black-clad trainer drifted in and out of sleep while he waited for his partners to be rejuvenated. A magazine lay on his lap, open to an article on the mysterious Mireno Cemetery.<br />
<br />
All at once a feminine voice hollered out the trainer's name, rousing him from slumber. “Hale?! William Hale?!”<br />
<br />
At the sound of his name, the trainer's grey-green eyes snapped open, and he sat bolt upright. It had been a while since anyone had called him by his first name, and for a moment he wondered how the woman knew it. But as she repeated her summons, he realized the Center's computer scanner must have automatically uploaded the profile information from his Trainer ID Card to its database when he checked his team in.<br />
<br />
The receptionist continued to page him, but he hesitated, pondering for a moment that it was now just over a year since he had arrived in the curious land of FB. Seeking to bury his former life and start over fresh, the boy had traveled under his middle name, Benjamin, up til now, hoping that one day it would help him finally put his past behind him. During the previous twelve months, he had gone on many strange adventures, encountered a variety of Pokemon, and met a number of unforgettable people. Time and again he found himself in situations where he had the opportunity to fight for justice, help those in need, and stand up for the defenseless. <br />
<br />
As the receptionist once again called his name, the black clad boy put on a determined expression and resolved to continue on his quest to lend aid to anyone who needed it, no matter what it cost him. He knew he had made the right decision to give up his former way of life, but he wasn’t so sure if it had been right to try to change his identity. Sitting there in the waiting room of the PokeCenter, he realized the time for hiding out under his middle name was over. It was time to accept who he was, starting with acknowledging his true name.<br />
<br />
“William Hale are you here or not?!” the woman repeated again, this time with more than a touch of irritation. It was nearing her break time, and this overdue trainer was begin to irk her. “If you don’t get up here in ten seconds, it’ll take more than an HP Restore Machine to heal <b>YOU</b>! One, two, three…”<br />
<br />
At the sound of the woman’s good-natured threat, the trainer sprang to his feet, haphazardly sending the magazine on his lap to the floor. He hastily raised his hand in reply and dashed across the reception room to the woman’s workstation, as she continued with her countdown. The six Poke Balls housing his loyal traveling companions sat in a box on a nearby countertop.<br />
<br />
“Are you William Hale?” the nurse asked in annoyance. “It sure took you long enough to answer.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, that’s me… I’m Will.” the boy replied, grinning sheepishly. “Sorry, I guess my mind was somewhere <i>else</i>.”<br />
<br />
The nurse’s countenance softened at the boy’s sincere apology. Teenagers were always the same she mused. She waved it off and reached for the box holding his containment orbs. Handing it over to him, she nodded politely and remarked, “Well anyways, thanks for waiting. I’ve restored your Pokemon to full health. Remember we’re here if you need us, and we hope to serve you again.”<br />
<br />
Will returned the woman’s nod with a grateful one of his own, placed his Poke Balls in the grey canvas messenger bag he had slung across his back, and turned to leave.<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray"><b><u>Mireno Cemetery</u> - please reply in darkslategray</b><br />
A subterranean cemetery built under the decaying city of Mireno. Little remains of the original city which has long since fallen to destruction and decay, but most of note is the underground catacombs where demons are said to walk, even after death. According to legend, the Cemetery houses, amongst others, the bodies of six priests who used their power to open a way to what archives describe as the &quot;holy land&quot;. Vicious Pokémon now live in the area, toughened by the unforgiving terrain, and will attack anything that gets in their way. Within the deepest areas of the cemetery, amongst the graves and traps, ominous powers are said to sleep, awaiting anyone foolhardy enough to plumb its deepest, darkest secrets...<br />
<b>Ghost Town</b><br />
The only remains of Mireno left standing, this crumbling hamlet is a place where thieves often lurk and hide, far away from the eyes of authority. Adventurers often find their inventory compromised when they stay too long in this area, but some have also found snippets of thieves' intel on how to evade many a trap and danger.<br />
<b>Pilgrimage Way</b><br />
A dark path found under the surface of the Ghost Town which leads into the actual cemetery. Peculiarly bright torches, said to have illuminated the passage since they were lit, line the walls of this gloomy cavern.<br />
<b>Cemetery Entrance</b><br />
An area infested with ivy that forms a central junction between the catacombs and the underground lake. Trap entrances prevent anyone from entering further areas without first finding the key to unlock them...<br />
<b>Catacombs</b><br />
Divided into a north and south region, the catacombs are said to hold the bodies of the six Priests who found a way to the &quot;holy land&quot;, alongside other individuals who sought great power in strength and magic. Their graves are believed to still possess the forbidden power and knowledge they received, but these are also said to be guarded by minions, centuries after death.<br />
<b>Underground Lake</b><br />
An area beyond the Cemetery, this lake formed from rainwater that seeped through the ground, slowly pooling here in a hole deep in the layers of rock. Although the waters look clear, the lake is a lot deeper than it appears, and rumours say that if the waters of the lake could be drained, the gateway to a gruesomely evil power will open.<br />
<b>Crystal Sanctuary</b><br />
A remote region accessible only by strange magic circles about the Underground Lake. Giant crystals of various colours lie embedded in the pitch-black walls within chambers inaccessible between each other, but on inspection little else of interest seems to lie here... or does it?<br />
<b>Pieta</b><br />
This area, said to lie somewhere beyond the Underground Lake, appears to exude death itself. Poisonous fungi line its depths, making breathing nigh impossible. Death itself is believed to reside in the furthest sector, though few have survived in their futile attempts to prove this.</span></span>

Some time later, Will stood in front of the crumbling remains of Mireno, a look of apprehension on his face. A veteran of many journeys, his nervousness didn't come from the uncertainity surrounding the adventure he was about to embark on, but rather from its grim location. He had come to this remote area to do a bit of exploring, but as he scanned his eerie surroundings he was suddenly hit by a sense of foreboding. Shuddering, he took a tentative step forward. <br />
<br />
“Maybe coming here wasn’t such a good idea after all,” he muttered under his breath. “I’ve got a bad feeling about this…”</span><br />

I had a blast in Talas and know this adventure is going to be unforgettable as well. I quoted the entire area, because I read that we have to start at the top subarea and work our way through. So, I'm currently at the Ghost Town, right? I purposely didn't state it specifically because I didn't want to inadvertently skip something.<br />
<br />
As always let me know if I do something wrong, or if you think there is anything I can improve on. The first part of my post wasn't meant to be self-updating, just my attempt at explaining my chara's name change, so if it comes across that way, please don't be offended.<br />

<span style="color: DarkSlateBlue"><i><span style="font-size: 9px"><i>Pepper grumbled. A short capture and flee adventure was turning into something alittle more than he bargained for. All in all, he couldn't help but feel sympathetic towards Ogden and his missing friends. Somewhere on this island a great evil must have taken place, but what could it have been.. and could it still be lurking in the shadows. He turned toward Pathos, who was attempting send a message to unknown danger, and wondered if he'll ever reach his true potential. If he only knew the power he could posses if he only dedicated himself. Maybe destiny brought them here to push them to the limit, forcing both trainer and pokemon to grow, learn, and find some kickass treasures.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm beginning to think we're in over our heads, Path.. I mean, we could be leading some serial killer or granny strangler straight to us,&quot; Pepper was breathing heavily. He knew that this world was built on the unexpected, and it should be expeceted. If Abra fainted, Ogden would not hesitate to bludgeon the both of them. 'Watch yourself, now.. I don't exactly like the idea of putting our entire trust in this stranger..' he whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool your jets, gentlemen; we're no longer alone,&quot; mutters Ogden, pointing at a distant shape flying over the cliff forest Pepper couldn't figure out what it could be. <br />
Whatever it was, it was closing in fast. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think they got my message,&quot; mumbled the silver fox. &quot;and it gave me a gosh darn headache doing so. Please, don't make me do that again, I'm just to fragile..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fragile my foot! If you only knew the incredible power you have at your disposal, but you constantly whine and moan about pointless matters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I moan about anything it's all your doing, fool. I'm beginning to thing you're taking advantage of me, and I don't like it!&quot;<br />
<br />
*THUMP* Before either of them could notice the creature seen flying in the distance revealed itself to be a Salamence, the Dragon Pokemon. And riding on it's back was a young man, no older than himself, and a Ninetales also. A shiver shot down his spine. Pepper looked at Pathos as he eyed the Fire Type, noticeably unnerved. &quot;You be quiet, you,&quot; he squeaked.<br />
<br />
Pepper sighed, &quot;Whaa the fhuuuhh.. I didn't say anything to you,&quot; he said with a small whine. &quot;I think you two should let me handle the introductions. You give off this child molester vibe, Patrick, no offence or anything,&quot; he said smiling sweetly at him. &quot;I think I've seen this person before, on television or in the FizzyBee Bar.. I don't know for sure,&quot; Pepper said trying his best to remember where he could have met the trainer. Through the years he has met many trainers from many parts of the world, it wouldn't be much of a shock running into a familiar face in this realm.<br />
<br />
It started out with a few seconds of awkward silence before the stranger spoke, oddly before Mr. Ogden. &quot;Yo yo whats up homeboy, the names Rayne. This here is Drought … don’t touch her … she’ll bite your hand off. And that’s Andromeda.” He said pointing at his Salamence, who in her excitement of being mentioned started flapping her wings and beating her tail, uprooting the unfortunate trees which were within its range. “She’s a bit excitable.” As he said that he snapped off her pokeball and recalled her, knowing full well he’ll call on her again in the near future.<br />
<br />
“Anyway … I’m pretty sure I know you, or rather, I’ve seen you around before. I can’t say I remember your name though.” Rayne said, looking over at the Abra’s trainer. “What are you guys doing here?”<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew it! Your that weather man from the channel six news, Rainy Stormyweathers?&quot; he said talking for the first time whilst looking intently at Drought. Pathos seemed deep in thought reading over what could be shared thoughts between the two ... did he even understand what they all said? Just as Pepper was about to speak Pathos pointed a clawed finger at his pokeball, withdrawing himself with his psychic abilities ... . Pepper glared at him and he grinned back sheepishly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot; And so, The Diddler plunged into his tale.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Pepper and the man to my right is Mr. Ogden. I heard rumors about the wild and feral pokemon that inhabit this land and decided to hunt down a beast or two. Patrick here lost his friends Evangeline and John, apparently they went missing here some time ago.. When I first arrived I was met by a wild golbat that didn't seem all to friendly, though what golbat ever is. This scruffy fellow decided to play hero and swipe the bat with his fancy weapon there and then we made our way here, after he informed me that there was another person on this island, strangled enough I have no clue how he knew you were here..&quot;</i> <br />

</blockquote><span style="color: DarkSlateBlue"><span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua'">&quot;I knew it! Your that weather man from the channel six news, Rainy Stormyweathers?&quot; The Abra's trainer asked excitedly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh. No ... I don't know what you're talking about ...&quot; Rayne answered, a little wearily. How did this trainer recognize him? He had done a couple segments for channel six in his hiatus to make ends meet, but he wasn't a permanent part of the news team. Rainy Stormyweathers, what a stupid screen name they made him take on. His reminiscence was cut short when the Abra recalled itself into its own ball, and the trainer went ahead and introduced himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Pepper and the man to my right is Mr. Ogden.&quot; Pepper ... the name didn't ring a bell, but it was good to finally match the face to a name. &quot;I heard rumors about the wild and feral pokemon that inhabit this land and decided to hunt down a beast or two. Patrick here lost his friends Evangeline and John, apparently they went missing here some time ago.. When I first arrived I was met by a wild Golbat that didn't seem all to friendly, though what Golbat ever is.&quot; He went on.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hear ya ...&quot; Rayne interupted, nodding his head at the mention of those dang bats. <br />
<br />
&quot;This scruffy fellow decided to play hero and swipe the bat with his fancy weapon there and then we made our way here, after he informed me that there was another person on this island, strangled enough I have no clue how he knew you were here..&quot; Pepper concluded. Rayne looked at the odd man, then back at Pepper. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait did you say Evangeline and John?&quot; Rayne had a sudden moment of realisation. &quot;You're sure it's Evangeline and John, not Evelyn and James?&quot; Rayne asked, aiming the question mainly at Mr. Odgen.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DarkSlateBlue"><span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua'">&quot;I knew it! Your that weather man from the channel six news, Rainy Stormyweathers?&quot; The Abra's trainer asked excitedly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh. No ... I don't know what you're talking about ...&quot; Rayne answered, a little wearily. How did this trainer recognize him? He had done a couple segments for channel six in his hiatus to make ends meet, but he wasn't a permanent part of the news team. Rainy Stormyweathers, what a stupid screen name they made him take on. His reminiscence was cut short when the Abra recalled itself into its own ball, and the trainer went ahead and introduced himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Pepper and the man to my right is Mr. Ogden.&quot; Pepper ... the name didn't ring a bell, but it was good to finally match the face to a name. &quot;I heard rumors about the wild and feral pokemon that inhabit this land and decided to hunt down a beast or two. Patrick here lost his friends Evangeline and John, apparently they went missing here some time ago.. When I first arrived I was met by a wild Golbat that didn't seem all to friendly, though what Golbat ever is.&quot; He went on.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hear ya ...&quot; Rayne interupted, nodding his head at the mention of those dang bats. <br />
<br />
&quot;This scruffy fellow decided to play hero and swipe the bat with his fancy weapon there and then we made our way here, after he informed me that there was another person on this island, strangled enough I have no clue how he knew you were here..&quot; Pepper concluded. Rayne looked at the odd man, then back at Pepper. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait did you say Evangeline and John?&quot; Rayne had a sudden moment of realisation. &quot;You're sure it's Evangeline and John, not Evelyn and James?&quot; Rayne asked, aiming the question mainly at Mr. Odgen.</span></span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><i>@Shadow: Sorry if we're forbidden, just wanted to release my Ledah again. :&lt;</i></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: DarkSlateBlue"><span style="font-size: 9px">Pepper clenched Pathos' pokebal tightly in his hand, his childish behavior was growing tiresome. Shaking the ball violently, <i>'You like this, huh? I'm not going to stop until you get your ass back out here,'</i> he spoke mentally, but effort was of little avail. He took a second glance at Drought, then it finally struck him. Ninetales are said to share psychic-type characteristics, perhaps Rayne and Drought could assist in training his inexperienced Abra.<br />
<br />
While Rayne now had his attention set on Mr. Ogden, Pepper took time to take a deep breath, the crisp night air was refreshing. He had forgotten why he had come here in the first place, and that was for Ledahs benefit. Clipping Pathos' plain red and white pokeball onto his belt and replacing it with a Light &amp; Dark blue Net Ball, Ledah's pokeball. A quick press of the release mechanism and his twilight Ledian burst unto the scene once again. Her cosmic dust glimmering in the midnight setting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leeedian..&quot; she exhaled, what souned like a sigh of extasy. Pepper threw his back pack onto the ground, rummaging through the countless number of usless items he had collected over time, until whipping out a bottle of <a href="http://bmgf.bulbagarden.net/showpost.php?p=1208564&amp;postcount=1959" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fbmgf.bulbagarden.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D1208564%26postcount%3D1959&amp;hash=b5233f60de9634e024656eab94a3a0c8" rel="nofollow noopener">Fresh Water</a>, a favorite of any parched pogie, and tossed it to Ledah.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait did you say Evangeline and John?&quot; Rayne had a sudden moment of realisation. &quot;You're sure it's Evangeline and John, not Evelyn and James?&quot; Rayne asked, aiming the question mainly at Mr. Odgen.<br />
<br />
God damn his short term memory, though if it didn't involve food or benefit him in some way he typically wouldn't remember. &quot;It could have been,&quot; said Pepper, as a large, comic sweatdrop appeared at his head. &quot;This whole situation is rather confusing.. Patrick, would you mind giving us a few more details on <i>YOUR</i> past? Momma used to say 'The best place to start is from the beginning', she sure did.&quot;</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper">No problem, Hayward. As a note, gentlemen, my home Internet these days is highly uncooperative; I suspect holidays are stretching the provision. Sorry these couldn't be out earlier.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslateblue"><div style="text-align: center"><b><u>Lacrima Castle</u></b>&#8203;</div><br />
<b><u>Wilheim Path</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Dark Fire &amp; SilverWind</u></b><br />
&quot;It's <i>Evelyn and James</i>! Really now, Pepper. Listening to the both of you, I'd almost sooner take my chances with the castle,&quot; snaps Ogden, before relaxing the grip on his weapon. A deep weariness seems to set into his eyes, distant and dreary, as he begins his story as requested.<br />
<br />
&quot;James, Evelyn, and I... we were the best of friends. Went to the same Trainers' school, and while we eventually went separate in specialisations little could break the bonds we shared. Elementary turned to college and then, when we were twenty-two years of age, both James and I realised that Evelyn meant far more to us than platonic friends,&quot; the man half mutters, half sighs. &quot;We shared a rivalry, me and James, aggressive yet amiable -- I don't think she ever knew. But I eventually realised we went about love in different manners. I sought to protect her; he sought simply to care for her. Evelyn was never the confrontational sort, and her choice in the field of healing showed this. She would not be able to accept the code of bloodshed by which I lived and I could not change for her sake.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was twenty-five years ago. I forged my own path, serving mercenary duties as I saw fit, improving myself in combat and experience. The last I saw of them was at their marriage, and we would keep in touch by a messenger Starly they kept... But the last I heard from them was fifteen years ago. I spent the time then tracking them down, finding many a broken lead... until the path led me here.&quot; Looking up, Ogden turns to glare at Rayne as the fingers re-tighten about his lance. &quot;Now that it's all said and done... what would <i>you</i> know about James and Evelyn? What could you possib -- <i>What in Mount Coronet?!</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
As Ogden interruptedly stares at Rayne's chest, the trainer in question looks down; a soft pulse of cerulean light emanating from where the talisman lies. &quot;You! Rayne! What are you concealing?&quot; demands Ogden, an act that has Rayne hissing and Andromeda snarling. Hurriedly calming them down Rayne produces the artifact for all to see, and at once accusation flies across Ogden's eyes. &quot;Bandit!&quot; he snarls, and in a single flicker he draws his spear but a centimetre from Rayne's neck; in spite of his Pokémon baying and howling at the fighter Rayne motions for them to stay put. &quot;Explain how you procured that necklace, or I'll cut you down where you stand!&quot;<br />
<br />
In spite of the sweat running down his neck Rayne repeats a synopsis of what he'd only just learned, though its completion hardly makes him feel any better. With two and two added together he can't tell how Ogden might otherwise react to the news, and Pepper if anything seems mildly amused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Evelyn's <i>dead</i>? And James as well? What do you take me for, a troglodyte?!&quot; roars Ogden, his weapon maintained at its same dangerous distance. &quot;More likely, you were the one who caused their deaths for your own cruel agendas!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>...Patrick, it's fine. You can believe him.</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That...!&quot; A waver ripples across his face like a pebble on a pond, and feeling the keen edge draw away Rayne looks in the direction of the talisman, seeing a shimmer of light surround the object. Dazedly Rayne presents the warrior with the jewel, Ogden accepting the crystal with an equally stunned expression. Energies of unidentifiable realms and knowledge swirl about the talisman, taking shape and form, but two of the three men already know the silhouette's identity.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Evelyn.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Patrick,</i>&quot; the miniature image of Evelyn whispers, smiling in the same gentle manner she was known for. &quot;It's been far, far too long, my dear friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What... What twist of fate is this?&quot; Even as he croaks the dread is distinct in the warrior's voice; fear of affirmation in what he has come to realise. &quot;Evelyn... you... you're...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry we had to meet like this, Patrick. But it's true; I am no longer a part of this world as you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;By the legends... no. It's true; it's all true.&quot; Wrinkles crease horribly in Ogden's brow. &quot;How could this have come to be? You... I saw the both of you, that day. He promised he would take care of you, he would make you happy! How could he have let this happen?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Patrick... I'm sorry. I told Rayne this; there was nothing that could be done.&quot; A gust of wind breezes, shuffling the leaves and grasses, sending a shimmer through the phantasmal image. &quot;James blamed himself, much like you are now. But what he did... was against the will of nature. Rayne gave but a partial account of the horrors he underwent for my sake... please, Patrick. I need you to join with these men into Lacrima Castle and destroy my body. It's the only way to save this wretched soul of mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Destroy... no! What would I do in a world without you?&quot; Ogden screams, anguish clear in his voice though shedding no tears. &quot;James is gone, and now I have to lose you?! The days we shared, the friendship we forged... All these years it's kept me alive; the hope we might come together again!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Patrick... Forgive me. For what I put you through then, and what I put you through even now.&quot; Quietly speaking, Evelyn raises a hand to touch the war-scarred cheek of her friend. &quot;But there no longer remains anything else you can do. The world I loved will suffer if you do not help me... There is little else I can say, and little longer I can remain. The talisman's protective powers will only hold me here for so long. Rayne, Pepper... please aid Patrick as best you can. Patrick... please, do not mourn my death. I chose to give my life to the world; the world took my life as it saw fit. You must do as the world requires...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...&quot; Unbearable silence sinks into the company, as Evelyn's final words are whisked away; her wraithly shape lost into the night wind, leaving the talisman sparkling in Ogden's shaking hand. Even Drought and Andromeda, hostile only moments earlier, have become oddly subdued at the tense atmosphere.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it...&quot; A crack of a knuckle sends a jolt up everyone's spine, before you realise that Ogden's other hand had gripped his lightning lance hard enough to hurt just by looking.<br />
<br />
&quot;DAMN IT ALL TO <i>HELL!</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
Survival instinct kicks in as Drought shoves Rayne aside and Ledah tugs Pepper backwards; a reflex proven timely as Ogden brandishes his spear through the air. A dull breaking sound is heard, followed by a resounding crash as the trunk of a nearby tree slides down its severed scar, Ogden having struck it down by sheer force in his rage and grief. Howling in unintelligible roars he tears for the castle's bridge, and after exchanging a series of glances the two trainers find no other option but to follow suit. Gravel, wood, marble; various materials torn from their places, lie strewn in a trail of unrestrained destruction, leading the both of them and their Pokémon to the raving Patrick in the moonlit garden.<br />
<br />
&quot;Forbidden beasts and demons, accursed spirits, spawn of evil!&quot; he roars, lashing at another bunch of hedged shrubs and decapacitating them, scattering leaves and sounds of scurrying Pokémon. &quot;You destroyed my friends -- I'll destroy you all! I'll purge this land of your existence! Come by the horde; I'll tear you down with this castle brick by blasted brick!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Skull!&quot; &quot;Skull!&quot; &quot;Skull!&quot;<br />
<br />
As if in response to Ogden's war cries, a miasma of tittering is heard above you; before long you spot a crowd of Duskull descend from nowhere upon your group. Twenty? Thirty? No one is sure as they weave amongst each other like vultures upon a corpse. &quot;You again,&quot; hisses Ogden, and just as a thought that nothing might surprise either of you passes by, rings of electricity flicker through Ogden's lance until the weapon is rife with sparkles. &quot;This won't be like the last time...&quot;</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkslategray"><div style="text-align: center"><b><u>Mireno Cemetery</u></b>&#8203;</div><br />
<b><u>Ghost Town</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Hayward</u></b><br />
No longer the amateur explorer you once were, Mireno Cemetery is but another location you select for your resumé of adventures, although if your experience is anything to go by a quick, cursory glance promptly gives you second thoughts. You have nothing to fear if this was another simple trip, and even your history of journeying is by no means anything to sniff at, but the same soldier's sense has you unnerved even now. The last time you trekked in ruins it led you on a quest of most dangerous proportions and this deathly village seemed no different. Eventually though you steel yourself before proceeding onward into the town's parameters.<br />
<br />
Memories of your first adventure alone, drawn by the recollection of your past, resurface in your mind as you leave small dust clouds in the wake of your footsteps. The adventure you encountered in ancient ruins placed you in an abandoned civilisation, void of its past grandeur, but this was different. Mireno's ghost town simply appears to exude no hope; it seems to have, at some point, had whatever life it might have possessed drained away, leaving the empty husk with you as its only apparent occupant. Or was <i>torn away</i> a better descriptor? You can half imagine a plague of some sort falling upon the town, whisking away its life force like a reaper's scythe, leaving the screaming shell of its victim behind.<br />
<br />
<i>Karakarakara.</i><br />
<br />
The unexpected sound of crumbling rock makes you jump, causing you to pause for an immediate inspection. From the shadows cloaking one of many collapsing walls a small, implike figure emerges, looking about inquisitively with eyes of diamond until both your gazes meet. &quot;Sableye!&quot; it exclaims, jumping up and down at the sight of you. Looks like you're not the only easily shaken one today...</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Memories of your first adventure alone, drawn by the recollection of your past, resurface in your mind as you leave small dust clouds in the wake of your footsteps. The adventure you encountered in ancient ruins placed you in an abandoned civilisation, void of its past grandeur, but this was different. Mireno's ghost town simply appears to exude no hope; it seems to have, at some point, had whatever life it might have possessed drained away, leaving the empty husk with you as its only apparent occupant. Or was <i>torn away</i> a better descriptor? You can half imagine a plague of some sort falling upon the town, whisking away its life force like a reaper's scythe, leaving the screaming shell of its victim behind.</span></span><br />

From the shadows cloaking one of many collapsing walls a small, implike figure emerges, looking about inquisitively with eyes of diamond until both your gazes meet. &quot;Sableye!&quot; it exclaims, jumping up and down at the sight of you. Looks like you're not the only easily shaken one today...</span></span>

<br />
<span style="color: darkslategray"><span style="font-size: 9px">In Mireno’s Ghost T</span><span style="font-size: 9px">own, the trainer Will Hale bolted in surprise at the sound of falling rubble. Freezing instantly, he warily surveyed the bleak landscape for a second time. Try as he might, he just couldn’t shake the hopeless feeling that radiated from every derelict structure, forlorn edifice, and forgotten corner of the eerie town. It was as if all the vitality that had once been there, had been cruelly ripped away. Will couldn’t imagine that anything would still be living in such an accursed place. Although, <i>living</i>, he admitted, was perhaps too subjective a term.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Just then, a tiny demonesque creature materialized from out of the shadows of a nearby building and Will bolted in shock at its mischievous appearance. It turned its jeweled eyes on the boy, a look of curiosity creeping across its small face. As their gazes briefly met, the Darkness Pokemon let out a shrill cry of <i>“Sableye!”</i> and immediately began hopping up and down. Will hesitated, then took a step backward. It was obvious he had startled the little one, and he wasn’t quite sure how it would react. </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">The specie’s reputation as a prankster preceded it, and Will knew that particularly lonely Sableye were known to play pranks on unsuspecting travelers to satisfy their craving for attention. Watching the creature dance about, Will also recalled having heard stories that claimed a Sableye could steal a person’s soul if that person looked deep enough into the Pokemon's diamond eyes. He didn’t know if that tale were true or just an urban legend. Either way, he wasn't going to put it to the test. </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Slowly, Will raised his left hand, palm out, trying to calm the agitated Sableye. He knew that their species generally preferred to lead solitary lives, but he didn’t want to chance anything. Not here at least. As a dual, dark and ghost type, the boy knew the creature had no known weaknesses, and he shuddered at the thought of facing off against a swarm of the little purple imps. Nor did he want the Sableye’s antics to alert any other unsavory creatures that might be lurking about the abandoned village.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">“Whoa, mate. Steady.” Will cooed. “I didn’t mean to scare you. I’m just passing through, and If you don’t mind, I think I’ll be on my way now…” He tried to appear friendly, but like a Wild West gunslinger awaiting a <i>high noon showdown</i>, his right hand drifted towards his bag and the Pokeballs within. Just in case. Fearing the loss of his soul, Will tried his best to avoid direct eye contact as he cautiously tried to back away, but all the same, he never let his gaze stray from the Sableye. Whether it chose to fight him, prank him, or leave him alone, he was going to let it make the next move. Since he didn’t think the last option was likely, he resolved to be ready for anything…</span></span><br />

Pressured only further by the situation, your desperation shows as you call for further instructions on putting the female Nuzleaf out of the battle. With the other Pokémon under Bide, however, the tactic of shunning him as a target is a wise if not given choice, and all too eagerly Volante and Grinder lunge for the offending female. Even with her foes at close range there is little that the female can do with a Pidgey and Aipom mauling her without mercy, and Cormag wastes little time in joining the slugfest, <b>Peck</b>ing the female without abandon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aipom!&quot; &quot;Murkrow!&quot;<br />
<br />
With a sudden blast of energy Cormag and Grinder are tossed from the Nuzleaf's torso, flung backwards in unison as they hit the dirt, still conscious but otherwise a little shaken and surprised. &quot;<b>Seed Bomb</b>... derived from Nuzleaf's <b>Nature Power</b>!&quot; realises Duessel, just as Volante comes in screeching for another of her <b>Fly</b> performances. A strike to the back of her head sends shudders through the evolved acorn, and after teetering for a while she finally gives up the ghost, crumpling to the ground in an unceremonious cloud of dust.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuz-LEAF!&quot; Punctuating the tense ambience with a warrior's cry, the forgotten male Nuzleaf releases the energy he accumulated from his <b>Bide</b>d time, to your horror striking down Volante with a malicious laser of crimson. A choked squawk is ripped from her feathered chest as she lands like a jet with engine failure, crashing by the roots of a tree. Running to her aid you scoop up your Pidgey, cradling her in your arms; while alive, the damage and overall exhaustion have taken far too much of a toll on her. Behind you, Aipom yelps a cringe of his own -- although with less damage taken, the continual combinations are wearing him out, more surely than slowly as the moments pass...</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: chartreuse">The girl's Pidgey had been knocked out cold. Her Aipom was in pain and exhausted, and now they had a disgruntled (and rather belligerent) plant being with which they needed to settle a score. And the first thing that went through the girl's head as she stared at the angry Nuzleaf was: <i>Even better than I coulda planned it.</i> The girl envisioned that she would end up with only one soldier fit for battle, and yet, while Grinder was extremely tired, he still had the potential for battle. But she realized that Grinder was showing signs of wear and tear. So, in responce, she opted to lighten his burden somewhat. &quot;Okay, Grinder, just give me one round of Scratch this time. She then threw Torchlight's Poké Ball. &quot;All right, little buddy, we got us a toughie over here. This one's already taken out part of the starting lineup, so we need your help. Start off with Smokescreen, then Tackle that Nuzleaf, twice! We should be glad it went <i>this</i> well.&quot;</span></span></div>

<b><u>Lonely Cubone</u></b><br />
Time ticks by quietly, punctuated only by the odd howling gust of wind and the subsequently creaking of stone and chains, as you watch over Marowak and Skarmory. Reflecting on what had happened and what the warrior lady had just told you, you're certain of one thing: the odds, to say the least, aren't particularly bright. What more can be said about an adversary commanding ancestral, celestial lineage and enough combat capability to kill several times over? Studying the resting forms of the Pokémon you note that while Marowak has several bruises, Skarmory's metallic body bears distinct signs of severe burning. Skarmory must have taken the main force of the Fire Blast earlier, you reason, and you sadly gaze at its shielded face, winced from pain even in slumber.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Maro?&quot; The sound of Marowak, weak but definitively alive, catches your attention. Looking downwards, you see your trusted lead operative raise a hand at you, which you grasp gratefully -- while both more than a little shattered, you both know that you'll certainly live to fight another day so long as you have each other. Though you're still rather weak to form coherent words Marowak simply clutches your hand a little tighter in understanding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is everything alright?&quot; Silent as she went, the woman's voice suddenly from behind startles you a little, turning back at the announcement of her return. &quot;We should be safe here, at least for a while. I don't know if that girl will come looking for us; she's never hunted me down specifically but the descendants of Alycos have... what is it?&quot; The colour seems to drain from her complexion as she reads your intent from your gaze. &quot;You're not... thinking of trying to help me, are you?&quot; she whispers, traces of fear clear in her tone as your quietude answers in your consent for you. For a moment she opens her mouth as if to say something in protest, but then turns to gaze troubledly into the distance, and awkward silence seems to consume the area.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I'm sorry. I just... You look so much like him; I don't want any danger to come to you.&quot; you barely hear her murmur, as she brings up a hand to wipe away her forming tear. &quot;Things won't be easy for us whatever path we take now. The way Skarmory has been scorched, I heavily doubt he can carry my weight, let alone ours. ...Marowak is your strongest Pokémon, isn't he? It's what I would have done myself, leading with the strongest Pokémon I have when going into unknown territory, that is if I had anyone else besides Skarmory... In any case, I don't think we can risk another confrontation. We could make it back to Riviera for proper medical attention and supplies, but risk getting seen; or we could bide our time in the deeper parts of Heaven's Gate.&quot;<br />
<br />
What will you choose?</span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Red"><br />
It was a tough choice, laced with doubt and worry whichever option he were to plump for. Natural conservatism and concern for Skarmory’s health made him keen to return to safer areas to get the steel bird attention and medical care from professionals. The Pokémon’s burns seems fairly severe, and while they didn’t seem to be affecting him too badly whilst he remained on the ground, but it would probably struggle to fly, certainly whilst carrying any significant weight. As he has no flying Pokémon of his own, this restricted their escape to a ground based one, and that much the Spawn of Alycos would almost certainly be expecting, and, if half as malevolent and cunning as the Mawile that made up part of her genetic makeup, she would be lying in wait, a prospect which turned LC cold. With their strongest Pokémon already weakened, the two of them would no doubt struggle to escape that confrontation.<br />
<br />
The alternative though, was to push on deeper into Heaven’s Gate, which could bring its own dangers. There was always the fear of a double bluff from a cunning enemy, but the real worry came from finding more trouble. The areas deeper into the Heaven’s Gate were rarely explored by the people of the Riviera and some were semi-mythical due to the sheer lack of information about them, and LC feared that it could be a case of venturing out of the frying pan and straight into the fire. Glancing up at the warrior-lady, concern flickered across his face, before he turned his gaze to Marowak. He was bruised, for sure, but bruises heal with time and there seemed to be no lasting damage done. He spoke, this time the lady:<br />
<br />
“How badly does Skarmory need attention? I have a few things, Potions and other medicines, but if it needs professional help we’ll have no choice but to head back to the Riviera edge, as likely as we are to be ambushed along the way. Marowak will be okay, and I have other Pokémon I can use to protect you if we choose to go that way. It’d probably be safer for us, and indeed my preference would be to venture further, but if Skarmory needs the attention we have no real choice but to try.” Fingering the Pokeballs on his belt, LC thought of his team and wondered which would be strong enough to stand up to such a fearsome opponent. Most of them were reasonably new additions to the team, and only Donphan had any real strength, and she still did not have the strength that Marowak possessed, even whilst injured.<br />
<br />
Awaiting the lady’s reply, LC considered the other things that she had said, the brief moment of weakness in her usual steely demeanour. <i>” You look so much like him; I don't want any danger to come to you.&quot;</i> It was not hard to see from the Girl’s eyes that tragedy had befallen her in the past, and with what little she had explained about her past, LC was beginning to put the pieces together on her story, but this seemed a little more personal...He had ideas of exactly what she had meant, but he didn’t want to think of them, not while they were in so much difficulty themselves, both of them needed to keep their minds thoroughly in the present. The danger may have abated for now, but a lingering sense of threat kept LC on alert as he waited to hear the diagnosis of the warrior lady.<br />
