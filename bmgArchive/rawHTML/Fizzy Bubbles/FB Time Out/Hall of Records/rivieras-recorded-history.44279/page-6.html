<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslateblue"><b><u>Dark Fire &amp; SilverWind</u></b><br />
Even as you continue pushing on, no break seems to appear in the onslaught of Duskull, leaving you up to your ears in persisted offence. More rising winds, courtesy of Ledah and Andromeda, cannonball into hordes of Duskull that seem to simply pour from the castle's heights, and a smile lights both your faces as Andromeda's <b>Dragonbreath</b> causes an instant explosion as the surrounding vortexes boost the wave of draconic fire into a volatile inferno, and the addition of Grimace's <b>Fire Spin</b> certainly doesn't hurt the techniques' firepower. Down low the rest of both teams of attacking forces have no sign of holding back either: Minerva, having psyched up her muscular and mental strength with a <b>Swords Dance</b>, easily calls upon random stones strewn about the field by Ogden earlier on in a ferocious <b>Rock Slide</b>, beaning down any Duskull unwitting enough to not switch to their intangible phases. A swig of special Fizzybrew beer soon wells up a blaze from within Pepper's Magmortar, and before long a twin blast of fire like a double volcanic eruption bursts out of her barrelled arms, joining the nine flames of Drought's <b>Overheat</b> attack in exorcising the nearing crowds. Left to his own time Tortuga gladly pumps up winds of his own; a <b>Dragon Rage</b>'s worth of storm catching two groups of Duskull and sending them spiralling back into dizziness, while a subsequent <b>Blizzard</b> coats them in little prisons of ice, locking them in the freeze status before they plummet like hailstones and shatter -- all the while, as Ogden detonates lightning charges, spreading through the Duskull like nodes in a short circuit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Clops. Clops. Clops.&quot;<br />
<br />
Like a drum beating the rhythm to a military dirge, even above the choir of Requiem the toneless chant rings in your ears, and as you crane your necks your eyes instantly focus on the source of the new track amongst the performance: a Dusclops pair, waving their hands in a synchronised, inscrutable fashion, hover through their minions of Duskull as they draw near, and inexplicably you find it difficult to tear your gazes from their singular eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; Almost in a flash of inspiration, Patrick turns around with enough of a jerk to nearly constitute a seizure, &quot; No, you fools! Look away!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dus-CLOPS!&quot;<br />
<br />
Two lasers, one from each Dusclops, shines from the cyclops' eyes, and as the light washes over you a prick in your consciousness informs the both of you that something is dangerously wrong. No longer can you hear the sounds of the battle around you, and even Rayne finds that no psychic quip from Drought can be heard either. Ogden's mouth curls in an unintelligible snarl before he resumes swiping at the swarming ghosts, and it dawns that the Dusclops must have cast <b>Mean Look</b> on the both of you, locking you in a double battle against the Beckoning duo. Taking wide glances, Pepper sees Tortuga amble towards him bewilderedly, while Andromeda descends with an angry screech. It appears that your battle partners against Dusclops have been decided and, if the rules of Mean Look are anything to go by, you'll be locked into single combat until one side falls completely...</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DarkSlateBlue">Rayne watched, mesmerized, by the utter carnage that their little crew of pokemon were creating. Powerful winds rushed past him on the ground, sending his shoulder length hair to fly aimlessly. Soon gigantic fire blasts, followed by a shower of rocks, and a devastating ice cold blizzard filled the night sky ... yet the Duskull would not cease. They fell in swarms, dropping to the ground like lead balloons, but they came washing over the castle walls in twice the number. From a far it most probably looked like an ominous black wave was endlessly flowing from the castle walls. It was only a matter of time before they were engulfed by this mass.<br />
<br />
Rayne stood in place, mouth agape, trying to coordinate another set of attacks for his pokemon. At the same time he was desperately looking for an escape route.<br />
<br />
<i>&lt;... This is ridiculous Rayne! ...&gt;</i> Drought beamed telepathically. If Rayne couldn't hear the anger in her voice, he most definitely felt it; a sharp pain sprang into existence right above his eyes, a kind he had never experienced before. <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;... I know. I think ...&gt;</i> Rayne stopped short of finishing his thought. Above the never ending squeals of the Duskull he picked out the sound of something new. A very steady beat of new cries rang throughout. Unlike the disorderly Duskull, these cries were in perfect sync, beating at precise time intervals, loud and unwavering, steady and menacing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Clops. Clops. Clops.&quot; Rayne looked up to see a zone of clearing around two Dusclops; the alpha dogs have come out to play it seems. The Duskull shrieking subsided slightly, and the thick throng of inexperienced ghosts seemingly cleared the path for their superiors. The sight of these apparitions descending was hypnotising, something about the wave-like swaying of their hands made it impossible for Rayne to rip his gaze away.<br />
<br />
<i>&lt;... What? Rayne. What do you think? ...&gt;</i> Drought asked urgently, but Rayne couldn’t be bothered to answer her at this time. A wide laser beam shot out from their one eye, like a floodlight that illuminated both Rayne and Pepper. <br />
<br />
“What?! No, you fools! Look away.” But it was much too late. A feeling of sorrow and despair raced through Rayne, before settling down. The noise of the battle around them disappeared, even Drought’s mental barrages could not be heard; they were trapped by <b>Mean Look</b>. Rayne looked over at Pepper who came to the exact same realisation. Though the two could not communicate, Pepper gave him a thumbs up, to which Rayne nodded in response. <br />
<br />
“Raaaah!” There was that blood numbing roar of Andromeda, presumably the pokemon the Dusclops chose as its opponent. Rayne smiled slightly, glad that his ground based pokemon were not chosen; this was a level playing field for his Salamence. Outside the Mean Look bubble Minerva and Drought continued their bombardment of the Duskull. Rayne knew their training would keep them safe for the time being, but he didn’t know for how long they could hold up. <br />
<br />
“Andromeda, let’s make these ghosts regret singling you out. Start out with a quick <span style="color: LightBlue"><b>Dragon Dance</b></span>, followed by an <span style="color: RoyalBlue"><b>Aqua Tail</b></span>. Give them a glimpse of your <span style="color: White"><b>Scary Face</b></span> to finish up.”</span></span></div>

<b><u>Moonlit Garden</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Dark Fire &amp; SilverWind</u></b><br />
Forced to do battle with the latest newcomers of Lacrima Castle, you rally your selected partners for the respective one-on-ones and give them their specified orders. Being the faster and more flexible one Andromeda is quick to enhance her statistical focuses with a <b>Dragon Dance</b>, performing a sizzling samba in mid-air that boosts her strength and speed, while Tortuga gladly belches out another round of his <b>Chocolate Magic</b>. Streaking brown destruction from his cannons, Tortuga's target Dusclops is gummed in the mass of summoned confection, but even as this occurs the remaining, untouched Dusclops begins waving its hands mysteriously. Even with nothing visible the two of you feel a distinct sense of inexplicable presence, and your gut churns at the feeling of sudden distortion, as though the very air around you was being warped. Warped? The thought strikes both of you, and looking up at Andromeda's sluggish movements it hits you like a ton of bricks: <b>Trick Room</b> is the new order of the game, and with Dusclops' normally pitiful speed you know the rules of reversed physics will make speed demons out of the bound spirits. Pushed by the new boosts in its agility the gummed Ghost-type unleashes a <b>Shadow Punch</b>; the guided nature of the move allowing it to strike Tortuga without fail.<br />
<br />
Huffily stamping his foot, Tortuga releases an orb of aquatic power to summon a <b>Rain Dance</b>, prompting clouds in the sky to congregate, but outside Minerva, Drought and Grimace flash looks of concern (and in Drought's case, untold annoyance) -- mainly reliant on Fire for their attacks, the wet weather would not serve them well for certain. Despite this Andromeda swoops in, furious that she's left to an effective crawl by her opponents, and with the force of a river torrent she slams an <b>Aqua Tail</b> at her specified enemy. Smirking she turns to see an expected look of pain, but the sight of Dusclops' steely gaze perturbs her slightly. The instinct is one well expressed as this particular Dusclops slams its hands to the floor, and with a cry Andromeda crashes to the ground as the both of you grasp your knees, struggling to maintain posture as Dusclops curses the relevant area with its natural manipulative powers over <b>Gravity</b>. A creepy laugh emerges from the other Dusclops as it raises its hands, and Rayne recognises the summoned debris: a repeat of the <b>Rock Slide</b> that Minerva used earlier. Forcefully the stones are hurled at both your Pokémon, and while Tortuga succeeds in deflecting the blows with his <b>Iron Defence</b>, Andromeda isn't as lucky as her face cringes from the <b>flinch</b>ing move...</span><br />

Certain that victory isn't far from reach at this point, you call for further evasive action out of Martéo, intent on following the plans Yuanli helped lay out. As Drapion strugglingly regains its footing Martéo screeches a storm above it, and already pushed to limits by the Taillow that simply won't stay down Drapion scowls, swinging its large claws in attempt to <b>Knock</b> Martéo <b>Off</b> her charted flight plans. Having a diversion mounted by his colleague, Chroma boldly stomps the ground, and as the energy is transferred through the dirt you see several <b>Rock Tomb</b>s rise up, each one catching a foot of the Dark scorpion. Without focus on its lower regions Drapion is quickly caught in the stony traps, and when it finally notices its legs are well and truly caught.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, Chroma, assist Martéo!&quot; Following the swish of his master's staff, Chroma nods at the circling Martéo as she begins flapping her wings violently; the beginning of a <b>Twister</b> you know is destined to arrive. Even as the draconic winds leave her feathers Chroma is ready to rumble, breathing <b>Ominous Wind</b>s to join those from Martéo that swirl with accelerating velocity. Soon enough a tornado a good bit taller than the ogre arachnid begins to thunder towards Drapion, who can only continue struggling in vain as a response. Not quite finished, Martéo flaps an <b>Icy Wind</b> just as the air funnel strikes, combining all three elemental zephyrs in a combination that enshrouds Drapion entirely. A horrible holler is barely heard from Drapion as the triple winds drown out its noise in the midst of damage, and eventually it fades as the attacks continue. By the time the tornado dissipates completely Drapion is left wheezing inaudibly on the ground -- whether from exhaustion or injury, you can tell that it no longer has the capability to fight on. <b>Level-up for Martéo</b>.<br />
<br />
&quot;We apologise, Drapion. That you attacked us was no sole fault of your own... I place this in hopes of your swift recovery.&quot; Opening his satchel Yuanli moves forward, and you see him place a Sitrus Berry as an offering for the fallen Pokémon. &quot;Now, it would be quite vulnerable if Drapion was left here weakened. Chroma, would you mind providing some cover for Drapion?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sabl.&quot; A light nod is observed from Chroma before he raises his little hands, and instantly you see a set of <b>Light Screen</b>s surround Drapion, forming a chamber that slowly fades out of view, taking Drapion with it. &quot;Given that Sableye naturally have affinities for crystal, they also possess some rudimentary powers -- this includes the refraction of light at will,&quot; explains the sage. &quot;Now, we must continue. We cannot say for certain Drapion's route will be safe for us now that it's collapsed from our duelling.&quot;<br />
<br />
The walk through the ghost town -- while no more comforting than before, now with the active threat of being attacked -- remains as serene as ever, under the guidance of the venerable Yuanli and Chroma, who continues to scamper about, using his abilities to locate a possible way underground. As calm settles over your senses, the scene of death no longer seems to disturb as much; almost fascinating you, as you wonder what must have happened here. What stories did this abandoned settlement have to tell?<br />
<br />
&quot;Will, I think we now have a possible option.&quot; A quip from the old man halts your footsteps, and peering ahead of Yuanli you spot a well in a cleared bit of town. &quot;Presumably this was where a fraction of the water supply, if not its whole, must have originated. If what the researchers told me was true...&quot; You see Yuanli go for his bag once again, this time producing what looks like a clear, flaky film. &quot;In general insect Pokémon do not enjoy a long life span. Much as it is unfortunate, some leave behind invaluable legacies -- in particular, Venomoth wings lose their toxicity after the original Pokémon... moves on, shall we say. You know from the PokéDex that the wings of a Venomoth may vary in shade dependent on the poison they carry,&quot; says Yuanli. &quot;The dried wing of a Venomoth can be used to determine the presence of latent poisons through these colour variations, in the same way that scientists would perform chromatography -- that is, to identify the substances that make up a single mixture. And now...&quot; As Yuanli holds the wing over the well, you observe that the translucent object starts to darken, turning a sickly greenish-black after half a minute's passing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was told that the cemetery of our objectives is laden with a variety of plants, none particularly favourable to general health. They release spores that can poison quite severely after overexposure, although it would take at least a few days by my reckoning. The Venomoth wing proves it, though -- we're right above the graveyard's outskirts, at least. The sensitivity of Pokémon to their environment brings vast knowledge with each experience... although, this does present us a bit of a problem now,&quot; muses the elder. &quot;How might we descend this structure? The well should be able to accomodate us if we went down at the same time, but by what means can we do so? I must admit to not having rope in my inventory, and even that might not be enough. Might we have to call on the help of another Pokémon?&quot;<br />
<br />
What do you think? It doesn't look like Yuanli has the resources to go past this obstacle, so it's up to you now...</span></span></div>

Having caught the Tangela in a bind with the poisoned status, you call desperately for Bellatrix to tend her efforts to you instead, gaining you a buzz in the affirmative. Calling on her previous experience with gathering honey Bellatrix releases a pulse of <b>Sweet Scent</b> in a bid to becalm the raging Tangela, wafting a cloud of aroma over to the screeching bunch. It takes a while before the mist appears to have any effect, but straining your ears you notice that the Tangela's babbles have started to quieten down in volume, almost to a troubled brooding as the Tangela presumably try to get the Toxic off each other. You hear a brief buzzing before Bellatrix's worried gaze meets yours, and relying on the night vision most insect Pokémon possess she carefully tears the knots apart with her <b>Fury Swipes</b>, barely leaving any scratches at all where her claws meet your skin. Grasping your hand in hers Bellatrix buzzes you up to a standing position before hurriedly pulling you along the path, sidestepping the muddled group of Vine Pokémon, dashing across the stone bridge ahead without them so much as noticing.<br />
<br />
By the time Bellatrix stops for you to catch your breath and sufficient time passes by, you manage to take a proper look at your surroundings -- a decision well made, you find, as the view is more breathtaking than you thought. Under the light of the full moon, the shadows cast off the pillars and beams resemble stalwart guards keeping the peace in the abandoned castle, while the dark leaves of shrubs reflect the illumination in a sheen almost soft enough to lie upon. Even in the darkness of night the garden bears a distinct aura of well-maintenance: an observation you find odd considering how the area must have been long abandoned by humans.<br />
<br />
&quot;Poli?&quot; The sound of wild Pokémon, more inquisitive than demanding, turns your attention to one of the pillars lining the tiled floor, and a brief scan yields a Poliwag peering out from behind one of the stone structures. The single tadpole is soon joined by another, then another, then several of the roly-poly Water-types, all looking at you in curiosity and -- perhaps a hint of fear? You can't be certain as a gloved hand, then two, start appearing as a couple of Poliwhirl show themselves. At least this group of Pokémon don't seem intent on attacking...</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: darkslateblue"><span style="font-size: 9px">Rick watched with hopeful eyes as Bellatrix buzzed in response to Ricks cry, the bug Pokemon obviously willing to turn her attention to help her trainer rather than simply letting him be throttled by the sheer amount of vines that spread through the area. The tactic was one he knew would work, having used it when trying to calm down Pokemon in his first adventure in the world of Fizzy Bubbles, when he had to face off against a extremely large criminal organization, and yet he somehow won. The organization had retreated, but Rick expected that he hadn’t heard the last of them. Since that day he had always watched his back, always made sure to carry his pokeball, but if he was being completely and utterly bested by a group of overgrown weeds, what chance did he have against the might of an entire criminal organization, which had probably rebuilt itself already. It had been a few months since the day he met Jirachi, and the experience was still vivid in his head; a legendary Pokemon! Bellatrix moved onto her orders, and Rick snapped back into reality, the aroma of a Sweet Scent floating through the area, and apparently it was working at least slightly, the Tangela calming down considerably compared to what they were like prior to this event. A brief buzzing emerges from Bellatrix lips as she slowly began to cut away the knots that bound Rick together, barely leaving any scratches where she ripped away the knots from his body. Gripping onto Ricks hand, a large comforting sigh spreading out of Ricks mouth without him even realizing it, she pulled him up to a standing position, and he couldn’t help but feel great gratitude towards his Starter Pokemon. Hurriedly, Bellatrix pulled Rick across the area, and Rick tried his best to help her do so, the pair sidestepping around the vine creatures and rushing over a cold stone bridge. Nervously looking down at his clothes, Rick noticed a large amount of tears had been cut through his clothes. Brilliant. Next time he was in a town, he’d have to buy himself a completely new set of clothes. It was about time he got a makeover anyway, physically and mentally. Sure, adventuring was fun, but he didn’t really have a <i>goal</i> in life, going anyway the wind blows or something similar to that. As Rick took a proper look at his surroundings, he found that he was nearly knocked of his feet by how beautiful it was. Under the light of the full moon, the shadows covered the pillars and guards, but gave them a far more mysterious look under the light of the moon. Amazing, the dark leaves seemed to be even more beautiful that the pillars and statues, their beauty in the moonlight almost overthrowing Rick. Considering the area has supposedly been uninhabited for years, Rick couldn’t help but feel slightly mythed at quite how well kept it looked, but Rick wasn’t one to question the ways in which natures beauty decided to work.<br />
<br />
“Poli?” a sound echoed from nearby, and Rick almost couldn’t believe what he was hearing. If it was truly a Poliwag, Rick would be more than ecstatic, the Pokemon being one of his favorites behind Slakoth. Well, really, all of Poliwags line were considered favorites rather than just the young one, and he couldn’t believe his luck. Maybe he’d get something more from his journey, something he didn’t realize that there was even the possibility of; finding a new team member. Turning towards the pillar which the cry seemed to come from, Rick noticed not one but several of them, all looking up at Rick not in fear but curiosity. He smiled down at the Pokemon, but tried to keep himself fairly unintimidating. He didn’t want another Tangela situation. Apparently, it wasn’t just Poliwag either, and Rick almost let out a gasp as he saw the Poliwhirl as well. He knew this side of him was slightly odd, but he couldn’t hide his enthusiasm as he looked at the Pokemon. Unsure as to what to do next, he gripped one of his team members Pokeballs, Duskull, just in case of a fight, and lowered himself to one knee. Beckoning towards one of the Poliwags, he hoped not to scare them, but just in case he put his Duskulls Pokeball in his shirt pocket, still able to be reached quickly in the chance of a crisis. He only hoped that the group would see he was trying to make a friendly gesture, and not trying to harm them in any way shape or form. Bruises from the Tangela attack still showed on his body, and frankly, he refused to add to that collection.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray"><b><u>Ghost Town</u></b></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray"><b><u>Hayward</u></b></span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Certain that victory isn't far from reach at this point, you call for further evasive action out of Martéo, intent on following the plans Yuanli helped lay out. As Drapion strugglingly regains its footing Martéo screeches a storm above it, and already pushed to limits by the Taillow that simply won't stay down Drapion scowls, swinging its large claws in attempt to <b>Knock</b> Martéo <b>Off</b> her charted flight plans. Having a diversion mounted by his colleague, Chroma boldly stomps the ground, and as the energy is transferred through the dirt you see several <b>Rock Tomb</b>s rise up, each one catching a foot of the Dark scorpion. Without focus on its lower regions Drapion is quickly caught in the stony traps, and when it finally notices its legs are well and truly caught.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;Now, Chroma, assist Martéo!&quot; Following the swish of his master's staff, Chroma nods at the circling Martéo as she begins flapping her wings violently; the beginning of a <b>Twister</b> you know is destined to arrive. Even as the draconic winds leave her feathers Chroma is ready to rumble, breathing <b>Ominous Wind</b>s to join those from Martéo that swirl with accelerating velocity. Soon enough a tornado a good bit taller than the ogre arachnid begins to thunder towards Drapion, who can only continue struggling in vain as a response. Not quite finished, Martéo flaps an <b>Icy Wind</b> just as the air funnel strikes, combining all three elemental zephyrs in a combination that enshrouds Drapion entirely. A horrible holler is barely heard from Drapion as the triple winds drown out its noise in the midst of damage, and eventually it fades as the attacks continue. By the time the tornado dissipates completely Drapion is left wheezing inaudibly on the ground -- whether from exhaustion or injury, you can tell that it no longer has the capability to fight on. <b>Level-up for Martéo</b>.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;We apologise, Drapion. That you attacked us was no sole fault of your own... I place this in hopes of your swift recovery.&quot; Opening his satchel Yuanli moves forward, and you see him place a Sitrus Berry as an offering for the fallen Pokémon. &quot;Now, it would be quite vulnerable if Drapion was left here weakened. Chroma, would you mind providing some cover for Drapion?&quot;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;Sabl.&quot; A light nod is observed from Chroma before he raises his little hands, and instantly you see a set of <b>Light Screen</b>s surround Drapion, forming a chamber that slowly fades out of view, taking Drapion with it. &quot;Given that Sableye naturally have affinities for crystal, they also possess some rudimentary powers -- this includes the refraction of light at will,&quot; explains the sage. &quot;Now, we must continue. We cannot say for certain Drapion's route will be safe for us now that it's collapsed from our duelling.&quot;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">The walk through the ghost town -- while no more comforting than before, now with the active threat of being attacked -- remains as serene as ever, under the guidance of the venerable Yuanli and Chroma, who continues to scamper about, using his abilities to locate a possible way underground. As calm settles over your senses, the scene of death no longer seems to disturb as much; almost fascinating you, as you wonder what must have happened here. What stories did this abandoned settlement have to tell?</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;Will, I think we now have a possible option.&quot; A quip from the old man halts your footsteps, and peering ahead of Yuanli you spot a well in a cleared bit of town. &quot;Presumably this was where a fraction of the water supply, if not its whole, must have originated. If what the researchers told me was true...&quot; You see Yuanli go for his bag once again, this time producing what looks like a clear, flaky film. &quot;In general insect Pokémon do not enjoy a long life span. Much as it is unfortunate, some leave behind invaluable legacies -- in particular, Venomoth wings lose their toxicity after the original Pokémon... moves on, shall we say. You know from the PokéDex that the wings of a Venomoth may vary in shade dependent on the poison they carry,&quot; says Yuanli. &quot;The dried wing of a Venomoth can be used to determine the presence of latent poisons through these colour variations, in the same way that scientists would perform chromatography -- that is, to identify the substances that make up a single mixture. And now...&quot; As Yuanli holds the wing over the well, you observe that the translucent object starts to darken, turning a sickly greenish-black after half a minute's passing.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;I was told that the cemetery of our objectives is laden with a variety of plants, none particularly favourable to general health. They release spores that can poison quite severely after overexposure, although it would take at least a few days by my reckoning. The Venomoth wing proves it, though -- we're right above the graveyard's outskirts, at least. The sensitivity of Pokémon to their environment brings vast knowledge with each experience... although, this does present us a bit of a problem now,&quot; muses the elder. &quot;How might we descend this structure? The well should be able to accomodate us if we went down at the same time, but by what means can we do so? I must admit to not having rope in my inventory, and even that might not be enough. Might we have to call on the help of another Pokémon?&quot;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">What do you think? It doesn't look like Yuanli has the resources to go past this obstacle, so it's up to you now...</span></span>

<br />
<span style="color: darkslategray">In Mireno’s Ghost Town, the Taillow Martéo glided in for a landing, choosing to alight upon the right forearm of her teenage trainer, Will Hale. More than a little winded from her just-completed battle, the Tiny Swallow Pokémon took deep, panting breaths, trying hard to satisfy her thirst for oxygen. Will grinned at his avian companion, congratulated her on her efforts, and sincerely thanked her for her help in dealing with Drapion, before returning her to the <i>Good Old 2009 Poké Ball</i> that served as her temporary residence. He placed the festive containment orb back in his messenger bag and turned to watch Yuanli ministering to the needs of the fallen Ogre Scorpion.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Yuanli apologized for fainting Drapion and placed a Sitrus Berry near its still form. Worried for the dark arachnid’s safety, the mysterious man instructed Chroma to shield it with a <b>Light Screen</b> chamber. Will guessed the berry was meant to speed Drapion along the road to recovery and gaped in awe at the little purple imp’s concealment technique. Any doubts Will might have harbored concerning Yuanli’s motives had been effectively put to rest by the oldster’s gracious actions. Marveling at the man’s compassion toward Pokémon, Will followed him and the lively Sableye through the deserted streets of town.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">As they trekked down one silent street after another, Will couldn’t help but wonder at the cause of the town’s abandonment. The last time he had seen a town in such a forlorn state was when he had been treasure hunting in the ruins of Lacuna. While there, he had somehow been magicked into the past and thrust into the middle of the civil conflict that had ultimately led to that society’s collapse. Commissioned by Arceus to put a stop to the violence, Will and his team undertook the task of unlocking the keys that were needed to reunite the fragmented nation and save Lacuna from cataclysmic destruction. In the process, the boy had rewritten history, and discovered that the feud had been fuelled by Darkrai and Cressalia’s longstanding rivalry. Will knew there was simply no way of predicting just what secrets this eerie settlement might hide.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">After a while Yuanli, Chroma, and Will stopped before a well in an open area of town. Yuanli tested the toxicity of the water using a form of Pokémon chromatography and found that the levels of poisonous material indicated the trio had indeed chanced upon the entrance to the sought-after Cemetery. He explained that it lay beneath the surface of the town, but admitted he was at a loss as to how they should proceed further. Turning to Will, he suggested enlisting the help of a Pokemon to aide in their descent.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Will nodded in response to Yuanli’s plan, reached into his messenger bag, and quickly produced a shiny steel Poké Ball. Holding the silver capture capsule at arm’s length, he pressed the round trigger switch and a brilliant scarlet light appeared, which morphed itself into the form of a slender mystic before fading, revealing the elegant Pokémon, Medicham.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Released from the cramped confines of his containment orb, the Medicham Medéo made an exaggerated show of reaching over to touch his toes, running in place, and doing jumping jacks. Unimpressed by this ostentatious display, Will sweatdropped and put on a slightly embarrassed grin before shrugging sheepishly in Yuanli’s direction. Turning back to Medéo, who had only just completed his elaborate stretching routine, Will issued his instructions. “Right then, mate. Enough of that. We need your help. There’s a cemetery buried somewhere beneath us and we’re looking for a way in. I think you just might be able to safely <b><span style="color: white">Teleport</span></b> all of us down this old well.”</span></span><br />

Southwest of Elendia lies a forest, within which lies the ancient ruins of Nelde -- home of the Binon royal family, who died out in the last few centuries. The Binon royal family was said to be a family of naturalist magicians who were at one with nature, and thus constructed their home alongside the forest trees. In the present day, the tree which the ruins were built around has grown into the stone, forming a monumental testimony of the power of nature over mankind. Alongside the local Pokémon, some of the ruins' magic traps are still in place to catch any intruders who might threaten the sanctity of the region.<br />
<b>Wiese Forest</b><br />
The forest that surrounds the Nelde Ruins. Its fertile soil has given rise to a wild variety of flora, some of which can no longer be found anywhere else on Riviera, though not all are safe to touch or consume. Adventurers are not recommended to delve too deeply into the forest, however -- it is said that within the deeper areas of Wiese Forest lies a magical labyrinth of trees, from which escape is nigh impossible.</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: chartreuse">When was the last time Shadow had come across trees, aside from those that towered uncountable metres high and were as much metal and plastic as they were wood? He vaguely remembered entering a forest, encountering -- what <i>did</i> he encounter? A Grass-type seemed likely, but he otherwise could not recall; it was as though the memory had been interrupted or corrupted. In any case he could not say whether it had even occurred, or mattered in the long run.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gligar, gligar.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy, boy.&quot; Shadow chided. It had been long ago when the spot above the scientist's head was occupied by Ephidel the then Zubat; disciplined and now a veteran member of the sector, his place was now usurped by another batlike being -- while not particularly threatening in aspects of potential blood loss, Lacrimus could give Ephidel a run for his mischief money, and worse still was liable to jump at any female insect he fancied. &quot;Insect...&quot; Humming the thought through his head Shadow ran through his priorities: a Pinsir numbered amongst the goals he set for himself, but that would not be a definitive necessity this time unlike his trip to the Laguna Peninsula. He'd heard stories of an ancient archive within the ruins of Nelde, possessing knowledge and intel long lost to modern times -- perhaps he could find something to further their causes? The last bit didn't end on a necessarily confident note, but Shadow was of the firm opinion that knowledge itself could not hurt, and its possession, given that there was no detriment, would only benefit them.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Gli.&quot; The KND operative on the run felt his Pokémon stretch lazily above him, resting his membraned back on his hair as his tail dangled serenely, thankfully not scratching Shadow's neck with poison in his wake. The ruins would not be too difficult to find, but Shadow hoped with this experience the younger operatives would glean something. With the single step starting the journey of a thousand miles he began making his way through the woods...</span></span></div>

<b>Shadowshocker:</b> Taking your first step into the knot of trees collectively known as Wiese Forest you reminisce on past adventures in wooded regions. Surprisingly, you don’t seem to recall any all that well. In fact you begin to doubt whether those adventures ever took place. What is certain you conclude, is the fact that if ever you had traveled in a forest, it must have been a long time ago. <br />
<br />
“Gligar, gligar.” Your excitable partner’s cries tear you away from your thoughts briefly, but soon your brain is drifting to another topic. As you compare your two bat-like creatures you are reminded of your true purpose in this forest. While finding a specific pokemon seems unlikely, the more pressing item on your agenda is locating a long lost archive. Indeed, legend has it that the ruins were once occupied by the Binon royal family. Of course at that time they were not ruins, but rather a mammoth complex of stone structures built in concert with the forest’s trees. Deep within this complex, hidden from the public was a great library. Books and tomes about all sorts of ancient magic, naturalism, spiritualism and what have you lined the vast shelves of this library. The Binon line had long ago died off or disappeared, and with them the so had the location of the archives. But to this day rumours about the hidden scriptures float amongst the citizens of Riviera; rumours that draw many knowledge seeking adventurers to the now treacherous halls of the ruins. <br />
<br />
You happen to be one of these adventurers, and whether you knew it or not, finding the archive was not going to be an easy task. Many men have searched endlessly for the hidden library. Some have gone mad trying, citing a gruelling set of trials as the cause. Others lost their lives within the ruins, their bodies never recovered from the depths of the ancient castle. Many simply never returned. No one really knows whether they found what they were seeking, but most believe they were lost in the endless trees, dying in their attempt to find the mysterious hall.<br />
<br />
It was perhaps one of the greatest ironies in all of Riviera. How a place so peaceful and warm could be the site of some of the greatest tragedies in all the land. Much like the sirens of mythology, the beauty and serenity of this place was a sinister illusion; this place was actually hideous and corrupted. It was the decaying bodies of innocent men that fertilized the soil of the Wiese Forest; it was the decaying bodies of innocent men that gave life to all the majestic vegetation that surrounded you now. The air here indefinitely suspended the fear and dread of people who ventured here before you, it was saturated with it. Of course a human nose, or a pokemon’s nose for that matter, could not pick up on this sort of scent. Instead you and Lacrimus pick up a different scent. <br />
<br />
As the two of you walk through the forest, blissfully unaware of its hidden monstrosity, you begin to notice a sweet smelling aroma about you. The smell starts out weak at first, but it soon becomes more intense, and even more pleasant. Your stomach begins to growl, begging you to munch down whatever it is that smells so delicious. As enthused as you are about the scent, Lacrimus seems doubly so. The Gligar begins to fan his wings, and swing his tail erratically. Soon he becomes overwhelmed by the scent and decides to take off ahead of you. Sure the smell was pleasant, but you didn’t really think it was <i>that</i> alluring. Lacrimus wasn’t looking back, however; he was heading straight for the source. Alarmed at how reckless your Gligar was acting, you pick up your pace in pursuit, but it wasn’t nearly fast enough; Lacrimus was flying full speed ahead now, quickly disappearing from your sight in a thick tangle of branches. <br />
<br />
“Gli…!?” Lacrimus’ surprised yell echoes through the forest. Though you were already running full speed in chase, your partner’s yelp manages to accelerate you further. Several feet ahead you spot a rather thick-looking group of bushes which rose up like a wall from the forest floor; Lacrimus flew through this bush when you lost sight of him. Covering your eyes in protection you dive through the bush, which to your surprise was not as hard to break through as you expected. All the momentum you had carried in the jump makes you wobble the landing, and you struggle to find your footing on the other side … then you were stopped dead in your tracks; stuck in a rather uncomfortable position. You struggle to free yourself, but your movements are useless, you just sway back and forth in that same awkward position. <br />
<br />
“Gligar!” Your eyes shoot up to the source of the sound, and there he was. Lacrimus was stuck as well, and now that you actually bothered to look around you realise the two of you are suspended in a gigantic spider web. Lacrimus was almost completely entangled, in his struggle against the strings he managed to get his entire right side, head and tail caught in the sticky mess; his left claw however was free to move around. You weren’t as bad off as your flying scorpion, but your two arms were immobile, stuck in an awkward balancing configuration. Naturally, you begin to survey the immediate area, assessing the situation. <br />
<br />
“Bee … bee … BEE!” Above you, a trapped Combee struggled alongside the two of you. It must have been this frightened Combee that lured your Gligar in with its <b>Sweet Scent</b>; it was sending out a distress call to any nearby pokemon for help. It worked all too well you thought to yourself, now the owner of this web would have enough food to share with its buddies. A scuttling sound to your right caught your attention just then. A red arachnid, which you instantly recognized as an Ariados, was just coming by its trap then, ready to inspect its haul for the day. When it saw the three of you its eyes widened in exhilarated surprise. It cackled at its fortune, or at least that’s what you thought it was doing. The sound that was emanating from its throat could hardly be classified as laughter. <br />
<br />
“Ora ... ridos.” The jubilant spider was in a good mood today, more than pleased that its trap worked so well. Seeing as it was more than enough for itself, it decided to call out some of its children. From below you could hear the hungry cries of the malnourished progeny of this Ariados. Looking down you instantly spot five sickly Spinarak making their way up the web; their mother was letting them get first bite it seemed, training them for when they were on their own. Although quite helpless in your current position, luck is on your side this time. It seems the mother hasn’t had much luck lately with her traps, and whatever she caught she kept for herself. As a result her babies were rather weak with hunger, and their climb was taking much longer than it would have normally. With your hands tied up at the moment, you couldn’t really put up much of a defence. Lacrimus was also out of commission currently, but he at least had his left claw available. Maybe … <br />
<br />
<i>Maybe what? What will you do?</i></span></span> <br />

Forced to do battle with the latest newcomers of Lacrima Castle, you rally your selected partners for the respective one-on-ones and give them their specified orders. Being the faster and more flexible one Andromeda is quick to enhance her statistical focuses with a <b>Dragon Dance</b>, performing a sizzling samba in mid-air that boosts her strength and speed, while Tortuga gladly belches out another round of his <b>Chocolate Magic</b>. Streaking brown destruction from his cannons, Tortuga's target Dusclops is gummed in the mass of summoned confection, but even as this occurs the remaining, untouched Dusclops begins waving its hands mysteriously. Even with nothing visible the two of you feel a distinct sense of inexplicable presence, and your gut churns at the feeling of sudden distortion, as though the very air around you was being warped. Warped? The thought strikes both of you, and looking up at Andromeda's sluggish movements it hits you like a ton of bricks: <b>Trick Room</b> is the new order of the game, and with Dusclops' normally pitiful speed you know the rules of reversed physics will make speed demons out of the bound spirits. Pushed by the new boosts in its agility the gummed Ghost-type unleashes a <b>Shadow Punch</b>; the guided nature of the move allowing it to strike Tortuga without fail.<br />
<br />
Huffily stamping his foot, Tortuga releases an orb of aquatic power to summon a <b>Rain Dance</b>, prompting clouds in the sky to congregate, but outside Minerva, Drought and Grimace flash looks of concern (and in Drought's case, untold annoyance) -- mainly reliant on Fire for their attacks, the wet weather would not serve them well for certain. Despite this Andromeda swoops in, furious that she's left to an effective crawl by her opponents, and with the force of a river torrent she slams an <b>Aqua Tail</b> at her specified enemy. Smirking she turns to see an expected look of pain, but the sight of Dusclops' steely gaze perturbs her slightly. The instinct is one well expressed as this particular Dusclops slams its hands to the floor, and with a cry Andromeda crashes to the ground as the both of you grasp your knees, struggling to maintain posture as Dusclops curses the relevant area with its natural manipulative powers over <b>Gravity</b>. A creepy laugh emerges from the other Dusclops as it raises its hands, and Rayne recognises the summoned debris: a repeat of the <b>Rock Slide</b> that Minerva used earlier. Forcefully the stones are hurled at both your Pokémon, and while Tortuga succeeds in deflecting the blows with his <b>Iron Defence</b>, Andromeda isn't as lucky as her face cringes from the <b>flinch</b>ing move...</span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DarkSlateBlue">It didn't take long for Rayne's outlook on the battle to change. The beginning seemed promising he had to admit. Dragon vs. Ghost; decent aerial matchup you would think. Andromeda started off with her <b>Dragon Dance</b> attack which under normal circumstances would have meant a significant advantage. Not this time. One of the Dusclops set up a <b>Trick Room</b>, causing Andromeda's boosted speed to count for nothing. If that wasn't enough, an increase in <b>Gravity</b> further handicapped the Dragon pokemon. So this battle did a complete 180 in the matter of seconds, and now Rayne scrambled to think up a decent counter attack. Not an easy feat within this warped dimension. <br />
<br />
The one thing Rayne and Andromeda had to work with was the rain. He looked over to where the three fire types stood; each one seemed to curse at the weather change. Drought looked the most annoyed. If only he could hear what she was thinking. Most likely something along the lines of: “wonder what Blastoise soup tastes like?” Maybe it was better if he didn’t know. While the fire types suffered from the rain, Andromeda and Tortuga only stood to gain from it. <br />
<br />
“Zap ‘im with <span style="color: Yellow"><b>Thunder</b></span>. Then try to catch them off guard with an <span style="color: DeepSkyBlue"><b>Avalanche</b></span>. Finish with a <span style="color: Brown"> <b>Rock Slide</b></span> of your own.” Rayne would make the best of the rain and warped speed dimension while he could. It was only a matter of time before the attacks’ effects would fade he figured. They could hold them off for a couple more turns ... he hoped.</span></span></div>

<b><u>Cod of War</u></b><br />
With the start of the battle going into a decent lead over your aquatic opponents, locking them into an enforced repetition of less useful tactics, you order Arctacea to embark on further offensive. Tottering on his stubby fir feet the Snover steps aside for a good shot at Octillery, waving his clublike arms and releasing flurries of <b>Razor Leaf</b> with each sweep. Sure enough, as Octillery helplessly raises its tentacles in a useless attempt to psyche itself up for more focus, the sharp leaves batter against its rubbery limbs, causing it to screech from the pain. Following a quick victory dance, Arctacea lobs a storm of glowing <b>Seed Bomb</b>s, but this time before they can make contact Kingler stubbornly scuttles in front of its comrade, shining with the sheen of <b>Harden</b> against the impact of Arctacea's second Grass-type technique.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm. So it would appear these two still have some tactics to share between them,&quot; muses Eriden, before raising his hands determinedly forward. &quot;Try some of this!&quot;<br />
<br />
As you watch on, a thin mist of frost begins forming from Eriden's palms, slinking into a circle of fog in front of the half-Walrein, and even as the seconds pass you see a ring of sharp icicles pointing at the enemy solidify through the gaseous formation. With little more than a creasing of Eriden's brow launches the technique forward, opening his curled fingers like a man-trap; the icicles opening likewise with his movements. Crushingly he brings his hands together as the attack strikes Kingler, and you realise that the improvised <b>Ice Fang</b> that Eriden has cast worked its magic: with one of the two secondary effects of Ice Fang kicking in Kingler can't help but cringe in temporal flight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sno! Snover!&quot; Noting his cue, Arctacea hurriedly proceeds to move in for the continued assault on Octillery, spiking an arm full of sizzling electricity. From afar you spot Octillery turn its noduled head, gazing with its unreadable eyes at your Snover, but the cry of &quot;Watch out!&quot; from Eriden comes too late. An almighty <i>SPLORK</i> is heard as Octillery vomits a disgusting <b>Gunk Shot</b> out of its mouth, slamming into Arctacea fullbodiedly in a sickening splatter of sludge. Caught foully, Arctacea squirms like a flipped Torkoal, as Eriden breathes over an <b>Icy Wind</b> to the opposition.<br />
<br />
&quot;The chilling effects of that last move should slow them down some, but it won't fix Octillery's recovery from my <b>Encore</b>,&quot; Eriden notes. &quot;My techniques will not be particularly effective in damage magnitude. Jamie, you'll need to keep Snover from being damaged as much as possible to keep the edge we have here.&quot;<br />
<br />
What now?</span><br />
<br />
</span>

<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: aqua">With Octillery and Kingler's current situation, the need to increase damage output was rather dwelling as Arctacea's Razor Leaf sliced into Octillery, yet his Seed Bomb was blocked off by the bulky crab, the crustacean grunting, yet its own defensive posture was offset by the improvised Ice Fang Eriden struck forth with. Focusing on the battle at hand, Jamie noted the fact that water types battling each other generally ended up as a case of who could endure their hits the longest with the inefficiency of each other's types, but this train of thought was broken by the sudden cry of the Walreinman as the Snover fell foul to a Gunk Shot from Octillery, the powerful strike sending the fir tree heads over heels, and as he thought, he realised that the Snover's natural movepool was still rather weak compared to that of the foes. Listening to Eriden's advice to keep him from taking too much damage, Jamie nodded before taking a second to think, until an idea struck. <i>If one's natural movepool is lacking, bolster it with some other moves for variety.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Arcy, come here a sec.&quot; Jamie called to the Snover who hopped up and waddled towards him as the trainer reached into a bag and pulled out a sizable stack of discs, technical machines he had bought for the ice type for special occasions that he had forgot about.

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Chartreuse"><b><u>Nelde Ruins: Wiese Forest</u> - Please Reply in Chartreuse</b><br />
<b>Shadowshocker:</b> Taking your first step into the knot of trees collectively known as Wiese Forest you reminisce on past adventures in wooded regions. Surprisingly, you don’t seem to recall any all that well. In fact you begin to doubt whether those adventures ever took place. What is certain you conclude, is the fact that if ever you had traveled in a forest, it must have been a long time ago. <br />
<br />
“Gligar, gligar.” Your excitable partner’s cries tear you away from your thoughts briefly, but soon your brain is drifting to another topic. As you compare your two bat-like creatures you are reminded of your true purpose in this forest. While finding a specific pokemon seems unlikely, the more pressing item on your agenda is locating a long lost archive. Indeed, legend has it that the ruins were once occupied by the Binon royal family. Of course at that time they were not ruins, but rather a mammoth complex of stone structures built in concert with the forest’s trees. Deep within this complex, hidden from the public was a great library. Books and tomes about all sorts of ancient magic, naturalism, spiritualism and what have you lined the vast shelves of this library. The Binon line had long ago died off or disappeared, and with them the so had the location of the archives. But to this day rumours about the hidden scriptures float amongst the citizens of Riviera; rumours that draw many knowledge seeking adventurers to the now treacherous halls of the ruins. <br />
<br />
You happen to be one of these adventurers, and whether you knew it or not, finding the archive was not going to be an easy task. Many men have searched endlessly for the hidden library. Some have gone mad trying, citing a gruelling set of trials as the cause. Others lost their lives within the ruins, their bodies never recovered from the depths of the ancient castle. Many simply never returned. No one really knows whether they found what they were seeking, but most believe they were lost in the endless trees, dying in their attempt to find the mysterious hall.<br />
<br />
It was perhaps one of the greatest ironies in all of Riviera. How a place so peaceful and warm could be the site of some of the greatest tragedies in all the land. Much like the sirens of mythology, the beauty and serenity of this place was a sinister illusion; this place was actually hideous and corrupted. It was the decaying bodies of innocent men that fertilized the soil of the Wiese Forest; it was the decaying bodies of innocent men that gave life to all the majestic vegetation that surrounded you now. The air here indefinitely suspended the fear and dread of people who ventured here before you, it was saturated with it. Of course a human nose, or a pokemon’s nose for that matter, could not pick up on this sort of scent. Instead you and Lacrimus pick up a different scent. <br />
<br />
As the two of you walk through the forest, blissfully unaware of its hidden monstrosity, you begin to notice a sweet smelling aroma about you. The smell starts out weak at first, but it soon becomes more intense, and even more pleasant. Your stomach begins to growl, begging you to munch down whatever it is that smells so delicious. As enthused as you are about the scent, Lacrimus seems doubly so. The Gligar begins to fan his wings, and swing his tail erratically. Soon he becomes overwhelmed by the scent and decides to take off ahead of you. Sure the smell was pleasant, but you didn’t really think it was <i>that</i> alluring. Lacrimus wasn’t looking back, however; he was heading straight for the source. Alarmed at how reckless your Gligar was acting, you pick up your pace in pursuit, but it wasn’t nearly fast enough; Lacrimus was flying full speed ahead now, quickly disappearing from your sight in a thick tangle of branches. <br />
<br />
“Gli…!?” Lacrimus’ surprised yell echoes through the forest. Though you were already running full speed in chase, your partner’s yelp manages to accelerate you further. Several feet ahead you spot a rather thick-looking group of bushes which rose up like a wall from the forest floor; Lacrimus flew through this bush when you lost sight of him. Covering your eyes in protection you dive through the bush, which to your surprise was not as hard to break through as you expected. All the momentum you had carried in the jump makes you wobble the landing, and you struggle to find your footing on the other side … then you were stopped dead in your tracks; stuck in a rather uncomfortable position. You struggle to free yourself, but your movements are useless, you just sway back and forth in that same awkward position. <br />
<br />
“Gligar!” Your eyes shoot up to the source of the sound, and there he was. Lacrimus was stuck as well, and now that you actually bothered to look around you realise the two of you are suspended in a gigantic spider web. Lacrimus was almost completely entangled, in his struggle against the strings he managed to get his entire right side, head and tail caught in the sticky mess; his left claw however was free to move around. You weren’t as bad off as your flying scorpion, but your two arms were immobile, stuck in an awkward balancing configuration. Naturally, you begin to survey the immediate area, assessing the situation. <br />
<br />
“Bee … bee … BEE!” Above you, a trapped Combee struggled alongside the two of you. It must have been this frightened Combee that lured your Gligar in with its <b>Sweet Scent</b>; it was sending out a distress call to any nearby pokemon for help. It worked all too well you thought to yourself, now the owner of this web would have enough food to share with its buddies. A scuttling sound to your right caught your attention just then. A red arachnid, which you instantly recognized as an Ariados, was just coming by its trap then, ready to inspect its haul for the day. When it saw the three of you its eyes widened in exhilarated surprise. It cackled at its fortune, or at least that’s what you thought it was doing. The sound that was emanating from its throat could hardly be classified as laughter. <br />
<br />
“Ora ... ridos.” The jubilant spider was in a good mood today, more than pleased that its trap worked so well. Seeing as it was more than enough for itself, it decided to call out some of its children. From below you could hear the hungry cries of the malnourished progeny of this Ariados. Looking down you instantly spot five sickly Spinarak making their way up the web; their mother was letting them get first bite it seemed, training them for when they were on their own. Although quite helpless in your current position, luck is on your side this time. It seems the mother hasn’t had much luck lately with her traps, and whatever she caught she kept for herself. As a result her babies were rather weak with hunger, and their climb was taking much longer than it would have normally. With your hands tied up at the moment, you couldn’t really put up much of a defence. Lacrimus was also out of commission currently, but he at least had his left claw available. Maybe … <br />
<br />
<i>Maybe what? What will you do?</i></span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Chartreuse">Perhaps it was the price of experience, as Shadow found that he felt irritation above all else, even expectant panic. Somehow, whenever he went on adventures, things never dropped casually into his lap -- they always happened harder before he could protest in pain, and faster before he could be put into a wheelchair. &quot;This is what happens when you lose control,&quot; he noted drily to his flying scorpion, although by this point the word 'flying' was a bit of a misnomer. Still, factoring in that the operative could not reach his PokéBalls for reinforcements, Lacrimus, untamed as he was, remained their only chance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, Lacrimus. What we need from you is a <b>Night Slash</b>. Focus the dark energy into your claw and struggle. With a bit of luck you'll sever enough of a portion of web to wrest yourself free; blast your way out with the momentum of a <b>Quick Attack</b> and <b>Night Slash</b> the both of us free.&quot; Turning to Combee, Shadow glanced at the somewhat apologetic baby bee. &quot;You, Combee! If you can, release more <b>Sweet Scent</b> in the direction of the Spinarak. It should slow them down while the three of us make a run for it.&quot; Hopefully, cooperation between the two bugs on his side would pave the way to temporal safety...</span></span></div>

<b><u>Moonlit Garden</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Dark Fire &amp; SilverWind</u></b><br />
Forced to do battle with the latest newcomers of Lacrima Castle, you rally your selected partners for the respective one-on-ones and give them their specified orders. Being the faster and more flexible one Andromeda is quick to enhance her statistical focuses with a <b>Dragon Dance</b>, performing a sizzling samba in mid-air that boosts her strength and speed, while Tortuga gladly belches out another round of his <b>Chocolate Magic</b>. Streaking brown destruction from his cannons, Tortuga's target Dusclops is gummed in the mass of summoned confection, but even as this occurs the remaining, untouched Dusclops begins waving its hands mysteriously. Even with nothing visible the two of you feel a distinct sense of inexplicable presence, and your gut churns at the feeling of sudden distortion, as though the very air around you was being warped. Warped? The thought strikes both of you, and looking up at Andromeda's sluggish movements it hits you like a ton of bricks: <b>Trick Room</b> is the new order of the game, and with Dusclops' normally pitiful speed you know the rules of reversed physics will make speed demons out of the bound spirits. Pushed by the new boosts in its agility the gummed Ghost-type unleashes a <b>Shadow Punch</b>; the guided nature of the move allowing it to strike Tortuga without fail.<br />
<br />
Huffily stamping his foot, Tortuga releases an orb of aquatic power to summon a <b>Rain Dance</b>, prompting clouds in the sky to congregate, but outside Minerva, Drought and Grimace flash looks of concern (and in Drought's case, untold annoyance) -- mainly reliant on Fire for their attacks, the wet weather would not serve them well for certain. Despite this Andromeda swoops in, furious that she's left to an effective crawl by her opponents, and with the force of a river torrent she slams an <b>Aqua Tail</b> at her specified enemy. Smirking she turns to see an expected look of pain, but the sight of Dusclops' steely gaze perturbs her slightly. The instinct is one well expressed as this particular Dusclops slams its hands to the floor, and with a cry Andromeda crashes to the ground as the both of you grasp your knees, struggling to maintain posture as Dusclops curses the relevant area with its natural manipulative powers over <b>Gravity</b>. A creepy laugh emerges from the other Dusclops as it raises its hands, and Rayne recognises the summoned debris: a repeat of the <b>Rock Slide</b> that Minerva used earlier. Forcefully the stones are hurled at both your Pokémon, and while Tortuga succeeds in deflecting the blows with his <b>Iron Defence</b>, Andromeda isn't as lucky as her face cringes from the <b>flinch</b>ing move...</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 9px">[SIZE=1[COLOR=DarkSlateBlue]It didn't take long for Rayne's outlook on the battle to change. The beginning seemed promising he had to admit. Dragon vs. Ghost; decent aerial matchup you would think. Andromeda started off with her <b>Dragon Dance</b> attack which under normal circumstances would have meant a significant advantage. Not this time. One of the Dusclops set up a <b>Trick Room</b>, causing Andromeda's boosted speed to count for nothing. If that wasn't enough, an increase in <b>Gravity</b> further handicapped the Dragon pokemon. So this battle did a complete 180 in the matter of seconds, and now Rayne scrambled to think up a decent counter attack. Not an easy feat within this warped dimension. <br />
<br />
The one thing Rayne and Andromeda had to work with was the rain. He looked over to where the three fire types stood; each one seemed to curse at the weather change. Drought looked the most annoyed. If only he could hear what she was thinking. Most likely something along the lines of: “wonder what Blastoise soup tastes like?” Maybe it was better if he didn’t know. While the fire types suffered from the rain, Andromeda and Tortuga only stood to gain from it. <br />
<br />
“Zap ‘im with <span style="color: Yellow"><b>Thunder</b></span>. Then try to catch them off guard with an <span style="color: DeepSkyBlue"><b>Avalanche</b></span>. Finish with a <span style="color: Brown"> <b>Rock Slide</b></span> of your own.” Rayne would make the best of the rain and warped speed dimension while he could. It was only a matter of time before the attacks’ effects would fade he figured. They could hold them off for a couple more turns ... he hoped.[/COLOR]</span>

</blockquote><br />
<span style="color: DarkSlateBlue"><span style="font-size: 9px">How the round had taken a dramatic turn for the worst in a matter of minture was beyond him. With both a Trick Room and Gravity maneuvers in effect the outcome of this battle could end up dreadful. Pepper struggled to maintain his posture, as did the rest of the group, with Andromeda taking the brunt of the attack. A Salamence that couldn't fly is like a Lapras who couldn't surf, something to think about. He stared up at the sky, praying the rain would soon come and give the duo some much needed leverage. Sheepishly grinning, the trainer of the swamp tortoise gave a look of apology for the improper attack. Clearly they weren't to pleased with the shift in weather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you seriously going to let these ghostly bastards over power you? I thought you were a mighty blastoise,&quot; Tortuga bawled in rage smashing his fists into the soil below him. &quot;Great. Now demonstrate for Dusclops the true power of those cannons with a <b>HYDRO PUMP</b>. And when they retaliate, <b>WITHDRAW</b> and hold out for the rain. Finally I want you to give him a <a href="http://forums.upnetwork.net/threads/1735-Fizzy-Bubbles-Items?p=106831&amp;viewfull=1#post106831" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.upnetwork.net%2Fthreads%2F1735-Fizzy-Bubbles-Items%3Fp%3D106831%26viewfull%3D1%23post106831&amp;hash=1b7ebb536a3fbe25be4cafa9d902d183" rel="nofollow noopener"><b>BRAIN FREEZE</b></a>..

<b>Kori Gotcha:</b> After the brief, yet slightly frightening skirmish with your Combusken the two of you set out into the depths of the Wiese Forest. Like with any typical fighting type, the promise of a good workout was an incentive well worth the sacrifice. While Combusken seemed more grounded for the time being, you could still sense the restlessness in your oldest party member. Something within the fiery fighting chicken itched for battle, and that instinctive need was reflected in his eyes, which seemed to be burn with fire. <br />
<br />
Glad that Combusken had settled slightly, you divert your attention to your surroundings, trying as best you could to isolate the forest’s sounds and sights. At first you are overwhelmed at how calm and majestic the trees are. Their thick trunks surround you from all directions, enveloping you like a thick brown blanket. As thick as the forest is, you don’t feel smothered, but rather an almost unnatural calmness washes over you. Bright, warm sunrays strike you through the thick foliage, completing the illusion of being in bed so perfectly you begin to feel a little drowsy. Unknowingly you shut your eyes and let out a drawn out yawn, the sound of which snaps right you out of your near-swoon. A little embarrassed you shake your head slightly to displace the grogginess; maybe that mighty kick from Combusken gave you a minor concussion you think to yourself, but brush it off just as quickly as you conjured up the idea. <br />
<br />
“Busk!” Your Combusken’s cry pierces into your ear. You look around and notice that you had strayed from your partner slightly. You’re not entirely sure how that occurred, seeing as Combusken was just beside you not ten seconds ago. More surprising still was the fact that his cry sounded hoarse, out of place, unnatural. “Busken?” Combusken waves you over, telling you to hurry up. Again, his voice cuts through the air, but where it used to sound warm and welcoming it now sounds harsh and venomous. Alarmed, you look around to see if something is deceiving you into perceiving this effect, but find nothing. Combusken by this point figured something was wrong and quickly raced to your side. The sound of his footsteps on dead leaves breaks the silence again, and once more you find yourself almost cringing at the sound. What’s going on here you wonder … and then it hit you.<br />
<br />
This forest … made not a sound. You stood there with your Combusken at your side, and heard … nothing. Not a single sound. No flying pokemon chirping in the bright sky, no water rushing past little pebbles, nothing. You’ve come here in an attempt to study pokemon communication, but come to the grim realisation this might not be the right place; in fact, this place was beginning to freak you out. The trees that had not too long ago felt so cozy around you began to feel a little constricting. Worried you turn back and head in the direction you came from, each footstep sounding like it will shred your eardrum. You cover your ears with your palms, but the sound of the pulsing blood in your hands is too intense to handle. Then it all goes away. Silence surrounds you once more. <br />
<br />
“…!” You try to speak, but no sound comes out. “…” Again, not a sound. You can feel your tongue and lips moving, and yet the sound is lost somewhere between your lips and your ears. You notice that Combusken is having the same problem. His beak is moving, but you can’t hear what he’s saying. Both of you stare at each other, confused and terrified.<br />
<br />
“Welcome pupil,” A loud, wise sounding voice grabs your attention. To your great relief the voice doesn’t make you want to rip your ears out. It seems to come from every direction at once, surrounding you. Before you have time to look for source the voice continues. “you have been chosen young one. <i>You</i> are one of only few. <i>You</i> exhibit all the characteristic necessary. <i>You</i> carry the potential to lead our great family into an age of prosperity not yet witnessed in our rich history.” The voice trails off for a bit, leaving you more confused than ever. Was this speech aimed at you? <br />
<br />
“As you know, the trials you are about to face are not at all like the ones you have been exposed to in your brief life. Your performance up to this point has been stellar, beyond what is expected of someone your age, and for that the Council commends you. Remember, your future hangs in the balance; succeed and untold fortunes await you, fail … well ... you know what awaits you if you fail.” The mysterious voice rings ominously in the silent forest; a gut feeling tolls you failure might not be an option. “Now child, step forward and prepare to take on your greatest test. The challenge that will determine the rest of your life.” <br />
<br />
The echo that followed each of the man’s words cut out briefly afterwards. A faint blue orb descended through the forest canopy, suspended several feet above the ground. Curiosity gets the best of you and you find yourself reaching out to touch it. All it took was a slight nudge, but suddenly the orb began expanding, the blue light now flashing in bright pulses. As the orb expanded it pushed the trees around it out of the way, as if they were simply decorations on wheels. Confused you look around to see that this odd phenomenon was occurring all around you, the edges of the orb pushed the trees away, but somehow you were left untouched when the orb touched you. Finally the expanding halted, but the transformation was not yet complete. You were now smack in the middle of a gigantic blue, pulsating dome. The diameter of which was probably 100 yards or so. Beneath you the grass shrivelled away to reveal a solid marble platform, with many random hieroglyphs, symbols, sign and lines going every which way; if you were to guess, it looked like a giant spell circle. And indeed, just as the thought crossed your mind several symbols lit with that same pulsating blue light. The light started around the edges, and followed a spiralling groove towards where you were standing. You watched in amazement as the light, like water rushing down a dry riverbed after a large rainfall, raced around the circle all the while lighting up other symbols as it passed by them. Finally, the light drew to the last spiral, draining into a small basin right in front of you. With another quick pulse the stage was set, the light stopped pulsating, and you were left in this strange blue dome with your Combusken.<br />
<br />
“The Council determined your first test to be the Void. As you might have realised by now, sound does not propagate in the Void, verbal commands are utterly useless. We are testing your mental capacity to think quickly. More importantly it will test your communication and improvising skills; skills which are essential for high ranking army officers. Now child ... it is your time ... ascend above the obstacles set before you here; the Council demands it.&quot; The man's voice cut out once again, but is replaced with another, a woman's voice this time. While it sounds much more youthful than the man's, it resonates with nobility and elegance, a soothing tone to lull you before the imminent challenge. <br />
<br />
<i>Use your tongue, I’ll use my ear,<br />
Language will not aid you here.<br />
For every spoken word that does exist,<br />
Twenty alternatives there be, I do insist.<br />
Speech will fail you here this time round,<br />
Yet communication lives without a sound.</i>”<br />
<br />
As the woman finished her little poem, a yellow orb floated into your sight from across the dome. It remained stationary for a bit, roughly 40 yards in front of you. Suddenly, much like the blue orb on first contact, it began pulsating and expanding. Unlike the blue orb however it did not maintain a spherical shape. Instead limbs poked out of an ever expanding mid region, more protrusions followed in the perpendicular plain … and then you understood. As the orb's limbs and mid region expanded slowly it began to take on a slight resemblance to a Beedrill. You had to defeat this Beedrill without being able to use your vocal chords. Spoken commands would be impossible, but the woman implied spoken words are but one way to communicate with pokemon. Across the battle ground, the Beedrill was almost fully shaped. The battle would start shortly. <br />
<br />
<i>What will be your commands?</i></span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Chartreuse"> With the formation of the glowing yellow ball into a now opposing Beedrill, Kori's left eye began to twitch with the, to be frank, craziness of the situation. He flailed his arms and moved his lips in hopes that he could hear a scream but still, there was no sound coming out of his mouth as if someone had pressed the mute button on him. <br />
<br />
<i>This is madness! Absolute madness! What kind of freaking place is this? What's going on?</i> he thought unable to process the series of events that went on. He gripped the sides of his head as a headache began to form, but Combusken pulled on his shirt and Kori was quickly reminded of what he had to do. Somehow, Kori had to command Combusken's attacks without vocally saying anything and defeat that Beedrill. Kori rubbed his chin in thought until an idea formed.<br />
<br />
Kori poked Combusken to get his attention. When Combusken turned around, he saw Kori point 1 finger as if saying this is first.<i>Um.....what?</i> thought Combusken when he saw Kori scratching at the air and then suddenly striking his hand as if he was <b>crush</b>ing something with a <b>claw</b>. Kori then raised 2 fingers and started to jump up and down, <b>bouncing</b> all over the place. Then Kori raised 3 fingers up and did a roundhouse kick followed by a straight kick, <b>double</b> the <b>kick</b>s in one motion. Kori then pointed straight at the Beedrill hoping that Combusken got the message.</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Chartreuse"><b><u>Nelde Ruins: Wiese Forest</u></b><br />
<b>Kori Gotcha:</b> Not wanting to believe what is happening to you in this odd clearing, you attempt to yell, to break through the mute air, but no sound is coming whatsoever. Frustrated, you try to come up with a plan, and slowly one begins to form. While this dome was not so conducive to the propagation of sounds, your sense of sight seems to work just fine. Worth a shot you figure, so you poke Combusken, who promptly turns around to face you. <br />
<br />
Like a game of charades you act out the commands for this round of battle. Judging by the perplexed stare you’re receiving from Combusken, it was not nearly as effective as you had hoped. Combusken copies your motions slowly, confusion still evident in his eyes. When you are finished, Combusken nods and turns around to face your adversary. While the two of you were piecing together your strategy the Beedrill had finished its transformation, and to your great surprise was nowhere to be seen. Rather suddenly the still air begins to pick, but the Beedrill is still nowhere in sight. The wind steadily accelerates and you realise it keeps changing directions. While you were distracted, the Beedrill had set up a <b>Tailwind</b> which, to your dismay, followed the insect pokemon wherever it went, giving it a speed boost no matter which direction it faced. <br />
<br />
Combusken also picked up on this little fact, concentrating on figuring out the pattern of the bee’s movement. With a mighty kick off, Combusken lurched into the air, slashing through it with a formidable <b>scratch</b>ing motion. Your eyes finally focus on your assailant, the Beedrill seemingly appearing out of thin air, and slamming into the ground when Combusken’s attack abruptly changed its momentum. Not skipping a beat, Combusken launches itself into the air. Combusken understood this command quite a bit better. The Beedrill quickly recovers, and follows Combusken’s jump; its wings glowing with dark energy, a <b>Pursuit</b> attack. In a flash it caught up, slamming headfirst into the still ascending fire bird. While the damage taken seems to be minimal, the Beedrill did succeed in slightly altering the trajectory of Combusken. Alarmed, you watch as Combusken wobbles slightly, but to your relief he manages to even out before reaching the apex of his ‘flight’. Determined, Combusken summersaults in the air, picking up speed rapidly. It doesn't take long for Combusken to reach the Beedrill, the <b>Bounce</b> attack once again spearing the Beedrill into the ground again. The Beedrill is more slow to get itself off the ground this time, but retaliates by poking Combusken with its <b>twin needles</b>. Combusken winces as the sharp pokers make contact, but fights through the pain before landing a <b>Double Kick</b> attack on the bee. The roundhouse kick successfully pushes a stinger out of the way, before a quick jab slams powerfully into the bee’s face. <br />
<br />
With this rounds’ attacks out of the way, you now have to think of a way to relay Combusken’s next moves to him without stealing his attention from the pesky Beedrill. Without sounds it seems but impossible, but maybe there was some way to circumvent this limitation. Maybe there is some way to speak with your pokemon without actually having to <i>physically</i> utter the words.<br />
<br />
<i>How will you react now?</i><br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Shadowshocker:</b> From somewhere deep within the tangle Lacrimus was in you can hear a muffled cry of agreement. Before long you can see the tell tale signs of dark energy concentrating at the Gligar’s claw. You look down, and notice that the Spinarak were ignoring you, and instead heading for the easier prey; the currently immobile Gligar and terrified Combee. Nervously you peer back up just in time to see Lacrimus’ attack sever several strands of the web. To you delight you spot his right claw wrestle out of the mess, and now the Gligar worked furiously with both claws, slashing the silky strands away one at a time. Finally he managed to cut enough strands to send him flying from the trap. You smile a victorious smile, knowing in his next fly around he would cut the rest of you free.<br />
<br />
And indeed, powered by a <b>Quick Attack</b> Lacrimus came whizzing by, only a dark purple blur. As he passed you could feel the hold of the strands on you coming undone. Several snaps can be heard above as your weight finally beats the tension of the individual strands. Moments before slamming face first into the forest floor, you hear Lacrimus fly by one more time, this time freeing your arms from the sticky mess. With your arms finally free you brace your fall, quickly jumping to your feet soon after. The Ariados shrieks in fury, and it is only then that you remember about the third trapped member. The Combee had managed to wrestle itself free as well and was now running interference, buying you and Lacrimus some much needed time to escape. <br />
<br />
The purple blur that had managed to cut you all out of this web finally slowed down enough for you to make out the familiar form of your Gligar. The two of you made eye contact for but a moment, but the mutual feeling of “let’s get the hell outta here” was plain in both sets of eyes. Careful not to step on any webs you tiptoe gingerly around the web, before finally picking up your pace, running deeper into the forest and away from danger. In front of you Lacrimus led the way, weaving acrobatically through the trees, and behind you could hear the not-so-elegant Combee, which continually bumped into trees and low hanging vines. After putting some distance between your group and the ambush site you finally get the courage to spy a glance backwards. While it was common knowledge that Combee were by no means a graceful species of bugs, this individual’s flight pattern was baffling. It flew in spirals and zigzags, as if it was a puppet on strings controlled by two different puppet masters. Here and now you made out the distant sound of the Ariados hissing; it was giving chase! Lacrimus also heard the venomous hissing from behind and picked up his pace, wanting to be rid of the danger as soon as possible. <br />
<br />
A louder than usual crash from behind you forced you to glance over your shoulder once more. The bee pokemon had lost some ground on the two of you, and was now laying face in the dirt about fifteen paces back from you. Its wings beat helplessly and without rhythm at its side, as if the Combee no longer controlled its wings at all. What you see next halts you dead in your tracks. Three needle-like protrusions extend from the Combee’s exposed back; the wounds oozing with a viscous dark liquid. In your retreat the Ariados managed to send off one attack, poisoning your ambushed comrade. The erratic flying seemed to make much more sense now. As it exerted itself physically the poison pumped throughout its body much quicker, inhibiting the proper nervous-muscular mechanisms to take place. The Combee was now essentially paralyzed by this poison, and even more helpless than it was in the web. You have a choice to make, rescue the Combee once again, or leave it here to face its hunter. <br />
<br />
“Cooooooomb…” One last desperate plea escaped from the doomed insect, now only seconds from complete full body paralysis. From somewhere within trees you can hear the clicking and hissing sounds of the arachnid creeping closer. You have to make a choice … and quick.<br />
<br />
<i>What will it be? Help the Combee or let nature run its course?</i></span></span></div>

Southwest of Elendia lies a forest, within which lies the ancient ruins of Nelde -- home of the Binon royal family, who died out in the last few centuries. The Binon royal family was said to be a family of naturalist magicians who were at one with nature, and thus constructed their home alongside the forest trees. In the present day, the tree which the ruins were built around has grown into the stone, forming a monumental testimony of the power of nature over mankind. Alongside the local Pokémon, some of the ruins' magic traps are still in place to catch any intruders who might threaten the sanctity of the region.<br />
<b>Wiese Forest</b><br />
The forest that surrounds the Nelde Ruins. Its fertile soil has given rise to a wild variety of flora, some of which can no longer be found anywhere else on Riviera, though not all are safe to touch or consume. Adventurers are not recommended to delve too deeply into the forest, however -- it is said that within the deeper areas of Wiese Forest lies a magical labyrinth of trees, from which escape is nigh impossible.</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: chartreuse">A young girl stepped across the borders of the vast land of Riviera, only to quickly plop down on a nearby boulder in exhaustion. She took off her heels to rest her sore feet on the soft ground as she let out a heavy sigh. The psychic Pokemon by her side, better known as a Kadabra, muttered to her telepathically, <i>&quot;You're quite foolish, you know. The way you are dressed is definitely not suited for an adventurer such as yourself.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
He was right, as usual. If it wasn't for the Kadabra by her side and the empty pokeball she played with in her hand, nobody would have known she was a trainer. With blazing red hair styled to perfection, a black and white dress that looked extremely expensive, and small heels with a pair of socks that went up to her knees, she looked more like the daughter of an extremely wealthy person. However, her demeanor was anything polite and dainty. The young trainer was known for her impatience, lack of manners, and her language to rival that of the toughest sailor. After her Kadabra's remark, she gave him quite the nasty glare, responding with, &quot;And who complained all the way here, Prestige? Sure as hell wasn't me. No, you sat there whining about how your legs hurt and how using your psychic powers to push your fat tail-end along was exhausting you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Prestige scoffed, <i>&quot;I'm not built to be dragged along as your companion for long walks such as this, Alina. If you want company, choose that giant, flaming rodent of yours. Ignatius would have enjoyed running through the fields more than I. He needs the exercise after laying around the city for the past few months.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Ignoring her Pokemon's retort, Alina turned her head to admire the beauty and vastness of Riviera. Prestige had been upset with her for weeks because of her chosen location to relax and take their vacation from their adventures, so she was kind of used to his &quot;piss poor&quot; mood by now. Instead of a remote and restful location she had chosen one of the busy and jam-packed cities of Fizzy Bubbles, and the Kadabra despised overcrowded places. <br />
<br />
Feeling slightly better, she put her heels back on her feet and stood up. It felt great to start exploring again with her Pokemon, especially since they were more than well rested and were very ready to start traveling again. Riviera seemed like a good place to start off a new year's worth of adventures, and a place such as this was bound to have many Pokemon to discover. Turning to Prestige who had been impatiently playing with the spoon in his claws, Alina asked him what he wanted to do and where he wanted to go. She figured letting him choose the location would lighten his mood considerably, and she was tired of his terrible attitude. It was very out of character for him to be so angry, and she desperately wanted her calm and content Kadabra back.<br />
<br />
Prestige sighed, shrugging his shoulders. <i>&quot;Oh, I don't care. The entire place is overall interesting...&quot;</i><br />
<br />
As he pondered to himself Alina impatiently played with the empty pokeball in her hand. The Kadabra had always proven to be extremely useful, being able to pick up on things of the past and helping Alina through tight situations with his psychic powers. He was her preferred psychic type, having more experience than the rest of her psychic Pokemon in the field (with the exception of her Baltoy), but his mood was giving her second thoughts. However, she knew choosing another psychic type in place of him would be a terrible idea, especially if she chose her Beldum, Merlot. God, how he hated that Beldum... Alina would never be forgiven if he chose &quot;that 1/4th of a Metagross.&quot; So, Alina stuck with her usual choice of Prestige, deciding against choosing a Pokemon in less of a rebellious mood. Besides, it seemed a place such as Riviera, a place with much history and mythology behind it, would have lots of things for a psychic Pokemon to pick up on, which would possibly cheer her Kadabra up.<br />
<br />
Finally making up his mind, Prestige straightened up and pointed towards a forest with his spoon. <i>&quot;I think the Nelde Ruins would be a good place to start, dear Alina,&quot;</i> he said. <i>&quot;It may not fit your tastes, but we could still accomplish something there.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Alina was fine with Prestige's decision, since she wasn't too interested in adding to her team anyway. No, many of her Pokemon were due for evolving and training, including Prestige. Nodding and gesturing for her Kadabra to follow her, Alina headed towards the direction her Pokemon was pointing in and began to weave her way through the trees of the Wiese Forest...</span></span></div>

With the tide of battle turned around so abruptly and viciously, Rayne and Andromeda find themselves heavily disadvantaged as Pepper's summoned weather begins to grace the grounds with drizzle. All around, the Fire-types and Ogden continue holding off the Duskull, bursts of steam and flickering electricity dancing in midair swarms, but warranting more concern are the spectral cyclops standing stonily ahead. With twin cries <b>Night Shade</b> blasts issue from both their eyes, striking their targets home as the inverse laws of speed aid them in getting an attack in first. Unfortunately, the heavier gravitational field proves its undoing as Tortuga unleashes a lavish <b>Hydro Pump</b> from where he positioned himself, slamming into his Dusclops foe squarely below the eye; the technique's accuracy boosted by Gravity's effects albeit also washing off the gummy chocolate. However, as Pepper glances over his Blastoise it becomes noticeable that the heavy attack has drained Tortuga more than it normally would as he pants heavily -- at once, it hits the both of you that with Dusclops' only ability <b>Pressure</b> active, time would be more of the essence with each attack starkly reducing the battle capabilities of your Pokémon. Howling, Andromeda lets fly a hurricane's worth of <b>Thunder</b>, spiralling into the mummified spirit for major damage through the circuitry of the rainy weather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dus... dusclops.&quot; A knowing gaze is exchanged between both Dusclops, before their suspended fists rise as one in mid-air, and as energies in yellow and cyan gather sickened emotions of foreboding build in your guts. A <b>Thunderpunch</b> flies towards Tortuga while an <b>Ice Punch</b> heads at Andromeda; Tortuga succeeding in <b>Withdraw</b>ing into his shell to lessen the blow as Andromeda's dual Achilles' heel causes her to thrash about in numbness, discomfort and pain all at once. Eyes burning with proverbial fire Andromeda stomps the tiled floor, summoning stalagmites of ice where her foot meets the ground as the ice building up on her body splinters into multiple clods and shards. Pushed by her anger at being damaged, the <b>Avalanche</b> goes over fast and furious, burying Dusclops in a veritable mountain of the frozen liquid. The calm after the blizzard is soon shattered as Andromeda calls on a repeat <b>Rock Slide</b>, this time wrenching some loose bricks off the walls to further knock her opponent back six feet under, just as a wisp of air wafts out of Tortuga's shell and worms its way at the other Dusclops. A low moan is heard as Pepper's foe begins feeling the dull effects of <b>Brain Freeze</b>, but with your efficiency compromised severely, just how much longer can you last?...<br />
<br />
<br />

The sight of one of your preferred species in Pokémon clearly enthralls you, although given what you've only just experienced you decide to play this next approach with some diplomacy as well as deterrence. Assuming a pose of coming in peace you wait to see what happens as Bellatrix, understanding what you're trying to achieve, flitters back a few paces to give you some space. Save for the chirping sounds of local Bugs distances away, nothing seems to take place as you patiently bide your time, until a couple of the little Poliwag bravely totter out in view. Slowly, as they shift towards your feet, the others begin shuffling from behind their hiding spots, and as they gather you're quite certain this time that from the smallest tadpole to the largest Poliwhirl, the look of apprehension in their eyes is unmistakable; some even have bruises over their bellies and arms for some others, an assortment of fresh ones to fading ones.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wrath wrath poli!&quot;<br />
<br />
The gruff call instantly parts the group, forming two lines as you glance ahead -- the musclebound frame of a Poliwrath strides out to meet you, looking you over with wide, frowning eyes as it nears. You hear Bellatrix's buzzing kick up a pitched notch before you raise a hand, a silent message for her to calm down while Poliwrath continues to size you up. Some of the Poliwag, looking up at their evolved brethren, begin whispering excitedly, yet hushedly as the partial Fighting-type grunts and nods.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wrathpoli, poliwrathpoli. ...Poli, poliWRATH!&quot;<br />
<br />
You briefly see Poliwrath raise its hands at you, and in the instant of a blink you are immediately greeted with the sight of hordes of Grass Pokémon -- Weepinbell, Tangela, Parasect, swarming the grounds of the Moonlit Garden. Attempting to turn your head for a better look, you're shocked to find Poliwag and Poliwhirl flailing helplessly from the onslaught, attacked by the plant creatures without abandon. They are not the only ones -- groups of Wooper and Lombre fall victim to the attack, and everywhere you turn only super-effective carnage is seen. A dull, defeated cry makes you turn your head; you see a withdrawing, lumbering mass leave Poliwrath battered upon the tiles, a gleaming droplet within a long, twisted arm that niggles at your memory, before another blink brings you back to reality: Bellatrix holding onto your arm concernedly as Poliwrath stands, solemn as ever as the other tadpoles bow their heads.<br />
<br />
&quot;Poli, poli.&quot; Producing an item you identify to be a King's Rock from its hands, Poliwrath casts a forlorn gaze at the object. Slowly the pieces begin forming in your mind, as you realise the images Poliwrath showed you with its <b>Hypnosis</b>: the local Water-types were attacked by botanic opponents, likely more than once over a period of time, and they left with -- fear trembles briefly in your head, as you recognise the pilfered item -- something the Poliwag group desperately need. You recall briefly that Poliwhirl can't evolve with only a King's Rock; with no humans on Rosalina Island, the Moondrop must somehow have been key with the evolution inducer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wrath?&quot; Returning its gaze to you, the quiet plea is clear in Poliwrath's eyes...</span><br />

Having taken a heavy hit, multiplied by his natural weakness towards toxins, it takes Arctacea a while before he gets back onto his feet, making use of the bought time to clumsily run back to your side. Shivering briefly from the cold wave emitted by your Pokémon, you reach into your inventory before picking out a selection of discs, placing them against the frosted tree's forehead. Before long the machines fragment one by one as they bestow their concealed knowledge to Arctacea, who waves his stubby arms in excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd say that was rather eleventh-hour, though timely intervention nonetheless.&quot; Glancing at the enemy, Eriden raises his hands over his chest. &quot;Brace yourself, Jamie!&quot;<br />
<br />
The call does not come unwarranted: as he stands like a castle wall you soon see the reason for Eriden's warning -- a storm of <b>Rock</b>s, <b>Blast</b>ed out of Octillery's versatile nozzlemouth come raining at your team, while Kingler swipes its heavier claw in a show of <b>Ancientpower</b>. With cringing grunts Eriden stomachs both attacks, striking a chord of worry in you: you know that being part Ice-type Pokémon must equate to a considerable bit of agony for the warrior.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boy, this really stinks,&quot; comments Seroba, so nonchalantly and so abruptly you jolt a little, having forgotten her presence in the group. &quot;Does anyone have any idea how bad hail is for the skin? ...Oh, don't worry your head, Jamie.&quot; The Azumagirl's pout turns into a comforting smile as she catches your expression, &quot;Eriden's more than capable of holding his own. Look!&quot; Guided by her index finger, you see that indeed, Eriden has taken on the defensive glow of <b>Stockpile</b>d power. Affirmed that his ally is simply waiting out the attacks, Arctacea scuttles back into the fray, tossing a fresh <b>Energy Ball</b> that spins about in midair before crashing onto its crustacean recipient. Barely given time to react at its comrade's momentary dysfunction, Octillery frowningly begins charging botanic energy of its own, but a <b>Toxic</b> glob direct to its mouth successfully fizzles out the attack as the octopus hocks, sickened as Arcatacea flashes a taunting wink from his delivered retribution.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get ready, Snover! A combination for the finish!&quot; The straining in Eriden's voice is clear as the magenta aura reaches a brightened peak; Arctacea nods at the fighter before waving his hands outward. By your Snover's newly gained powers over water, the abundant liquid from the surroundings starts to gather in a <b>Water Pulse</b>, and just as Arctacea sends the wave bursting ahead Eriden rips open his protective stance, billowing a screaming laser from the air just in front of his teeth. The doublestocked <b>Spit Up</b> races along with the miniature tsunami, leaving Kingler as the closest opponent no option but to take the attacks literally head on; its cry accompanied by the sounds of crashing water and exploding energy. Moments later, with the clearing of the smoke and foam, you see Kingler barely twitch before its main pincer finally hits the marble with a resounding crash, its legs giving way as it faints right then and there...</span><br />

&quot;Ah, a fine specimen of a Medicham indeed. Your concern is polite, Will, though not quite necessary; Medicham profess a natural need to improve themselves continuously, a wise maxim followed by most Fighting-type Pokémon,&quot; reassures Yuanli. Giving your instructions to Medéo, the yoga practitioner glances past you, looking down into the well with a focused look in his eyes. A while passes before Medéo stands up, nodding in quiet confidence before extending his lithe arms outward. A shimmer of power travels down his arms, flying off his fingertips before you feel the glimmer of energy start to envelop your body, spreading like a wave of sunlight and burrowing deep into your consciousness. Feeling the urge to blink you do so, and in that fragment of time when you reopen your eyes you find yourself having to immediately adjust to an environment of shadow. Damp discomfort wraps around your skin like seaweed, and lined neatly along the walls a multitude of torches burn with a mesmerising shade of seagreen, illuminating the cavern littered with rocks and spikes.<br />
<br />
&quot;An excellent effort, Medéo. More so, considering your performance was without prior knowledge of this area, and you had carry on more than one individual. I don't exaggerate, Will, when I say that you've trained your Medicham well,&quot; Yuanli smiles. &quot;Now, we should continue. Mildew and malevolence do wait for no one.&quot;<br />
<br />
The passage, as your group makes its way down the only possible direction led by the torches and a breeze of cold air simply been graced by death, this road seemed to be steeped right in it like a foul bog; you have a vague impression that even stopping to rest here would risk one drowning in the sheer stench of the afterlife. The thoughts spurs your footsteps, prompting you to move on even though your mind is quite certain you're walking towards the great passing itself, until you come across -- what, exactly? As you draw nearer you see the wall ahead of you is in fact made of petrified plant material, with a slab of rock preventing further access.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? What might this be?&quot; Suddenly, bending down to pick up something, Yuanli beckons to you: a swatch of tattered, dark brown cloth in his hand. &quot;Chroma, would you mind?&quot; Nodding, Yuanli's Sableye casts his pair of red eyebeams over the item, scanning it for about a minute before ceasing the attack. This time, though, you notice him snarling and clawing the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Chroma. Those thieves quite likely took refuge in this very cemetery, though in my humble opinion, a rather foolish and risky endeavour considering the circumstances. But what of this slab?&quot; Tapping the barrier with his staff, Yuanli peers at it closely. &quot;In any case, we cannot continue on with our objective like this. ...Oh, I say!&quot;<br />
<br />
In a display you find incredibly deja vu, lines begin appearing on the rocky panel, and as though entranced you lean in for a closer look:<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center"><i>A cycle is the way of life,<br />
Back and forth between death's scythe.<br />
Many come and go this way<br />
And this commandment must obey.<br />
A sacred law, a pact of trade,<br />
A giving up of light or shade.<br />
No matter through will, faith or wrath,<br />
None may leave the grave unscathed.<br />
<br />
Your entry now is not allowed<br />
Until a toll you grant.<br />
The payment sought will sate the taste<br />
Of creatures adamant.<br />
It perishes against the wind,<br />
It fails against the chill.<br />
Inside if crushed it makes a cure<br />
To alleviate the ill.</i>&#8203;</div><br />
&quot;Interesting perspective. Suffice to say, it seems that without offering the item requested by the creator of this riddle -- whomever it might be, we're quite stuck here. This mechanism must have been implemented to keep most individuals out... regardless, we have to solve this riddle,&quot; Yuanli mutters. &quot;Certainly not one to scrimp on the theatrics, wise words though they are, this person...&quot;<br />
<br />
What do you think? Do you have something that might fit the riddle's description?</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Chartreuse"><b><u>Nelde Ruins: Wiese Forest</u></b><br />
<b>Kori Gotcha:</b> Not wanting to believe what is happening to you in this odd clearing, you attempt to yell, to break through the mute air, but no sound is coming whatsoever. Frustrated, you try to come up with a plan, and slowly one begins to form. While this dome was not so conducive to the propagation of sounds, your sense of sight seems to work just fine. Worth a shot you figure, so you poke Combusken, who promptly turns around to face you. <br />
<br />
Like a game of charades you act out the commands for this round of battle. Judging by the perplexed stare you’re receiving from Combusken, it was not nearly as effective as you had hoped. Combusken copies your motions slowly, confusion still evident in his eyes. When you are finished, Combusken nods and turns around to face your adversary. While the two of you were piecing together your strategy the Beedrill had finished its transformation, and to your great surprise was nowhere to be seen. Rather suddenly the still air begins to pick, but the Beedrill is still nowhere in sight. The wind steadily accelerates and you realise it keeps changing directions. While you were distracted, the Beedrill had set up a <b>Tailwind</b> which, to your dismay, followed the insect pokemon wherever it went, giving it a speed boost no matter which direction it faced. <br />
<br />
Combusken also picked up on this little fact, concentrating on figuring out the pattern of the bee’s movement. With a mighty kick off, Combusken lurched into the air, slashing through it with a formidable <b>scratch</b>ing motion. Your eyes finally focus on your assailant, the Beedrill seemingly appearing out of thin air, and slamming into the ground when Combusken’s attack abruptly changed its momentum. Not skipping a beat, Combusken launches itself into the air. Combusken understood this command quite a bit better. The Beedrill quickly recovers, and follows Combusken’s jump; its wings glowing with dark energy, a <b>Pursuit</b> attack. In a flash it caught up, slamming headfirst into the still ascending fire bird. While the damage taken seems to be minimal, the Beedrill did succeed in slightly altering the trajectory of Combusken. Alarmed, you watch as Combusken wobbles slightly, but to your relief he manages to even out before reaching the apex of his ‘flight’. Determined, Combusken summersaults in the air, picking up speed rapidly. It doesn't take long for Combusken to reach the Beedrill, the <b>Bounce</b> attack once again spearing the Beedrill into the ground again. The Beedrill is more slow to get itself off the ground this time, but retaliates by poking Combusken with its <b>twin needles</b>. Combusken winces as the sharp pokers make contact, but fights through the pain before landing a <b>Double Kick</b> attack on the bee. The roundhouse kick successfully pushes a stinger out of the way, before a quick jab slams powerfully into the bee’s face. <br />
<br />
With this rounds’ attacks out of the way, you now have to think of a way to relay Combusken’s next moves to him without stealing his attention from the pesky Beedrill. Without sounds it seems but impossible, but maybe there was some way to circumvent this limitation. Maybe there is some way to speak with your pokemon without actually having to <i>physically</i> utter the words.<br />
<br />
<i>How will you react now?</i><br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Chartreuse"><i>Ok, he missed the Crush Claw but at least he got the Bounce and Double Kick right</i> thought Kori. Still, for only being able to mime out the attack orders, Combusken did really well. Now though, Kori had no idea how he was supposed to relay attack orders to his pokemon now that Combusken's full attention was on the Beedrill. Without sound Kori couldn't yell the orders and now there was no way to mime it out. Even if he could, writing out orders wouldn't work either since Combusken would have to be distracted and he couldn't risk that, Beedrill are dangerous enough when their presence is acknowledged. Kori's brain was wracked and he was getting frustrated. <br />
<br />
<i>Dammit! I don't get it! How am I supposed to relay anything to Combusken if I can't say anything! What I really need is for Combusken to increase his speed with <b>Agility</b> and then overwhelm this bug with his fire attacks <b>Ember</b> and <b>Vacuum Wave</b> but how am I supposed to say it! All I have is the voice in my head.</i> Kori grabbed his head as a headache was beginning to form. <i>WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO! I NEED TO HELP MY COMBUSKEN!</i> shouted Kori's mind to who knows what.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslateblue"><b><u>Lacrima Castle</u> - please reply in darkslateblue</b><br />
Located on Rosalina Island, the northeasternmost island in Riviera territory, Lacrima Castle is also popularly known as &quot;the castle bathed in moonlight&quot;. Until some decades ago, a race of people known as Arcs lived within the castle grounds, but little has been heard from them ever since and the Arcs are believed to have simply died out. Swarmed by a variety of Pokémon, Rosalina Island is a considerably feral location in Riviera, and with the Arcs' apparent disappearance it has been overcast by a peculiar shroud that appears to cloud the island in night's darkness. Adventurers to Lacrima Castle find that it is always night there, though the silvery moon shines bright upon the seemingly ominous, yet melancholy structure. The only methods of getting to Lacrima Castle would be via the help of a Surfing or Flying Pokémon, although it is rumoured another method of transport exists somewhere...<br />
<b>Wilheim Path</b><br />
A coastal road that goes about a cliff, leading to where Lacrima Castle stands. Due to its position near the water, the weather is often warm, and migratory birds can be seen enjoying the breeze. Some of the grasses and herbs found here are known to have various healing properties.<br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslateblue">Stark wandered along the coastal road. His long red coat flowing behind him. The journey ahead appeared daunting considering how far away the castle still was. The darkness surrounding the island was eery to say the least. A land of eternal night was what he had heard. How anyone could have possibly lived there was beyond him. Not that he disliked the darkness, it was just that he liked the natural energy he felt from sunlight. Then again, maybe the fabled Arcs that lived here were vampires or some other ghoul that couldn't handle the sun. His mind raced with stories from his childhood of ghosts and monsters. He remembered sitting in front of the TV as a child on a rainy Saturday afternoon watching old black and white films. The bad accents. The cheesy special effects. A smile curled up his face at the thought. He wasn't quite sure what made him jump to memories of classic horror movies exactly, but it did make him realize that maybe he should be paying a little more attention to where he was and what he was doing. Especially with the way the road ahead seemed to travel along the edge of a cliff.<br />
<br />
Stark took his first steps wondering just what it was that intrigued him about Lacrima Castle. Usually he spent his time visiting more tourist oriented places in his journeys. The castle was far from touristy. Although he had to admit the moon was a sight to behold here. It's silvery luminescence lighting the night sky like a lonely soul lost in tranquility. Still, it was the mystery of the Castle that drew him to it. At least that was what he finally concluded. A whole race of people gone from the world without a trace of what happened. Granted he didn't want to find out first hand what happened, but his curiosity was definitely piqued. <br />
<br />
He could hear the crunch of the ground beneath his boots as he walked. Each sound seemingly louder than the last. He didn't remember stepping so heavily in the past and probably wasn't really stepping that heavily. It was just that it was now in his head. That was the problem with noticing the noise in the first place. His hand reached down to his belt and cupped a pokéball thinking that maybe he would release one of his partners to get the stray thoughts and sounds out of his head. However, he stopped short of actually removing the device. He was heading into the unknown and there was always a chance he would need the help of his friends. For now he would let them rest until he actually needed them. The journey to the castle was going to take a while and needlessly stressing out one of his partners wasn't going to help anyone. Instead he continued his trek alone doing his best to ignore any stray thoughts while taking in what scenery he could make out. </span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;Ah, a fine specimen of a Medicham indeed. Your concern is polite, Will, though not quite necessary; Medicham profess a natural need to improve themselves continuously, a wise maxim followed by most Fighting-type Pokémon,&quot; reassures Yuanli. Giving your instructions to Medéo, the yoga practitioner glances past you, looking down into the well with a focused look in his eyes. A while passes before Medéo stands up, nodding in quiet confidence before extending his lithe arms outward. A shimmer of power travels down his arms, flying off his fingertips before you feel the glimmer of energy start to envelop your body, spreading like a wave of sunlight and burrowing deep into your consciousness. Feeling the urge to blink you do so, and in that fragment of time when you reopen your eyes you find yourself having to immediately adjust to an environment of shadow. Damp discomfort wraps around your skin like seaweed, and lined neatly along the walls a multitude of torches burn with a mesmerising shade of seagreen, illuminating the cavern littered with rocks and spikes.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;An excellent effort, Medéo. More so, considering your performance was without prior knowledge of this area, and you had carry on more than one individual. I don't exaggerate, Will, when I say that you've trained your Medicham well,&quot; Yuanli smiles. &quot;Now, we should continue. Mildew and malevolence do wait for no one.&quot;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">The passage, as your group makes its way down the only possible direction led by the torches and a breeze of cold air simply been graced by death, this road seemed to be steeped right in it like a foul bog; you have a vague impression that even stopping to rest here would risk one drowning in the sheer stench of the afterlife. The thoughts spurs your footsteps, prompting you to move on even though your mind is quite certain you're walking towards the great passing itself, until you come across -- what, exactly? As you draw nearer you see the wall ahead of you is in fact made of petrified plant material, with a slab of rock preventing further access.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;Oh? What might this be?&quot; Suddenly, bending down to pick up something, Yuanli beckons to you: a swatch of tattered, dark brown cloth in his hand. &quot;Chroma, would you mind?&quot; Nodding, Yuanli's Sableye casts his pair of red eyebeams over the item, scanning it for about a minute before ceasing the attack. This time, though, you notice him snarling and clawing the air.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;Yes, Chroma. Those thieves quite likely took refuge in this very cemetery, though in my humble opinion, a rather foolish and risky endeavour considering the circumstances. But what of this slab?&quot; Tapping the barrier with his staff, Yuanli peers at it closely. &quot;In any case, we cannot continue on with our objective like this. ...Oh, I say!&quot;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">In a display you find incredibly deja vu, lines begin appearing on the rocky panel, and as though entranced you lean in for a closer look:</span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">What do you think? Do you have something that might fit the riddle's description?</span></span>

</blockquote> <br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">As Yuanli puzzled out loud over the mysterious riddle, Will dragged a hand through his short brown hair and mentally ran through the lines of the poem a second time. He had to admit the first stanza certainly had him stumped, although he guessed the references to death had to do with the nearby graveyard. As for the second stanza, Will completely agreed with the wizened sage; it was clear that they were required to leave some kind of item in order to progress further through the caverns.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray"><i><b>“…sate the taste of creatures adamant…”</b></i> Obviously, the riddle spoke of food that a Pokemon with a steely, unyielding nature would find satisfying. But what kind?</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray"><b><i>“…perishes against wind…fails against chill… can be crushed to make a cure…”</i></b> From the last lines, it was clear that the food had to be some type of Berry. But which one? </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Will knew that most Berries possessed some type of curative property and, in general, grew better in warmer climes. The only exception he could think of was the Yache Berry, which he had witnessed firsthand growing bountifully in the Glacier Islands. Thriving under the care of the residents of snowflake village, that special berry was the exception to the rule, and gave powerful testimony to the agriculture prowess of the hardy farmers of Snowflake Village. The small settlement was famous throughout the land of FB for its Yache Orchards.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Hoping he might have a Berry that would answer the riddle, Will sat cross-legged on the ground and turned his messenger bag upside down, effectively emptying it of its meager contents. An odd assortment of items tumbled haphazardly to the ground. A pair of heart scales. An Espeon stuffed toy. Six custom Poke Balls, four of which housed Will’s active party. A sable-colored Pokedex. An oblong Pokeblock dispenser. A lumpy, drawstring sack.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Seeing the tattered carrying pouch, Will immediately grabbed it and set it off to one side. He scooped up all his other belongings, stuffed them back into his courier bag, then turned to regard the item he had singled out. As he had before, the boy upended the drawstring sack and poured its contents onto the ground. A small collection of berries in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors could be seen in the murky, subterranean light. During his travels, Will had chanced upon a Berry Shop that graciously handed out complimentary Berries to trainers, and the majority of the produce before him were free samples he had received there.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Staring at the peculiar fruits, Will wished he had paid closer attention to their tag descriptions and thought hard to remember what they said. As he racked his brain, he separated the berries into two smaller piles; those that were commonly used in battle - four berries - and those that were primarily used in the preparation of Poke-snacks, the other two.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">The first berry Will inspected was round and bright red with a curly green stem. It was the incredibly spicy Cheri Berry. His never-surrender Medicham comrade Medeo loved its provocative flavor. Will turned it over in his hand. It was small and he remembered that it was a well-known remedy for Paralysis.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Will grabbed a half-blue, half-brown berry next. The Chesto Berry. It was super hard, with a tough, thick skin, and he guessed it would probably taste pretty dry. He had never tried one in battle, but had overheard fellow trainers talk about using it instead of a Poke Flute to awaken their sleeping partners.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">After that, Will carefully picked up a soft, pink berry with green leaves. His stomach gurgled pitifully as he stared longing at the tiny Pecha and hungrily licked his lips. Very sweet and very delicious, Will had to admit this Berry more than lived up to its reputation of having a wonderful taste. In battle and out, it had utility as a common cure for Poisoning.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">The fourth berry Will reached for was round and green. One of its ends curled up, while the other had five different colored leaves in the shape of a star. The unique pattern had earned it an appropriate name, the Starf Berry, and Will recalled hearing that many people considered it a mirage. It had something to do with a legend claiming it was so strong it had to be abandoned at the world’s edge. Will didn’t know if that was true or just a myth, but if so, it made this berry quite rare, and he hated the idea of having to part with it.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Finally, Will came to a pair of large, hard berries that vaguely reminded him of the top part of a Ludicolo’s head. A crown of stiff pointy leaves circled each large fruit’s ridged exterior. Like the Cheri, these Pinap Berries were a favorite of Medeo, and Will figured that could only mean that they, too, had a spicy flavor. Will was certain the tropical-looking fruit had medicinal value, but he couldn’t quite remember what specific ailment it cured. It would have to do. In any case, it was the only berry he had doubles of, and cheapskate that he was, he didn’t much mind the thought of parting with one.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Leaving a Pinap out, Will quickly shoveled the remaining fruit quintet into his Berry Bag, pulled the drawstring tight, and stuffed it back into his messenger bag. He palmed the Pinap and stood, brushing the dust off the seat of his dark trousers with his free hand. Turning to Yuanli, he held out the tropical-looking fruit and asked, “Well, what d’you think, sir?

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Chartreuse"><b><u>Nelde Ruins: Wiese Forest</u></b><br />
<b>Shadowshocker:</b> From somewhere deep within the tangle Lacrimus was in you can hear a muffled cry of agreement. Before long you can see the tell tale signs of dark energy concentrating at the Gligar’s claw. You look down, and notice that the Spinarak were ignoring you, and instead heading for the easier prey; the currently immobile Gligar and terrified Combee. Nervously you peer back up just in time to see Lacrimus’ attack sever several strands of the web. To you delight you spot his right claw wrestle out of the mess, and now the Gligar worked furiously with both claws, slashing the silky strands away one at a time. Finally he managed to cut enough strands to send him flying from the trap. You smile a victorious smile, knowing in his next fly around he would cut the rest of you free.<br />
<br />
And indeed, powered by a <b>Quick Attack</b> Lacrimus came whizzing by, only a dark purple blur. As he passed you could feel the hold of the strands on you coming undone. Several snaps can be heard above as your weight finally beats the tension of the individual strands. Moments before slamming face first into the forest floor, you hear Lacrimus fly by one more time, this time freeing your arms from the sticky mess. With your arms finally free you brace your fall, quickly jumping to your feet soon after. The Ariados shrieks in fury, and it is only then that you remember about the third trapped member. The Combee had managed to wrestle itself free as well and was now running interference, buying you and Lacrimus some much needed time to escape. <br />
<br />
The purple blur that had managed to cut you all out of this web finally slowed down enough for you to make out the familiar form of your Gligar. The two of you made eye contact for but a moment, but the mutual feeling of “let’s get the hell outta here” was plain in both sets of eyes. Careful not to step on any webs you tiptoe gingerly around the web, before finally picking up your pace, running deeper into the forest and away from danger. In front of you Lacrimus led the way, weaving acrobatically through the trees, and behind you could hear the not-so-elegant Combee, which continually bumped into trees and low hanging vines. After putting some distance between your group and the ambush site you finally get the courage to spy a glance backwards. While it was common knowledge that Combee were by no means a graceful species of bugs, this individual’s flight pattern was baffling. It flew in spirals and zigzags, as if it was a puppet on strings controlled by two different puppet masters. Here and now you made out the distant sound of the Ariados hissing; it was giving chase! Lacrimus also heard the venomous hissing from behind and picked up his pace, wanting to be rid of the danger as soon as possible. <br />
<br />
A louder than usual crash from behind you forced you to glance over your shoulder once more. The bee pokemon had lost some ground on the two of you, and was now laying face in the dirt about fifteen paces back from you. Its wings beat helplessly and without rhythm at its side, as if the Combee no longer controlled its wings at all. What you see next halts you dead in your tracks. Three needle-like protrusions extend from the Combee’s exposed back; the wounds oozing with a viscous dark liquid. In your retreat the Ariados managed to send off one attack, poisoning your ambushed comrade. The erratic flying seemed to make much more sense now. As it exerted itself physically the poison pumped throughout its body much quicker, inhibiting the proper nervous-muscular mechanisms to take place. The Combee was now essentially paralyzed by this poison, and even more helpless than it was in the web. You have a choice to make, rescue the Combee once again, or leave it here to face its hunter. <br />
<br />
“Cooooooomb…” One last desperate plea escaped from the doomed insect, now only seconds from complete full body paralysis. From somewhere within trees you can hear the clicking and hissing sounds of the arachnid creeping closer. You have to make a choice … and quick.<br />
<br />
<i>What will it be? Help the Combee or let nature run its course?</i></span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: chartreuse"><span style="font-size: 9px">Tactics were almost inapplicable at this point as Shadow's mind debated with ethics. Under most circumstances if he was just passing by and a minute too late, he wouldn't have been too shaken, but in this case even if Combee had been a tactical annoyance for lack of a nicer definition, they were acquaintances bonded by trauma. A knuckle tensed as Shadow recalled one of tenets of his training, years ago when he could still identify himself as the proud operative of an organisation: to never leave a fellow operative behind, not when there was still hope.<br />
<br />
Mentally Shadow went through his immediate inventory and cursed. When was the last time he purchased PokéBalls? He had been lax in maintenance and was presently out of an immediate capsulation module to ensure Combee's safety. He would have to perform an open-air escort, but at the very least the enemy had not yet appeared, giving him a slight advantage to speed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lacrimus, <b>Quick Attack</b>. Ride the Normal-type priority energy, curve in and snag Combee, then round right back without letting go as best you can, dropping it back into my arms before we start running like hell,&quot; breathed Shadow. &quot;I'll be waiting with a <a href="http://forums.upnetwork.net/threads/1009-Berry-Shop?p=121604&amp;viewfull=1#post121604" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.upnetwork.net%2Fthreads%2F1009-Berry-Shop%3Fp%3D121604%26viewfull%3D1%23post121604&amp;hash=565946a1d979af126e81d8e93c3cfc9d" rel="nofollow noopener">Cheri Berry</a> for first aid administering and try to extract those barbs as we go, but if you need to throw Ariados off at any point a <b>Sand-Attack</b> should buy us time.&quot;</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Chartreuse"><b><u>Nelde Ruins: Wiese Forest</u></b><br />
<b>Demon Skittles:</b> Having no problem at all locating the fringe of Wiese Forest, Prestige and yourself march into the forest, ready to begin a new chapter of your adventures. At first the going is slow, seeing as this new terrain is less suitable to your choice of footwear. The soft soil of the forest parts much more easily under the pressure of your heels in comparison to the rocky substrate that makes up the other parts of Riviera. Prestige did not miss your slightly altered swagger, but kept the comments to himself for the time being. Judging by his face he was having a hard time restraining himself. Almost instantaneously you notice a change in your Kadabra’s demeanour, his face contorting slightly, a crease forming on his forehead. <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… Hold on …&gt;</i> He beams to you in alarm. <i>&lt;… Take two steps to your left, and then continue walking in the same direction …&gt;</i> Mildly confused, you do as he instructs, shooting him a questioning stare. Before you get the chance to ask him about what had just occurred, Prestige’s voice once again cuts into your head. <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… You were two steps from setting off some sort of trap …&gt;</i> You glance backwards to where you would have stepped had he not warned you, but don’t see a thing. <i>&lt;… It’s not physical. I can’t see it at all, but I can sense it. Whoever laid this out knew what they were doing, because I couldn’t pick up its signature until we were within three yards of the thing …&gt;</i> You follow Prestige’s gaze to the trap, but once again find that your eyes are not registering anything out of the ordinary; just grass and leaves. Suddenly you realise how lucky it was that you were wearing those heels. Had you not and instead worn hiking boots, or running shoes, you probably would have walked right into the trap before your extrasensory partner noticed the magical trap. <br />
<br />
Before either of can analyse the situation further a shrill screams cuts through the forest, not terribly far from where you were, followed by a deep thud. Initially you wonder if someone had stepped into a nearby trap, but what you hear next dispels that theory: <br />
<br />
“H-h-h-h-help … some-some-so-someone? HELP!” Up ahead through the trees, in a moderately sized clearing you spot the distressed man. He is sitting on the ground, eyes fixed ahead in terror, kicking and clawing as fast as he can away from whatever he’s staring at. This time it’s the man’s gaze that you follow, and then you notice it … his stalker, and you can’t believe what you’re seeing. While the trees slightly obstruct your view, there is no doubt about it. You are staring at a giant, green Victreebel. From where you stand you would estimate its height to be roughly eight feet. As if the immense size of the thing wasn’t enough of a tip off, the colour most certainly sent warning flags flying. The normally bright yellow flower portion of the pokemon is the exact same colour as its leaves; meadow green. The red lips that normally line the top of its mouth have also been painted green of a slightly different shade. The stalk, the terminal leaf, everything but its eyes, all green. You watch in disbelief as this monstrosity slowly closes the distance between hunter and prey. <br />
<br />
“HELP!” The man yells again. The Victreebel swiftly lashes out with a vine, smacking the man face with such force it almost feels as if you’ve been slapped. With another vine it easily coils the ankle of the helpless man, with ease lifts him over its head, and slams the man into the ground. The Victreebel retracts its vines, cackling to itself, as the defenceless man blindly searches for his glasses that were flung off in the process. How he moved at all after that display was beyond you. As he searches, the grass type begins spitting up thick globs of acid all about the place, making the clearing a minefield of corrosive garbage for the man to sift through. Clearly, the mutant Victreebel is just toying with its prey for the time being. Soon, however, it would land the final blow and walk off with its catch. <br />
<br />
<i>Will you intervene?</i><br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Kori Gotcha:</b> The severity of the situation is not lost on you as you begin to feel anger build up within you. The frustration of not being able to communicate would drive just about any person half past crazy, and yet you stand there not being able to quite place the pieces of the puzzle together. You know what you needed to do, but not how to pass that information along to your partner. Without commands Combusken was sure to get hurt, and that thought you could not stand. But then you also had yourself to worry about. If you lose this battle, you would fail the challenge.<br />
<br />
The grim warning of the invisible man runs through your head: <i>“Succeed and untold fortunes await you, fail … well ... you know what awaits you if you fail.”</i>. Maybe knowing what awaits you with failure would have been best, but judging by the way he uttered that final sentence was too discomforting. Panic and anger well up inside you once more as you watch the next round of battle unfold. Not given any instruction, Combusken is helpless as the Beedrill swoops down and unleashes a <b>fury</b> of <b>attack</b>s on him. Not caring too much for your obvious disadvantage the bee pokemon circles around shoots a stream of <b>pin needle</b>s at your Combusken. Instinct saves your fire fowl this time, as he rolls to one side and then forwards in a perfectly executed evasive maneuver. Combusken looks back at you with a worried expression and then shifts his gaze to your belt, then back up to meet your eyes; urgency now written all over his features. The Beedrill, angry that its latest attack was foiled, throws itself into a tantrum, glancing Combusken’s thigh with a rather feeble <b>Rage</b> attack. <br />
<br />
Combusken didn’t seem to take notice of this last attack. Instead it ran back to you, urgently pointing at your pokeball clip with one of his claws. Now it was his turn to play charades with you. Combusken closed his eyes slowly and deliberately before bringing his two hands to both his temples, making it look as if he was concentrating or meditating. He then snapped his eyes open, and pointed at your belt again. Out of nowhere the wind shifted, and you were all too aware that the Beedrill was barrelling towards your distracted Combusken. The foe slams into Combusken with enough force to send the chicken hurtling through the air, and although you can tell that it hurt, the stare in Combusken’s eyes told you that he felt it was worth it.<br />
<br />
<i>What will you make of Combusken’s hint?</i><br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Shadowshocker:</b> As soon as the instructions left your mouth Lacrimus flew into action. The Gligar’s acceleration is immediate, and within a fraction of a second you see the dark blur that is your flying scorpion dip to snag the paralyzed Combee. With the Combee in tow Lacrimus alters his flight trajectory into a tight U, slamming the knocked out bee into your waiting grasp. Knowing the sluggish thing couldn’t chew at the moment, you crush the Cheri Berry you had prepared, letting the juices run into one of the slightly agape mouths of Combee. In an almost immediate response to the antidote the Combee’s eyes began darting from direction to direction, anxiously searching for its miraculous cure. Only too glad to comply, you lightly stuff the Cheri Berry pulp into the mouth of the recovering Combee.<br />
<br />
Not wanting to waste another second in this vulnerable position, you turn on your heels and bolt as fast as you can away from your ambush site. Apparently, not fast enough. You can hear the venom in Lacrimus’ voice as he curses audibly in his tongue. A slender flutter of his wings had him flipping in midair, now flying backwards in front of you, a sight that could only mean the reappearance of the resilient Ariados. Lacrimus tensed his wings, building up as much tension as he possible could in his chest muscles, before unleashing an immensely powerful gust of wind. The force of the wind sent every loose particle in the immediate vicinity hurtling in the opposite direction of your sprint. The soil from the forest floor could not keep its grip on the ancient roots, and it too spiralled into the Gligar’s distractive technique. The displeased screech of the spider informed you of the successful attack, but before the feeling of safety could really sink in you notice darts flying past you in a scattered pattern. To your relief you don’t feel any of the poisonous darts hit you; the Ariados was shooting blindly through the opaque veil of particles. <br />
<br />
So as to not give it another shot you pick up your pace further, tugging at the poisonous darts in the Combee’s back. Lacrimus was once again flying in front of you now, leading you in the least obstructed path. Although you could not hear the spider pokemon anymore, you had a feeling that the Ariados would not give up that easily. The look in its eyes as it watched its soon-to-be meal escape right under its “nose”, well, that was enough to let you know that this Ariados would probably chase you to the other end of the forest before quitting the chase. Having no other choice you run, run as fast as your legs would let you. <br />
<br />
As fast as your legs would let you … why was your left leg suddenly feeling a bit heavier? Not a bit, actually, it felt significantly heavier. Now that you noticed it, it actually felt as if your whole body was heavy. Every second the air around you thickened. Now it felt like you were running through chest deep water, and now molasses. What was going on? Startled you look down at your left leg, the source of this odd sensation. It didn’t take long to notice the suddenly all too visible dart sticking out of your left hamstring. Now it felt as if you’re running through sand, impossibly slow. The realisation hit you harder than freight train … the poison that soaked the dart set into action immediately; both a potent localized anaesthetic and an effective neurotoxin. Before you could really contemplate the consequences of …<br />
<br />
Floor … <br />
<br />
Darkness …<br />
<br />
* * * * * <br />
<br />
Now it felt like you were buried in concrete. Somehow you manage to force your eyelids open, and the sight that awaited you took several agonizing moments to reach your brain. You were in a dark room, that much you could tell, but no detail was taking shape. Maybe the poison hadn’t worn off yet. The recognition of a sharp pain in your left hamstring disproved that theory. Your attempt at wincing was not much better than your previous eye-opening ordeal. By the time your eyelid muscles responded to the automatic pain reflex, the pain was pretty much gone. It was as if someone had taken your nerves while you were blacked out, and replaced them with wires that raced around the whole world before they ended at their target. If opening and closing your eyes took seconds, you didn’t want to think how difficult walking would be. <br />
<br />
“Ah … so you’re finally up.” A raspy, female voice cut your contemplating off. Your brain had no problem realising this voice grated your very nerves. She had the kind of voice that was instantly annoying beyond belief; the kind of voice that sent goose bumps all along your arms when your brain functioned properly. Why did your brain have no problem integrating her voice? You were suddenly aware that this woman was actually hovering right over your face, blocking the light source from you. Goose bumps ran down your arm, just now reacting to her voice. How annoying. “Haghahag … cough … hak … you were slow to recover, child … hak hak … at least you survived … cough … much better than most humans would have fared.” Her disgusting wheezing and coughing and laughing made you want to vomit, or maybe it was the lingering effect of the poison. You could feel your muscles moving in response to the gag reflex, but before the natural motion of things could dish out its product; your muscles stopped moving, and then relaxed.<br />
<br />
“I wouldn’t move … cough … if I were you … baha … you may have beat Sheila’s poison … but … hak … the poison running through your veins now … haghaghak … is much more deadly.” She laughed a disgusting, blood curdling laugh; her lungs so full of mucous you’d think she would have drowned a long time ago. Again you feel like vomiting, but again your muscles tense and then relax. “Don’t even try child … now tell me … hak … I would love to know … bahag … before I end your life, how you managed to steal the Queen Bee … who sent you here child … haha … if you are a child at all.” Your jaw muscles and tongue are suddenly much more solid feeling than the rest of your body, the neural connections inhibited no longer. Was this hag controlling your body? Was she allowing you to speak? Whatever it was, you were granted the ability to speak, yet full body movement still eluded you. Better make the best of it. Apparently your life depended on it. <br />
<br />
<i>What will be your response?</i></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: DarkSlateBlue"><b><u>Lacrima Castle: Wilheim Path</u></b><br />
<b>Stark:</b> Your trek across the cliff path continued to be just as eventful as before; that is, not that eventful at all. The sound of your boots meeting the ground broke the silence of the night twice every second, and while at first the sound bugs you, soon it fades once more into the periphery of your mind. The castle was still a ways away, by the looks of it, another thirty minutes or so at this pace would have you at the bridge. What you begin to notice is that this walk is far too quiet … the sound of your steps breaks the silence again, and you half curse at noticing that again. But, the silence around cannot be ignored; it’s dead quiet. The sea that spreads outwards beneath you is very calm tonight, no waves are hammering up the cliff’s face. There’s no wind, no pokemon, nothing … aside from your own footsteps that is. Curious, you scan all around you for anything living, and finally you spot three shadows cut across the abnormally large moon. Two Murkrow and a Honchkrow you identify quickly. They are much too far to hear however. <br />
<br />
Sure the silence was curious, but you don’t feel terrified; you know you’re not alone on this mysterious island. Whether the company you know is here, is friendly or not, is an entirely different concern. Suddenly, another shadow cuts across the night sky. This time it was much closer. The shape flutters overhead with amazing speed, circles around, before diving straight at you with incredible velocity. Instinctively you reach for a pokeball, but before your hand has the chance to unclip a pokeball the shape changes directions once more, disappearing above the cliff with a shriek of terror. Not entirely sure what to make of the exchange, you take a few hesitant steps forward. Realising the flying beast is not coming back for you; you walk on, occasionally stealing glancing above you for another kamikaze dive. <br />
<br />
Several more minutes pass uneventfully and now you could definitely feel an incline in the slope of the path, signalling the last stretch of the Wilheim Path. From farther down the path you could tell that once the slope steepened a bit, it curled around a bend where you could no longer see the path, before emerging once more in your line of sight right at the foot of the bridge that would lead you to the castle. Knowing your goal is now less than ten minutes away you pick up your pace slightly, reaching that bend that you had spotted earlier. You take the turn, not thinking much of the blind corner. No one could have been prepared for what waited for you around the corner. It wasn’t the sudden appearance of another human on the path that startled you, but rather who that person was. You were looking straight into your own eyes; the man in front of you was you!<br />
<br />
“You came?! This … this can’t be … this is just like before. Impossible.” The man … you … babbled. There was no mistaking it. The man’s voice was yours, a little hoarse and tired, as if you’d aged a bit, but definitely your voice. “I only … why? I only stopped for a second … this is just like before … just like.” His voice was frantic, scared, crazed. You were speechless. The man was wearing exactly what you had on at the moment, although his garb was tattered and covered in blood. The same red coat, every article of clothing the same, and yet this man was not you; this man was off. He looked like he was insane. His eyes darted incredulously from place to place, stopping on your awe-stricken face every few moments. The man’s breathing quickened, he started mumbling to himself, pulling at his hair (he was missing several chunks; apparently he pulled hard) and fidgeting. <br />
<br />
“No … no … haha … ha … no … impossible … unbelievable … just like before.” He was definitely insane, and being around him made you uncomfortable. “You … I mean me … me in the past … no not in the past … this is the present … listen … make all the right choices … don’t make my mistakes … you’ll end up where I am …” After giving you his warning, the man pushed you to the side and ran for it; the opposite way you were heading. To your horror you watch as the dark shape from before hurtles downwards from the sky, slamming hard into the man’s body. You reach out to him, but he was past the point of no return. He tried to catch his balance on the edge of the path, but lost that battle. The sound of his body shattering onto a protruding rock preceded the splash by a fraction of a second. He was gone. Suddenly you feel really woozy, and you lean against the cliff face for support. As you slide down to take a seat your head naturally cocks back and for a brief second you think you can see a face looking down at you from above the lip. You blink once, and the face is gone; must have imagined it. First the flying beast, now this? What was wrong with this island? <br />
<br />
It is only then that you notice that the rock face across from you had eyes; eyes that were staring directly at you with evident anger. The eyes blink and you flinch, not really expecting it. The eyes open up once again, but now they were pulling out of the rock, gaining three dimensional shape. The dark purple eye sockets followed, then the floating hands, finally the full body of a majorly pissed off Haunter hovered above you.<br />
<br />
“Haunter!” It accuses sharply, pointing one of its crooked fingers at you. You woke this Haunter from its slumber and it is not at all happy to see you. <br />

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray"><div style="text-align: center"><b><u>Mireno Cemetery</u></b>&#8203;</div><br />
<b><u>Cemetery Entrance</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Hayward</u></b><br />
Conceding with Yuanli's views, you ponder the riddling inscriptions as you pore through your inventory -- with the little information that is provided, you're quite certain that the item in question is one of edible varieties, and the line &quot;of creatures adamant&quot; helps you to eliminate some of the other choices you have. Eventually deciding on a berry that you conveniently happen to have multiples of, you bravely extend a hand with the Pinap in your fingers, depositing the fruit at the bottom of the stone slab. Stepping back, you wait for something to happen, but nothing can prepare you for what takes place after a few moments -- right before your eyes, the skin of the Pinap Berry darkens in patches, until the entire of the spice-laden food is a disgusting, rotten shade of black. Deflating like a punctured beach ball, the berry releases a cloud of its stinging scent that ends in a putrid pong, before crumbling into the ground; somehow you have an image of the berry screaming as its freshness was wrenched away. Moments later, a low, ominous rumbling fills the passage as the stone sinks back underground, allowing you entry.<br />
<br />
&quot;They don't mince words, whoever put this in place. I suppose we should be thankful that a costlier toll was not demanded of us,&quot; sighs Yuanli, shaking his head. &quot;I fear that the tasks to fulfill will only become more insurmountable, but we must press on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone concedes in silence as you enter through the ivy-invested gateway, a sharp chill diving down your spine with your passing under its cover, and you can only feel stronger apprehension as the group moves into an open area of the catacombs. You find that while no torches stand in this area, light is provided by a variety of bizarre, spherical fungi sprouting about the landscape like freaky little light bulbs -- any other vegetation is sparse, with but several types of creepers and pitiful stems, curled and malformed by the lack of light and proper nourishment, almost like hands of the buried alive desperately trying to break free but to no avail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very little information exists on the cemetery of Mireno. Even the research group who requested my services could only offer what they themselves had heard,&quot; Yuanli recalls to you. &quot;Some stories say that Mireno was initially a subterranean location of worship, others say it was a facility of study -- of whom, or what, I'm afraid no one can quite remember. But what is generally agreed on is that six priests attempted to, by means of Mireno, forge a gateway to what they called &quot;the promised land&quot;. No one knows what they meant, but since then Mireno turned into the wasteland everyone recognises. In fact, very few locals dare to speak of it directly, I hear, believing the name itself to be cursed. They say that the ruined village above is testament to Mireno's power...&quot; The sage pauses. &quot;What can be confirmed is that since the time of those priests, traps laid throughout the years are effective even today. If this would follow like the challenge earlier, Will, we must proceed in utmost caution, more than before... Chroma, if you don't mind, a <b>Flash</b> would help us out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;SABL!&quot; You almost see the gears grind behind the imp's crystalline eyes, as a spectrum of light bursts out of Chroma's face, widening such that you can see the surroundings more clearly: a pair of dark caverns, heading to your extreme left and right, and deep in the wall ahead you're shocked to see another cavern -- the shocking characteristic being a series of sharp, steel formations the shape of fangs choking the entrance, with a single circular symbol embedded in the centre that makes you think of an eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Another seal... My guess is that this new obstacle is far more stringent than the one we faced earlier,&quot; remarks Yuanli. &quot;Whatever lies behind it likely derived its origin of some fiendish power; unfortunately our final objective -- that is, to return the item to Mireno's centre -- lies beyond said barrier, and I doubt teleportation could bypass this. I can feel the intensity within these bones of mine.&quot; Indeed, looking to Chroma and Medéo you find both of them frowning as one; whatever they're sensing and you're not, they don't like it one bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Much as I would prefer to spend less time in this miasma, it seems we have no choice.&quot; Turning to you, Yuanli nods as he continues, &quot;Without a better understanding of this place and its key, we cannot hope to succeed... Will, considering how your keen insights have brought us this far, I believe it will not be inappropriate if you decided the navigation for us. We need to explore the depths of the catacombs available to us posthaste in order to advance with the breaking of this seal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Two choices lie around you for the moment, and now that Yuanli has placed the decision in your hands, what will you do?</span></span></div>

<br />
<b><u>Cod of War</u></b><br />
Having taken a heavy hit, multiplied by his natural weakness towards toxins, it takes Arctacea a while before he gets back onto his feet, making use of the bought time to clumsily run back to your side. Shivering briefly from the cold wave emitted by your Pokémon, you reach into your inventory before picking out a selection of discs, placing them against the frosted tree's forehead. Before long the machines fragment one by one as they bestow their concealed knowledge to Arctacea, who waves his stubby arms in excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd say that was rather eleventh-hour, though timely intervention nonetheless.&quot; Glancing at the enemy, Eriden raises his hands over his chest. &quot;Brace yourself, Jamie!&quot;<br />
<br />
The call does not come unwarranted: as he stands like a castle wall you soon see the reason for Eriden's warning -- a storm of <b>Rock</b>s, <b>Blast</b>ed out of Octillery's versatile nozzlemouth come raining at your team, while Kingler swipes its heavier claw in a show of <b>Ancientpower</b>. With cringing grunts Eriden stomachs both attacks, striking a chord of worry in you: you know that being part Ice-type Pokémon must equate to a considerable bit of agony for the warrior.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boy, this really stinks,&quot; comments Seroba, so nonchalantly and so abruptly you jolt a little, having forgotten her presence in the group. &quot;Does anyone have any idea how bad hail is for the skin? ...Oh, don't worry your head, Jamie.&quot; The Azumagirl's pout turns into a comforting smile as she catches your expression, &quot;Eriden's more than capable of holding his own. Look!&quot; Guided by her index finger, you see that indeed, Eriden has taken on the defensive glow of <b>Stockpile</b>d power. Affirmed that his ally is simply waiting out the attacks, Arctacea scuttles back into the fray, tossing a fresh <b>Energy Ball</b> that spins about in midair before crashing onto its crustacean recipient. Barely given time to react at its comrade's momentary dysfunction, Octillery frowningly begins charging botanic energy of its own, but a <b>Toxic</b> glob direct to its mouth successfully fizzles out the attack as the octopus hocks, sickened as Arcatacea flashes a taunting wink from his delivered retribution.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get ready, Snover! A combination for the finish!&quot; The straining in Eriden's voice is clear as the magenta aura reaches a brightened peak; Arctacea nods at the fighter before waving his hands outward. By your Snover's newly gained powers over water, the abundant liquid from the surroundings starts to gather in a <b>Water Pulse</b>, and just as Arctacea sends the wave bursting ahead Eriden rips open his protective stance, billowing a screaming laser from the air just in front of his teeth. The doublestocked <b>Spit Up</b> races along with the miniature tsunami, leaving Kingler as the closest opponent no option but to take the attacks literally head on; its cry accompanied by the sounds of crashing water and exploding energy. Moments later, with the clearing of the smoke and foam, you see Kingler barely twitch before its main pincer finally hits the marble with a resounding crash, its legs giving way as it faints right then and there...</span><br />
<br />
</span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: aqua">As the last of the TMs were applied to Arctacea, Eriden's call to brace himself suddenly gave Jamie a bit of a sinking feeling, as both octopus and crab unleashed their stony charges towards them, and as the Walreinman braced against the impact, grunting as he did so, Seroba's voice caught him out by surprise, his eyes turning to the Azumagirl before following her pointed finger at Eriden, the stockpiled glow giving him some relief as Arctaces stubbled back into the fray, looking much more offensive as he tested his newfound charges by smacking Kingler with a rather acrobatic Energy Ball. As the surprised crab floundered, the Octillery frowned before charging similar energy, but the Snover was far from finished as a toxic glob of his own found its way into the mouth of the fish, the thought that the likely grass attack wouldn't be too pleasing to Eriden nullified as the Octillery hocked from the reverse assault, irked further by Arctacea's wink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get ready, Snover! A combination for the finish!&quot;<br />
<br />
A nod from the frosted tree as Jamie watched the pair, and the basic aquatic control bestowed on the ice type being thrown into action, the water pulse combined with the doublestocked spit up smashed into the Kingler, and as the steam dissipated, the clonk of the larger pincer to the marble brought a bittersweet feeling to the trainer: While they indeed had the numerical advantage, the current state of Octillery and the sight of its fallen comrade would likely drive it to a state of berserk fury, rendering it unpredictable. It was, therefore of utmost importance to fell the calamari with haste.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good work, Arcy, but we're not out of the proverbial woods yet. Octillery's likely to become more aggressive with its ally down, so stay aware of it. Strike it with a <b>bullet seed</b> barrage to draw attention from Eriden so he can get his breath back, as a move like that would be quite exhausting. Once distracted, siphon some energy from him with a <b>giga drain</b> before using the colder conditions to try and flash freeze him with a powerful <b>blizzard</b>.&quot;</span></span></div>
