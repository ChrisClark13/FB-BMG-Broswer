&quot;Potions... they would help alleviate some of the base damage inflicted on his physical form, but the burning is a different story. My village used to specialise in metallurgy so I've some degree of experience where it comes to the effects of fire on metal,&quot; explains the girl. &quot;Under normal circumstances Skarmory grows enough metallic feathers to replace its coat when damaged, but from my preliminary observations, it looks like even the hypodermic layers have been badly scorched. Suffice to say, it's not something a simple Burn Heal or Rawst Berry can alleviate.&quot; Pausing for a moment, she continues. &quot;I suppose you're right. It won't help if we took shelter here; if we do come across <i>her</i> again we'll be in a far worse state than we were earlier. It's really all or nothing, isn't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Another period of quietude passes, punctuated only as the woman warrior moves over with a Steel Ball in her hand, recapturing her trusted friend in a wave of red energy. For a moment she grasps the PokéBall in her hand, her eyes half-closed in sadness before she turns back at you. &quot;Seeing that we'll be working together for a while, now... introductions would only be reasonable. ...Sharene. That's my name. And yours?&quot; She nods gently as you give her your name. &quot;We should go, as soon as we're all rested up and ready. Before <i>she</i> does decide to come looking for us.&quot;<br />

While the threat of Alycos' descendant appearing is an everpresent one, hours later after moving out from the dilapidated temple you find a far more pressing issue is navigation. With only an expanse of stones and metal to guide you by and little else in landmarks, you begin wondering if you're not travelling in circles -- albeit, up-and-down, back-and-forth circles upon rugged rock and chain.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm afraid this is best we can do. Without Skarmory to give us a bird's eye view we won't be able to see the Remote Sanctuary from here,&quot; grunts Sharene, as she hefts you up on a larger rock platform. &quot;...That's enough climbing for now. We need some degree of strength for evasive action if the situation calls for it, and we might need to set up camp for the... what?&quot; Her hand separating from yours, Sharene takes a good look at your surroundings for the first time in a while, and starting to feel a sense of unease you turn about as well. Where Heaven's Gate had hues of red, you find the sky now tainted a strangely ominous shade of violet.<br />
<br />
&quot;This... it can't be!&quot; Sharene whispers, clearly trembling and afraid this time. &quot;I'd only heard of it in legends, but that sky, this darkness...! There's no mistaking it, we're -- aaaargh!&quot;<br />
<br />
As though an invisible force cleaved the flooring below you, you feel the now somewhat-familiar feeling of falling down once again; like a digestive biscuit the rock crumbles under your weight, leaving you and Sharene to fall to the next stony platform underneath. While not bonecrushing the bruising experience is hardly a pleasant one, and as the two of you pick yourselves up a sinister presence looms overhead. Like an unidentified flying object the statue-like creature hovers down at you, beholding you in apparent disdain with beady eyes as three smaller figurines follow suit, surrounding the sides of the large-nosed beast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probopass,&quot; identifies Sharene. &quot;And it looks angry enough to kill...&quot;<br />
<br />
What will you do now?</span><br />

With Volante taken out of the picture you have little alternative but to release Torchlight for battle, and with a few instructions laid out the Cyndaquil eagerly jumps in. Out from his mouth a cloud of <b>Smokescreen</b> billows forth, cloaking the male Nuzleaf who gives a disgruntled cry at having his view obscured. &quot;Now, Cormag! Follow with <b>Icy Wind</b>!&quot; Seizing the chance, Duessel calls for another encore of his Murkrow's freezing weather, and cawing loudly Cormag sends another miniature snowstorm into the smoke cloud. For a while, nothing seems to happen, until several curved, focused pockets of air explode out of the fog. Instinctively you raise your arms, but even with the move's inaccuracy a shot of <b>Razor Wind</b> still succeeds in catching you by the gut -- not sharp enough to cut cloth or skin but strong enough to knock you over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you alright, Miss?&quot; You have little chance to reply before Duessel hoists you by the wrist, bringing you back to a stand. With the swishing zephyrs separating the Smokescreen and Nuzleaf in full view, the three males charge in as one with their respective limbs raised. A <b>Peck</b>, <b>Scratch</b> and <b>Tackle</b>, carried over by the simultaneous force of three Pokémon, cleanly throws the leaf-topped Pokémon off his feet, sending him tumbling into the undergrowth's dirt. For a while he tries pushing himself upwards, but his wooden arms eventually collapse after a few moments' passing. <b>Level up for Grinder</b>.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's too late. We weren't fast enough!&quot; At Duessel's grimace, you peer upwards only to immediately wish you hadn't. In the trees above you scores of Nuzleaf stand defiantly on the branches, glaring at you like Swellow on Wurmple. &quot;Stay close,&quot; hisses Duessel, a command quickly heeded as you press your back against his in defensive position; the tension oozing about you like a plague of poisonous gas.<br />
<br />
Half expecting pain to begin raining all over your body, you are momentarily surprised as music begins reaching your ears: a hauntingly whistled aria that almost seems beautiful if not for the situation. A buzzing sixth sense informs you that something is very wrong, and sure enough as you turn you see to your horror Duessel collapsing on his knees with little more than a grunt. Frantically, you look at Torchlight and Grinder who only follow suit as your gaze sweeps by, and before too long as the music's volume increases you feel your senses failing, your strength fading. As your vision blurs, the last thing you feel is a muffled sensation of the cold earth striking your face...<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center">***&#8203;</div><br />
&quot;Missy? Missy, wake up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roused by the voice of Duessel, you blearily open your eyes. How long had passed since you fainted <i>this</i> time? It was irrelevant, in any case, reminding yourself that time held no meaning in this forest. Sitting up you identify your current surroundings with a jolt: the house that Duessel and you had lodged in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuzleaf are known to make music by blowing through flutes they make from leaves. When they do so, listeners -- people and Pokémon suffer a variety of effects. In any case the encounter brought us back to square one... as it always has.&quot; As Duessel bows his head -- in regret or frustration, you're not particularly sure -- you take a look outside; the trees the same state as when you had left.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did we do wrong?&quot; he mutters, scratching his head. &quot;I don't think we were wrong in thinking along the lines of a clock, but if that's the case... hm. Maybe the season of the forest we were in had something to do with the direction? Could it help to reread the instructions?&quot;<br />
<br />
What do you think?</span><br />

Going for a diplomatic approach, you try communicating to the Sableye in calm, hushed tones, while planning on a swift escape if the situation called for it. Unexpectedly the Sableye ceases its hopping, instead opting to stare at you with its crystalline eyes, devoid of pupils to read its expression by. The silent exchange persists for a minute or so, only interrupted by a blink every now and then, and if not for the area's dangerous reputation you might have otherwise found the scenario amusing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sable.&quot; Nodding a little, the Pokémon of Darkness raises its claws to you, gesturing its fingers towards itself in a sort of &quot;come hither&quot; message -- or, at least, you think that's what it's trying to say. Pointing towards the walls from which it came you're ascertained that the Sableye does, in fact, want you to follow it, but what might the reason be? Dwelling on the decision you eventually reason that whatever the case is, not much could really hide in the open of a ruined building and Sableye, at least, doesn't seem to mean any form of harm.<br />
<br />
Whatever you expected, you are surprised to find the figure of a reclining man, wearing tattered robes you're quite sure would have belonged in a Eastern-inspired museum as opposed to on an adventurer's frame. It takes a few calls from Sableye for the man to turn around; his weary, yet smiling face framed by shoulder-length greying hair and thin, wispy moustache and beard.<br />
<br />
&quot;And who might this be, Chroma?&quot; he asks gently, as the Sableye titters back at him; it hadn't occurred to you that the little imp was actually a Trainer's Pokémon. &quot;Yes, you're right. He's not quite like most of those who pass by here. I can see it in his eyes; he has a good head upon those shoulders. He has seen much and accomplished likewise for one so youthful. Yes, I think he will be at least sympathetic to our cause.&quot; Coughing to clear his throat, the man proceeds to address you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Forgive my unbecoming appearance and poise, young man. My name is Yuanli; wandering mediator by trade. I specialise in the harmony of people and Pokémon, nature and spirits, no matter their history or character,&quot; he introduces. &quot;For years I've trekked the lands far and wide, with the sole aim of resolving conflicts where they might arise, alongside my faithful partner here.&quot; At this Chroma flashes you a cheeky grin, his mouth lined with sharp teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;However, I suppose even experience is no curative for the effects of aging. My most recent assignment required me to appease some spirits whom, I believe, reside in a massive resting ground below this very hamlet. I had come across a research group who claimed that an artifact they procured was cursed, and thus begged me to return it to its true location of origin,&quot; continues Yuanli. &quot;After weeks of searching I chanced upon this abandoned settlement, but unfortunately I was set upon by a band of thieves, who pilfered the bag that contained the artifact in question. I was injured in the process; while not grievously, my age left me quite unable to continue then. ...The incident was a fortnight ago. Chroma assisted me, faithfully as he always does, by searching for scraps of food and scaring away any potential intruders. He judged you and deemed that you would not threaten us, and so brought you in.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have only just met, young man; yet, my work has taught me one truth amongst others. Few things happen without rhyme or reason. That we met here is likely the sum of a greater equation.&quot; The aged man smiles at you again; positive as his demeanour is, you can tell that he is considerably weakened. &quot;If it would not trouble you too much to satisfy the whims of an old man, I would appreciate it if you assisted me in my quest. In my state I doubt I could retrieve the artifact -- or, if you're not minding, a little support out of this town would be nice, to prepare for another venture.&quot;<br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">In Mireno’s Ghost Town, the trainer Will Hale listened intently to Yuanli’s tale, and marveled at the elderly stranger’s resolve and resiliency. Will gaped as he learned that Yuanli had survived in this forsaken hamlet for the past two weeks on nothing but the bits of leftover food his faithful Sableye Chroma had brought him. As the wizened old man finished explaining his predicament and fixed Will with a questioning look, the boy dragged a hand through his short brown hair and thought hard about what he should do. His first instinct had been to help the man out, but his recent journey through the Volcanic Mountain Range’s Sacred Forest had taught him to be more cautious.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">While trekking through that arboreal region, Will had unwittingly been involved in a tribal feud when a woodland warlord had tricked him into <i>“helping”</i> escort a biological weapon straight into the heart of enemy territory. The boy’s intentions had been virtuous, but still he had inadvertently caused a great deal of damage and destruction. Almost irreparable. Will learned a valuable lesson on that journey; unfortunately, not everyone who asked for help was honest. Since then, he had resolved to no longer blindly trust someone just because they requested his assistance. He knew it might seem harsh, but he didn't want to be duped again.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">After another moment of contemplation, Will looked from Yuanli to Chroma and back. He certainly had no reason to doubt the wizened old man’s story. Despite Yuanli’s circumstances and having lost a good deal of strength, he had retained a cheery attitude and optimistic outlook, and Will greatly admired the man's determination not to give up. Looking at him lying on the ground in such a poor condition, it was hard for Will to imagine he could be planning something sinister. Will nodded, consenting to help Yuanli retrieve the stolen artifact. “Alright, I’ll help you out,” he replied. Bowing respectfully, he introduced himself as Will Hale, a trainer from Pacifidlog Town, Hoenn, before continuing, “But what about you? Are you going to be okay? I have some Berries in my bag you can have. They might help you recover a bit of your strength.”</span></span><br />

<b><u>Ghost Town</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Hayward</u></b><br />
&quot;Pacifidlog Town... ah. It was about thirty years ago that the locals requested my help in the Braille plate incident. A remote, but nonetheless fine community indeed, resilient and adaptive to the whims of nature. I daresay you possess these qualities yourself, Will,&quot; smiles Yuanli. &quot;Your offer of Berries is appreciated, but it's quite alright. I have sufficient strength to continue; the main concern was biding time and making sure the coast was clear, or at least until help arrived. With your kind assistance we can now proceed.&quot; Rising to his feet with a little help from Chroma, Yuanli dusts himself down, reslinging a simple satchel across his shoulder and picking up a carved staff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shall we?&quot; Tapping the ground with his wooden rod, Yuanli gestures at you as he begins striding out of the shack's shadow, rather surprisingly sprightly for an elderly man as Chroma totters after him, soon followed by you. For the most part, the ghost town seems as forbidding and sinister as it was when you entered it, but the presence of Yuanli and Chroma serenely strolling down the abandoned streets seems to lighten the mood like a lifted weight.<br />
<br />
&quot;As I've mentioned, our destination lies somewhere within subterranean lands. Unfortunately when you found me, Will, I was unable to perform a prior investigation, but thanks to you we're now working together, and I can perform the necessary surveys proper.&quot; Coming to a stop in a bit of open space, Yuanli issues a few more taps with his staff. &quot;Chroma, if you please.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sableye!&quot; Like a child in a candy store Chroma leaps ahead, pattering across the ground in a crouched position, scratching at the dirt every now and then. &quot;Sableye, being partially Ghost-type, have natural affinities for spirits and related interactions. They stand out as individuals also because of their natural skills; as cave-dwellers, they have developed heightened senses for navigation and identifying the presence of others in situations where vision is highly impeded. We recognise these abilities as the techniques <b>Foresight</b> and <b>Detect</b>,&quot; explains Yuanli. &quot;In addition, their preference for crystals as food grants them not only clarity in sight, but to use the power of crystals as their own; focusing energies and dissipating them at will. As such, I owe a great deal to Chroma in my work.&quot; The venerable sage takes a few moments to proudly stroke his beard. &quot;Pardon the ramblings of an old man, Will. Age tends to render a direct relationship shared between experience and long-windedness.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sabl?&quot; Some distance away Chroma circles a bit of ground like a Growlithe about to recline. A set of red lights streaming from the imp's eyes of gemstone bathe the dirt, as Chroma attempts to sense what lies beneath, but out of nowhere Yuanli's grip on his staff seems to tighten as he steps back.<br />
<br />
&quot;A looming presence of hatred and fear!&quot; he declares. &quot;Will, Chroma! Get back!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<b>DRAPI!</b>&quot; &quot;Sableye!&quot;<br />
<br />
Barely scurrying back in time, the ground where Chroma was only moments ago bursts outward, littering the surroundings with dirt clods and dust clouds. Segmented limbs rise out of the choking wake, two jagged arms connected to a spiked head. Swaying as it scuttles, the Drapion makes its entrance known with another loud roar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm. Not quite what I expected,&quot; muses Yuanli, then dropping a hand to pat Chroma on the head in assurance as the Sableye looks guiltily on. &quot;It seems that our new acquaintance has suffered a noticeable degree of torment and pain,&quot; he observes. &quot;This forced it to re-emerge in front of us, although I cannot say for sure what the cause was. Regardless, it appears to be beyond pacifist means of calming down.&quot; With the signal of a sharp jab from Yuanli's stake to the ground, Chroma stands up boldly, walking towards Drapion as the latter continues screeching and flailing. &quot;Are you ready, Will?&quot;</span></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: darkslategray"><span style="font-size: 9px">As his faithful Sableye Chroma courageously advanced upon the screeching, flailing Drapion, Yuanli addressed the blackclad trainer at his side, inquiring, <i>“Are you ready, Will?”</i></span></span><br />

</i></span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">In answer, the boy wordlessly adopted a defensive combat pose. He needed no further queries. He reached into the canvas messenger-bag slung over his shoulder and quickly withdrew a half sky-blue, half white Poké Ball. Holding the celebratory capture capsule out at arm’s length, he pressed the round trigger switch and a shower of confetti instantly appeared, followed by a blinking <i>2009</i>, and a bright scarlet light, which morphed itself into the form of a tiny swallow before fading, revealing the avian Pokémon, Taillow.<br />

</span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">“The Drapion specie is known to be able to rotate its head 180º,” he informed his little companion, recalling the data he had learned from his Pokedex. “So, let’s try to confuse and disorient it.

Randomly change directions a few times while unleashing a <b><span style="color: white">Supersonic</span></b>-<b><span style="color: white">Growl</span></b> combo.” Martéo lifted a wing to her forehead in smart salute, and Will continued. “Stay out of reach of its claws and tail, and let fly with a barrage of <span style="color: white"><b>Swift</b></span>.”<br />

No sooner than you send Arctacea into battle the effects of Snover's unique ability come into play; instantly you feel spatters of hail fall against your back while Eriden looks on, mildly surprised at your choice of the stubby fir tree against the enemy. Nevertheless, he seems to otherwise approve, and you soon understand why as he pulls down his helm: slowly the ice raining down on the both of you begins to build up around his muscular body. Bringing two fingers to his mouth the half-Walrein starts breathing an impressive <b>Blizzard</b> from between his lips, and under the weather conditions you created the attack hits both Octillery and Kingler squarely in the faces. Cheerily Arctacea jumps about, lobbing a <b>Leech Seed</b> in Kingler's direction. Too chilled by the freezing zephyr to react in spite of resistance, Kingler helplessly lets the parasitic pod bean it on its crest, which soon wraps its siphoning tendrils about its carapace.<br />
<br />
&quot;...!&quot; Tensing his muscles in apparent anticipation, Eriden gestures forward as both enemy Waters wave their appendages in annoyance; soon enough issuing <b>Bubblebeam</b>s from their mouths in response. Not one to be outdone, clearly, the merman blows a <b>Powder Snow</b> ahead this time, freezing the incoming orbs of water in mid-air. Weighed down by the latent change from liquid to solid the bubbles crash to the floor, harmlessly breaking into smithereens. &quot;Attacking by wild instinct... an effort doomed to failure, for certain,&quot; declares the experienced warrior, and you affirm to yourself that he's definitely not an individual to be messed with, as Arctacea launches into a phase of <b>Growth</b>. Blips of energy, wrung from Kingler's essence, fly through the air towards their intended recipient, and noting this Octillery appears to slither in front of its battlemate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm?&quot; Not having expected the defensive tactic, Eriden watches as Kingler begins a <b>Harden</b> from behind Octillery, the latter raising its tentacles up and down in a ritualistic pattern. &quot;<b>Focus Energy</b>, I see. Combining its immovable traits and its sniping ability to help protect its comrade... But even such plans are not free from falling astray.&quot; While Arctacea blasts the octopus with his <b>Icy Wind</b>, you turn to Eriden who has taken to clapping his hands in a mystic rhythm at which you find yourself tapping your feet to.<br />
<br />
&quot;<b>Encore</b>,&quot; explains the warrior, &quot;Now we know what the enemy will be up to next, as well as created an opening in the battle. With Octillery's <b>Suction Cups</b> blocking the way we need to take every chance we get to eliminate this obstacle as swiftly as possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: aqua">With the air taking a chill, Jamie gave a slight shiver, both from cold and anticipation at the battle before him as Arctacea cheerfully implanted the seed into the Kingler, just after Eriden used the colder conditions to his advantage by blasting both the foes with a blizzard. With the retaliatory Bubblebeam failing, and a slightly larger Snover standing in the battlefield, Jamie listened to the Walreinman's words as he recognised the Encore technique, giving a small smirk at the move as he looked towards the fir tree. While not natural for a pokemon such as Arctacea to learn, a halloween celebration had brought forth a little tutelage from Volcape, and as the Snover glanced towards his foes, the trainer rubbed his brow in concentration.<br />
<br />
&quot;This should buy us time. Arcy, take advantage of your grass typing against Octillery, as it's body is softer than the shell of Kingler by flicking a <b>razor leaf</b> barrage into a hail of <b>seed bomb</b>s. Once the initial strike is done, head in and strike with a <b>thunderpunch</b> only when the coast is clear. If at any time you detect any hint of flame, make immediate evasive maneouveurs to avoid getting scorched by them. Careful out there!&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking back towards his foes, Jamie realised that while Kingler's defensive status outweighed Octillery's, the crab possessed much greater physical power, and had the potential to use it against the fir tree, yet the priority was in subduing the Octillery before it became a menace.</span></span></div>

&quot;Potions... they would help alleviate some of the base damage inflicted on his physical form, but the burning is a different story. My village used to specialise in metallurgy so I've some degree of experience where it comes to the effects of fire on metal,&quot; explains the girl. &quot;Under normal circumstances Skarmory grows enough metallic feathers to replace its coat when damaged, but from my preliminary observations, it looks like even the hypodermic layers have been badly scorched. Suffice to say, it's not something a simple Burn Heal or Rawst Berry can alleviate.&quot; Pausing for a moment, she continues. &quot;I suppose you're right. It won't help if we took shelter here; if we do come across <i>her</i> again we'll be in a far worse state than we were earlier. It's really all or nothing, isn't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Another period of quietude passes, punctuated only as the woman warrior moves over with a Steel Ball in her hand, recapturing her trusted friend in a wave of red energy. For a moment she grasps the PokéBall in her hand, her eyes half-closed in sadness before she turns back at you. &quot;Seeing that we'll be working together for a while, now... introductions would only be reasonable. ...Sharene. That's my name. And yours?&quot; She nods gently as you give her your name. &quot;We should go, as soon as we're all rested up and ready. Before <i>she</i> does decide to come looking for us.&quot;<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center">***&#8203;</div><br />
While the threat of Alycos' descendant appearing is an everpresent one, hours later after moving out from the dilapidated temple you find a far more pressing issue is navigation. With only an expanse of stones and metal to guide you by and little else in landmarks, you begin wondering if you're not travelling in circles -- albeit, up-and-down, back-and-forth circles upon rugged rock and chain.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm afraid this is best we can do. Without Skarmory to give us a bird's eye view we won't be able to see the Remote Sanctuary from here,&quot; grunts Sharene, as she hefts you up on a larger rock platform. &quot;...That's enough climbing for now. We need some degree of strength for evasive action if the situation calls for it, and we might need to set up camp for the... what?&quot; Her hand separating from yours, Sharene takes a good look at your surroundings for the first time in a while, and starting to feel a sense of unease you turn about as well. Where Heaven's Gate had hues of red, you find the sky now tainted a strangely ominous shade of violet.<br />
<br />
&quot;This... it can't be!&quot; Sharene whispers, clearly trembling and afraid this time. &quot;I'd only heard of it in legends, but that sky, this darkness...! There's no mistaking it, we're -- aaaargh!&quot;<br />
<br />
As though an invisible force cleaved the flooring below you, you feel the now somewhat-familiar feeling of falling down once again; like a digestive biscuit the rock crumbles under your weight, leaving you and Sharene to fall to the next stony platform underneath. While not bonecrushing the bruising experience is hardly a pleasant one, and as the two of you pick yourselves up a sinister presence looms overhead. Like an unidentified flying object the statue-like creature hovers down at you, beholding you in apparent disdain with beady eyes as three smaller figurines follow suit, surrounding the sides of the large-nosed beast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probopass,&quot; identifies Sharene. &quot;And it looks angry enough to kill...&quot;<br />
<br />
What will you do now?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Red">Preparing to leave the camp, LC collected his belongings and packed them into his rucksack, placing in his various potions, battle items, and Pokeballs of every shape, size and colour. Filling the bag up almost to the brim, he picked up the final package, wrapped up in some by now rather grubby tissue paper. Curling the paper back to reveal an ornate Pokeball, dark orange in design, the colour set against a black case. His oldest treasure, collected many years ago in the now defunct Fizzy Zone, hard won after a long campaign, he has carried it around ever since, never quite finding the opportune moment to use it. Smiling slightly at the memories, he placed the Master Ball back into his bag, tapping it for luck before zipping up the rucksack and throwing it over a shoulder, turning to see the lady likewise making her preparations. As they are about to leave, she introduces herself as Sharene, relieving LC slightly as he was starting to wonder if she even had a name, and asked his own, always a tricky question:<br />
<br />
“Well...” he began as he always did when somebody asked that: “my name is Leyton Christopher, but as that sounds ridiculous most people just call me LC, it always seems easier than way.” The slight smile on Sharene’s face was enough to let him know that she too considered his full name a bit daft, and once more he laughed at what his parents had been thinking when they decided that <i>Leyton</i> was an appropriate name for a child, let alone a double barrelled mess like he’d received. Returning the slight smile, the two walked off in search of assistance for Skarmory, Marowak resting in his Pokeball for the timebeing.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Some considerable time later, and with no sign of Alycos’ descendant, nor a trail of destruction, LC’s confidence was beginning to mount slightly, feeling more secure the closer they got the Remote Sanctuary. A few paces ahead, Sharene stopped climbing, near the top of a rock face, and looked up. Following her gaze, LC saw for the first time that the sky had changed from the deep red it had been before to a much darker shade, edging on purple. A slight shiver runs through LC at this discovery, he knows not why, but the more experienced Sharene seems very surprised by the change in scenery, and is about to elaborate whether it bodes good or ill when the ground literally moves beneath their feet, sending the pair tumbling down onto a rock formation a little lower down, landing painfully but not cripplingly...<br />
<br />
<i>Pro! Probo!</i><br />
<br />
LC gulped as he looked up at what they had thought was a rock- floating above them, looking angry as hell- a Probopass, glaring down at them with a gigantic red nose protruding before it, covered in the sand and dust which had disguised it so well. Scrabbling for his bag, LC realised the situation was difficult: Skarmory and Marowak were still recovering and would be needed if they were to encounter the creature again, and Sharene had no other Pokémon around. It was time to try one of his newer partners, no doubt, in a considerably less than ideal situation. Thrusting a hand into his bag, LC pulled out a Pokeball, knocking items aside as he did so, causing the wrapped package to come tumbling out onto the rocks, LC only just stopping it falling with his foot. Throwing the Pokéball forth, LC cried out:<br />
<br />
“Aleksandr, we need your help”<br />
<br />
With an explosion, the ball opened and energy pours out, forming into the Zangoose, who looks around to gather his bearings before nodding, awaiting orders.<br />
<br />
“You need to stay agile, Al, this isn’t going to be a cakewalk. Start us off with a Swords Dance, then see if you can get in a Low Kick without putting yourself in too much danger.” LC issued his orders, but worried for the Zangoose. This place was not ideal for such a young Pokémon, but needs must and there was nothing else that he could do, was there? Scooping down, he picked up the package. <i>Perhaps</i>...<br />

With the start of the battle going into a decent lead over your aquatic opponents, locking them into an enforced repetition of less useful tactics, you order Arctacea to embark on further offensive. Tottering on his stubby fir feet the Snover steps aside for a good shot at Octillery, waving his clublike arms and releasing flurries of <b>Razor Leaf</b> with each sweep. Sure enough, as Octillery helplessly raises its tentacles in a useless attempt to psyche itself up for more focus, the sharp leaves batter against its rubbery limbs, causing it to screech from the pain. Following a quick victory dance, Arctacea lobs a storm of glowing <b>Seed Bomb</b>s, but this time before they can make contact Kingler stubbornly scuttles in front of its comrade, shining with the sheen of <b>Harden</b> against the impact of Arctacea's second Grass-type technique.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm. So it would appear these two still have some tactics to share between them,&quot; muses Eriden, before raising his hands determinedly forward. &quot;Try some of this!&quot;<br />
<br />
As you watch on, a thin mist of frost begins forming from Eriden's palms, slinking into a circle of fog in front of the half-Walrein, and even as the seconds pass you see a ring of sharp icicles pointing at the enemy solidify through the gaseous formation. With little more than a creasing of Eriden's brow launches the technique forward, opening his curled fingers like a man-trap; the icicles opening likewise with his movements. Crushingly he brings his hands together as the attack strikes Kingler, and you realise that the improvised <b>Ice Fang</b> that Eriden has cast worked its magic: with one of the two secondary effects of Ice Fang kicking in Kingler can't help but cringe in temporal flight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sno! Snover!&quot; Noting his cue, Arctacea hurriedly proceeds to move in for the continued assault on Octillery, spiking an arm full of sizzling electricity. From afar you spot Octillery turn its noduled head, gazing with its unreadable eyes at your Snover, but the cry of &quot;Watch out!&quot; from Eriden comes too late. An almighty <i>SPLORK</i> is heard as Octillery vomits a disgusting <b>Gunk Shot</b> out of its mouth, slamming into Arctacea fullbodiedly in a sickening splatter of sludge. Caught foully, Arctacea squirms like a flipped Torkoal, as Eriden breathes over an <b>Icy Wind</b> to the opposition.<br />
<br />
&quot;The chilling effects of that last move should slow them down some, but it won't fix Octillery's recovery from my <b>Encore</b>,&quot; Eriden notes. &quot;My techniques will not be particularly effective in damage magnitude. Jamie, you'll need to keep Snover from being damaged as much as possible to keep the edge we have here.&quot;<br />

What now?</span><br />

As Chroma and Martéo both charge into battle, the wild Drapion almost seems to either not notice them, or simply regard them less significant as it once again bellows in unintelligible negative feedback. Being the faster of the two Martéo quickly screeches up a <b>Supersonic</b>, bathing the demon arachnid in waves of obfusticating noise, and you feel a gentle tapping against your arm. Turning you see Yuanli peering at you kindly, yet somewhat amusedly. &quot;Are you sure, Will? We <i>are</i> supposed to be calming Drapion down, you know. Afflicting a mindless subject with further confusion could risk unexpected repercussions,&quot; he chides gently. &quot;Nevertheless, I am sure you meant well in your commands. ...Chroma, a <b>Fake Out</b> if you please.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sabl!&quot; With speed you'd otherwise never expect from a short, lumbering imp, Chroma leaps at Drapion's large head, slamming his claws between its eyes before any time can be given for Drapion to react, and sure enough the Poison-type stares stunnedly, suspending its terrible limbs in midair. A <b>Growl</b> issues from Martéo's voicebox this time, and as the new set of sound waves covers Drapion you spot Yuanli making a nod of approval as he strokes his beard. &quot;Now, Chroma, a spell of <b>Spite</b> to wear out the opponent.&quot; Raising hands filled with ghostly prowess, Chroma wastes little time as he smirkingly siphons away Drapion's strength, each flailing movement draining the Dark-type further. A series of <b>Swift</b> stars spatter against its cranium from above courtesy of Martéo, until all of a sudden Drapion rears its ugly head for another roar. Against the outline of its jaws you see crackles of electricity, but before Drapion can land a bite on your Taillow Chroma comes crashing into its neck, sending it scuttling, toppling to the side.<br />
<br />
&quot;<b>Sucker Punch</b>. While I have to admit a preference against the nature of such tactics, there have been instances where that particular skill salvaged enough to justify exceptions,&quot; comments Yuanli. &quot;It is quite advantageous for us that this Drapion seems to have already experienced reasonable damage prior to our encounter. Again, I cannot profess to knowing the cause... however, even in pain, this Drapion has more than sufficient experience and strength to make short work of us if need be. We should proceed with caution, Will.&quot;<br />

Not having a clue as to your present location, and the more immediate threat of a wild Pokémon, armed to its proverbial teeth and fully capable and willing of bearing its power on you, you release one member of your team. Claws primed for action, Aleksandr beholds Probopass with the piercing glare known for his species, typically reserved only for the Seviper family. His marked eye twitches in tension: somehow, he seems more ready to maim and battle than you might have otherwise expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've heard... only passing mentions of this place. This realm was where a horrific battle between gods and demons took place long before our time -- the Maze of Shadows,&quot; whispers Sharene. &quot;It was said that even the air itself is poisoned with the obsession to destroy. Countless lives were lost, endless blood was shed... even now it's believed that the Pokémon are more aggressive here than anywhere else. Little else is known, for few dare to tread here at all -- some say that unspeakable evil sleeps in the deepest recesses of this place.&quot; Listening to Sharene's explanation and looking back at the lumbering compass, you can't help but feel some truth to her explanation: what else could be the reason for Probopass' unprecedented Earth Power?<br />
<br />
&quot;No time for doubt. Regardless of the rationale, we can't fall here!&quot; As Aleksandr sharpens himself up with a spinning <b>Swords Dance</b>, the warrior girl reveals her own weapon with a gleaming flourish, gracing everyone's presence with her scythe. &quot;You won't stop us here!&quot; she declares, defiantly glaring at the lodestone statue, &quot;I've conquered enemies far stronger than you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<b>Pro. Bo.</b>&quot; Steely and methodical as ever, Probopass simply bends forward for what looks to be a <b>Tackle</b> as Sharene and Aleksandr stand their ground, but it doesn't take you long to realise that even with its size, Probopass is still metres above you. A few moments pass in wonder as Probopass sweeps above you, until Sharene suddenly lunges backward; her expression clearly showing no intent of having done so willingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Hey, let go!&quot; she cries, and you realise what has happened: the single swipe over Sharene caused her scythe to be picked up by the field of Probopass' <b>Magnet Pull</b>. Sure enough the weapon wrenches out of Sharene's hands (&quot;No!&quot; she cries, more frustrated than despairing), zooming through the air to attach itself onto Probopass' nose with a dull clang. With no means of offence Sharene can but glance helplessly at you, anger boiling at herself clear in her eyes. With a toneless command of &quot;<b>Bo</b>&quot; the magnetic beast gestures upwards, and before you know it the three little units around itself fly towards you.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Leyton, get back!&quot;<br />
<br />
Feeling a push to your side, you can only watch as Sharene selflessly slams you out of the Mini-Noses' path, taking a blow to her gut from one of the units as the others swipe by Aleksandr. As the sharp nose digs into her the girl's eyes widen in a soundless gasp, before she collapses onto the rock. Rushing to her side you find her cringing from the strike to a weak point; her eyes screwed in pain as tears uncontrollably flow, hands clutching her stomach while she struggles to even whimper. It takes a clanging sound to tear your attention and concern from her, prompting you to look back at Probopass: Aleksandr, having apparently caught a ride on one of the Mini-Noses, served a hefty <b>Low Kick</b> as best he could to Probopass' steel hat, taking advantage of the target's heavy weight as he performs a landing next to you. Casting a glance at the two of you briefly your Zangoose resumes snarling at the unforgiving enemy, and while the technique did seem to leave a bump considering the excellent type matchup Probopass still seems otherwise raring to go. Worse still, Sharene is about next to complete incapacitation, and it's all up to you to hold the proverbial fort...</span></span></div>

No problem, Hayward. As a note, gentlemen, my home Internet these days is highly uncooperative; I suspect holidays are stretching the provision. Sorry these couldn't be out earlier.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslateblue"><div style="text-align: center"><b><u>Lacrima Castle</u></b>&#8203;</div><br />
<b><u>Wilheim Path</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Dark Fire &amp; SilverWind</u></b><br />
&quot;It's <i>Evelyn and James</i>! Really now, Pepper. Listening to the both of you, I'd almost sooner take my chances with the castle,&quot; snaps Ogden, before relaxing the grip on his weapon. A deep weariness seems to set into his eyes, distant and dreary, as he begins his story as requested.<br />
<br />
&quot;James, Evelyn, and I... we were the best of friends. Went to the same Trainers' school, and while we eventually went separate in specialisations little could break the bonds we shared. Elementary turned to college and then, when we were twenty-two years of age, both James and I realised that Evelyn meant far more to us than platonic friends,&quot; the man half mutters, half sighs. &quot;We shared a rivalry, me and James, aggressive yet amiable -- I don't think she ever knew. But I eventually realised we went about love in different manners. I sought to protect her; he sought simply to care for her. Evelyn was never the confrontational sort, and her choice in the field of healing showed this. She would not be able to accept the code of bloodshed by which I lived and I could not change for her sake.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was twenty-five years ago. I forged my own path, serving mercenary duties as I saw fit, improving myself in combat and experience. The last I saw of them was at their marriage, and we would keep in touch by a messenger Starly they kept... But the last I heard from them was fifteen years ago. I spent the time then tracking them down, finding many a broken lead... until the path led me here.&quot; Looking up, Ogden turns to glare at Rayne as the fingers re-tighten about his lance. &quot;Now that it's all said and done... what would <i>you</i> know about James and Evelyn? What could you possib -- <i>What in Mount Coronet?!</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
As Ogden interruptedly stares at Rayne's chest, the trainer in question looks down; a soft pulse of cerulean light emanating from where the talisman lies. &quot;You! Rayne! What are you concealing?&quot; demands Ogden, an act that has Rayne hissing and Andromeda snarling. Hurriedly calming them down Rayne produces the artifact for all to see, and at once accusation flies across Ogden's eyes. &quot;Bandit!&quot; he snarls, and in a single flicker he draws his spear but a centimetre from Rayne's neck; in spite of his Pokémon baying and howling at the fighter Rayne motions for them to stay put. &quot;Explain how you procured that necklace, or I'll cut you down where you stand!&quot;<br />
<br />
In spite of the sweat running down his neck Rayne repeats a synopsis of what he'd only just learned, though its completion hardly makes him feel any better. With two and two added together he can't tell how Ogden might otherwise react to the news, and Pepper if anything seems mildly amused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Evelyn's <i>dead</i>? And James as well? What do you take me for, a troglodyte?!&quot; roars Ogden, his weapon maintained at its same dangerous distance. &quot;More likely, you were the one who caused their deaths for your own cruel agendas!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>...Patrick, it's fine. You can believe him.</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That...!&quot; A waver ripples across his face like a pebble on a pond, and feeling the keen edge draw away Rayne looks in the direction of the talisman, seeing a shimmer of light surround the object. Dazedly Rayne presents the warrior with the jewel, Ogden accepting the crystal with an equally stunned expression. Energies of unidentifiable realms and knowledge swirl about the talisman, taking shape and form, but two of the three men already know the silhouette's identity.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Evelyn.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Patrick,</i>&quot; the miniature image of Evelyn whispers, smiling in the same gentle manner she was known for. &quot;It's been far, far too long, my dear friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What... What twist of fate is this?&quot; Even as he croaks the dread is distinct in the warrior's voice; fear of affirmation in what he has come to realise. &quot;Evelyn... you... you're...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry we had to meet like this, Patrick. But it's true; I am no longer a part of this world as you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;By the legends... no. It's true; it's all true.&quot; Wrinkles crease horribly in Ogden's brow. &quot;How could this have come to be? You... I saw the both of you, that day. He promised he would take care of you, he would make you happy! How could he have let this happen?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Patrick... I'm sorry. I told Rayne this; there was nothing that could be done.&quot; A gust of wind breezes, shuffling the leaves and grasses, sending a shimmer through the phantasmal image. &quot;James blamed himself, much like you are now. But what he did... was against the will of nature. Rayne gave but a partial account of the horrors he underwent for my sake... please, Patrick. I need you to join with these men into Lacrima Castle and destroy my body. It's the only way to save this wretched soul of mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Destroy... no! What would I do in a world without you?&quot; Ogden screams, anguish clear in his voice though shedding no tears. &quot;James is gone, and now I have to lose you?! The days we shared, the friendship we forged... All these years it's kept me alive; the hope we might come together again!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Patrick... Forgive me. For what I put you through then, and what I put you through even now.&quot; Quietly speaking, Evelyn raises a hand to touch the war-scarred cheek of her friend. &quot;But there no longer remains anything else you can do. The world I loved will suffer if you do not help me... There is little else I can say, and little longer I can remain. The talisman's protective powers will only hold me here for so long. Rayne, Pepper... please aid Patrick as best you can. Patrick... please, do not mourn my death. I chose to give my life to the world; the world took my life as it saw fit. You must do as the world requires...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...&quot; Unbearable silence sinks into the company, as Evelyn's final words are whisked away; her wraithly shape lost into the night wind, leaving the talisman sparkling in Ogden's shaking hand. Even Drought and Andromeda, hostile only moments earlier, have become oddly subdued at the tense atmosphere.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it...&quot; A crack of a knuckle sends a jolt up everyone's spine, before you realise that Ogden's other hand had gripped his lightning lance hard enough to hurt just by looking.<br />
<br />
&quot;DAMN IT ALL TO <i>HELL!</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
Survival instinct kicks in as Drought shoves Rayne aside and Ledah tugs Pepper backwards; a reflex proven timely as Ogden brandishes his spear through the air. A dull breaking sound is heard, followed by a resounding crash as the trunk of a nearby tree slides down its severed scar, Ogden having struck it down by sheer force in his rage and grief. Howling in unintelligible roars he tears for the castle's bridge, and after exchanging a series of glances the two trainers find no other option but to follow suit. Gravel, wood, marble; various materials torn from their places, lie strewn in a trail of unrestrained destruction, leading the both of them and their Pokémon to the raving Patrick in the moonlit garden.<br />
<br />
&quot;Forbidden beasts and demons, accursed spirits, spawn of evil!&quot; he roars, lashing at another bunch of hedged shrubs and decapacitating them, scattering leaves and sounds of scurrying Pokémon. &quot;You destroyed my friends -- I'll destroy you all! I'll purge this land of your existence! Come by the horde; I'll tear you down with this castle brick by blasted brick!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Skull!&quot; &quot;Skull!&quot; &quot;Skull!&quot;<br />
<br />
As if in response to Ogden's war cries, a miasma of tittering is heard above you; before long you spot a crowd of Duskull descend from nowhere upon your group. Twenty? Thirty? No one is sure as they weave amongst each other like vultures upon a corpse. &quot;You again,&quot; hisses Ogden, and just as a thought that nothing might surprise either of you passes by, rings of electricity flicker through Ogden's lance until the weapon is rife with sparkles. &quot;This won't be like the last time...&quot;</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: DarkSlateBlue"><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px">It became more clear. This false sense of destiny, maybe it could have been Evelyn's spiritual essence that brought him to Lacrima. After all, it wasn't the most appeasing of attractions. Pepper inhaled deeply, everything she was telling Ogden was rather much to take in. As she continued on with her tale, he couldn't help but feel hopeful. A few minutes had passed, and then Pepper turned to Rayne, and tapped him on the shoulder as they were still introducing each others. “Rayne, is it? Well, it’s nice to meet you,” he offered his hand. Rayne uneasily shook hands. Apparently it was not something he was used to. Pepper felt uncomfortable and awkward. Being alone for so long, he was not at all used to socializing. So much time had passed without realization, now Patrick was ranting and raving, tearing apart the surrounding plant life. <br />
<br />
&quot;Skull!&quot; &quot;Skull!&quot; &quot;Skull!&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone was immediately mesmerized at what they saw as they rushed down the path to the garden, where Patrick and Pepper had their first meeting. Dirty blankets scattered everywhere above, . Duskul, most likely the ravanous group that assaulted Patrick in the past. A timid looking zubat fluttering by, but they didn’t pay much attention, as they were too busy looking up. <br />
<br />
His next move was driven only by pure instinct, reaching down and plucking two pokeball from his belt. One was the normal everyday brand ball, while the other the blood red and black Vampire ball. Held within were Tortuga the Blastoise and Grimace the Magmortar. Within seconds the crimson release mechanism had taken shape, both towering over their trainer in size. Grimace had always felt obligated to fight the good fight, while Tortuga seemed rather peed about another involving physical participation. <br />
<br />
“Be careful… it’s-“ Peppers’s voice trailed off. Patrick began slicing his lighting lance through the air, unfazed by the challange ahead.<br />
<br />
“Looks like there’s no other choice,” he remarked, guessing that Raynce had the same thought of a massive attack on the foe. &quot;Alright Ledah go watch Patrick's back and make sure no stray duskul get at him. Grimace will start this off by <b>OVERHEAT</b>ing the dirty laundry! While she's recooperating, I want you to watch over her, Tortuga. <b>CHOCOLATE MAGIC</b> anything that gets close, but leave the long range attacks to <b>EGG BOMB</b>. Lend a <b>HELPING HAND</b> if you feel able, Grim.&quot;<br />

&quot;Forbidden beasts and demons, accursed spirits, spawn of evil!&quot; he roars, lashing at another bunch of hedged shrubs and decapacitating them, scattering leaves and sounds of scurrying Pokémon. &quot;You destroyed my friends -- I'll destroy you all! I'll purge this land of your existence! Come by the horde; I'll tear you down with this castle brick by blasted brick!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Skull!&quot; &quot;Skull!&quot; &quot;Skull!&quot;<br />
<br />
As if in response to Ogden's war cries, a miasma of tittering is heard above you; before long you spot a crowd of Duskull descend from nowhere upon your group. Twenty? Thirty? No one is sure as they weave amongst each other like vultures upon a corpse. &quot;You again,&quot; hisses Ogden, and just as a thought that nothing might surprise either of you passes by, rings of electricity flicker through Ogden's lance until the weapon is rife with sparkles. &quot;This won't be like the last time...&quot;</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 9px">It became more clear. This false sense of destiny, maybe it could have been Evelyn's spiritual essence that brought him to Lacrima. After all, it wasn't the most appeasing of attractions. Pepper inhaled deeply, everything she was telling Ogden was rather much to take in. As she continued on with her tale, he couldn't help but feel hopeful. A few minutes had passed, and then Pepper turned to Rayne, and tapped him on the shoulder as they were still introducing each others. “Rayne, is it? Well, it’s nice to meet you,” he offered his hand. Rayne uneasily shook hands. Apparently it was not something he was used to. Pepper felt uncomfortable and awkward. Being alone for so long, he was not at all used to socializing. So much time had passed without realization, now Patrick was ranting and raving, tearing apart the surrounding plant life. <br />
<br />
&quot;Skull!&quot; &quot;Skull!&quot; &quot;Skull!&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone was immediately mesmerized at what they saw as they rushed down the path to the garden, where Patrick and Pepper had their first meeting. Dirty blankets scattered everywhere above, . Duskul, most likely the ravanous group that assaulted Patrick in the past. A timid looking zubat fluttering by, but they didn’t pay much attention, as they were too busy looking up. <br />
<br />
His next move was driven only by pure instinct, reaching down and plucking two pokeball from his belt. One was the normal everyday brand ball, while the other the blood red and black Vampire ball. Held within were Tortuga the Blastoise and Grimace the Magmortar. Within seconds the crimson release mechanism had taken shape, both towering over their trainer in size. Grimace had always felt obligated to fight the good fight, while Tortuga seemed rather peed about another involving physical participation. <br />
<br />
“Be careful… it’s-“ Peppers’s voice trailed off. Patrick began slicing his lighting lance through the air, unfazed by the challange ahead.<br />
<br />
“Looks like there’s no other choice,” he remarked, guessing that Raynce had the same thought of a massive attack on the foe. &quot;Alright Ledah go watch Patrick's back and make sure no stray duskul get at him. Grimace will start this off by <b>OVERHEAT</b>ing the dirty laundry! While she's recooperating, I want you to watch over her, Tortuga. <b>CHOCOLATE MAGIC</b> anything that gets close, but leave the long range attacks to <b>EGG BOMB</b>. Lend a <b>HELPING HAND</b> if you feel able, Grim.&quot;<br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">Sorry for the delay Shadow, I was on vacation and had no efficient way of replying. Looking forward to getting back into this adventure.<br />
Question: Do you take pokemon abilities into account? I sort of assumed you did, if you do not ... well then I guess Drought is going to be taking some friendly fire for no reason.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: DarkSlateBlue">As Patrick recounts his past, Rayne quickly realised letting this man know what happened to his beloved Evelyn might not go over so well. Maybe he would spare him <i>some</i> detail; like leaving out the whole necromancy deal. <br />
<br />
“You! Rayne! What are you concealing?” Shit! Rayne thought, he had totally forgot the about the talisman. Looking down he noticed that it was glowing slightly, more than bright enough for Patrick to notice. Slowly he reached into his shirt and produced the shimmering piece of jewellery. “Bandit! Explain how you procured that necklace, or I'll cut you down where you stand!” If Patrick’s yelling wasn’t intimidating enough, his spear - which was now within an inch of his throat - certainly was. Andromeda roared in fury, snarling she launched herself forward, ready to shred the man if he even dared bring the lance closer. Rayne raised his hand to calm her slightly, although he could sense that his Salamence was not about to let her guard down. Taking a deep breath, he began to recount the sombre tale of Evelyn and her mad husband. <br />
<br />
No amount of preparation could have made Rayne ready for what happened next. Patrick first accused Rayne of fabricating the story, but when the apparition of his love appeared and confirmed the unlikely story, his hesitation turned to fear and anger. <br />
<br />
“Damn it… DAMN IT ALL TO <i>HELL!</i>” Drought rammed Rayne, just enough to push him out of the path of Patrick’s lance. The enraged man then raced towards the castle, apparently not caring for his own safety. As he ran up the path, tearing up the surrounding plant life, Pepper approached Rayne. <br />
<br />
“Rayne, is it? Well, it’s nice to meet you.” He said, extending his hand. Rayne still dazed by the whole situation blinked once, not entirely hearing what Pepper said. He shook his head a little, shaking Pepper’s hand in return.<br />
<br />
“Right back at ya Pepper,” It had been a while since he had interacted with other trainers, and so he was rather relieved that he had met up with one on this adventure. He sensed Pepper was a good trainer, and felt better about heading towards the castle, knowing he has a competent trainer around. “Hey Pepper … Does Patrick even own pokemon?” Just as he uttered those words the sky rang out in a chorus of pokemon cries.<br />
<br />
&quot;Skull!&quot; &quot;Skull!&quot; &quot;Skull!&quot; Rayne looked up at the quadrant of the night where this annoying melody was coming from, and to his alarm spotted a group of twenty, maybe thirty Duskul. They were quickly descending on Patrick, who was still raging up the path, seemingly unfazed by the appearance of this mass of ghosts. <br />
<br />
“Shit!” Rayne cursed under his breath. Pepper had also noticed the ghost by this point and he began running up the path in pursuit of Patrick. Without much of another option, Rayne exhaled in exasperation before giving chase. <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… Drought. Can you pick up their signatures? Are they infected with Malice? …&gt;</i> Rayne was beginning to suspect that maybe every single pokemon on this cursed island was possessed; he feared the Malice made them tougher adversaries. If his fears proved to be true … this wasn’t going to be an easy battle. Up ahead Pepper had already released two more pokemon, a Blastoise and Magmortar, and was issuing commands. Wasting no time, Rayne unclipped a pokeball from his belt, releasing it while maintaining his pace. <br />
<br />
“Blaze!” Rayne smiled, as he heard the voice of his oldest companion to his right. Minerva, his Blaziken, sensing the urgency of the situation, literally hit the ground running, and was pacing her trainer to his right. Drought was flanking his left side, teeth flaring, ready for battle. Andromeda swooped down in an elegant arc just then, ready to receive her commands.<br />
<br />
“Andromeda! Whip up a <span style="color: Gray"><b>Tailwind</b></span> to make it harder for the ghosts to approach our group. Then whip around, and use that tailwind to add a little speed to your <span style="color: Gray"><b>Air Cutter</b></span> attack.” The Dragon pokemon roared in approval, a roar so loud and fierce it sent shivers up Rayne’s back. <br />
<br />
“Drought. Send out a <span style="color: Plum"><b>Hypnosis</b></span> into that mass. Follow up with <span style="color: White"><b>Safeguard</b></span>.” The nine tailed fox leaped into action almost immediately, hopping up onto a moderately sized rock to get a better vantage point of the whole battle. Rayne then turned his attention to the large fire bird standing beside him. Ah, it was great to see Minerva. She was hands down the most reliable and powerful of his party, which was precisely why he called her out. Rayne glanced around the battle field, he counted three fire types; he could use that to his advantage. <br />
<br />
“Minerva. Activate Drought’s Flash Fire with an <span style="color: DarkOrange"><b>Ember</b></span> attack. Then let’s see how <span style="color: DarkOrange"><b>Sunny Day</b></span> plays out on this island. Finish up with <span style="color: DarkOrange"><b>Flamethrower</b></span> … pick any of one of those ghosts as a target.” Rayne finished, wondering how this battle would unfold, before realising Drought never answered him about whether they were possessed or not. Ah well, he thought, soon as they knocked one of them out he would have his answer.</span></span></div>

Instantly troubled by unfriendly locals upon your first steps into Rosalina territory, you quickly call for brief combat tactics from your starter, who buzzingly seems to dismiss the flailing Vine with a bit of disdain. Energy burning behind her eyes, Bellatrix looses a <b>Signal Beam</b> at the Tangela's feet, blasting dirt clods and damage in its wake as Tangela is knocked flying. Huffily Bella brings her arms akimbo as Tangela coughs, looking at you before screeching up a new storm that almost sounds like crying this time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Skree! Skreeeeh! SKREEEEEEH!&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsure of what to do you try moving forward, only to feel your feet caught tightly in unknown material. A few moments of swinging your arms lands you in the dirt path flat on your back, and before you know it you feel flat tendrils curl about your wrists and fingers, locking them to the ground before you can so much as struggle. Hearing a gaggle of murmurs and shrieks you bend your neck to get the best look ahead as you can, shocked to notice not one, but seven swathing creatures of vine headed towards you, waving their weedlike flagella in vindicated anger. Forced into your current position you won't be able to access your other PokéBalls, but what the wild Pokémon might lack in level, they're certainly making up for it in numbers...</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslateblue">Rick smiled as he noticed the Signal Beam slam into the Tangelas feet, dirt clouds and damage affecting the Tangela as it was launched flying backwards from the bug typed attack. This cheered him up slightly, but then again it also proved a further problem. The Signal beam was supposed to scare the Pokemon away, but perhaps a strong super effective attack wasn’t the best attack to do such a thing with, the Pokemon probably feeling even more aggressive than before. Rick knew that he would if he was attacked first, as would Bellatrix most likely, the bug type having a rather aggressive side in there. Bellatrix put her hands on her hips as she approached Tangela, looking at it with an almost belittling look. Rick couldn’t help but feel sorry for the little creature, even if it did react in such a wild and disturbing fashion moments ago. The Tangela coughed, and looked up at Rick, and the Pokemon looked sadder than Rick would have expected from a single attack. Suddenly, Rick lost all sympathy for the plant like creature when it once again screeched, except this time is seemed more like a cry of sadness than madness. Quickly thinking through what to do, Rick realized that he could simply just walk away now and hope that none of the Pokemon noticed what he did. Unfortunately, as he stepped forwards, he realized that the others already knew exactly what he had done to the monster. Ricks feet seemed to be caught in some sort of unknown material, and he soon found himself falling flat on his back. Tendrils began to wrap around Ricks wrists and fingers, wrapping them to the ground before he could so much as struggle. A gaggle of murmurs and shrieks cause Rick to briefly turn his neck, and Rick was shocked to see seven of the Tangelas heading towards Rick, waving their tentacle like arms in what Rick thought was a extremely mad manor. In Rick’s current position, he knew he couldn’t reach his Pokeballs, but he could still command Bellatrix.<br />
<br />
“Quick Belle, widespread <b>Attack Order</b> to hit all of them at once. Twice if necessary. Follow with some <b>Toxic</b> spray over the weeds.” Rick just hoped it would be enough to save him.</span></span></div>

<b><u>Moonlit Garden</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Dark Fire &amp; SilverWind</u></b><br />
Any questions, doubts, or otherwise unanswered thoughts are forcibly pushed back to both your minds as the enemy descends upon you. With Pokémon already released and others joining the fray, you're more than ready and willing to stand your ground and push back the storm of invading Requiems. Even as Andromeda stretches her neck to unleash her attack some of the Duskull briefly shriek in apprehension as the Salamence's <b>Intimidate</b> kicks in, before her <b>Tailwind</b> spreads throughout the ground in waves, uplifting everybody's sense of speed. Already another seasoned warrior herself Minverva the Blaziken lobs a brief <b>Ember</b> at Drought. Her <b>Flash Fire</b> ability soaking in the attack easily, Drought beams over a smirking &lt;<i>Thank you</i>&gt; while in the middle of the group, Pepper's Grimace is already at work, blasting an <b>Overheat</b> into the crowd. A symphony of screeching is heard as the first wave of Duskull is razed by the blistering temperatures, some of the weaker ones immediately flopping to the ground unable to continue. Noting the horde of Fire-types on the field Minvera releases a <b>Sunny Day</b> beam to the sky, but without actual sun the clouds simply clear to let more moonlight grace the battleground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dian, dian!&quot; Only moments after having been deployed to support Ogden Ledah returns to Pepper's side, clutching to his shoulders as Patrick continues to rave. While the question of whether Patrick actually possesses any Pokémon goes without an answer, both of you notice that the seasoned battler clearly doesn't seem to be having any issues. Driven by his unwavering fury the man's lancework is almost a performance in itself, delivering lightning arc after lightning arc as he deflects each Duskull trying to sneak an <b>Astonish</b> on him, every now and then slicing into a ghost's ethereal form and downing it. With Ogden's safety somewhat ascertained and yours to secure all your Pokémon go into full counterattack mode: Minerva striking first with a steady <b>Flamethrower</b> more than on par with Grimace's earlier move, creating an outward explosion as Andromeda's <b>Air Cutter</b> billows into the waves of fire. Behind, Tortuga chuckles as his cannons lob <b>Egg Bomb</b>s into various parts of the seemingly unending Duskull crowd, augmented by a <b>Helping Hand</b> attempt by Grimace, and what doesn't quite get struck is put to sleep as Drought forces her <b>Hypnosis</b> waves at the swarm.<br />
<br />
&lt;<i>They're not fully corrupted. If anything, I'd say it's only started to drive them crazy,</i>&gt; informs Drought, but a sudden lightshow above drags your attention back to the battle as the Duskull release a united <b>Confuse Ray</b>. Just in time Drought casts a <b>Safeguard</b> that washes over everyone; for sure, Patrick is not an individual anyone would want berserk, the man in question now having taken to controlled releasing electric blasts in combination with his shocking slashes, supported by Tortuga blasting <b>Chocolate Magic</b> around to gum unsuspecting spectres together. One by one the fainted Duskull sink into the ground, but even as this happens more Duskull appear from nowhere to fill the void, drowning the air in screeching...<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>Wilheim Path</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Handymankg2</u></b><br />
<br />
With your movement just about completely restricted by an unforeseen <b>Grass Knot</b>, the only alternative for you remains to command Bellatrix against the advancing group of waving Vine Pokémon. Angrily buzzing at the assault on her trainer the living Beehive raises her abdomen, releasing a storm of drones like bullets from a machine gun out of her honeycombed underside. Under the command of an <b>Attack Order</b> the bugs start tearing at the Tangela septulets, and if not for the massive amount of Tangela screaming from the incessant stinging and slashing on their tendrils the contigency plan would otherwise have been just perfect.<br />
<br />
Having put the enemy under distraction and damage, you instinctively try for another struggle attempt, but the botanic ropes hold you firmly in place: it seems quite likely that only the fainting of the opposing group might release you. With any possible preliminary attack from the Tangela intercepted by her pestilential plague of minions, Bellatrix curtly recalls her swarm for her next attack -- a volley of <b>Toxic</b> globs that spatter over the Grass-types, each squealing in discomfort as the poison soaks into their vines. A defiant buzz is heard from Bellatrix in her anger and general fed-up-ness with the group, but before she knows it a spatter of <b>Bullet Seed</b>s start raining onto her, any remainder flying behind and dotting the ground about you; a few landing on your cheek leaving the sensation of a scorching raindrop. Barely looking up, you find that while Bellatrix withstood the attack decently, the odds of seven weaker Pokémon united against one managed to push her back more than you might otherwise have guessed...</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">As Chroma and Martéo both charge into battle, the wild Drapion almost seems to either not notice them, or simply regard them less significant as it once again bellows in unintelligible negative feedback. Being the faster of the two Martéo quickly screeches up a <b>Supersonic</b>, bathing the demon arachnid in waves of obfusticating noise, and you feel a gentle tapping against your arm. Turning you see Yuanli peering at you kindly, yet somewhat amusedly. &quot;Are you sure, Will? We <i>are</i> supposed to be calming Drapion down, you know. Afflicting a mindless subject with further confusion could risk unexpected repercussions,&quot; he chides gently. &quot;Nevertheless, I am sure you meant well in your commands. ...Chroma, a <b>Fake Out</b> if you please.&quot;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;Sabl!&quot; With speed you'd otherwise never expect from a short, lumbering imp, Chroma leaps at Drapion's large head, slamming his claws between its eyes before any time can be given for Drapion to react, and sure enough the Poison-type stares stunnedly, suspending its terrible limbs in midair. A <b>Growl</b> issues from Martéo's voicebox this time, and as the new set of sound waves covers Drapion you spot Yuanli making a nod of approval as he strokes his beard. &quot;Now, Chroma, a spell of <b>Spite</b> to wear out the opponent.&quot; Raising hands filled with ghostly prowess, Chroma wastes little time as he smirkingly siphons away Drapion's strength, each flailing movement draining the Dark-type further. A series of <b>Swift</b> stars spatter against its cranium from above courtesy of Martéo, until all of a sudden Drapion rears its ugly head for another roar. Against the outline of its jaws you see crackles of electricity, but before Drapion can land a bite on your Taillow, Chroma comes crashing into its neck, sending it scuttling, toppling to the side.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;<b>Sucker Punch</b>. While I have to admit a preference against the nature of such tactics, there have been instances where that particular skill salvaged enough to justify exceptions,&quot; comments Yuanli. &quot;It is quite advantageous for us that this Drapion seems to have already experienced reasonable damage prior to our encounter. Again, I cannot profess to knowing the cause... however, even in pain, this Drapion has more than sufficient experience and strength to make short work of us if need be. We should proceed with caution, Will.&quot;</span></span><br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">As Yuanli finished elucidating on his strategy, Will rubbed his forehead and thought over the stranger’s words. <i><b>“Proceed with caution, huh?! Well, I suppose there’s a first time for everything…”</b></i> he mused, a wry grin spreading slowly across his face. At 4’03” the Ogre Scorpion towered over Taillow and Sableye. Will knew he and Yuanli couldn’t outmuscle their opponent and didn’t stand a chance in a straight-up fight, but maybe they could take advantage of their smaller size, and outrun Drapion, pinpoint a weakness and exploit it.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">“<b><span style="color: white">Tailwind</span></b>, Martéo,” the boy instructed after a moment of consideration. “Look sharp! Let’s keep one step ahead and just out of reach.” He nodded at his avian companion and continued, “Follow up with a <b><span style="color: white">Focus Energy - Air Cutter</span></b> combo. Try to find an opening in Drapion’s defenses and attack before it can react. Be sure to cover Chroma if he gets into trouble. We owe him one.”</span></span><br />

Any questions, doubts, or otherwise unanswered thoughts are forcibly pushed back to both your minds as the enemy descends upon you. With Pokémon already released and others joining the fray, you're more than ready and willing to stand your ground and push back the storm of invading Requiems. Even as Andromeda stretches her neck to unleash her attack some of the Duskull briefly shriek in apprehension as the Salamence's <b>Intimidate</b> kicks in, before her <b>Tailwind</b> spreads throughout the ground in waves, uplifting everybody's sense of speed. Already another seasoned warrior herself Minverva the Blaziken lobs a brief <b>Ember</b> at Drought. Her <b>Flash Fire</b> ability soaking in the attack easily, Drought beams over a smirking &lt;<i>Thank you</i>&gt; while in the middle of the group, Pepper's Grimace is already at work, blasting an <b>Overheat</b> into the crowd. A symphony of screeching is heard as the first wave of Duskull is razed by the blistering temperatures, some of the weaker ones immediately flopping to the ground unable to continue. Noting the horde of Fire-types on the field Minvera releases a <b>Sunny Day</b> beam to the sky, but without actual sun the clouds simply clear to let more moonlight grace the battleground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dian, dian!&quot; Only moments after having been deployed to support Ogden Ledah returns to Pepper's side, clutching to his shoulders as Patrick continues to rave. While the question of whether Patrick actually possesses any Pokémon goes without an answer, both of you notice that the seasoned battler clearly doesn't seem to be having any issues. Driven by his unwavering fury the man's lancework is almost a performance in itself, delivering lightning arc after lightning arc as he deflects each Duskull trying to sneak an <b>Astonish</b> on him, every now and then slicing into a ghost's ethereal form and downing it. With Ogden's safety somewhat ascertained and yours to secure all your Pokémon go into full counterattack mode: Minerva striking first with a steady <b>Flamethrower</b> more than on par with Grimace's earlier move, creating an outward explosion as Andromeda's <b>Air Cutter</b> billows into the waves of fire. Behind, Tortuga chuckles as his cannons lob <b>Egg Bomb</b>s into various parts of the seemingly unending Duskull crowd, augmented by a <b>Helping Hand</b> attempt by Grimace, and what doesn't quite get struck is put to sleep as Drought forces her <b>Hypnosis</b> waves at the swarm.<br />
<br />
&lt;<i>They're not fully corrupted. If anything, I'd say it's only started to drive them crazy,</i>&gt; informs Drought, but a sudden lightshow above drags your attention back to the battle as the Duskull release a united <b>Confuse Ray</b>. Just in time Drought casts a <b>Safeguard</b> that washes over everyone; for sure, Patrick is not an individual anyone would want berserk, the man in question now having taken to controlled releasing electric blasts in combination with his shocking slashes, supported by Tortuga blasting <b>Chocolate Magic</b> around to gum unsuspecting spectres together. One by one the fainted Duskull sink into the ground, but even as this happens more Duskull appear from nowhere to fill the void, drowning the air in screeching...</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 9px">Chills shot down Pepp’s spine, the horrid shreiking of the duskull, their ridiculous red eye gave him a feeling of uneasiness. “It is simple to see, these duskull will swarm us in hoards, and I don't think we can be victorious through brute strength alone,” the man comments out loud. If the worst should happen and the duskull overrun their little group, he made a mental note to take refuge in the castle. Pepp smiles slightly at took a moment to calm himself.<br />
<br />
Pepper stared at Ledah for a moment, &quot;We need your help Ledah. You have that unique <b>COPYCAT</b> ability at your disposal, now would probably be the best time use it, then we can get some real damage done. Take advantage of this Tailwind and produce a couple of <b>WHIRLWIND</b>'s to blow these ghouls away. Set up a <b>SAFEGUARD</b> when everyone has finished with their final attack.&quot; The Ledian paused for a moment, then hesitantly nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Grimace we're going to have to give it our all&quot; Pepp called out to his partner. Despite his words and feelings, Patrick would continue his assault till every single duskull has fallen. &quot;Lets add to the windy carnage with a <b>FIRE SPIN</b>, if we manage to trap enough of the little bastards things might even out a tad. That <b>FIZZYBREW</b> has gotten better with age, drink it all down and let the fun begin.&quot; <br />
<br />
He closed his eyes, &quot;.. I will destroy every ghost in this castle if I have to. And I will capture me something savage,&quot; As Pepper opened his eyes, greeted by a pair of grunts from Grimace and Tortuga, he tries to assess the situation. &quot;BLAST!&quot; Tortuga pumped his fist, it seemed he was taking much pleasure in ghost busting. The sticky chocolate dripped from his cannons, and the energy filled egg bombs had done some damage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Use your <b>DRAGON RAGE</b> to bring the pain, then finish by chilling everything with a <b>BLIZZARD</b>.&quot; </span></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DarkSlateBlue">To Rayne’s great relief a fair number of Duskul were fainted by the combined assault of the more experienced trained pokemon. Unfortunately, a second wave of the ghosts came flowing out of the darkness to fill the gaps left behind by the weaker members of their species. Rayne shook his head in disbelief; this might take a while. Maybe their best option would be to retreat towards the castle. Then again, Patrick was far from being reasoned with in his current state, and was most likely going to stay out here and take on the throng of skull ghosts. That gave Rayne an idea … he would try it out as a last resort however.<br />
<br />
“Andromeda, summon a <span style="color: LightBlue"><b>Twister</b></span>, then fire off a <span style="color: LightBlue"><b>Dragonbreath</b></span> into the cyclone for added damage.” Far above him he heard that menacing roar again; she got her instructions.<br />
<br />
“Excellent. Drought, let’s inflict some pain on these ghosts with your activated ability shall we? <span style="color: DarkOrange"><b>Overheat</b></span> those poor souls. Follow with another wave of your <span style="color: Plum"><b>Hypnosis</b></span>.” Rayne had to admit he would really enjoy seeing Drought roast their foes with the super boosted attack. <br />
<br />
“Now, Minerva. Use <span style="color: White"><b>Swords Dance</b></span> to boost the power of your <span style="color: Brown"><b>Rock Slide</b></span>. If any get within striking distance of you try a <span style="color: Black"><b>Thief</b></span> attack.<br />
<br />
“Hey Pepper,” He roared over the deafening shrieks of the Duskul, and crackling of attacks being fired off. “I say we move this battle towards the castle. We’ll have a better field positioning with its walls at our backs. What do you think?”</span></span></div>

With your movement just about completely restricted by an unforeseen <b>Grass Knot</b>, the only alternative for you remains to command Bellatrix against the advancing group of waving Vine Pokémon. Angrily buzzing at the assault on her trainer the living Beehive raises her abdomen, releasing a storm of drones like bullets from a machine gun out of her honeycombed underside. Under the command of an <b>Attack Order</b> the bugs start tearing at the Tangela septulets, and if not for the massive amount of Tangela screaming from the incessant stinging and slashing on their tendrils the contigency plan would otherwise have been just perfect.<br />
<br />
Having put the enemy under distraction and damage, you instinctively try for another struggle attempt, but the botanic ropes hold you firmly in place: it seems quite likely that only the fainting of the opposing group might release you. With any possible preliminary attack from the Tangela intercepted by her pestilential plague of minions, Bellatrix curtly recalls her swarm for her next attack -- a volley of <b>Toxic</b> globs that spatter over the Grass-types, each squealing in discomfort as the poison soaks into their vines. A defiant buzz is heard from Bellatrix in her anger and general fed-up-ness with the group, but before she knows it a spatter of <b>Bullet Seed</b>s start raining onto her, any remainder flying behind and dotting the ground about you; a few landing on your cheek leaving the sensation of a scorching raindrop. Barely looking up, you find that while Bellatrix withstood the attack decently, the odds of seven weaker Pokémon united against one managed to push her back more than you might otherwise have guessed...</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslateblue">Releasing the swarm of bees like bullets from her underside, the Attack Order zoomed into the Tangela, dealing some damage but not doing nearly enough as Rick had hoped they would. The Tangela cried out in pain as the bugs stung them and slashes down their tendrils but there weren’t nearly enough bugs to deal with the entire range of Tangela. Why should have Rick suspected anything otherwise? It wasn’t like Vespiquen contained an army of bugs large enough to cover even one Pokemon in bees, let alone the whole group. No, his first plan of action was failing fast, and being trapped meant he still saw no way to free himself. Deciding that he should still try, regardless of the rate of success, Rick quickly and frantically attempted to pull himself out of the grip that the Pokemon held on his body. Unfortunately, the botanic tendrils locked him firmly in the place he was in, the Pokemon not letting up no matter how much effort he put into the matter. From what Rick was feeling right now, it seemed that the likeliness was that the opposing group would only release him if they were all fainted. What were the chances of that, though? He had no way to reach his pokeballs, and even if he did his Pokemon were all still fairly young. His Duskull and Shroomish would put up a decent fight, sure, but Slakoth and Croagunk? The battled raged on, and with any attack that the Tangela would try to push back blocked by the insect attack, Bellatrix could move on to the next attack fairly swiftly. A volley of Toxic blobs flew over the grass types and slammed into them, most likely causing a large amount of pain as the squeals of discomfort seemed to show. A defiant buzz from the Vespiquen made Rick smile quite a bit; his Pokemon was willing to do almost anything for him. The Tangela, free from the bugs, fought back with a large splatter of Bullet Seeds which rained into Vespiquen, any remaining landing on the ground, some even on Ricks face as he groaned in pain. They felt like scorching raindrops, and he supposed that the idea of acid rain was similar to this. Bellatrix took the attack, certainly, but she wouldn’t be able to survive this fight much longer by herself. Ideas quickly formulated in Ricks mind, until he had a somewhat decent plan in his mind.<br />
<br />
“Belle, we’re going to use an old plan. Mass <b>Sweet Scent</b> to calm them down if you can. If that works and they loosen their grip on me, I’ll try and free myself, but if it fails, use your <b>Fury Swipes</b> to cut away the vines that are closest to me. Do it quickly and suddenly so you can free me before they can react. Good luck, I believe you can do it Belle.” He smiled, trying to be as encouraging as possible, even if he didn’t know whether he truly would escape from this large predicament. What a conundrum.</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslateblue"><div style="text-align: center"><b><u>Lacrima Castle</u></b>&#8203;</div><br />
<b><u>Moonlit Garden</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Dark Fire &amp; SilverWind</u></b><br />
Even as you continue pushing on, no break seems to appear in the onslaught of Duskull, leaving you up to your ears in persisted offence. More rising winds, courtesy of Ledah and Andromeda, cannonball into hordes of Duskull that seem to simply pour from the castle's heights, and a smile lights both your faces as Andromeda's <b>Dragonbreath</b> causes an instant explosion as the surrounding vortexes boost the wave of draconic fire into a volatile inferno, and the addition of Grimace's <b>Fire Spin</b> certainly doesn't hurt the techniques' firepower. Down low the rest of both teams of attacking forces have no sign of holding back either: Minerva, having psyched up her muscular and mental strength with a <b>Swords Dance</b>, easily calls upon random stones strewn about the field by Ogden earlier on in a ferocious <b>Rock Slide</b>, beaning down any Duskull unwitting enough to not switch to their intangible phases. A swig of special Fizzybrew beer soon wells up a blaze from within Pepper's Magmortar, and before long a twin blast of fire like a double volcanic eruption bursts out of her barrelled arms, joining the nine flames of Drought's <b>Overheat</b> attack in exorcising the nearing crowds. Left to his own time Tortuga gladly pumps up winds of his own; a <b>Dragon Rage</b>'s worth of storm catching two groups of Duskull and sending them spiralling back into dizziness, while a subsequent <b>Blizzard</b> coats them in little prisons of ice, locking them in the freeze status before they plummet like hailstones and shatter -- all the while, as Ogden detonates lightning charges, spreading through the Duskull like nodes in a short circuit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Clops. Clops. Clops.&quot;<br />
<br />
Like a drum beating the rhythm to a military dirge, even above the choir of Requiem the toneless chant rings in your ears, and as you crane your necks your eyes instantly focus on the source of the new track amongst the performance: a Dusclops pair, waving their hands in a synchronised, inscrutable fashion, hover through their minions of Duskull as they draw near, and inexplicably you find it difficult to tear your gazes from their singular eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; Almost in a flash of inspiration, Patrick turns around with enough of a jerk to nearly constitute a seizure, &quot;No, you fools! Look away!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dus-CLOPS!&quot;<br />
<br />
Two lasers, one from each Dusclops, shines from the cyclops' eyes, and as the light washes over you a prick in your consciousness informs the both of you that something is dangerously wrong. No longer can you hear the sounds of the battle around you, and even Rayne finds that no psychic quip from Drought can be heard either. Ogden's mouth curls in an unintelligible snarl before he resumes swiping at the swarming ghosts, and it dawns that the Dusclops must have cast <b>Mean Look</b> on the both of you, locking you in a double battle against the Beckoning duo. Taking wide glances, Pepper sees Tortuga amble towards him bewilderedly, while Andromeda descends with an angry screech. It appears that your battle partners against Dusclops have been decided and, if the rules of Mean Look are anything to go by, you'll be locked into single combat until one side falls completely...<br />
<br />

Having caught the Tangela in a bind with the poisoned status, you call desperately for Bellatrix to tend her efforts to you instead, gaining you a buzz in the affirmative. Calling on her previous experience with gathering honey Bellatrix releases a pulse of <b>Sweet Scent</b> in a bid to becalm the raging Tangela, wafting a cloud of aroma over to the screeching bunch. It takes a while before the mist appears to have any effect, but straining your ears you notice that the Tangela's babbles have started to quieten down in volume, almost to a troubled brooding as the Tangela presumably try to get the Toxic off each other. You hear a brief buzzing before Bellatrix's worried gaze meets yours, and relying on the night vision most insect Pokémon possess she carefully tears the knots apart with her <b>Fury Swipes</b>, barely leaving any scratches at all where her claws meet your skin. Grasping your hand in hers Bellatrix buzzes you up to a standing position before hurriedly pulling you along the path, sidestepping the muddled group of Vine Pokémon, dashing across the stone bridge ahead without them so much as noticing.<br />
<br />
By the time Bellatrix stops for you to catch your breath and sufficient time passes by, you manage to take a proper look at your surroundings -- a decision well made, you find, as the view is more breathtaking than you thought. Under the light of the full moon, the shadows cast off the pillars and beams resemble stalwart guards keeping the peace in the abandoned castle, while the dark leaves of shrubs reflect the illumination in a sheen almost soft enough to lie upon. Even in the darkness of night the garden bears a distinct aura of well-maintenance: an observation you find odd considering how the area must have been long abandoned by humans.<br />
<br />
&quot;Poli?&quot; The sound of wild Pokémon, more inquisitive than demanding, turns your attention to one of the pillars lining the tiled floor, and a brief scan yields a Poliwag peering out from behind one of the stone structures. The single tadpole is soon joined by another, then another, then several of the roly-poly Water-types, all looking at you in curiosity and -- perhaps a hint of fear? You can't be certain as a gloved hand, then two, start appearing as a couple of Poliwhirl show themselves. At least this group of Pokémon don't seem intent on attacking...</span><br />

Screeching in affirmative at the alteration in plans, Martéo speedily executes the new commands she is given. A breeze billows behind your ears as your Taillow summons up a <b>Tailwind</b>, pushing herself and Chroma to greater speeds with the attuning of wind patterns to suit your team's movements, while Chroma appears to raise his hands to the sides of his head, clacking his fingers while growling. &quot;<b>Role Play</b> allows a Pokémon to replicate the special ability of their target. Whether this Drapion was destined for protection or exploitation of anatomical weaknesses, it will quite indubitably aid our cause if we borrowed it. Even from those who mean harm to us, there is still much to learn.&quot; Again, stroking his beard, Yuanli appears to mull the situation before continuing. &quot;Chroma, I believe the time calls for a <b>Dark Pulse</b>.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Leye Sableye!&quot; It doesn't take long at all for the Dark-type to tap into his natural reserves, blasting rings of negative energy from his mouth, but even with its speed rendered inferior to yours Drapion is no less capable of battle and in response, storms a squall of the same dark projectiles to meet Chroma's. As the temporary stalemate occurs, Martéo circles the exchange overhead, but even as she flies you know that she's <b>Focus</b>ing her <b>Energy</b> to strike Drapion wherever she can to do the most damage. With the seconds pushing on you find Chroma still holding strong but undoubtedly beginning to fail, you signal to Martéo for the next phase to begin. Swinging her wings Martéo fires waves of <b>Air Cutter</b> at Drapion's head, and as the focused winds hit home Drapion isn't particularly pained, but the attempt is enough to get its concentration to weaken, letting the remainder of Chroma's attack get in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, Chroma! <b>Low Kick</b>!&quot; The command could not come swifter as the senior's Sableye swings into action, diving for a kick that wouldn't look out of place in a baseball game. With the attack targeted at its lower regions, Drapion howls as the technique designed against weightier Pokémon causes it to topple over onto its side; a shower of <b>Poison Sting</b>s littering from its jaw and sprinkling harmlessly over the dusty road.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's beginning to get careless in its aim and execution of techniques. We should be capable of disabling it soon enough if we remain consistent in our advancement,&quot; Yuanli advises...</span></span></div>

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px">Many millenia ago, it is said, gods and demons clashed in a legendary war known in the annals as Ragnarok. Earth was thrown into chaos by the violence that ensued, and the army of the deathly dimension began to encroach on the boundaries of Heaven itself, threatening to overthrow it completely and forever plunge the world into permanent darkness and despair. With this threat in mind, it is recorded that the gods proceeded to break an ancient covenant for the salvation of the world -- sacrificing their power, they created embodiments of destruction known as the Grim Angels; each bearing a divine weapon with which they tore through the armies of chaos, and brought Ragnarok to its end.<br />
<br />
Drained of their omnipotent might, the gods were said to have left the remains of their power within the realm of Riviera where the critical clash between the Grim Angels and demons took place, and entrusted its inhabitants to safeguard the land forevermore, until the day of the gods' return. In time, Riviera became a natural wilderness, where hardy adventurers and explorers journey to in attempts to seek out the mysteries of the land -- with some help of Flying or Surfing Pokémon, or the occasional helpful boatman for a one-way trip, as no other vessels make scheduled stopovers at the wild environment.<br />
<br />
Little else remains of Riviera's history, and in present day, few know of the legend behind the island's past. Even amongst those who still believe in it, few know of the truth behind the power that was said to be locked deep inside Riviera: should the need arise to defend the world's balance, the power of divine destruction within Riviera will be unlocked, purifying the world and taking the world out in the process...<br />
<br />
<span style="color: chartreuse"><b><u>Nelde Ruins</u> - please reply in chartreuse</b><br />
Southwest of Elendia lies a forest, within which lies the ancient ruins of Nelde -- home of the Binon royal family, who died out in the last few centuries. The Binon royal family was said to be a family of naturalist magicians who were at one with nature, and thus constructed their home alongside the forest trees. In the present day, the tree which the ruins were built around has grown into the stone, forming a monumental testimony of the power of nature over mankind. Alongside the local Pokémon, some of the ruins' magic traps are still in place to catch any intruders who might threaten the sanctity of the region.<br />
<b>Wiese Forest</b><br />
The forest that surrounds the Nelde Ruins. Its fertile soil has given rise to a wild variety of flora, some of which can no longer be found anywhere else on Riviera, though not all are safe to touch or consume. Adventurers are not recommended to delve too deeply into the forest, however -- it is said that within the deeper areas of Wiese Forest lies a magical labyrinth of trees, from which escape is nigh impossible.<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: chartreuse"><span style="font-size: 9px">Kori ran. Kori ducked. Kori sidestepped, and then he ducked some more. Kori's face was lined with sweat and his eyes welled with tears as Kori tore through his Pokedex. He pressed the buttons on the pocket computer as fast as he could, but once again, before he could reach his mark, Combusken came flying overhead with a kick directed towards Kori, but instead hitting a tree causing it to crack in half and fall over.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the HE~LL!&quot; yelled Kori. Again, Kori ran through the forest as fast as he could and dived into some brush where hopefully Combusken wouldn't find him. With only a few moments reprieve, Kori focused once again on the Pokedex. &quot;C'mon, c'mon, c'mon! Where's that Fighting type Pokemon index?&quot; he said, scrolling through the options until he finally reached the correct tab. He selected the page and scrolled through even more electronic pages until he got to one labeled Fighting Pokemon Behavior and selected the index.<br />
<br />
&quot;When Fighting Type Pokemon store too much energy, they seek to exert it through fighting other pokemon, training, and in some cases, sparring with their trainers.&quot; said the Pokedex all too loud. Kori tried his hardest to keep the volume down, but it was too late. 2 starlights shined through the brush. Kori felt the steely gaze and turned, only able to say &quot;Aww crap.&quot; before hearing &quot;BUSKEEEEEEEEEEN&quot; and then feeling a powerful kick to his head which sent Kori sailing through the air until he landed with a thud. Combusken landed on his feet and struck his &quot;ready for action&quot; pose, but then seeing his trainer face down in the dirt, Combusken rushed over to him and checked if he was alright. When Combusken picked Kori up, Kori's eyes were swirly and he was disoriented. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, Torchic, did you use Copycat again? You know that move hurts ya.&quot; Kori said to the 3 small Torchics swirling around his head. Shaking himself out of his stupor, Kori got back up and patted the dirt off of his clothes. &quot;Combusken, I know it was a long trip here and I know how restless your getting, but I promise, once we're done with our job collecting vocal samples from the Pokemon here I'll get you some weights so you can train yourself silly.&quot; he bargained. Combusken looked very apologetic, but at the notion of being able to train some more, the little fire bird perked up and shook Kori's hands. With their little tussle over and a mutual agreement reached, Kori and Combusken walked through the dense forest as Kori recalls the reason why he and his companion Pokemon have entered this wild portion of the land of Riviera. <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
It was a few hours into the night after Kori's adventure in Mediville when his cellphone rang &quot;Ring ring ring, Ring ring ring. Phone Call, Phone Call!&quot;. Kori got up from his sleeping bag, picked up the phone and blaring through the receiver was mambo music. He knew that tune. It was the favorite song of the Pokemon Professor that gave Kori his Pokedex, Professor Maggie Fern; the expert in the field of Pokemon Communications. Graduated the same class as Professor Elm of Johto, Maggie went head first into her field of Pokemon Communications trying to crack the language of Pokemon. Kori first met her at his families farm when his older brother Mori began his journey. Back then, she was just beginning her term as a Professor. The next time Kori would see her would once again be at his farm when Kori's older brother Mori brought his younger brother his Torchic. It was that day as well that Kori received the Pokedex, trusted tool of Pokemon researchers and trainers everywhere.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Professor. Whats up?&quot; answered Kori.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Kori! How's your journey going? I didn't get you at a bad time did I?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, it's fine, I just got out of Mediville, and my Pokemon journey, hehe, it's been eye opening.&quot; he said, recalling the craziness of a few hours ago. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, did you say Mediville? That's great! I know you've never been to my labs so why don't you stop on by, I'm just a day out of Mediville by foot so come around. I might have a job for you to do for me also&quot; she said. A loud bang was heard in the background and the music stopped suddenly. &quot;Oh no, Ludicolo, put that blender down! I have to go Kori. See you tomorrow!&quot; she said, hanging up. Kori put the phone back into his backpack and went back to sleep. The next day, Kori put foot to dirt road again expecting a whole days walk, but was greeted by a kind stranger in a pick-up truck. Getting a ride, Kori made it to the lab closer to the afternoon. He walked up to the door and knocked a couple of times, but there was no answer. He tried the bell and once again, there was no answer. After waiting, Kori tried the door knob and the door opened releasing the sound of blaring mambo music. <br />
<br />
The house was messy, notes strewn about. A door opened and out came a Ludicolo swinging a pair of maracas in time with the music, and holding on to it's waist dancing in conga line fashion was Professor Maggie Fern. Her curly orange hair bounced up and down, she wore a short party dressed that was patterned after the Bellossom and her favorite pair of Sunkern earrings. When she and Ludicolo noticed Kori standing at the door, flabbergasted at this ridiculous sight, Professor Fern quickly ran to turn off the stereo, rushed to get her white lab coat on and put her glasses back on. Ludicolo threw away the maracas and tried to straighten up. &quot;Ah-hem....Kori! I didn't expect you till later this evening.&quot; said Professor Fern, glowing bright red. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hehe, um, I got a ride and thought I'd drop on by earlier....guess I interrupted something.&quot; said Kori, embarrassed as well, not really sure how to conduct himself. Maggie turned to Ludicolo and began doing the craziest thing, she started speaking Pokemon language. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ludi Ludicolo, Ludi Ludi?&quot; she said. The Ludicolo nodded it's large sombrero shaped head and headed to the kitchen.<br />
<i>Tea...get, guests, for?</i><br />
<br />
&quot;What was that?&quot; Kori asked, amazed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, as I'm sure your brother told you, I'm an expert in the field of Pokemon communications. I've dedicated my life to the pursuit of cracking the Pokemon language so that one day Humans and Pokemon can understand each other easier. It's still crude, but I'm nearing a breakthrough&quot; she explained. The Ludicolo came out with a tray loaded with iced tea and snacks. He placed it on the coffee table. &quot;Ludicolo.&quot; said Maggie in thanks.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...you said something about a job, Professor?&quot; asked Kori, sitting down in a chair, picking up a cookie. Maggie sat down on the opposite chair and got her notes together again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't call me Professor, it makes me feel old. I still got some life in me. Call me Maggie.&quot; she said with a smile. On the table, Maggie laid out page after page of research pages, notes, test results and a map. Most of this Kori couldn't make heads or tails of. &quot;For the past number of years, your brother Mori helped me along with my research by collecting pokemon and recording samples of Pokemon in the wild. He was very helpful and went all over the world in the pursuit of my research, as well as seeing his own journey through of course which is why I want you to help me now.&quot; she explained. She pointed to a map, placing her finger on a land called Riviera. &quot;On one of your brothers adventures, Mori journeyed to a place called Riviera and when he was there, he told me about the sights and most importantly, the sounds. Your brother was so amazed.......HE FORGOT TO RECORD ANYTHING FOR ME!!!!&quot; she said, starting to cry. Ludicolo was quick with the tissues. Kori supposed that she was easily emotionally moved. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...M,Maggie.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So you see, that's why I need you!&quot; said Maggie, quickly recomposing herself and grabbing hold of Kori's hands, her face up close enough for Kori to smell her breath. What was with the scent of mango he wondered. &quot;I need you to go to Riviera discover as much as you can for me, bring back whatever news you can, and I'm sure that there would be some Pokemon there for you to discover too.&quot; she pleaded. Kori could barely utter a word. She took this as an agreement. &quot;Oh thank you so much Kori!&quot; she said hugging him. After getting a run down of how Kori would get to Riviera, and choosing the Weise Forest as his starting point, Professor Maggie Fern set Kori off on the next part of his journey. Maggie saw Kori off at her front door. &quot;Thank you so much Kori, I really appreciate your help. I've made all the arrangements so you'll be good to go when your ready. By the way, I heard Riviera can be kind of wild, do you still just have that Torchic your brother gave you?&quot; she wondered. Kori smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, not anymore.&quot; he said. Kori then grabbed 4 Pokeballs and pressed the buttons in the middle to unleash the Pokemon that were inside. &quot;Torchic evolved into Combusken, I caught a Pachirisu outside of Mediville, and I got a Girafarig and a Paras too now. I think I'll be alright with these guys.&quot; said Kori. Maggie felt even reassured that he was the right guy to talk to. &quot;Excellent. I wish you luck on your journey Kori!&quot; she said. Kori waved goodbye, recalled his Pokemon and started off for Riviera. Maggie closed the door, but apparently it didn't close all the way because the next thing Kori heard, the Mambo music started back up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Ludicolo, it's MARGARRRRRRRIIIIIITTTTTAAAAAAA time!&quot; said Maggie grabbing a blender. Ludicolo resumed his maraca playing, and the Pokemon professor's party resumed. Kori looked at the partially ajar door with a large bead of sweat appearing behind his head. Was this really the Professor Mori put his trust in?<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Back in the Weise Forest, Kori shook off the bizarre behaviors of Professor Maggie Fern and headed forth to see what he could find out here.</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Chartreuse"><b><u>Nelde Ruins: Wiese Forest</u> - Please Reply in Chartreuse</b><br />
<b>Kori Gotcha:</b> After the brief, yet slightly frightening skirmish with your Combusken the two of you set out into the depths of the Wiese Forest. Like with any typical fighting type, the promise of a good workout was an incentive well worth the sacrifice. While Combusken seemed more grounded for the time being, you could still sense the restlessness in your oldest party member. Something within the fiery fighting chicken itched for battle, and that instinctive need was reflected in his eyes, which seemed to be burn with fire. <br />
<br />
Glad that Combusken had settled slightly, you divert your attention to your surroundings, trying as best you could to isolate the forest’s sounds and sights. At first you are overwhelmed at how calm and majestic the trees are. Their thick trunks surround you from all directions, enveloping you like a thick brown blanket. As thick as the forest is, you don’t feel smothered, but rather an almost unnatural calmness washes over you. Bright, warm sunrays strike you through the thick foliage, completing the illusion of being in bed so perfectly you begin to feel a little drowsy. Unknowingly you shut your eyes and let out a drawn out yawn, the sound of which snaps right you out of your near-swoon. A little embarrassed you shake your head slightly to displace the grogginess; maybe that mighty kick from Combusken gave you a minor concussion you think to yourself, but brush it off just as quickly as you conjured up the idea. <br />
<br />
“Busk!” Your Combusken’s cry pierces into your ear. You look around and notice that you had strayed from your partner slightly. You’re not entirely sure how that occurred, seeing as Combusken was just beside you not ten seconds ago. More surprising still was the fact that his cry sounded hoarse, out of place, unnatural. “Busken?” Combusken waves you over, telling you to hurry up. Again, his voice cuts through the air, but where it used to sound warm and welcoming it now sounds harsh and venomous. Alarmed, you look around to see if something is deceiving you into perceiving this effect, but find nothing. Combusken by this point figured something was wrong and quickly raced to your side. The sound of his footsteps on dead leaves breaks the silence again, and once more you find yourself almost cringing at the sound. What’s going on here you wonder … and then it hit you.<br />
<br />
This forest … made not a sound. You stood there with your Combusken at your side, and heard … nothing. Not a single sound. No flying pokemon chirping in the bright sky, no water rushing past little pebbles, nothing. You’ve come here in an attempt to study pokemon communication, but come to the grim realisation this might not be the right place; in fact, this place was beginning to freak you out. The trees that had not too long ago felt so cozy around you began to feel a little constricting. Worried you turn back and head in the direction you came from, each footstep sounding like it will shred your eardrum. You cover your ears with your palms, but the sound of the pulsing blood in your hands is too intense to handle. Then it all goes away. Silence surrounds you once more. <br />
<br />
“…!” You try to speak, but no sound comes out. “…” Again, not a sound. You can feel your tongue and lips moving, and yet the sound is lost somewhere between your lips and your ears. You notice that Combusken is having the same problem. His beak is moving, but you can’t hear what he’s saying. Both of you stare at each other, confused and terrified.<br />
<br />
“Welcome pupil,” A loud, wise sounding voice grabs your attention. To your great relief the voice doesn’t make you want to rip your ears out. It seems to come from every direction at once, surrounding you. Before you have time to look for source the voice continues. “you have been chosen young one. <i>You</i> are one of only few. <i>You</i> exhibit all the characteristic necessary. <i>You</i> carry the potential to lead our great family into an age of prosperity not yet witnessed in our rich history.” The voice trails off for a bit, leaving you more confused than ever. Was this speech aimed at you? <br />
<br />
“As you know, the trials you are about to face are not at all like the ones you have been exposed to in your brief life. Your performance up to this point has been stellar, beyond what is expected of someone your age, and for that the Council commends you. Remember, your future hangs in the balance; succeed and untold fortunes await you, fail … well ... you know what awaits you if you fail.” The mysterious voice rings ominously in the silent forest; a gut feeling tolls you failure might not be an option. “Now child, step forward and prepare to take on your greatest test. The challenge that will determine the rest of your life.” <br />
<br />
The echo that followed each of the man’s words cut out briefly afterwards. A faint blue orb descended through the forest canopy, suspended several feet above the ground. Curiosity gets the best of you and you find yourself reaching out to touch it. All it took was a slight nudge, but suddenly the orb began expanding, the blue light now flashing in bright pulses. As the orb expanded it pushed the trees around it out of the way, as if they were simply decorations on wheels. Confused you look around to see that this odd phenomenon was occurring all around you, the edges of the orb pushed the trees away, but somehow you were left untouched when the orb touched you. Finally the expanding halted, but the transformation was not yet complete. You were now smack in the middle of a gigantic blue, pulsating dome. The diameter of which was probably 100 yards or so. Beneath you the grass shrivelled away to reveal a solid marble platform, with many random hieroglyphs, symbols, sign and lines going every which way; if you were to guess, it looked like a giant spell circle. And indeed, just as the thought crossed your mind several symbols lit with that same pulsating blue light. The light started around the edges, and followed a spiralling groove towards where you were standing. You watched in amazement as the light, like water rushing down a dry riverbed after a large rainfall, raced around the circle all the while lighting up other symbols as it passed by them. Finally, the light drew to the last spiral, draining into a small basin right in front of you. With another quick pulse the stage was set, the light stopped pulsating, and you were left in this strange blue dome with your Combusken.<br />
<br />
“The Council determined your first test to be the Void. As you might have realised by now, sound does not propagate in the Void, verbal commands are utterly useless. We are testing your mental capacity to think quickly. More importantly it will test your communication and improvising skills; skills which are essential for high ranking army officers. Now child ... it is your time ... ascend above the obstacles set before you here; the Council demands it.&quot; The man's voice cut out once again, but is replaced with another, a woman's voice this time. While it sounds much more youthful than the man's, it resonates with nobility and elegance, a soothing tone to lull you before the imminent challenge. <br />
<br />
<i>Use your tongue, I’ll use my ear,<br />
Language will not aid you here.<br />
For every spoken word that does exist,<br />
Twenty alternatives there be, I do insist.<br />
Speech will fail you here this time round,<br />
Yet communication lives without a sound.</i>”<br />
<br />
As the woman finished her little poem, a yellow orb floated into your sight from across the dome. It remained stationary for a bit, roughly 40 yards in front of you. Suddenly, much like the blue orb on first contact, it began pulsating and expanding. Unlike the blue orb however it did not maintain a spherical shape. Instead limbs poked out of an ever expanding mid region, more protrusions followed in the perpendicular plain … and then you understood. As the orb's limbs and mid region expanded slowly it began to take on a slight resemblance to a Beedrill. You had to defeat this Beedrill without being able to use your vocal chords. Spoken commands would be impossible, but the woman implied spoken words are but one way to communicate with pokemon. Across the battle ground, the Beedrill was almost fully shaped. The battle would start shortly. <br />
<br />
<i>What will be your commands?</i></span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Screeching in affirmative at the alteration in plans, Martéo speedily executes the new commands she is given. A breeze billows behind your ears as your Taillow summons up a <b>Tailwind</b>, pushing herself and Chroma to greater speeds with the attuning of wind patterns to suit your team's movements, while Chroma appears to raise his hands to the sides of his head, clacking his fingers while growling. &quot;<b>Role Play</b> allows a Pokémon to replicate the special ability of their target. Whether this Drapion was destined for protection or exploitation of anatomical weaknesses, it will quite indubitably aid our cause if we borrowed it. Even from those who mean harm to us, there is still much to learn.&quot; Again, stroking his beard, Yuanli appears to mull the situation before continuing. &quot;Chroma, I believe the time calls for a <b>Dark Pulse</b>.&quot;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;Leye Sableye!&quot; It doesn't take long at all for the Dark-type to tap into his natural reserves, blasting rings of negative energy from his mouth, but even with its speed rendered inferior to yours Drapion is no less capable of battle and in response, storms a squall of the same dark projectiles to meet Chroma's. As the temporary stalemate occurs, Martéo circles the exchange overhead, but even as she flies you know that she's <b>Focus</b>ing her <b>Energy</b> to strike Drapion wherever she can to do the most damage. With the seconds pushing on you find Chroma still holding strong but undoubtedly beginning to fail, you signal to Martéo for the next phase to begin. Swinging her wings Martéo fires waves of <b>Air Cutter</b> at Drapion's head, and as the focused winds hit home Drapion isn't particularly pained, but the attempt is enough to get its concentration to weaken, letting the remainder of Chroma's attack get in.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;Now, Chroma! <b>Low Kick</b>!&quot; The command could not come swifter as the senior's Sableye swings into action, diving for a kick that wouldn't look out of place in a baseball game. With the attack targeted at its lower regions, Drapion howls as the technique designed against weightier Pokémon causes it to topple over onto its side; a shower of <b>Poison Sting</b>s littering from its jaw and sprinkling harmlessly over the dusty road.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;It's beginning to get careless in its aim and execution of techniques. We should be capable of disabling it soon enough if we remain consistent in our advancement,&quot; Yuanli advises...</span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Yuanli was right. Will wholeheartedly agreed. They must continue to press their advantage. In its current, distressed state, there was absolutely no way of predicting what Drapion might do next, and they had to try to immobilize it before it could regain any of its wits. Chroma was fighting well, but Will wondered how much longer the little purple imp could keep it up. It certainly must have consumed a considerable amount of energy using <b>Role Play</b>. Despite Will’s first impression, Yuanli had turned out to be quite the strategist and Will felt slightly foolish that he had judged the man solely based on his outward appearance. Will realized that if kept his own eyes open, he just might learn something about battling and timing from the mysterious oldster and his faithful Sableye.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Turning to his tiny avian companion gliding overhead, Will felt a fierce sense of pride suddenly surge inside himself. Martéo was certainly doing her species proud, he couldn’t help but admit, living up to its Pokédex entry of courageously taking on larger, stronger opponents. </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">“Brilliant, mate!” the boy praised, grinning. “Don’t get cocky!

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslateblue"><div style="text-align: center"><b><u>Lacrima Castle</u></b>&#8203;</div><br />
<b><u>Moonlit Garden</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Dark Fire &amp; SilverWind</u></b><br />
Even as you continue pushing on, no break seems to appear in the onslaught of Duskull, leaving you up to your ears in persisted offence. More rising winds, courtesy of Ledah and Andromeda, cannonball into hordes of Duskull that seem to simply pour from the castle's heights, and a smile lights both your faces as Andromeda's <b>Dragonbreath</b> causes an instant explosion as the surrounding vortexes boost the wave of draconic fire into a volatile inferno, and the addition of Grimace's <b>Fire Spin</b> certainly doesn't hurt the techniques' firepower. Down low the rest of both teams of attacking forces have no sign of holding back either: Minerva, having psyched up her muscular and mental strength with a <b>Swords Dance</b>, easily calls upon random stones strewn about the field by Ogden earlier on in a ferocious <b>Rock Slide</b>, beaning down any Duskull unwitting enough to not switch to their intangible phases. A swig of special Fizzybrew beer soon wells up a blaze from within Pepper's Magmortar, and before long a twin blast of fire like a double volcanic eruption bursts out of her barrelled arms, joining the nine flames of Drought's <b>Overheat</b> attack in exorcising the nearing crowds. Left to his own time Tortuga gladly pumps up winds of his own; a <b>Dragon Rage</b>'s worth of storm catching two groups of Duskull and sending them spiralling back into dizziness, while a subsequent <b>Blizzard</b> coats them in little prisons of ice, locking them in the freeze status before they plummet like hailstones and shatter -- all the while, as Ogden detonates lightning charges, spreading through the Duskull like nodes in a short circuit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Clops. Clops. Clops.&quot;<br />
<br />
Like a drum beating the rhythm to a military dirge, even above the choir of Requiem the toneless chant rings in your ears, and as you crane your necks your eyes instantly focus on the source of the new track amongst the performance: a Dusclops pair, waving their hands in a synchronised, inscrutable fashion, hover through their minions of Duskull as they draw near, and inexplicably you find it difficult to tear your gazes from their singular eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; Almost in a flash of inspiration, Patrick turns around with enough of a jerk to nearly constitute a seizure, &quot;No, you fools! Look away!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dus-CLOPS!&quot;<br />
<br />
Two lasers, one from each Dusclops, shines from the cyclops' eyes, and as the light washes over you a prick in your consciousness informs the both of you that something is dangerously wrong. No longer can you hear the sounds of the battle around you, and even Rayne finds that no psychic quip from Drought can be heard either. Ogden's mouth curls in an unintelligible snarl before he resumes swiping at the swarming ghosts, and it dawns that the Dusclops must have cast <b>Mean Look</b> on the both of you, locking you in a double battle against the Beckoning duo. Taking wide glances, Pepper sees Tortuga amble towards him bewilderedly, while Andromeda descends with an angry screech. It appears that your battle partners against Dusclops have been decided and, if the rules of Mean Look are anything to go by, you'll be locked into single combat until one side falls completely...</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: DarkSlateBlue"><span style="font-size: 9px">&quot;Excellent,&quot; Pepper hissed in Mr. Burns manner. &quot;You're doing great guys! Soon we'll be done with these wretched beasts and then we can explore the castle, and hopefully track down Ellen's deceases body.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cries filled the moonlight garden as hoards of ghosts fell to a combination of Wind, Fire, and Dragon energy. Though it felt like the waves of Duskull would never end, a new challenge presented itself in the form of Evolution. The rhythmic chants caught the attention of both Pepper and Rayne, who immediately twisted their heads to the source of the distraction. <br />
<br />
&quot;Clops. Clops. Clops.&quot;<br />
<br />
Descending from the night sky two ominous looking Dusklops crept their way through their ghostly minions, setting their sights on the pair of trainers. Pepper felt a tingling sensation whell up inside of him, somehow, staring directly into the eye of the Dusklops englufed him completely. Time had slowed to a hault, he had been overcome by a strange new suppressant. <br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; Almost in a flash of inspiration, Patrick turns around with enough of a jerk to nearly constitute a seizure, &quot;No, you fools! Look away!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dus-CLOPS!&quot;<br />
<br />
A crimson beam washed over Pepper, leaving him cringing with dispair. &quot;Blast it! this must be their <b>MEAN LOOK</b> technique,&quot; the young man muttered. Bursting into action, Tortuga found himself ready to defend, flexing his sea turtle muscles. Pepper turned to Rayne and gave him a thumbs up, though he couldn't verbally communicate with him anymore he figured it was enough, before issuing commands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Start this off by gluing Dusklops in his place with a <b>CHOCOLATE MAGIC</b>, if it can't move it can't attack, then fire off a <b>RAIN DANCE</b> to summon the rain clouds. <b>IRON DEFENCE</b> to finish.</span></span></div>
