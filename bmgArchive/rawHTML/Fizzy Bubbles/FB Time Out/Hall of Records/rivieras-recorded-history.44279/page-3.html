Left with your Swampert as your only viable option for defence, you rally Wraith in your attempt to turn the tables around against your aquatic adversary. Pulling up the waters around him, it doesn't take long for Wraith to summon a respectably-crested wave of <b>Surf</b>, drawing a look of surprise even from Tentacruel as the momentum from the whirlpool and other currents rise to a peak. You feel your organs plummet with the rest of your body as you cling to Wraith for dear life, falling like a giant hailstone as Wraith bulldozes his attack straight into the enemy jellyfish. Water churns above you before rushing in to fill the spatial depression, submerging the three of you as the froth bubbles in a most turbulent manner above you. Clinging to Wraith you hold desperately to your breath, heaving a large gasp as Wraith breaks the water surface, and spotting Tentacruel rise as well he wastes no time in hocking a large <b>Mud Shot</b> at Tentacruel. The projectile splatters against the jewelled forehead, but even as the silt drips down Tentacruel's face you find that it's barely even stunned or stifled; certainly, it must be the <b>Clear Body</b> ability in action even though the Poison typing must have taken some rather strong damage.<br />
<br />
Giving off a snort of annoyance, Wraith starts treading towards the other offending Water-type; his fist starting to glow in power when all of a sudden you feel a lashing, followed by a constriction at your back, pinning you forcefully against Wraith's vertebrae. A yelp from Wraith followed by a sense of displacement, a view of the sky and choking sensation informs you that Tentacruel has now got you under clear <b>Wrap</b>s. Roaring, Wraith swings his arm, striking a <b>Mega Punch</b> against a tentacle which withdraws from the attack, only to be replaced by others, surrounding you in mid-air like a twisted inquisition. Tentacruel's certainly experienced some hurt this time, but things are really not looking too good for you...</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: aqua">With the opposing Tentacruel before him looking ever more irritated, Wraith followed his master's orders to a point, drawing upon his own aquatic powers for assault, bending the waters into his own wave, in a manner which seemed to also take advantage of the Tentacruel's own weapon, Jamie noticed before realising that being on the back of a pokemon about to attack with a tidal wave wasn't the safest place to be. Clinging to the Swampert like a kitten to a velcro pad, the human could only take one lungful of air before falling alongside the larger fish as the wave slammed down onto the Tentacruel, just as the waters from above submerged all parties involved as the world took a blur for him. Holding desperately to whatever air he had in his stinging lungs, he gave a gasp of relief upon breaking the water's surface before Wraith spat forth a missile of mud into the jellyfish. As the sludge splattered onto the Tentacruel, Jamie gave a frown as the silt simply slid off the face, the realisation that the body of his tormentor was clearer than anticipated giving him slight relief that any draining assaults would be beneficial, rather than detrimental. Sadly the Swampert lacked basic skills as that.<br />
<br />
Trudging to his foe, fist aglow, the Swampert and trainer suddenly found themselves under sudden wraps by the enemy's tentacles. Slugging one, Jamie realised quickly that with the situation less than pleasant as further tentacles hung above him and the Swampert, the problem would be that Tentacruel were said to possess eighty or so of the limbs, meaning that fighting them off would be meaningless. However, he wasn't one to surrender so easily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wraith, <b>protect</b> us from these...the bubble created should shove these ties off us...then <b>slam</b> your <b>body</b> into that lighter jellyfish before...giving him a chill and intimidation with a mighty <b>roar</b>...preferably before I snap a bone...&quot;</span></span></div>

&quot;That certainly sounds likely,&quot; nods Duessel as the two of you look over your figures in the dirt. &quot;I think you're further along the track than I ever tried, although... if all it took were two variations, why would there be a need to indicate four directions?&quot; Some scratching of heads ensues for a while with you taking in this information, until Duessel pipes up again. &quot;You know, now that I think of it, in all the instances Cormag and I looked for food, there were only those three times that we encountered the signboard when we made an attempt to escape, even though we must have trekked far enough in this forest... maybe that's what the instructions mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
Beckoning your view, Duessel points to the lines in the paper's clues. &quot;Four symbols oversee direction... if what you're saying is right, it could mean that a certain seasonal phenomenon indicates the direction to travel to the signboard. Time passes in cycles... certainly, when I travelled in different directions, we experienced different seasons. Maybe the seasons indicate the exact path we need to take in order to escape, and the paths vary depend on what season it already is.&quot;<br />
<br />
It sounds like you're all getting closer to a resolution as more of the pieces fall in place from the putting together of heads. If you can take what has been hypothesised to be true, all that might be left is to theorise a navigated way out...<br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: chartreuse">&quot;Maybe... Hang on. I think we're onto something, but I don't know.&quot; The girl picked up her stick and continued drawing.She considered at first going north twice, or perhaps north and west, or maybe the other way round, or maybe south twice and north four times, or maybe east , then south, then north then west, and so on, and so on, until the map of routes the girl had drawn began to look like a labyrinth. Then looked at the sheet of paper one more time. &quot;Time passes in cycles, direction is overseen by the four symbols.&quot; She then considered what was associated with them in the hopes of finding a landmark, a turning point, perhaps. Blastoise was associated with ponds and lakes, but it could also be found on the coast, which meant the exit was available in wintertime, perhaps? Ho-oh was associated with rainbows. She considered how odd it would be to find one in the summer, but what the heck. Flygon was associated with the desert... Now it was just plain outlandish But then again, what wasn't? Purugly was a housepet... &quot;Wait up, none of this makes sense, this can't be it...&quot; The girl considered something else. Perhaps something that resembled the Pokémon was in each one. &quot;Direction is overseen by the four symbols... Wait! I got it! In each season, there is something that looks like one of the four pokémon listed here, in this case, a Purugly. that is, one of the Four Symbols. 'Direction is overseen by the four symbols.' That suggests that we go the direction that each one points. If we follow those, we might have ourselves an exit. What do you think?&quot;</span></span></div>

With the new presence unleashing a storm's worth of questions, you find yourself troubled above all else by the strange woman. Was this mysterious lady friend or foe, alive or dead -- and was she a prelude to what you might have to face in this strange location? Hoping to seek answers you mentally relay a general contigency plan to Drought, steely standing on the spot you're on and waiting for the stranger to make her move. As it is, she seems to head right for you; Drought tensing her muscles and curling her lip in preparation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh...&quot; A few steps away from you, the woman falls to her knees, making a grasping motion at which you can't help but jump. As she seems to sob against your calves you look uneasily to Drought, who can only mirror your bewilderment. &lt;<i>She's not attacking,</i>&gt; reasons your Ninetales, though she has a certain tone of surprise at that. Bending down you support the woman by her arms, gently leaning her shaking frame against a tree, both you and Drought looking into her eyes glinting with tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pleas... des... oy...&quot; she whispers, &quot;Seek... hou... ddle... orest...&quot; Clutching her wrist, you're alarmed to feel her pulse suddenly dwindle to a complete stop; noting her expression you see that she's completely unmoving, with her eyes glassy as the night sky and her skin greying. &lt;<i>She's gone,</i>&gt; Drought informs you grimly. &lt;<i>I could sense her spirit was already fading, fragmenting. Almost like it was glued on to this body like strings to a puppet, and flimsily at that. She was barely holding on as it was.</i>&gt;<br />
<br />
Wiping the sweat off your clammy forehead, you heave a deep sigh. Experiencing anguished death is generally never a pleasant thing to be a part of, but what are you to make of the woman's final message and Drought's observations?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: DarkSlateBlue"><span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua'">Rayne stood in one spot, unyielding and unwavering, as the strange woman made her way closer and closer. Beads of cold sweat started forming on his forehead, revealing his anxiety, but still he stood motionless. His Ninetails too obeyed her orders and did not move, but he could see her tense up, her fur stand on end, her lip curl back. <br />
<br />
Several steps from Rayne the woman fell to her knees, stretching out her arms, to which Rayne instinctively jumped in aid. The tension was broken, if only briefly, as the woman began sobbing at his feet. Confused, Rayne looked at Drought, who returned the confused expression with one of her own. <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;... She's not attacking ...&gt;</i> Fair enough, thought Rayne. Slowly he helped the woman up, supporting her against a tree. Her body was cold, and he could tell hardly an ounce of energy was left in her. Still whimpering, she whispers: &quot;Pleas... des... oy... seek... hou... ddle... orest...&quot; And with that she faded. He felt her weak pulse dissipate, her muscles slackened, her eyes glossed over, her skin lost the little colour it had to begin with. She was dead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it!&quot; Rayne screamed, guilt quickly sinking in. Why didn't he help her. Maybe if he had offered help initially ... <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;... She's gone. I could sense her spirit was already fading, fragmenting. Almost like it was glued on to this body like strings to a puppet, and flimsily at that. She was barely holding on as it was ...&gt;</i> Drought's comment helped to ease his mind. Of course her death wasn't his fault. She was barely living when they ran into her. He couldn't have helped her in any case. Still, death was never easy to cope with, especially when you see the last bit of life slip out of a human being. Having encountered death while adventuring with Drought before, he decided it would be best to put the guilt aside and focus on the more pressing issue, what was this woman talking about?<br />
<br />
&quot;Almost like it was glued on her body ... strings on a puppet? What does that mean? Was the spirit someone else's? Was someone draining her spirit? Was someone animating an already dead corpse?&quot; He reasoned aloud, but still it didn't quite make sense. &quot;And what the hell was she rambling about. Destroy? Destroy what I wonder.&quot; As he replayed their encounter over and over in his head those fragmented words kept flashing: seek, hou, ddle, orset, seek, hou, ddle, orset, seek, hou, ddle, orset ... <br />
<br />
&quot;Seek, house, middle, forest? Is that what she was trying to say? Was she giving us directions?&quot; Whatever she was trying to do, he felt obligated to check it out, maybe he could avenge her death. Who knows what this woman was all about. Looking down at her cold lifeless body he made up his mind ... he would continue his treck into the forest. He knelt beside the woman, closed her eyelids, folded her arms over her chest, and layed her down between the thick roots of the largest tree in his immediate area. That's as good of a burial he could afford at this time; with his knife he carved a marker into the tree: &quot;Here lies Unknown, who was laid to rest by R., on November 10th, 2009. May she rest in peace ...&quot; He walked off, never looking back.<br />
<br />
Once out of site, and the event somewhat out of mind, he snapped a pokeball off his belt and flicked it open. The flash that ensued was bright enough to partially blind him for a few seconds, even though he had his eyelids shut. Upon regaining his eyesight the familiar sight of his Scyther greeted him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Scy ... ther!&quot; Plague called out, warming up his flight muscles. <br />
<br />
&quot;Glad to see you buddy.&quot; Rayne smiled, extending his fist, Plague in turn extended his scythe until they made contact. &quot;Listen Plague, this is what I need you to do. Fly up above the canopy, find me the middle of the forest. There may or may not be a house there. In either case, I need the center of the forest, because that's where we're going. Think you can do that for me?&quot; Rayne's plan was to use his Scyther as a sort of biological GPS; he would periodically send him above the canopy to ensure his bearings were right, adjusting his path if they got off course.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, you got it Plague. Use <span style="color: Plum"><b>Agility</b></span> to speed up the process, zip around the forest quickly until you find the center. Let Drought know if you spot any houses or anything else odd you see when you come back. I'll explain everything to you then.&quot; Plague nodded his agreement, and with a flurry of wing beats zipped off, crashing through the forest roof.</span></span></div>

Things certainly have not begun on a bright start to say the least, as you spend time evaluating the situation at hand. Determining to seek out the cause of everything as indicated by the woman's final words, you release another of your trusted friends onto the scene. Not sorry to have a chance to stretch his wings, Plague zips about for a few moments before receiving your orders, soaring through the matrix of trees above you with a determined cry. &lt;<i>I've got a lock on his positioning,</i>&gt; Drought soon informs. &lt;<i>He seems to be headed towards our right, although I can't say for sure if he's sighted the house we're looking for. From what I can read, it's in what appears to be a clearing ahead.</i>&gt; With little more ado, Drought bounds ahead on her graceful paws, leaving you to run quickly behind her as your Pokémon lead the way.<br />
<br />
Barely maintaining a steady gait, you find yourself struggling between catching up to Drought while keeping a sharp eye for the masses of roots and branches in your way, bits of bark snapping across you every now and then and leaving faint scars of friction burn across your skin -- a rather demanding task in itself, as Drought's lit tails flicker as she runs. None of her familiar sarcasm or wit seems to be present, you find, or did the woman's death affect your Ninetales as well? She certainly seemed a little shaken when she presented her analysis earlier...<br />
<br />
&quot;SCYTHER!&quot; &quot;HON-KROW!&quot;<br />
<br />
&lt;<i>Look out!</i>&gt; Suddenly bounding against you, Drought pushes you away as Plague suddenly comes crashing through the canopy; a dark shape above him piledriving him into the ground. Picking himself up and shaking off clods of dirt, Plague screeches at his cackling assailant; a confirmation with the PokéDex states the enemy as a Honchkrow. A snarl rips from Drought's lips, before she instantly launches a series of fireballs from the tip of her tails, scorching a tree some distance away and instantly incinerating it into bits; as it crumbles you see a purple figure rip from the debris, forming into a Haunter with a most maniacal expression on its face.<br />
<br />
&lt;<i>Be careful. I'm sensing similar energy from these two as I did from the woman. I can't tell if they're actually alive or dead, but there's definitely something there... something far more ominous.</i>&gt; Pawing the ground, Drought takes her place alongside Plague, swishing his claws angrily as the enemies leer eerily at the three of you.<br />
<br />
What will you do now?</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: chartreuse"><div style="text-align: center"><b><u>Nelde Ruins</u></b>&#8203;</div><br />

&quot;Direction... four symbols... oh, now I remember why this seemed so niggling.&quot; Experiencing a distinct breakthrough, Duessel taps his forehead with a prodigious look on his face, before pointing to each of the Pokémon much to your bewilderment. &quot;The four symbols referred to four deities that were said to oversee the four cardinal directions. A large turtle overlooked North, a white tiger for West, a vermillion bird for South and a green dragon for East. Matching that to what you just said... it must mean we should be travelling... ah, <i>now</i> I remember. I thought I had been going away from the sun on my first journey instead of towards it when it was the other way round, THEN travelled away; no wonder things felt like they didn't add up. We should be travelling <b>west</b> this time.&quot; Reflexively, you feel an expression of mild annoyance creep along your face as Duessel grins sheepishly, &quot;Guess 45 years of solitude really do a number on your memory, eh?&quot;<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center">***&#8203;</div><br />
A packing of supplies, and some well wishes shared later, you find yourself trekking besides Duessel and Cormag; the two of your new acquaintances appearing to have a spring in their step at prospects of finally leaving this forest, while you admittedly can't share similar sentiments. How long would it be before Duessel turned on you, as many others did before?<br />
<br />
&quot;Aha, here we go.&quot; Suddenly startled by Duessel's declaration, you stop with your Pokémon to see a sturdy, yet certainly aged sign ahead of you, but you already know what the sign says from what Duessel copied. &quot;Any idea how we should go forward?&quot;<br />
<br />
You now have enough information in order to go according to what the seasons and clues tell you, but a wrong calculation would certainly leave you no better off, if not worse, than when you begun... What will you choose to do now?</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: aqua"><div style="text-align: center"><b><u>Tetyth City</u></b>&#8203;</div><br />
<b><u>Tetyth Lake</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Cod of War</u></b><br />
The notion of being jellyfish chow suddenly becoming very real, you cry out defensive manoeuvres to Wraith who is only too happy to oblige. With natural knowledge of the attack in question your Swampert quickly kicks in his <b>Protect</b>, forming an impenetrable bubble that swiftly expands outwards, pushing away the crushing tentacles as you earlier hoped. Screechingly Tentacruel tries pushing its <b>Wrap</b> further, but it soon becomes clear that Wraith's stance is stronger and the swarm of tendrils is violently launched backwards as the barrier fades. Flailing from the removal of suspension Wraith lunges for a <b>Body Slam</b>, ramming valiantly into Tentacruel, and for a while the fact that Wraith appears a distance away from you eludes your senses. All too soon, with a splash into the lake water, you realise that your plan had a slight though crucial miscalculation: the strangled position in which you were pressed against Wraith and the force of being wrenched free separated you from your Swampert, leaving you to struggle against powerful currents and the remaining horde of tentacles.<br />
<br />
Now with a hefty, fully evolved enemy at its face, Tentacruel appears to withdraw its limbs to counterattack, but the rest of the details escapes you as your muscles fail to prevail against the tide, dragging you below the surface. Pain wracks your chest as you try desperately to stay alive and afloat; the only images reaching your brain in blurs and a mixture of shrieking and roaring alongside the medley of froth and bubbles all around you...<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center">***&#8203;</div><br />
&quot;He's awake! Oh, thank goodness!&quot; &quot;Admittedly so. I had not expected him to survive, though I am still of the opinion that he was very foolish.&quot;<br />
<br />
What had happened? You're not sure what had happened after you went under, but as it is you feel pretty weightless even now. Raising a hand you're startled to see a strange, pulsing barrier around it, patterned with gleaming refraction of light. A gasp rises from your throat, soon followed by another as you see bubbles issuing from your mouth, and after some flailing and looking about you've ascertained that somehow, one way or another, you've survived the Tentacruel onslaught and now lie on what seems to be a marbled surface, having magically gained the power to breathe and move freely underwater, all without getting wet.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you've quite finished ogling,&quot; mutters the gruff male voice you'd just heard, and looking ahead of you you're stunned to see a barechested male, joined by a smiling woman wearing a glimmering tank top, but what has you thoroughly baffled is how they appear to be perfectly fine with no underwater breathing equipment. Peering downwards, you almost start backpedalling when you notice that where human legs should have been, the man has a bulky tail and flippers with a belt of what seems to be ice at his waist, while the woman has a blue and white lower body with a peculiar bubble design, and a bobbing orb at the end of a zigzagging tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I know. Intriguing, isn't it?&quot; grins the woman, and proving her point she paddles over to you and performs a few graceful circles. &quot;Welcome to the depths of Tetyth Lake, stranger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's the one you have to thank for the bubble barrier. Standard Azumarill ability,&quot; explains the man curtly, in a manner much like someone describing ordinary weather. &quot;Rather foolhardy of you, though, to have entered the lake like that. Few people these days would dare to brave the ferocious Pokémon that live in higher waters, but in the first place we don't see many people headed for Tetyth. The city's curse takes those that escape the floodwater's grasp; only us Aquafolk have a chance of surviving out here.&quot; Extending a hand, the half-Walrein man gazes down at you, apparently in greeting while trying to figure you out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eriden. And she's Seroba. Who might you be?&quot;</span></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: chartreuse">The girl was not as annoyed at Duessel's error as she was for forgetting the four dieties. At the research center of the Ruins of Alph, they were quite visibly displayed on an old map. She often wondered what happened to that place. Anyway, just for good measure, she drew a few more markings in the dirt. IN SPRING=GO EAST. IN SUMMER=GO SOUTH. IN AUTUMN=GO WEST. IN WINTER=GO NORTH. She also sketched SUMMER TO WINTER TO SPRING TO FALL. &quot;Time passes in cycles... cyclic time.&quot; She drew a circle in the ground with a stick. At the top she put SPRING, at the right she put SUMMER, the bottom FALL, the left, WINTER. She studied this and came up with a plan. She drew a straight line from FALL to SUMMER, and from there to WINTER, from right to left across the circle. From there, she drew a line to SPRING, and another to FALL, top-down. &quot;I think I have us our way out, Mr. Duessel.&quot; She showed Duessel the circle, retracing the path her stick had followed. &quot;The time here is based loosely on that which appears on a clock. So if we go <b>east</b>, counter-clockwise, we'll go back one season. Then we go <b>west</b>, across the face of the clock, going straight to summer and skipping spring. From there, we go <b>north</b>, clockwise, bringing us up one season, then <b>south</b>, down the face of the clock, going right to fall without going through summer.

All too soon, with a splash into the lake water, you realise that your plan had a slight though crucial miscalculation: the strangled position in which you were pressed against Wraith and the force of being wrenched free separated you from your Swampert, leaving you to struggle against powerful currents and the remaining horde of tentacles.<br />
<br />
Now with a hefty, fully evolved enemy at its face, Tentacruel appears to withdraw its limbs to counterattack, but the rest of the details escapes you as your muscles fail to prevail against the tide, dragging you below the surface. Pain wracks your chest as you try desperately to stay alive and afloat; the only images reaching your brain in blurs and a mixture of shrieking and roaring alongside the medley of froth and bubbles all around you...<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center">***&#8203;</div><br />
&quot;He's awake! Oh, thank goodness!&quot; &quot;Admittedly so. I had not expected him to survive, though I am still of the opinion that he was very foolish.&quot;<br />
<br />
What had happened? You're not sure what had happened after you went under, but as it is you feel pretty weightless even now. Raising a hand you're startled to see a strange, pulsing barrier around it, patterned with gleaming refraction of light. A gasp rises from your throat, soon followed by another as you see bubbles issuing from your mouth, and after some flailing and looking about you've ascertained that somehow, one way or another, you've survived the Tentacruel onslaught and now lie on what seems to be a marbled surface, having magically gained the power to breathe and move freely underwater, all without getting wet.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you've quite finished ogling,&quot; mutters the gruff male voice you'd just heard, and looking ahead of you you're stunned to see a barechested male, joined by a smiling woman wearing a glimmering tank top, but what has you thoroughly baffled is how they appear to be perfectly fine with no underwater breathing equipment. Peering downwards, you almost start backpedalling when you notice that where human legs should have been, the man has a bulky tail and flippers with a belt of what seems to be ice at his waist, while the woman has a blue and white lower body with a peculiar bubble design, and a bobbing orb at the end of a zigzagging tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I know. Intriguing, isn't it?&quot; grins the woman, and proving her point she paddles over to you and performs a few graceful circles. &quot;Welcome to the depths of Tetyth Lake, stranger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's the one you have to thank for the bubble barrier. Standard Azumarill ability,&quot; explains the man curtly, in a manner much like someone describing ordinary weather. &quot;Rather foolhardy of you, though, to have entered the lake like that. Few people these days would dare to brave the ferocious Pokémon that live in higher waters, but in the first place we don't see many people headed for Tetyth. The city's curse takes those that escape the floodwater's grasp; only us Aquafolk have a chance of surviving out here.&quot; Extending a hand, the half-Walrein man gazes down at you, apparently in greeting while trying to figure you out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eriden. And she's Seroba. Who might you be?&quot;</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: aqua">Under the multitude of tentacles by the ravenous foe, Jamie had taken to heart the whole ideology that the creatures of the lake were aggressive, and yet in spite of this was thankful that the Swampert he was painfully hugged against had its own defensive measures as the translucent bubble emerged from the beast, instantly taking the strain off his body as he felt he could breathe again. Looking up at the mass of tentacles trying in vain to crush the bubble and the pair, the Tentacruel gave up eventually as the bubble faded, to the flailing form of the Swampert slamming his heavy body into the lighter enemy, and as the boy noticed the Swampert seeming to shrink, it was only once he hit the water that he remembered a basic law of physics: Objects in motion continue unless somehow acted upon by another force. Without a safe hold of the Swampert, the trainer found himself launched over the battling pair by the assault, and into the waters of the lake in alarm. As the urge to keep afloat took priority, he felt himself sinking into the depths, the visuals blurred, the only sounds screeching and roaring as froth seemed to fizz from the battlefield, and then there was darkness.<br />
<br />
<i>Pain. It hurts all over.<br />
<br />
What am I searching for? Who exactly was I?</i><br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
&quot;He's awake! Oh, thank goodness!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Admittedly so. I had not expected him to survive, though I am still of the opinion that he was very foolish.&quot;<br />
<br />
The voices woke him from the annals of unconsciouness, and as he sat up, clutching his slightly stinging head with his hand, his eyes focused just enough to register the strange barrier around it. With a gasp, he gave a second one upon noticing the bubbles before flailing around in a panic at the basis of being underwater until reasoning set in and his muddled mind struck forward with hypothesis. If he was here, underwater, then it must mean that he had either been killed and was in some strange limbo, or he had survived the Tentacruel assault miraculously and had found the ability to survive under the waves, both in terms of respiration and avoiding being crushed under extreme pressure.<br />
<br />
&quot;When you've quite finished ogling,&quot; the second voice, one quite gruff, grunted as Jamie looked at the source of the vocals before staring at the two humans underwater, somehow without breathing aids, until the wandering eyes bugged out at their distinct lack of lower body halves. Instead, the male seemed to possess a tail and flippers with an icy belt, while the other, a female, had a bubble-style body with a tail ending in a large bouncy ball, and as bewilderment set about, he was almost prepared to actually look for a way out of this unusual place before the woman paddled a few circuits around him, as though finding his unease amusing before welcoming him to Tetyth Lake's depths.<br />
<br />
'<i>Wait...I actually made it, and aren't dead? That's a relief...</i>' he thought, before the man spoke up again.<br />
<br />
&quot;She's the one you have to thank for the bubble barrier. Standard Azumarill ability. Rather foolhardy of you, though, to have entered the lake like that. Few people these days would dare to brave the ferocious Pokémon that live in higher waters, but in the first place we don't see many people headed for Tetyth. The city's curse takes those that escape the floodwater's grasp; only us Aquafolk have a chance of surviving out here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Listening to the man, Jamie remembered the Tentacruel and noted that the next time he orders a full-force physical move while riding a pokemon, to try and hold onto it, when the sudden memory of the battle gave him greater concern, mainly over that of Wraith. Had the Swampert managed to defeat the Tentacruel and went searching for him, or did things go terribly wrong? Dispelling the latter idea, the Walrein man introduced himself as Eriden, while the Azumermaid was Seroba before inquiring as to his name, something most people would find quite easy, but not for him. All he knew was an alias, and if an identity was required, then an alias would have to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, er, thanks for the bubble. The name's Jamie, er, excuse me if I'm a bit jumpy, this whole underwater business is a bit new to me,&quot; he blurted, thinking what to do, he had his priorities alright, and finding Wraith trumped finding this library that he headed to Tetyth for. <i>Firstly</i>, he reckoned, <i>letting these two aquafolk know his predicament was best if he was finding Wraith.</i> &quot;I sorta came here looking for information on a pokemon that has the power to change memories or something, but was attacked by a Tentacruel. I fell into the water and found myself here, but my Swampert was still battling it, and I'm not sure how long I've been out for, or whether he's okay or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rising somewhat sluggishly, Jamie took the welfare of his team above the welfare of his quests, and right now Wraith was his main concern.</span></span></div>

A multitude of raging thoughts, above all the will to survive, pound through your brain as the desperation and malice in the air afflict you. For certain there's a lot more than meets the eye, perhaps even more than you might be capable of imagining, but to answer these queries now would be impossible except in the afterlife. With an expression twisted in an unfathomable cross between what might be irritation, loathing and worry all mixed together, your unlikely saviour scowls at you before she disappears behind your back. Looking back at the monster girl, you find that in spite of her apparent frenzy and bloodlust her movements seem uncoordinated as she steps forward. However, as Marowak places his palm on the rock you spy a flash of violent purple energy across the ground, and before you know it you feel a slashing thump swipe across your stomach faster than you can blink. As the air is smashed out of your lungs you clutch your gut painfully; peering sideways you see Marowak in much the same agonised pose. Had the attack occurred in response to Marowak's offensive stance?<br />
<br />
&quot;Wak maro!&quot; Briefly recovering from the unprecedented strike, Marowak finally pounds the stair with a determined fist, sending a wave of his <b>Earth Power</b> into the stone, unfettered by the lack of his weapon. Lines of shining yellow light spiderweb through the rocky surface, cutting out distinct plates of the earth as they surround the cloaked enemy before erupting in an explosion of gaiakinetic energy. With a shriek the demonic girl finds herself tossed backwards, and given an opening Marowak lunges valiantly forward, kicking in knowledge he possessed since long ago as he blazes in a <b>Flame Wheel</b>'s fireball. Like a falling meteor your Pokémon rams into his enemy, but even as his body burns and you squint your eyes you discover that no other combustion appears to be occurring; a train of thought soon derailed as a snapping sound breaks your concentration. To your utmost horror the fanged hood has somehow revolved about the girl's head, now holding Marowak in its crushing grasp as she screeches in victory.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Feisty, are we? How'd you know I like my meal piping hot? But don't worry... Once I'm done with this morsel, I'll be sure to tend to you. Eeeheeheeheeheehee!</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
Rendered helpless, you watch despairingly as Marowak is flipped upwards like a burger, suspended briefly before the inevitable drop and devour, when you hear the other new voice ring out like a lightning bolt.<br />
<br />
&quot;<b>Pursuit</b>!&quot; Riding a missile surrounded in jet-black power, the warrior woman speeds in on Marowak as her Skarmory hones in like a bullet, barely snatching your Ground-type a split second after the cloak jaws snap shut. A sharp swerve, followed by a jerk on your shoulders, and you soon find yourself hanging in mid-air from Skarmory's firm but painless talon grip. &quot;Now, Skarmory! <b>Agility</b>!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Skaaaar!&quot; As Dark energy gives way to Psychic power, Skarmory careens against the wind faster than you might have expected out of a metallic avian, but your new visual perspective weighs most heavily on your mind. Granted, you had come searching for sights, but most certainly not from a precarious bird's eye view while under the threat of a manic half-human. Somehow Skarmory seems to pay little mind to your instinctive flailing, bravely navigating towards the chains and rocks, when --<br />
<br />
&quot;What in the -- NO!&quot; At the woman's curse, you turn around to immediately wish you hadn't made the involuntary action; a symbol of flame, gaining size and intensity with distance as it heads towards you, threatening to swallow the entire group. &quot;Skarmory, <i>faster</i>!&quot;<br />
<br />
Little else reaches your senses at that point, aside from a scorching wave of heat and Skarmory's cry of agony, followed by a ripping sound as the material of your shirt slips through the Armour Bird's cringing claws; a death knell louder even than the collective screams above you. Stones and metal, accompanied by a cacophonic orchestra of noise of chaos, fills your mind as you hurtle...<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center">***&#8203;</div><br />
Minutes or hours? You can't tell for certain, but as you open your eyes you know that for certain you've been put out of commission for quite a while. As your sensory functions refamiliarise themselves you feel a series of definitive throbbing pains through your body; a combination of burns, cuts and bruises, but surprisingly less severe than you might have otherwise expected from the near-death experience. The scarred face of the scythe wielder appears before you; her dark blue eyes soft in their gaze, and for some reason you have the distinct impression that she had been crying for a while, at least.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're alive!&quot; she whispers, again surprising you with how gentle she's being, &quot;Thank goodness, you're alive!&quot; Dull thuds pulse in your limbs as you find yourself scooped in an embrace; the woman's hair pressed against your neck as she holds you like a long-lost friend. Was this really the cold, no-nonsense lady you'd only just met some time ago, you can't help but wonder, as she eventually relents with a sad look on her face. Looking around, you find yourself on the floor of what seems to be the ruins of an ancient temple having already lost its gleam. Some distance away Marowak and Skarmory lie, resting off their exhaustion and injuries.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry you had to get involved in this.&quot; The woman speaks, and meeting her gaze you sense unease within her, as though she's deliberated over what to say for a while and still hasn't found the right words. &quot;I understand that you likely have a lot of questions for me, but first...&quot; For a moment, the steely, resolute quality in her countenance returns, and you know that things have only taken another turn for the serious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me -- what do you know about the Grim Angels?&quot;</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: Red"><span style="font-size: 9px"><i>Apologies for the extreme delay in replying. This is a beautiful update and I wish I could dedicate the time to this reply to do it justice.</i><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>Ow...</i><br />
<br />
LC propped himself up, favouring his left arm as his right was swollen and bruised at the very least if not worst, seemingly having broken his fall. <i>His Fall</i>. Flashbacks came into his head even as he sat there of the recent events...the flight...the explosion...and the fall. <i>The Fall</i>! LC's eyes darted around to look for Marowak, and were relieved to see the Bonekeeper Pokemon a short distance away, lying facedown but noticeably breathing, sleeping off the pain. A second pang of relief came as he saw Skarmory next to his companion, in no state to fly, but clearly alive in spite of the damage sustained in the flight from the hellspawn that had confronted them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well?&quot; The woman prompted LC, reminding him of her prior question, jerking him out of his stream of thought and back to reality. In truth, he didn't know much about them beyond what he'd read before coming to the Riviera and now that was feeling rather underdone. Perhaps he should have read into this adventure a little more before setting off, and in doing so saved himself from getting caught up in this horrible mess. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not much really. I know they fought the Demons for the final time here in Heaven's Gate, which is what intruiged me to come here originally, like a History lesson really. I didn't realise that anything like this would happen, I...I don't know what to say. I'm sorry I nearly got you...both...all of us killed. What was sh...that?&quot; Looking up at the woman once more, LC remained as puzzled as ever. She was hard to judge and made him feel slightly uncomfortable, probably more due to the situation than her manner, as strange as it was. <br />
<br />
Awaiting the woman's reply, LC nursed some more bruises on his legs. It had not been the best start to his adventure, really.<br />

Things certainly have not begun on a bright start to say the least, as you spend time evaluating the situation at hand. Determining to seek out the cause of everything as indicated by the woman's final words, you release another of your trusted friends onto the scene. Not sorry to have a chance to stretch his wings, Plague zips about for a few moments before receiving your orders, soaring through the matrix of trees above you with a determined cry. &lt;<i>I've got a lock on his positioning,</i>&gt; Drought soon informs. &lt;<i>He seems to be headed towards our right, although I can't say for sure if he's sighted the house we're looking for. From what I can read, it's in what appears to be a clearing ahead.</i>&gt; With little more ado, Drought bounds ahead on her graceful paws, leaving you to run quickly behind her as your Pokémon lead the way.<br />
<br />
Barely maintaining a steady gait, you find yourself struggling between catching up to Drought while keeping a sharp eye for the masses of roots and branches in your way, bits of bark snapping across you every now and then and leaving faint scars of friction burn across your skin -- a rather demanding task in itself, as Drought's lit tails flicker as she runs. None of her familiar sarcasm or wit seems to be present, you find, or did the woman's death affect your Ninetales as well? She certainly seemed a little shaken when she presented her analysis earlier...<br />
<br />
&quot;SCYTHER!&quot; &quot;HON-KROW!&quot;<br />
<br />
&lt;<i>Look out!</i>&gt; Suddenly bounding against you, Drought pushes you away as Plague suddenly comes crashing through the canopy; a dark shape above him piledriving him into the ground. Picking himself up and shaking off clods of dirt, Plague screeches at his cackling assailant; a confirmation with the PokéDex states the enemy as a Honchkrow. A snarl rips from Drought's lips, before she instantly launches a series of fireballs from the tip of her tails, scorching a tree some distance away and instantly incinerating it into bits; as it crumbles you see a purple figure rip from the debris, forming into a Haunter with a most maniacal expression on its face.<br />
<br />
&lt;<i>Be careful. I'm sensing similar energy from these two as I did from the woman. I can't tell if they're actually alive or dead, but there's definitely something there... something far more ominous.</i>&gt; Pawing the ground, Drought takes her place alongside Plague, swishing his claws angrily as the enemies leer eerily at the three of you.<br />
<br />
What will you do now?</span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: DarkSlateBlue"><span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua'">Seconds after Plague crashed through the canopy Drought informed her trainer that the bug pokemon had located the target and was moving off towards their right. She also filled him on the fact that there was a clearing in that direction; good news indeed. As Scyther zipped ahead unimpeded by the thick tangle of trees, Drought and Rayne did their best to follow below. Of course Drought had no problem at all keeping up to the speedy mantis, but Rayne on the other hand had a tougher time. Running full steam ahead, with only Drought's tails illuminating his path, he found it difficult to side step the forests obstacles, and within minutes his muscles and skin were throbbing from the continues contact with tree branches. <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;... Tell him to slow down a bit, will you? ...&gt;</i> Rayne asked. Draught did not respond. Perhaps she sent Plague a telepathic message, or maybe she was also really focused on dodging the various obstacles. Whatever the reason was, she ignored him, and their pace did not slow even a bit. Draught ignoring him gave him an idea, one he wished he had thought of much earlier. If he could keep a telepathic link with Drought, while simultaneously she could keep a link with Plague, what was stopping Rayne from using Drought as a mental bridge to his Scyther? It was certainly worth a try. <br />
<br />
Rayne's focus narrowed, he collapsed onto Drought's thoughts and started filing through them, which was really mentally exhausting he found. His head began to hurt, this was beyond his scope, but then he found it. Plague's vision, Plague's thoughts, Plague's movement, Plague's sensations. Focusing even harder he attempted to isolate his Scyther's thoughts, to beam him a message, but he couldn't quite break on through. His head felt like it would split from the inside, but still he pressed on ... focusing ever harder on that one thought ... until he ran smack into a tree. In his obsession, he lost focus on his external enviornment, which caused him to run into a tree he never even saw. Shaking his head, he looked down at his arms, which were covered in bruises and cuts, presumeably from him not noticing what he was running into. Rayne slowly breathed out, collected his thoughts, and once again bound off in his high speed chase through the forest; this mind link would have to wait for another day he decided, one in which he can sit down with his whole team and practice. <br />
<br />
After another minute or so of running he had finally caught up to his Ninetales, who suddenly stopped in her tracks. A screech from above informed him that they were no longer alone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Scyther!&quot; Plague sounded alarmed. Drought's actions mirrored Plague's cry as she shoved her trainer protectively; away from the spearheading combination of Scyther and mysterious assailant. <br />
<br />
&quot;Plague!&quot; Rayne called out as his Scyther hit the forest floor with a sickening thud. The mysterious assailant was revealed to be a Honchkrow, the evolution of Murkrow (a dark bird Rayne had a nasty history with). Rayne's blood began to boil, but just as he was about to relay his orders, Drought revealed another foe. An angry scowl crossed her face as she sent a storm of fireballs at a decaying tree, instantly vaporizing it ... revealing the gaseous form of a Haunter.<br />
<br />
<i>&lt;... Be careful. I'm sensing similar energy from these two as I did from the woman. I can't tell if they're actually alive or dead, but there's definitely something there... something far more ominous. ...&gt;</i> She told Rayne, her anger sending tremors through out his brain. The death of that woman now felt less isolated. Whatever Drought sensed in these pokemon was also present in the woman; the golden question being, exactly what was this presence? The appearance of these sinister looking pokemon worried Rayne greatly, they looked evil; bent on destruction, chaos and death. And he was going to fight them ...<br />
<br />
<i>&lt;... Alright Drought, keep the mental link. I don't want these pokemon knowing what we're up to. Put up a <span style="color: White"><b>Safeguard</b></span> around you and Plague, then <span style="color: Plum"><b>Imprison</b></span> Haunter, finally burn Honchkrow with <span style="color: DarkOrange"><b>Will-O-Wisp</b></span>. That'll curb its attack and drain its health. ...&gt;</i> Knowing his two pokemon had a speed advantage over the other two he would use Drought to disable the opponents' strengths, while Plague (who was a better natural fighter) would lay down the hurting on them. Drought growled, exposing her razor sharp teeth, beforing beginning her move.<br />
<br />
&quot;Plague! Use <span style="color: White"><b>Focus Energy</b></span>, follow it by <span style="color: White"><b>slashing</b></span> the Honchkorw.&quot; Finish it up by using <span style="color: Black"><b>Pursuit</b></span> on the Haunter.&quot; Plague slid his scythes past each other, sending out a pleasent metallic ring which kept resonating in Rayne's ears. A battle at last ...</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: red"><div style="text-align: center"><b><u>Heaven's Gate</u></b>&#8203;</div><br />
<b><u>Crumbling Sanctum</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Lonely Cubone</u></b><br />
&quot;The Grim Angels.&quot; The name carrying off the woman's lips like a soft breeze, you watch as your unlikely saviour casts a sad look across the sinisterly desolate landscape of suspended stone and metal. &quot;The truth about the Grim Angels, especially where it came to their origin, has varied in Riviera's history. No one truly knows whether they were divine or enchanted beings, or simply normal humans like you and I who were affected by phenomena that, perhaps, no one will ever come to know. What is certain is that they followed the collective bidding of -- well, <i>someone's</i> judgement. Could have been a revered individual or organisation, though the legends point towards the gods. The Grim Angels followed the commands of the gods to pass judgement as the gods saw fit, mowing down whoever stood in the way of accomplishing that end. For this the Grim Angels were granted great power of their own and a Pokémon familiar to aid them... but in return, as legends stated, they had to give up something of their own.<br />
<br />
&quot;After the last Great War that the Grim Angels brought onto Riviera -- Heaven's Gate itself is testament to that grand battle -- it was stated that some of the surviving Grim Angels never returned to Heaven, but lived amongst people and Pokémon. The Grim Angel Ein, who gave up his wings for his power, was said to have been the first amongst them to fall in love with a mortal woman, and from then on Riviera held some lineage that historians have tried to trace back to the original Grim Angels,&quot; she continues. &quot;Millenia have passed since then, though; you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who's more than a distant relative... but that girl is an exception. She was descended from the Grim Angel Alycos, who gave up her sanity in exchange so she could also meet the objectives required of her -- with no psyche to hurt or damage she would not be deterred by assignments given to her. She became fused with the Pokémon that was given to her as a familiar; Mawile, the Deceiver Pokémon.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a plan that worked... far too well. Varying accounts have existed about Alycos, but they neither praised nor criminalised her as a whole. With no sanity to restrain her she was a danger to her allies as well as enemies, and this was as long as there were loose ends to tie, blood to spill. Eventually after the last Great War, some accounts say, the gods exiled her to Earth as they could no longer control her, while others say that what little of her mind remained made her choose self-exile as an option, but all confirm that at some point she fell in love with a mortal man who reciprocated her feelings and empathised her situation.&quot; At this the woman sighs, a terrible wince across her face. &quot;You know how female insects tend to eat the male after... well, suffice to say, that's what happened according to the archives. Alycos' uncontrolled half claimed another sacrifice to sate her innate bloodlust. The man's family, it was recorded, were beyond furious and distraught. Alycos was forced out of civilisation, doomed to forever wander the badlands and wildernesses of Riviera, even as she carried the child of her beloved... and after she was born, it is said she left her child in the care of a kind and understanding hamlet before she died.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since then the violent and bloody legacy of Alycos has been repeated through the ages. The power of the heavens, and the curse that came with it, lives on even now in that girl. Each generation a poor man falls head-over-heels in the single descendant of Alycos, resulting in more mindless bloodshed and misery. Everywhere the descendants of Alycos go, they bring destruction and death by the cast of their shadow... as <i>she</i> did to my village five years ago. Little more than a humble, quiet town that specialised in metallurgy; she simply appeared one day and torched the place to the ground... I was the only survivor.&quot; Bowing her head as she says this, you feel a pang of guilt and pity as the woman recounts her difficult memories. &quot;Like it was nothing but dust in the wind. Since then I've been doing my research and hunting her down, such that the legacy of Alycos could end... but I still can't match up to her strength, even though she comes here every now and then. I wait for the chance to strike in her most vulnerable stages, but... well, you saw what happened. There were times that I barely lost my life to her, if not for my Skarmory and his dedication to me.&quot; Weakly she cracks a smile at the roosting bird behind you, her gaze briefly meeting your own guilt-ridden expression. &quot;It's alright. It wasn't your fault,&quot; she whispers gently, placing a comforting hand on yours, &quot;None of this has to do with you. You were just in the wrong place at the wrong time... but this is my story. You've nothing to do with it, and I've seen too much death to risk seeing yours.<br />
<br />
&quot;...I'm sorry, but that's all I can tell you. About her, about me.&quot; Standing up, the woman picks up her scythe as though preparing for battle. &quot;I'm going to patrol the surroundings, just in case. For now you need to rest from your wounds; we can't risk sending you back to the Riviera Barrier if you haven't fully recovered.&quot;<br />
<br />
Watching the warrior lady leave through a doorway of rubble, you see her vanish amongst the rough roads of rocks linked by chain, information still running full course in your head. The adventure you hoped for certainly hasn't been anything like you ever guessed it might be, but what will you do now?</span><br />

With even less answers than before and two distinctly dangerous enemies in front of you, you relay discreet instructions to Drought and direct orders to Plague; the former synchronising her thoughts with Plague who nods as he grinds his bladed arms against each other. As he starts to <b>Focus</b> his <b>Energy</b> to keener, sharper levels, Drought wastes little time in casting a panel of <b>Safeguard</b> over your entire group -- a timely endeavour, it proves, as a <b>Thunder Wave</b> dances from Honchkrow's wings over to your Ninetales, while Haunter sends a series of scorching <b>Will-o-wisp</b> at Plague. Briefly shimmering from Drought's initiation, the protective anti-status barrier flickers into view as the attacks scatter against it, causing both enemies to snarl and spit at the preventive spell.<br />
<br />
Exchanging a curt nod, Plague zooms into action as the faster of your two fighters, delivering a <b>Slash</b> to its earlier assailant. A glint of distant moonlight reflects off his extended limb as he draws damage, and you're pleased to note that his skill has not gone unseen as Honchkrow receives a <b>critical</b> gash to its puffed breast. As this happens, Drought extends a pair of her nine tails into a crossed position, casting more of her mystique power in a bid to <b>Imprison</b> all shared knowledge she possesses with her enemies, and instantly you see Honchkrow's flailing grind to an immediate halt; its attempt at a <b>Taunt</b> failing completely.<br />
<br />
Screeching at the interruption of its second attack in a row, Honchkrow swoops in with its <b>Wing</b>s outstretched for <b>Attack</b>, joining with Haunter's <b>Shadow Punch</b> as the blows rain onto Drought; her earlier Safeguard unable to protect against actual attacks. However, as Honchkrow backs away you hear a singular smirk whispered into your mind, and the sound of an agonised squawk confirms that Drought's <b>Will-o-wisp</b> technique has come into practice. A frown replacing the cheeky expression on Haunter, you watch as it waves its disembodied claws in <b>Spite</b>, but realisation soon strikes as it discovers the ability to be locked as well. The miscarried tactic provides Plague an opening to drive home a tackle in blazing <b>Pursuit</b>, ramming into the venomous spirit as it cannonballs into the trees, phasing through before hovering back menacingly. Everyone's taken damage here, but given the preliminary stages of the battle this match is certainly far from over...</span><br />

&quot;Your Swampert? Ah, yes. We saw him succeed barely in discouraging the Tentacruel from attacking further, but such is the nature of the <b>Roar</b> technique. Although, the local jellyfish have been known to be undeterred in their hunts and territorial fights; such a tactic is not likely to always work. Be aware that not all adversaries will be capable of being dissuaded,&quot; warns Eriden. &quot;As for your Swampert, we managed to identify the -- PokéBall in which he would otherwise be kept in, and retrieved him before he risked further injury.&quot; You note for a moment that Eriden had to visibly struggle a little before breaking the pause in his sentence; an expression of distaste as he speaks the word.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you would look for a Pokémon that affects memory, however, I'm afraid we have no such information that might help you. Psychic Pokémon in particular naturally possess a wide range of abilities; perhaps it would better serve your purposes if you searched --&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Information? Why not bring him to the Library, Eriden?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seroba! We do not speak of such things to outsiders.&quot; Harshly interrupting, the half-Walrein glares at his associate, now taken to performing underwater somersaults playfully. &quot;You know as well as I do the city does not look kindly upon trespassers, and that includes us!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, come on, Eriden! I don't think he's like the others; those who came to Tetyth only to plunder.&quot; Smiling serenely at you, Seroba seems to size you up before continuing, &quot;And besides, you never know! We might find something relevant to his queries!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You forget that likewise, we cannot guarantee that any search will prove useful. In which case we would simply expose this adventurer and ourselves to needless danger.&quot; Sighing, Eriden addresses you once again. &quot;Jamie, was it? I suppose that given circumstances, we can offer... assistance, if you will, in your personal quest. In your present state it would be foolish to mount an expedition into Tetyth's limits alone, although I am still of the opinion your exertions will not lead to fruition here. Whether to retreat or to push forward, we leave the choice to you. Whichever your selection we will honour your decision and see you through these depths unharmed.&quot;<br />
<br />
What will you choose to do?</span></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: DarkSlateBlue"><span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua'">“Well done there guys!” Rayne was really pleased with the way that round had turned out. Plague was untouched, the opponents were impaired, but Drought had taken some serious damage from the eerie duo. Regardless of how well that round went, Rayne knew not to celebrate just yet. Not only were these high level adversaries, he could not forget that there was something strange about them, something that could prove tough to defeat. <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… Alright Drought, let’s build on last round. Use <span style="color: Purple"><b>Confuse Ray</b></span> on Honchkrow. Follow it up with a <span style="color: Black"><b>Nasty Plot</b></span>, and finish up with a <span style="color: Plum"><b>Psychic</b></span> attack on Haunter. …&gt;</i> It was Drought’s turn to lay a hurting on these guys, and if all worked out according to plan, that Haunter was in for quite a hurting. <br />
<br />
“Plague, I need you to use <span style="color: Black"><b>Pursuit</b></span> on Haunter, and combo that with another <span style="color: White"><b>Slash</b></span> to Honchkrow. Finish up by providing cover for Drought; <span style="color: PaleGreen"><b>Fury Cutter</b></span> on anybody who gets too close.” With his commands relayed, Rayne shifted his focus onto the enemies, watching closely for any odd behaviour.</span></span></div>

Disjointed events and conclusions half-formed in your mind, your immediate priority is the unwelcome newcomer in this confusing equation which Ledah is quick to acknowledge. Relying on unique intel your Ledian rises into an <b>Extremespeed</b>, slamming into the myotis of mostly mouth head-on. Not having expected its prey to fight back the Golbat is stunned momentarily, save for a few coughs as it recovers from having had its open gob rammed into, before screaming a shriek of indignance at you. The breezes around you seem to rise upwards as Golbat lifts its wings, but not for long when the Bat Pokémon swings them back down. Harshly hardened pockets of <b>Air Cut</b> crescents all around you, prompting you to instinctively raise your hands for protection as the Flying-type move slashes into the dirt around, drawing dust as Ledah winces from the wind slicing past her own skin.<br />
<br />
As soon as the wind dies down, however, your twilight-shaded bug is back into action; her four fists fizzling with electricity as the Golbat stares wide-eyed as much as its beady oculous organs can allow. With two knuckle sandwiches per wing Ledah's <b>Thunderpunch</b> hits strong and true, knocking the Golbat askew as its wings lock up from the immediate discharge of power, causing it to crash land onto the grass while Ledah proudly taps into her star-studded side. More glittering dust emanates from her five spots, surrounding her in rings of <b>Cosmic Power</b> as she gracefully hovers next to you, both of you watching as Golbat struggles to stand on its short spindly legs. For a while it doesn't seem as though Golbat is reacting at all aside from struggling, but as its eyes finally meet your gaze you feel a strange sensation of being constricted even though no neural signals have crossed your nerve endings. A check of your PokéDex confirms the phenomenon as <b>Mean Look</b>, and indeed it seems this Golbat isn't keen on letting you go anytime soon, taking to the air once more with fangs glistening from poison...</span></span>

</blockquote><i><span style="color: darkslateblue"><span style="font-size: 9px">Pepper chuckled to himself half halfheartedly. It had been some time since he'd been attacked by a vicious creature such as this golbat, but it couldn't only be that it was wild. No.. There was some peculiar about this Castle, and the surrounding grounds. Almost, mysterious. This called for further investigation. Why waste time with a Golbat when there was exploring to be done, and treasures that have been lost in time, maybe.<br />
<br />
&quot;You've done a great job, Ledah.. <b>BATON PASS</b> immediately,&quot; he commanded his Night Lit bug, in place calling out his newly recieved Scizor, Chernobyl. With a flick of a PokeBall, the metalic creature stood before him, a pokemon designed for damage. The mystical energy from Ledah's Cosmic Power consumed the Steel Bug, giving her a little bit of an advantage, but probably not as effective as Ledian.<br />
<br />
Golbat wobbled a distance away, for a while it doesn't seem as though it was reacting at all aside from struggling, but as its evil gaze finally meet his own, a strange sensation of being constricted had overcame him. A flip of his silver, outdated PokéDex confirmed the phenomenon as Mean Look, and indeed it seems this Golbat isn't keen on letting the duo go anytime soon, taking to the air once more with fangs glistening from poison.<br />
<br />

Making it an personal favorite of Kuchens, his Shadow Lickitung. &quot;Chernobyl! Use those lethal weapon's of yours you call hands and <b>SLASH</b> that Golbat through the <b>NIGHT</b>, but if it should get it's nasty fangs on you don't hesitate to give it dose of your <b>MEGA PUNCH</b>.

<b><u>Rosalina Forest</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Dark Fire</u></b><br />
Only eager to put on the pressure for the sinister opposition, your speedier teammates jump into their subsequent orders quickly. Much like he did before Plague swings into a <b>Pursuit</b>, surrounding himself with sizzling darkness and charging into the spirit, who can do little but take the accelerated hit with little more than a grunting cry. With both the other combatants out of the way Drought releases a <b>Confuse Ray</b> from her eyes; twin orbs of ghostly energy wafting towards Honchkrow and surrounding it. A mental grin is heard from Drought in your head as Honchkrow's movements become immediately uncoordinated and clumsy, barely sustaining its position in midair.<br />
<br />
Arcing in his flight pattern, Plague moves back in for his other target under your pleased, watchful eye; a claw drawn in preparation for his <b>Slash</b> manoeuvre when without warning, Haunter lunges at him surrounded by darkness of its own. A storm of pummels rains on your Scyther as Haunter watches with a malicious, vindicated gleam in its eyes; you realise with a jolt that Haunter was lying in wait for a chance to execute <b>Payback</b> on Plague if he had targeted it. Disoriented, Plague collapses into Honchkrow as the energy fades from his claw, and in a crumpled heap both fall to the ground at which you and Drought wince in unison. The thought is soon overridden while Drought performs her <b>Nasty Plot</b>, and almost at once you bring a hand to your head as the Ninetales' dark plans fill your mind, Plague staggering to his feet in the meanwhile and moving towards the two of you.<br />
<br />
&lt;<i>...!</i>&gt;<br />
<br />
As the sensation of impending danger hits you Drought pushes you aside with her front paws; Plague swinging his bladed arms across her chest in a wild <b>Fury Cutter</b>. &lt;<i><b>Psycho Shift</b>!</i>&gt; Drought half-shrieks into your head, more from surprise than hurt as her natural resistances weaken the damage from the Bug-type move, &lt;<i>Honchkrow must've cast it while its mind was still clear within confusion!</i>&gt; Sure enough, you cast a glance at Honchkrow to see it otherwise fine, once again rising to the air with a confident caw. Joining with Haunter it flaps its wings, combining strength with its ghostly colleague to fire a combined blast of <b>Ominous Wind</b> at Drought. Seethingly the fiery fox releases her <b>Psychic</b> power outwards, clashing with the sweeping zephyrs of worlds beyond, but the boost to her special offence proves the stronger investment in the end. Spread outwards, the neurological attack knocks into both Haunter and Honchkrow; while the energy passes into both only Haunter seems affected by the blast, as Honchkrow's Dark-type nullifies the technique's effects completely.<br />
<br />
&lt;<i>What now?</i>&gt; asks Drought, and you can hear the concern in her voice. While Haunter looks a considerable bit more damaged, Honchkrow remains a rather irksome threat; in the meantime both your Pokémon are starting to tire slightly from their combinations, Plague being a greater concern as he idly starts scraping at a nearby tree...<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>Moonlit Garden</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Thunder Punch</u></b><br />
Opting for a relatively recent acquisition that specialised in offence, you call for a tactical retreat from Ledah, the latter instantly spiralling back into her Net Ball while leaving behind a shimmering <b>Baton</b>, holding her boosts to <b>Pass</b> onto the next Pokémon to take her place. Sure enough, Chernobyl the Scizor flashes into view with the passing of another instant, taking the defence increments as they flicker around her body, adding to the metal armour encasing her. Screeching in bloodlust Golbat comes crashing down, but by the time it makes contact it realises its folly far too late, for not only did Chernobyl resist the effects of its <b>Poison Fang</b> the armour meant that freeing itself was, and is, a difficult endeavour. With her enemy at laughably close range Chernobyl brings a <b>Mega Punch</b> right into Golbat's mouth, brutally gashing it while knocking it clear from your Scizor's shoulder, but as it quickly regains its bearings you find that if anything, Golbat seemed more startled than hurt. This observation seems to be reinforced as Golbat charges in a <b>Wing Attack</b>, smacking Chernobyl by her head and slamming her to the ground in one swoop; drawing clods of dirt as she crumples.<br />
<br />
Defiantly, Chernobyl takes to the air once again, rushing into Golbat as she trails <b>Fury Cutter</b> after <b>Fury Cutter</b> in the space just above its eyes, but even with the attachment of the Werewolf Claws it becomes clear that Golbat's dual resistance to the insect element is resulting in little damage being done if at all. A stunning shriek is heard overhead, and before you know it Chernobyl falls to the ground again in another clang; an <b>Astonish</b>ed look across her face...</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: chartreuse"><div style="text-align: center"><b><u>Nelde Ruins</u></b>&#8203;</div><br />
<b><u>Wiese Forest</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Excessive Spare Time</u></b><br />
&quot;Cyclic time... that certainly sounds like a solid observation, given what we have to work with. Not that it appears to pass in this confounded forest anyway, but let's not waste time.&quot; Looking at the shadows of the trees overhead, Duessel takes a while to affirm the proper cardinal directions before referring to your diagram once again. &quot;East... that would be the direction from whence we came.&quot; Performing an about turn, the whistling man marches on with everyone else in tow, all hopeful that soon enough you'll be out of the woods, figuratively and literally.<br />
<br />
...Or at least, the sentiment holds on as hard as you try, but with the passing of an hour in continuous walking you find your optimism wane considerably. Volante and Cormag, both exhausted from the perpetual flapping of wings, have taken to roosting on the shoulders of their respective trainers, and even Torchlight has found her spot nestled in your arms; her little legs too tuckered out to sustain any more walking.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Hold it.&quot; Raising a hand, Duessel's voice brings you to a halt as the tone of unease in his voice alerts you. Now that you've stopped focusing on the mindless trek onwards you take a better look at your surroundings, and somewhat to your surprise the landscape has indeed changed from an analogous sea of reds and oranges to vividly blossoming flowers. &quot;Aren't we supposed to be heading towards summer? But... this looks like <i>spring</i> to me, don't you think so, Miss?&quot; It takes a while before both of you develop the same, shared look of agonised realisation that comes with the awkwardness of a mistake committed; the fact that you've not seen any other change, event or development from the non-stop walk for over an hour a certain testament that something has gone wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuzleaf! Nuzleaf!&quot; Before either of you can say anything in light of your plight, unwelcome company makes itself known as a pair of bipedal creatures, each sporting a differently sized leaf atop their heads, leap down from the fields of flora above you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Drat. Certainly not the best timing,&quot; mutters Duessel; Cormag cawing excitedly as he takes flight from the man's shoulder. &quot;But I don't think we'll be advancing much of anywhere for a while... Ready to defend yourself, Miss?&quot;</span></span></div>

</blockquote><i><span style="color: DarkSlateBlue"><span style="font-size: 9px"><br />
It was clear that ordering Chernobyl to use Fury Cutter, an attack that had nearly no effect on the giant Bat, was a mistake that shouldn't have happened in the first place. Pepper flipped open his pokedex once again, this time reading what little information it had on type advantages. After reading, he looked up at Chernobyl and frowned. His newly traded partner had very little attacks that would be super effective on Golbat, but he had to make do with what he was dealt. With all this power she possessed, perhaps they'd be able to work something out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Up on your feet Chernobyl theres no time for rest, and when you prepared, stun Golbat with your <b>BULLET PUNCH</b> giving you time to get out as fast as possible. Then to give you some extra cover, use your <b>BUBBLE BEAM</b>. Golbat wouldn't dare try flying through that mess. Then lets play roulette with luck and try out a <b>METRONOME</b>.&quot; Pepper smiled at his partner, and Scizor nodded and turned her attention on her enemy. &quot;Good luck.&quot; he whispered.<br />
<br />
His mind began to wander about his choice in location as he watched his Scizor focus on the opponent in front of them. Pepper had complete confidence in Chernobyl, which was new feeling to him. Looking down at his belt at the assortment of pokeball's adorning it, he had finally trained some powerful pokemon he could be proud of. Slaking, being his favorite. If things go according to plan, there might be a possible chance he'd be called upon soon.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder if there <i>IS</i> more than meets the eye...&quot; he quietly mused to himself when suddenly his attention was drawn to the castle that he avoided from the start. This could have been fate pushing him away from something that could possibly unleash havoc upon Lacrima. Or it could just be a real old castle with dirty old people jumping from behinds doors. The Diddled smirked. He hadn't really had a chance to spend much time with his psychic type and this was a perfect opportunity. His hand moved from the pokéball in his hand to another one next to it. With a flash of light the ball opened to release a silver haired fox. Another one of his squad members that had unusual coloring. Pepper smiled.<br />
<br />
He pressed his fingers to his lips, motioning for Pathos to keep quiet. And the battle continued.</span></span></i></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslateblue"><b><u>Dark Fire</u></b><br />
Only eager to put on the pressure for the sinister opposition, your speedier teammates jump into their subsequent orders quickly. Much like he did before Plague swings into a <b>Pursuit</b>, surrounding himself with sizzling darkness and charging into the spirit, who can do little but take the accelerated hit with little more than a grunting cry. With both the other combatants out of the way Drought releases a <b>Confuse Ray</b> from her eyes; twin orbs of ghostly energy wafting towards Honchkrow and surrounding it. A mental grin is heard from Drought in your head as Honchkrow's movements become immediately uncoordinated and clumsy, barely sustaining its position in midair.<br />
<br />
Arcing in his flight pattern, Plague moves back in for his other target under your pleased, watchful eye; a claw drawn in preparation for his <b>Slash</b> manoeuvre when without warning, Haunter lunges at him surrounded by darkness of its own. A storm of pummels rains on your Scyther as Haunter watches with a malicious, vindicated gleam in its eyes; you realise with a jolt that Haunter was lying in wait for a chance to execute <b>Payback</b> on Plague if he had targeted it. Disoriented, Plague collapses into Honchkrow as the energy fades from his claw, and in a crumpled heap both fall to the ground at which you and Drought wince in unison. The thought is soon overridden while Drought performs her <b>Nasty Plot</b>, and almost at once you bring a hand to your head as the Ninetales' dark plans fill your mind, Plague staggering to his feet in the meanwhile and moving towards the two of you.<br />
<br />
&lt;<i>...!</i>&gt;<br />
<br />
As the sensation of impending danger hits you Drought pushes you aside with her front paws; Plague swinging his bladed arms across her chest in a wild <b>Fury Cutter</b>. &lt;<i><b>Psycho Shift</b>!</i>&gt; Drought half-shrieks into your head, more from surprise than hurt as her natural resistances weaken the damage from the Bug-type move, &lt;<i>Honchkrow must've cast it while its mind was still clear within confusion!</i>&gt; Sure enough, you cast a glance at Honchkrow to see it otherwise fine, once again rising to the air with a confident caw. Joining with Haunter it flaps its wings, combining strength with its ghostly colleague to fire a combined blast of <b>Ominous Wind</b> at Drought. Seethingly the fiery fox releases her <b>Psychic</b> power outwards, clashing with the sweeping zephyrs of worlds beyond, but the boost to her special offence proves the stronger investment in the end. Spread outwards, the neurological attack knocks into both Haunter and Honchkrow; while the energy passes into both only Haunter seems affected by the blast, as Honchkrow's Dark-type nullifies the technique's effects completely.<br />
<br />
&lt;<i>What now?</i>&gt; asks Drought, and you can hear the concern in her voice. While Haunter looks a considerable bit more damaged, Honchkrow remains a rather irksome threat; in the meantime both your Pokémon are starting to tire slightly from their combinations, Plague being a greater concern as he idly starts scraping at a nearby tree...</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: DarkSlateBlue"><span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua'">&quot;Plague? What are you doing?&quot; Rayne yelled, watching as his Scyther unleashed the Fury Cutter attack on his team mate. Drought quickly informed Rayne of what had occured there. &quot;These guys are no pushovers ...&quot; He concluded. <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;... What now? ...&gt;</i> asked Drought, sounding more concerned than she had initially. Rayne analysed the situation quickly, and it was not looking great. Plague took a serious beating from that boosted Payback attack, and walked out of that exchange confused from an attack that was not aimed at him. Drought was considerably better, but clealy fatigue was beginning to set in. A change in tactics was necessary Rayne figured ...<br />
<br />
<i>&lt;... Focus on the Haunter. Let's knock it out and then worry about that damned bird. God, I hate those birds. Anyway. Let's kick that special attack of yours another notch with one more <span style="color: Black"><b>Nasty Plot</b></span>, then <span style="color: Plum"><b>Psychic</b></span>. If it survives that, <span style="color: White"><b>Disable</b></span> it quickly in case it's planning another vengeful attack ...&gt;</i><br />
<br />
<i>&lt;... Sure ...&gt;</i> was her response. <i>&lt;... What about Plague ? ...&gt;</i><br />
<br />
<i>&lt;... Don't worry about him. Focus on your part, I'll do my best to get him back ...&gt;</i>. How he was going to do it, he was not yet sure.<br />
<br />
&quot;PLAGUE! FOCUS! STOP DICKING AROUND! USE <span style="color: Plum"><b>AGILITY</b></span>!&quot; Rayne screamed, hoping that would maybe work. Just to be safe he did not order any offensive moves, for Drought's sake. Rayne was justing hoping he could at least eliminate the Haunter from this contest, and swing the odds in his directions.</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslateblue"><div style="text-align: center"><b><u>Lacrima Castle</u></b>&#8203;</div><br />
<b><u>Rosalina Forest</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Dark Fire</u></b><br />
With Plague temporarily put out of commission as far as steamrolling the enemy is concern, you focus efforts onto Drought in an attempt to, at least, bring Haunter out of the equation. Now more determined than ever Drought unleashes another onslaught of <b>Nasty Plot</b>, sending a winceworthy wave of thuds through your head while her temporary intelligence rises with her special capability. Looking aside, you spot her eyes blaze in fury and power, but all of a sudden two bolts of dark energy swing into her, slashing across her fur as she screams before rising and revealing themselves as Haunter and Honchkrow.<br />
<br />
&lt;<i>You'll pay for that!</i>&gt; You hear Drought screech through your head, none too pleased at the pair of pre-emptive <b>Sucker Punch</b>es that she received, and with a resounding explosion of <b>Psychic</b> prowess she nails Haunter in a single, ferocious strike. Without so much as even a gasp Haunter crumples to the forest floor; a series of purple flames lifting from its ethereal form, joined by several pulses of red light as it sinks through the soil. As you realise Haunter won't be resurfacing any time soon, you are alerted as Drought paws at you alarmedly; tapping your head you find that you can no longer feel any psychic relay from your Ninetales. Glancing where Haunter last fell, you realise that the purple flames must have resulted from Haunter's <b>Grudge</b> sealing away Drought's powers with its defeat.<br />
<br />
Your thoughts are interrupted rudely, however, when Honchkrow suddenly dives in, smacking Drought to her face in a doubled dose of <b>Assurance</b> for the damage she took earlier. Cawing in crazed triumph, the Big Boss Pokémon nearly veers back for another strike when Plague -- who had for the most part continued to whittle against his new favourite tree -- suddenly darts in like a malfunctioning aeroplane from his dizzying <b>Agility</b>. Disrupted by the move, it becomes Honchkrow's turn to be surprised when Plague crashlands into its side, bringing both of them down for a second crash against the ground, both of them stumbling to recover. Meeting eyes with Plague's, you find that the disorientation has disappeared from his countenance, and together he joins Drought as they glare at the seething raven...<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>Moonlit Garden</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Sock</u></b><br />
Few of the odds, if any at all, are skewed towards your Pokémon and her powers, and even as you call for more orders she simply lies there <b>flinch</b>ed from the stunning attack she took earlier. A piercing <b>Screech</b> issued from Golbat's wide mouth has everyone going for their ears in an attempt to block out the sheer dissonance, and with her defences wide open Golbat dives in with its head gleaming with brilliant psychic power. Knocked askew by the <b>Zen Headbutt</b>, it takes Chernobyl a considerable bit to recover before she opens her pincers, launching streams of <b>Bubblebeam</b> that float towards the offending bat, popping almost harmlessly against the venomous beast's wings. A raucous series of laughter, echoing even in the open air of the garden, rings through before Golbat dives in once more...<br />
<br />
&quot;Take <i>that</i>!&quot;<br />
<br />
Out of everything you might have expected, you might consider this one of the least likely of scenarios: in just slightly baggy adventurer's robes a figure comes lunging out of the shrubbery and vegetation behind you, clutching a gleaming pole in his hand. The light sparking off his weapon is reflected in his inexplicable gaze, full of mysterious determination and stalwart purpose. With a curt grunt he swings the object across the air, the back end nearly taking your eye out as it arcs, and with a thud the opposing Golbat is slammed against the castle wall, crumpling into a heap. Getting to its feet the bloodsucker cries indignantly, but as your unlikely saviour glares on it eventually gives up, hissing dejectedly before taking off into the sky.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that's over... what are <i>you</i> doing here?&quot; he growls, turning around and frowning at you with his dark eyes in apparent annoyance and accusation. A ragged cloak in a shade of red that makes you think of blood lines his neck, his hair a mess of brown with spikes and fringe, but what you definitely don't want to argue with is his poised lance; sharpened into a lightning bolt shape at both ends that almost hurts to look at. &quot;Lacrima Castle's no tourist attraction. And is that supposed to be an outfit, or are you trying to look like Pokémon bait?&quot; It doesn't sound like this stranger's altogether happy at all, to say the least, much less about you...</span></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DarkSlateBlue">It seemed that the confidence he had in her battling abilities were falsely deserved and additional training was needed. The Golbat made Chernobyl's Bubble Beam look like mere soap suds in a wash bucket. Pepper swore under his breath, grinding his teeth in annoyance. Adding insult to injury the winged beast's ribald laughter grinded his last gear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take that!&quot;<br />
<br />
From out of the blue a Red Cloaked bushmen charged forth an swung a mighty lance at the vicious creature, sending him crashing into the castle walls. His laughter was soon replaced with muzzled growling. Admitting defeat the golbat fled the scene, leaving the diddler with this unknown stranger wielding a very intimating weapon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that's over... what are you doing here?&quot; he growled, turning around and frowning at Pepper with his dark eyes in apparent annoyance and accusation. <i>'One thing for sure, don't get on this guy's bad side.'</i> he made a mental note. &quot;Lacrima Castle's no tourist attraction. And is that supposed to be an outfit, or are you trying to look like Pokémon bait?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;P-please.. P-p-pardon the intrusion,&quot; he studered as he took notice of the eye-poping attire he had been wearing, barely able to keep a constant eye contact with the stranger as he glanced back up. &quot;Aahhh I thought this would be the most weather appropriate thing for this region. I'm <i>Sorry</i> if it doesn't meet your standards, buddy.&quot; Pepper gulped, regretting the snappy outburst he just made. A single swipe of that pointy stick could slit his throat and leaving him bleeding out in seconds. Quickly changing the subject from fashion to explanation, &quot;Ahehe.. You see.. I'm a junior researcher for Professor Klump of Seaside's Pokemon Institute.&quot; Lying came as a second nature to the diddler, though most often had many holes in the stories told. &quot;You see, I'm studying the effects ancient structures have on the wild inhabitants compared to those that live in Seaside.&quot; <br />
<br />
Forgetting that both Chernobyl and Pathos were still out of the field he quickly withdrew his Steel Bug and scooped the Psychic Fox tightly in his arms, who quickly struggled out of his grasp and swung himself around to his trainers back. All this releasing and withdrawing was giving him whiplash, and should prepare would the worst. Knowing Pathos would be scanning his thoughts, <i>'<b>TELEPORT</b> us a safe distance away if this stranger should attack.'</i><br />
<br />
Pepper's eyes remained set into a heavy glare upon the cloaked savior before him, the mans questionable nature having rubbed him up the wrong way. If information was to be found he looked like the fellow to withhold it. “And just who might you be, huh? You wouldn't happen to know any of the history behind this place... would you?” The trainer intrigued, unknowningly as the man as stood before them, chirping as Pathos giggled. “I-i-f you're think you're gonna kill me you better thing twice! People know where I am you know! People who enjoy my company!” Pepper warned as he stepped forward, ready to hear what answers if any the stranger would present.<br />
<br />
The Diddler's true intentions were to uncover a hidden power rumored to be sealed within the castle itself, leaving much needed investigation. If this man proves of worth, maybe he'd be able to persuade him into guiding him right to the jackpot. God hoping he falls for his stuttering fool act...</span><br />

&quot;Your Swampert? Ah, yes. We saw him succeed barely in discouraging the Tentacruel from attacking further, but such is the nature of the <b>Roar</b> technique. Although, the local jellyfish have been known to be undeterred in their hunts and territorial fights; such a tactic is not likely to always work. Be aware that not all adversaries will be capable of being dissuaded,&quot; warns Eriden. &quot;As for your Swampert, we managed to identify the -- PokéBall in which he would otherwise be kept in, and retrieved him before he risked further injury.&quot; You note for a moment that Eriden had to visibly struggle a little before breaking the pause in his sentence; an expression of distaste as he speaks the word.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you would look for a Pokémon that affects memory, however, I'm afraid we have no such information that might help you. Psychic Pokémon in particular naturally possess a wide range of abilities; perhaps it would better serve your purposes if you searched --&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Information? Why not bring him to the Library, Eriden?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seroba! We do not speak of such things to outsiders.&quot; Harshly interrupting, the half-Walrein glares at his associate, now taken to performing underwater somersaults playfully. &quot;You know as well as I do the city does not look kindly upon trespassers, and that includes us!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, come on, Eriden! I don't think he's like the others; those who came to Tetyth only to plunder.&quot; Smiling serenely at you, Seroba seems to size you up before continuing, &quot;And besides, you never know! We might find something relevant to his queries!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You forget that likewise, we cannot guarantee that any search will prove useful. In which case we would simply expose this adventurer and ourselves to needless danger.&quot; Sighing, Eriden addresses you once again. &quot;Jamie, was it? I suppose that given circumstances, we can offer... assistance, if you will, in your personal quest. In your present state it would be foolish to mount an expedition into Tetyth's limits alone, although I am still of the opinion your exertions will not lead to fruition here. Whether to retreat or to push forward, we leave the choice to you. Whichever your selection we will honour your decision and see you through these depths unharmed.&quot;<br />
<br />
What will you choose to do?</span>[/size]

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: aqua">As the trainer listened to the Walrein-man's words, he felt a slight wave of relief knowing that Wraith had been successful in deterring the Tentacruel, though the note that others won't be so easy to remove set his heart down a bit. What truly gave him the feeling of guilt, however, was the way Eriden spoke of the Swampert's housing: As a part-pokemon, the thought of touching an object harnessed for the capture and containment of like species may have been unfavourable for him, much like the mess that his Zangoose was wont to leave on that particular corner of his base, Jamie mused to himself before snapping back to reality. Returning to the conversation at hand, Seroba's interruption gave him all the information required: That the subaquatic city of Tetyth wasn't myth, and that there was a library located within. The response from the Aquaman, however, was one that wasn't of great favour, the being snapping harshly at the cheerful Azumarrilady.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know as well as I do that the city does not look kindly upon trespassers, and that includes us!&quot;<br />
<br />
The idea of the two not being native to the city took him by mild surprise, as Jamie had thought them to be residents of the underwater city, and as Eriden gave him the option to either venture into the city with guarantee of information, or to head back and search elsewhere, he took a few moments to consider this situation.<br />
<br />
'<i>Tetyth has a library, that much is confirmed, yet the thought that the people of the city dislike intruders, especially thieves, attenuates to the difficulty. However, Seroba seems to be quite enthusiastic about going, while Eriden is quite reluctant. Perhaps a personal loss in the city? Nevertheless, I came here searching for answers, and won't be leaving without them.</i>'<br />
<br />
Opening his eyes once more, Jamie turned to the hybrids, a firm nod as he gave his answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if there's no answer in the city, the prospect of seeing the place itself or finding something out that'l help get me information will be of great help. I'm not in this for profit, for greed only leads to ruin. I'll be happy to accept your aid, but remember to keep yourselves safe as well, and not just me. Oh, and sorry about the pokeball thing, Eriden, I just never expected to be sent flying off my Swampert when he charged.&quot;</span></span></div>

&quot;Cyclic time... that certainly sounds like a solid observation, given what we have to work with. Not that it appears to pass in this confounded forest anyway, but let's not waste time.&quot; Looking at the shadows of the trees overhead, Duessel takes a while to affirm the proper cardinal directions before referring to your diagram once again. &quot;East... that would be the direction from whence we came.&quot; Performing an about turn, the whistling man marches on with everyone else in tow, all hopeful that soon enough you'll be out of the woods, figuratively and literally.<br />
<br />
...Or at least, the sentiment holds on as hard as you try, but with the passing of an hour in continuous walking you find your optimism wane considerably. Volante and Cormag, both exhausted from the perpetual flapping of wings, have taken to roosting on the shoulders of their respective trainers, and even Torchlight has found her spot nestled in your arms; her little legs too tuckered out to sustain any more walking.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Hold it.&quot; Raising a hand, Duessel's voice brings you to a halt as the tone of unease in his voice alerts you. Now that you've stopped focusing on the mindless trek onwards you take a better look at your surroundings, and somewhat to your surprise the landscape has indeed changed from an analogous sea of reds and oranges to vividly blossoming flowers. &quot;Aren't we supposed to be heading towards summer? But... this looks like <i>spring</i> to me, don't you think so, Miss?&quot; It takes a while before both of you develop the same, shared look of agonised realisation that comes with the awkwardness of a mistake committed; the fact that you've not seen any other change, event or development from the non-stop walk for over an hour a certain testament that something has gone wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuzleaf! Nuzleaf!&quot; Before either of you can say anything in light of your plight, unwelcome company makes itself known as a pair of bipedal creatures, each sporting a differently sized leaf atop their heads, leap down from the fields of flora above you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Drat. Certainly not the best timing,&quot; mutters Duessel; Cormag cawing excitedly as he takes flight from the man's shoulder. &quot;But I don't think we'll be advancing much of anywhere for a while... Ready to defend yourself, Miss?&quot;</span></span>

She was dealing with native animals, and, for all she knew, she was going to double over and barf halfway through... again. She gulped, tugged at her collar, and called out Volante and Grinder, her Aipom. She knew that Volante had the type advantage, and she thought that Grinder could stand to see some more action... &quot;All right. The bad news is, we have us another enemy. The good news is that I'm pretty sure we'll get to keep our lunch. But we gotta act fast, okay? Volante? Sand-attack twice, then fly at the one with the big leaf. Grinder, Sand-attack once, then scratch at the smaller-leafed one. We've got us a mission to clear...&quot;</span></span></div>

With Plague temporarily put out of commission as far as steamrolling the enemy is concern, you focus efforts onto Drought in an attempt to, at least, bring Haunter out of the equation. Now more determined than ever Drought unleashes another onslaught of <b>Nasty Plot</b>, sending a winceworthy wave of thuds through your head while her temporary intelligence rises with her special capability. Looking aside, you spot her eyes blaze in fury and power, but all of a sudden two bolts of dark energy swing into her, slashing across her fur as she screams before rising and revealing themselves as Haunter and Honchkrow.<br />
<br />
&lt;<i>You'll pay for that!</i>&gt; You hear Drought screech through your head, none too pleased at the pair of pre-emptive <b>Sucker Punch</b>es that she received, and with a resounding explosion of <b>Psychic</b> prowess she nails Haunter in a single, ferocious strike. Without so much as even a gasp Haunter crumples to the forest floor; a series of purple flames lifting from its ethereal form, joined by several pulses of red light as it sinks through the soil. As you realise Haunter won't be resurfacing any time soon, you are alerted as Drought paws at you alarmedly; tapping your head you find that you can no longer feel any psychic relay from your Ninetales. Glancing where Haunter last fell, you realise that the purple flames must have resulted from Haunter's <b>Grudge</b> sealing away Drought's powers with its defeat.<br />
<br />
Your thoughts are interrupted rudely, however, when Honchkrow suddenly dives in, smacking Drought to her face in a doubled dose of <b>Assurance</b> for the damage she took earlier. Cawing in crazed triumph, the Big Boss Pokémon nearly veers back for another strike when Plague -- who had for the most part continued to whittle against his new favourite tree -- suddenly darts in like a malfunctioning aeroplane from his dizzying <b>Agility</b>. Disrupted by the move, it becomes Honchkrow's turn to be surprised when Plague crashlands into its side, bringing both of them down for a second crash against the ground, both of them stumbling to recover. Meeting eyes with Plague's, you find that the disorientation has disappeared from his countenance, and together he joins Drought as they glare at the seething raven...</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: DarkSlateBlue"><span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua'">Rayne could tell Drought’s anger was reaching a boiling point, and he liked it. Any time Drought could channel her thoughts into her attacks, the recipient of the attack was most certainly in for a painful experience. Knowing this, he watched in glee as his Ninetales executed another one of her nasty plots. The images that rushed his head were far from pleasant; in fact they nauseated him slightly, but he wanted to be rid of these pests … fast. His head started tingling as Drought began preparing her psychic attack, but it was quickly interrupted as both Haunter and Honchkrow swooped in with a pair of sucker punches. This tag team ability of the pair of pokemon was rather impressive, and he knew that he had to separate them. <br />
<br />
The tingling in his head returned, much more intense, much angrier; and then she unleashed it. The psychic energy ripped through the air, and nailed Haunter. Instantly the ghost pokemon crumpled and collapsed to the forest floor. The ghost pokemon burst into purple flames, followed by a burst of red light. As odd as that was, Rayne did not pay it much attention, until Drought ran up to him and clawed him gently.<br />
<br />
“Grudge!? Is that what the fireworks was about?” Even after being knocked out this Haunter found a way to haunt his Ninetales. Impressive. Sort of made Rayne want to capture the ghost pokemon, but seeing as it had soaked into the ground, it wasn’t going to happen. Just as Drought turned around to return her attention to the battle, the Honchkrow swooped in with a boosted Assurance attack. The bird felt pretty confident with itself as it cackled to itself … when Plague appeared out of nowhere to ram the crow to the ground, returning the favour from earlier. <br />
<br />
“Plague! That was awesome. You alright?” Rayne asked. The mantis pokemon nodded as he pushed himself to his feet, the confusion that glazed his eyes now gone. “Alright. Well let’s finish this pesky crow off guys. Plague, charge a <span style="color: White"><b>Razor Wind</b></span>. While he’s doing that, Drought fry the bird with your boosted <span style="color: DarkOrange"><b>Flamethrower</b></span>. After Plague unleashes his attack, and you’re out of harm’s way use <span style="color: White"><b>Quick Attack</b></span> to pick up enough speed to leap up and combo into a <span style="color: White"><b>Body Slam</b></span>. Plague, finish your turn off with a <span style="color: Gray"><b>Wing Attack</b></span>.” Rayne was hoping to wrap this fight off. He felt confident, that they had the edge now.</span></span></div>

Having turned the tables around into a two-against-one situation, you're only more determined than ever to overcome this obstacle with your trusted teammates. Leaving her comrade spinning aside, the now mentally mute Drought blasts forth a raging <b>Flamethrower</b> from her mouth, but with a screech Honchkrow raises its wings from its perched position. A <b>Heat Wave</b> rushes forth from the pyrokinetically charged feathers, prickling your skin with experiences of scorching warmth as fire attack meets fire attack, but it doesn't take long for Drought to prove her control over fire is superior. As Honchkrow shrieks from the flames, Plague slices his <b>Razor Wind</b> at his target, causing a localised explosion as the hardened, focused air cuts into the blast of heat.<br />
<br />
Picking up on the opening, both Drought and Plague dart towards the shady raven; Drought relying on her <b>Quick Attack</b> to match with Plague's speedier agility, before the two of them crash in unison onto the Honchkrow. Left with barely enough time to squawk, Honchkrow is left lifeless on the ground as Drought and Plague leap back to admire their combined handiwork. A spray of red sparks, reminiscent of those Haunter had left behind earlier, catches your attention before the bird's body is consumed in the mysterious energy, and as the crimson blips dissipate into the night sky you're shocked to see nothing left behind on the ground. <b>Level-up for Drought and Plague</b>.<br />
<br />
&lt;<i>It's nothing like I've ever seen before.</i>&gt; Briefly startled by the return of Drought's voice, you realise the conclusion of battle lifted the seal on her mental energy. &lt;<i>Those Pokémon were alive, but... it was as though they were possessed, or poisoned, and were corrupted from within... Could it be that red light?</i>&gt; Reminded of the phenomena that had taken Haunter and Honchkrow in their defeat, you can't help but wonder if you haven't stumbled upon the tip of a very, very sinister iceberg, but as it is you still have very little information to work with. Leading the way you advance towards the house in the middle of the forest clearing, and as your fingers meet the wooden door it slowly swings open like a dying man stretching out on his deathbed.<br />
<br />
A powerful, rotting stench reaches your nose, causing the three of you to instinctively cringe for a moment before you gingerly step into the room. Bits of bodies far too broken and damaged to ascertain their identity lie in various piles in the dilapidated abode like grotesque decorations, spattered with faded papers and dangerously sharp shards of what appears to be scientific equipment. Bloodstains and other fluids streak across the walls not lined with dishevelled bookcases, and every now and then you spot deep scars of unknown origin dug into the floor, so deep you can almost feel the impact left behind. All in all, along with the distinct signs of violent struggle, you feel the strong stench of death emanate from the house, and even Drought and Plague move about more edgily than usual.<br />
<br /> 
&quot;I'm honoured... you could come.&quot;<br />
<br />
The voice, while little more than a whisper, seems to break the apprehension in your mind like a shattering mirror, drawing your attention to the furthest end of the cottage where a tattered workbench stands. Bright twinkles of power, manifesting out of nothing, gather above the table, eventually forming the figure of a brunette woman; her flowing hair suspended beautifully along her sparkling dress of white, her deep green eyes shining at the sight of you but also holding a profound sense of sadness within.<br />
<br />
&quot;Evelyn,&quot; she speaks in introduction, &quot;And what am I to call you?...&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>Moonlit Garden</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Salad Washing</u></b><br />
<br />
&quot;Save the act, boy. You're not fooling anyone with that story of yours,&quot; sighs the stranger, and as he rolls his eyes you're somewhat relieved to find he's more bemused than angry. &quot;And where would you expect to go on that Abra of yours? Elsewhere on this island, to be sampled by another local specimen of feral wildlife? The way I've seen you make decisions, you'll end up doing more harm to yourself than I ever intended.&quot; While you find that you can't appreciate the attitude of this man, the good news is, at least, he bears no ill will towards you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ogden. Patrick Ogden,&quot; he introduces gruffly. &quot;Been looking for a couple of my close associates, James and Evelyn. The word is, they were last sighted headed for this island at least a decade back, and that was the last time anyone ever heard of them since I lost contact with them twenty years ago. The folks in Rivieria warned me not to come and, while I'm not particularly worried about my safety, I've found no sign that anyone's lived here long-term, at least not for at least half a century, and I can't imagine why anyone'd want to be here. The way the local variety of Pokémon are behaving just doesn't sit right; they're uncharacteristically feral even without being disturbed... I simply can't fathom why James and Evelyn would ever come here.&quot;<br />
<br />
A deep frown lining his forehead, Ogden turns his attention back to you; while no longer indiscriminately fierce you feel that for the most part he's still trying to figure you out. &quot;That's my story. I don't suppose you'd be kind enough to tell me yours?...&quot;</span><br />
<br />

<b><u>Wiese Forest</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Excessive Spare Time</u></b><br />
The premise of another battle, compounded with the certainty that you've well and truly lost your way, doesn't paint a very rosy situation for you, but nevertheless you now have a new situation that demands prompt attention. Releasing the third member of your team, you send Grinder into combat with Volante, both Aipom and Pidgey promptly kicking up a <b>Sand-Attack</b> with the abundant dirt from the forest floor. Not having expected the irritant attack both Nuzleaf cry out in surprise and indignance, wildly rubbing at their faces while Volante continues to kick up a second dose of her <b>Sand-Attack</b>.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cormag, go for it! Strike the male Nuzleaf with your <b>Drill Peck</b>!&quot; calls Duessel, and as Volante arcs into the air the Murkrow dives at the Nuzleaf with the larger leaf on its head, spinning like a miniature tornado as he slams his beak into the Wily Pokémon's chest, soon followed by Volante as she <b>Fli</b>es past its head, slashing at him with her talons. Aside, Grinder tears at the other Nuzleaf, jumping on her head agilely as he <b>Scratch</b>es her all over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuzleaf!&quot; Holding their hands to their craniums, both Nuzleaf appear to cringe when you notice the sunlight above reflecting off a light sheen on their bodies. &quot;<b>Harden</b>, eh? Missy, call your Pokémon back for now.&quot; At Duessel's suggestion, you gesture to Grinder and Volante to fall back from their close range, as Cormag flies about them to face the Nuzleaf from afar. &quot;<b>Icy Wind</b>, Cormag!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Krow murkrow!&quot; Waving his wings, Cormag launches a wave of freezing air and snowflakes at both enemies, and a smile lights everyone's faces as rime begins to form across the Nuzleaf's woody dermic layers, slowing down any further movement that might come. Far too soon, however, both Nuzleaf rear their heads as their leaves spiral about, launching a combined <b>Razor Leaf</b> that slices at your skin along with everyone else. Looks like these two won't go down easy...</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: aqua"><div style="text-align: center"><b><u>Tetyth City</u></b>&#8203;</div><br />
<b><u>Tetyth Lake Depths</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Cod of War</u></b><br />
&quot;Think nothing of it, Jamie. It's not something we expect outsiders to immediately appreciate or grasp. We seek only to assist others on their way, not to judge those ways.&quot; Clearing his throat, Eriden continues, &quot; Now that the local Tentacruel have been possibly alerted we have to prepare ourselves for any potential assault, and there are few of us who can traverse both underwater and above it; even fewer are willing to wade near the waters around the ruined city. For certain if you had been travelling with other human companions we would have to escort you away from Tetyth Lake posthaste, but we can aid your quest as we see fit. We will, however, not allow you to commit anything we deem as potentially detrimental to our community, to our own discretion; as it is we might come under swift retaliation now that the Tentacruel population might have been alerted. Still, I suppose the two of us would not constitute an overly negative result to our defences, while hopefully providing adequate protection for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So that's settled then, Eriden? You could always have told him yes, y'know,&quot; pouts Seroba, before she gigglingly takes you by the hand. The soft, supple feel of her fingers surrounds your palm as she begins kicking upwards, lifting you off the bed of marble. Soon enough you find yourself being pulled along for a ride through the lake waters, allowing you to take in the sights of the underwater settlement of hybrids. Various families of half human, half Pokémon bustle amongst houses constructed of rock, coral and marble, and every so often you spot droves of children merrily swimming in playful frolics, kicking their fishtails energetically as they chase each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're he-ere!&quot; Seroba announces in a sing-song voice, as you break the water's surface a split second later. Lifted onto a series of stepping stones, you feel Seroba's protective bubble pop as your foot is raised out of the water, giving you a few moments to catch your land-legs back as Eriden points ahead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Carnea. From the outer district we'll have to find a way inside,&quot; notes Eriden. Wading to the edge where water gives way to stone, the two locals heft themselves onto the ruined marble on their lower Pokémon limbs; even with apparent familiarity to terra firma you note that Eriden's flippered abdomen and Seroba's feet won't be making for a very quick journey in comparison to you...<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like we're not alone.&quot; As Eriden raises his arm halting your advances, you spot movement from the ruined buildings ahead. Clicking its smaller pincer a Kingler crawls out of its hiding place, waving its larger claw at you threateningly while an Octillery slithers up from a pothole in the road; neither appears happy to see the three of you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seroba! Secure the rear end!&quot; Eriden calls, as ice begins to surround his hands, forming a helmet shaped exactly like a Walrein's cranium, complete with crests of frozen froth which he places on his head. &quot;I hope you're ready to do battle, Jamie...&quot;</span></span></div>
