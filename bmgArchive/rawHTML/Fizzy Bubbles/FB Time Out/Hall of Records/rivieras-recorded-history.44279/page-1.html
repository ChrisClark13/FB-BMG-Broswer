<div class="bbWrapper"><div style="text-align: center"><b><span style="font-size: 12px">RIVIERA</span></b>&#8203;</div><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px">Many millenia ago, it is said, gods and demons clashed in a legendary war known in the annals as Ragnarok. Earth was thrown into chaos by the violence that ensued, and the army of the deathly dimension began to encroach on the boundaries of Heaven itself, threatening to overthrow it completely and forever plunge the world into permanent darkness and despair. With this threat in mind, it is recorded that the gods proceeded to break an ancient covenant for the salvation of the world -- sacrificing their power, they created embodiments of destruction known as the Grim Angels; each bearing a divine weapon with which they tore through the armies of chaos, and brought Ragnarok to its end.<br />
<br />
Drained of their omnipotent might, the gods were said to have left the remains of their power within the realm of Riviera where the critical clash between the Grim Angels and demons took place, and entrusted its inhabitants to safeguard the land forevermore, until the day of the gods' return. In time, Riviera became a natural wilderness, where hardy adventurers and explorers journey to in attempts to seek out the mysteries of the land -- with some help of Flying or Surfing Pokémon, or the occasional helpful boatman for a one-way trip, as no other vessels make scheduled stopovers at the wild environment.<br />
<br />
Little else remains of Riviera's history, and in present day, few know of the legend behind the island's past. Even amongst those who still believe in it, few know of the truth behind the power that was said to be locked deep inside Riviera: should the need arise to defend the world's balance, the power of divine destruction within Riviera will be unlocked, purifying the world and taking the world out in the process...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: lemonchiffon"><b><u>Elendia</u> - please reply in lemonchiffon</b><br />
This quiet, peaceful village is all that remains of civilisation in Riviera, and is said to have stood since Ragnarok's passing. Most adventurers who come to Riviera stop by this central location as a rest stop, stocking up on energy and materials before moving on to other locations to begin their exploration. The friendly locals often dispense assistance and advice to adventurers in need, but most are unwilling to delve into information about the world outside Elendia, citing various dangers...<br />
<b>Sprite Residences</b><br />
A group of cottages constructed amongst the trees that grew in amongst the remains of a heavenly city that once stood, the Elendian families coexist here in harmony, having enjoyed the lasting peace in the region for centuries. Children play amongst the stone and wood while their parents forage the materials they need to get by. The Elder's house lies in the middle of these houses, and at the geographical centre of Elendia, where Graham the wise Elder lives and watches over the village.<br />
<b>Hobbit Smithy</b><br />
A blacksmith's workshop located a short distance away from Sprite Residences. The local blacksmith, Chappi, constructs various items from materials he finds using the Thor Hammer; the Hobbit's family's heirloom. If you bring a sliver of material here, he might be able to make something useful, if you're willing to help him collect more.<br />
<b>Crystal Caverns</b><br />
This beautiful cavern lined with crystals is where Elendia's Magic Guild has stationed themselves, where they carry out all sorts of research ranging from elemental manipulation to mythology. Within one of the caverns lies the Magic Guild's headquarters which also doubles as a library, and the members may approach you for help in locating items outside of Elendia if needed. It's also said that an ancient, magical teleportation circle lies within the labyrinth.<br />
<b>Undine Spring</b><br />
This spring, located near the forest by Sprite Residences, is a seemingly perpetual source of fresh water for the village. Sometimes the villagers congregate here to relax, and it is sometimes said that if you dig amongst the multicoloured sands around the spring, you might find fragments of the weapons used in the times of Ragnarok...<br />
<b>Grove of Repose</b><br />
A pathway surrounded by trees where the sunlight filters through softly, which leads adventurers from Elendia to the wilder areas of Riviera.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red"><b><u>Heaven's Gate</u> - please reply in red</b><br />
A desolate area cloaked in light where it is said that the Grim Angels clashed with demons for the final time, rendering the once sacred landscape barren and dilapidated. Ruins of what appear to be palaces and temples lie strewn across the rocky area, and other than stone upon marble upon metal, little else of interest exists here, save for a few prominent landmarks such as the paths of floating stones. Still, some adventurers come here occasionally for a look at Heaven's Gate's few sights, and also to chance upon finding angelic remains from centuries long past.<br />
<b>Remote Sanctuary</b><br />
A shimmering forcefield, known as the Riviera Barrier, appears to surround the area this ruined shrine, and this is where adventurers to Heaven's Gate must begin their journey from. No one has any idea why the barrier exists, but some theorise that it forms an interdimensional rift that brought the supposed heavenly passage to Riviera's soil.<br />
<b>Stone Lattice</b><br />
A network of chained stones that seem to be the only way to go deeper into the area. While some believe the strange path to be magically animated, sceptics say that the rocks possess various magnetic qualities, forming a series of floating rocks by repulsive forces.<br />
<b>- Silver Palace</b><br />
Out of the ruins in Heaven's Gate damaged by Ragnarok, the Silver Palace is the one seemingly most intact. Statues and pillars stand here, worn by the ages, but otherwise hardly anything of value remains here. However, adventurers do sometimes try their luck and search for ancient treasures, though most don't dare to dig too hard for fear of collapsing the battered structure.<br />
<b>Heaven's Scale</b><br />
Huge rocks hang suspended by chains atop sharp pinnacles of stone, where it is believed fallen angels were tried and judged. A majestic, yet severe atmosphere surrounds these strange formations.<br />
<b>- Cavern of Judgement</b><br />
A sub-area from Heaven's Scale, said to be where fallen angels waited in line to receive their judgement. Once gloomy and dark, the crumbling walls allow light from above to filter in, creating a most surreal passage to the Stairway of Judgement.<br />
<b>-- Stairway of Judgement</b><br />
Led from the Cavern of Judgement, and an apparent extension where the numerous fallen angels queued. It is not known how deep the Stairway carries on, but those who have seen it are inclined to believe it carries on forever.<br />
<b>Angel's Memorial</b><br />
The highest point where anyone can go in Heaven's Gate, said to be the resting place of the Grim Angels who had lost their lives in Ragnarok. The light that shines here appears to bathe the area, casting a calming, yet tragic aura on the crumbling ruins. It seems to be completely inaccessible by scaling, and can only be reached with the help of an extremely strong, flight-capable Pokémon.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkslateblue"><b><u>Lacrima Castle</u> - please reply in darkslateblue</b><br />
Located on Rosalina Island, the northeasternmost island in Riviera territory, Lacrima Castle is also popularly known as &quot;the castle bathed in moonlight&quot;. Until some decades ago, a race of people known as Arcs lived within the castle grounds, but little has been heard from them ever since and the Arcs are believed to have simply died out. Swarmed by a variety of Pokémon, Rosalina Island is a considerably feral location in Riviera, and with the Arcs' apparent disappearance it has been overcast by a peculiar shroud that appears to cloud the island in night's darkness. Adventurers to Lacrima Castle find that it is always night there, though the silvery moon shines bright upon the seemingly ominous, yet melancholy structure. The only methods of getting to Lacrima Castle would be via the help of a Surfing or Flying Pokémon, although it is rumoured another method of transport exists somewhere...<br />
<b>Wilheim Path</b><br />
A coastal road that goes about a cliff, leading to where Lacrima Castle stands. Due to its position near the water, the weather is often warm, and migratory birds can be seen enjoying the breeze. Some of the grasses and herbs found here are known to have various healing properties.<br />
<b>- Rosalina Forest</b><br />
A despairing, forbidding forest outside of Lacrima Castle's parameters. The trees seem to grow jagged and intertwining, preventing conventional entry by walking. Some people who dared to go near it claim that you can hear disembodied whispers and screams from inside the forest, as though they were taken from people on the verge of death.<br />
<b>Moonlit Garden</b><br />
A shadowed bridge decorated with gargoyle statues leads over a moat from Wilheim Path, revealing this area which surrounds the walls of Lacrima Castle. Lined by stone pillars and shrubs, the garden seems to exude a sense of beautiful sadness. The trees in the garden sometimes hold Berries, but also have a chance of holding slumbering Pokémon.<br />
<b>Sentry Tower</b><br />
One of the corner towers appears to be the only way into the walls of the castle. Standing at tens of metres tall, various nocturnal and Flying-type Pokémon live in its abandoned stairwell, littered with what appear to be chains and skeletons. It is said that Pokémon with the power to generate twisters stand guard here, ready to literally blow away anyone they deem as intruders.<br />
<b>Connecting Bridge</b><br />
A network of stone bridges linking the four corner towers of Lacrima Castle, crossing over shaky stone blocks and crumbling turret roofs. What appear to be fragments of treasure lie here, but some contain traps that trigger the local spirits into attacking. Peering into the depths below shows nothing but darkness; yet there seems to be no other way to explore the castle from the inside.<br />
<b>- Castle Dungeon</b><br />
The deepest part of Lacrima Castle, the dungeons have long since caved in, though adventurers unlucky enough to fall from the castle's heights very occasionally land up in this humongous underground prison. Metal chains, which were once used to restrain large Pokémon, can be seen lining the walls. It is said that valuable items can be found in the darkest depths of the dungeon, but if you would lay your hand on them a price would need to be exacted from you...<br />
<b>Castle Chambers</b><br />
Seemingly accessible only by flight, or scaling down the walls from the Connecting Bridge. Lit by peculiar blue-white flames, the castle halls are lined by strange-looking armour, statues and murals. Some of these are believed to be demonic in origin.<br />
<b>Moonlit Courtyard</b><br />
Near the exact centre of the castle lies this beautiful, strangely well-maintained courtyard. The local flora blooms beautifully in the moonlight, and the fountain there is said to hold rejuvenating water, active in the light of a full moon.<br />
<b>The Sealed Tower</b><br />
In the very centre of the Moonlit Courtyard lies the tallest tower in Lacrima Castle. Strange runes line the inner walls, and adventurers who scale the tower to its peak find a huge spherical barrier preventing access to the very top. No one knows what secret the barrier holds, but some believe that within the seal lies an accursed power...</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: chartreuse"><b><u>Nelde Ruins</u> - please reply in chartreuse</b><br />
Southwest of Elendia lies a forest, within which lies the ancient ruins of Nelde -- home of the Binon royal family, who died out in the last few centuries. The Binon royal family was said to be a family of naturalist magicians who were at one with nature, and thus constructed their home alongside the forest trees. In the present day, the tree which the ruins were built around has grown into the stone, forming a monumental testimony of the power of nature over mankind. Alongside the local Pokémon, some of the ruins' magic traps are still in place to catch any intruders who might threaten the sanctity of the region.<br />
<b>Wiese Forest</b><br />
The forest that surrounds the Nelde Ruins. Its fertile soil has given rise to a wild variety of flora, some of which can no longer be found anywhere else on Riviera, though not all are safe to touch or consume. Adventurers are not recommended to delve too deeply into the forest, however -- it is said that within the deeper areas of Wiese Forest lies a magical labyrinth of trees, from which escape is nigh impossible.<br />
<b>Tree Ruins</b><br />
The lower floors of Nelde Ruins still hold strong after centuries, though many of the tree's roots have breached the stone slabs, crossing around the rooms and even causing cave-ins. The roots can be climbed to reach the higher areas of the ruins.<br />
<b>Treetop Ruins</b><br />
Over the years the tree's trunk grew through the weakened ceiling. Here, wooden and stone structures have been built about the tree, though some of the platforms have rotted and some doors magically sealed. Forest Flying-type Pokémon tend to build their nests in the branches, some of which can be easily reached if you walk on the sturdier branches, but not without a severe risk of falling and snapping wood.<br />
<b>- Tree Hollow</b><br />
The inside of the tree can occasionally be reached by falling off the Treetop Ruins. A sizeable space formed as fungi grew on the inside of the tree, eating away at the wood and spreading around the tunnel-like area. Little sunlight filters in through the cracks in the bark, creating a habitat frequented by various Bug-type Pokémon.<br />
<b>-- Royal Tomb</b><br />
Deep within the Tree Hollow lies the tomb where the kings of Binon were laid to rest. The royal crest of a winged reptile adorns this area, and it's possible that if you searched through the dust and fungi you might find some remnant of Binon's knowledge, the rest of which has been lost to the ravages of time.<br />
<b>Wooden Platforms</b><br />
A stairwell built from fallen logs and lashed together by vines, magicked into the sides of the tree, allowing the stairwell to grow along with its host. Climbing these platforms runs a higher risk of strong winds and falling off, but it leads into the higher parts of the ruins.<br />
<b>Colony Remains</b><br />
A gigantic structure that resembles a nest, high above the ground. Fragments of eggshells can be seen littered about the plant fibres, having apparently housed many a strong colony of Flying-type Pokémon in the past. Some think that non-harmful experiments and studies were carried out here by the Binon family, many years ago.<br />
<b>Treetop Apex</b><br />
The highest point of Nelde Ruins, so high that a drop in temperature can be felt. It is said that a great Flying-type Pokémon nests here...</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: aqua"><b><u>Tetyth City</u> - please reply in aqua</b><br />
Originally a city in the centre of a lake, southeast from where Elendia is located, Tetyth was said to have been cursed in the distant past when the local inhabitants angered the gods with their extravagance and arrogance. Due to this the once beautiful city of splendour and prosperity was submerged within the waters, killing all the people in the city's limits and leaving behind the city's rich treasures and archives. In light of this, adventurers and researchers have made attempts to explore the sunken ruins, in order to discover more about the ancient lake city that has now become infested with Pokémon. However, not all investigative expeditions have been successful; many of the city's traps are still very active, and those who set foot on Tetyth's abandoned soil have returned with claims that the water has a mind of its own...<br />
<b>Tetyth Lake</b><br />
With no port to cast off, Surfing on a Pokémon is the only other way to access Tetyth across the watery depths. Usually the waters seem calm, but it is rumoured that feral aquatic Pokémon have staked their territory in various bits of the lake, ready to attack any intruders...<br />
<b>Lake Cavern</b><br />
For those without Surfing Pokémon, or those who do not wish to brave the lake, the Lake Cavern still exists -- a drippy, murky passage thought to have been used as an emergency exit, or as an alternative trade route in the distant past. The sounds of swishing lakewater above can be heard from down here.<br />
<b>Sinking Island</b><br />
Led from the Lake Cavern, this small islet leads on to a rocky path towards Tetyth's city limits. Young local Pokémon frolic amongst the shallows, but beware of the extremely slippery stones.<br />
<b>Carnea District</b><br />
A residential area that takes up the outermost radius of the city. While the coastal houses have long since fallen to the submerging waters, a good number of their roofs can still be used as makeshift paths. Some of the houses were apparently used for storage, and if you can go through their still-pristine doors and locks you might find a little something for yourself...<br />
<b>Colosseo</b><br />
In the central part of the lower areas of Tetyth lies Colosseo: a battleground for entertainment that also doubles as a gigantic stairway to the upper areas of Tetyth. Battles between warriors and beasts took place for the citizens' enjoyment in a past long gone, under the watchful statue of Luxray, the Battle Lion. Some believe that beasts and souls, descended from many a clash from ancient times, still haunt this area.<br />
<b>Aura Plateaus</b><br />
An area built out of various minerals such as limestone and marble, giving this area its name due to the pristine, white appearance of its buildings. It is hypothesised that buildings critical to the city's commerce, government and other such aspects were located here. Markings on the buildings suggested that the curse of submergence even reached this area in that time.<br />
<b>St. Claremonts</b><br />
The highest area in Tetyth is filled with various religious buildings, such as churches and sanctuaries. Many treasures are believed to be found here, drenched in pools of floodwater, although some of the statues are also said to move if you stare at them long enough...<br />
<b>Mizel Bridge</b><br />
Legends of Tetyth say that this sacred bridge was where an angel once walked down from her descent to Earth. Some details of mechanisms have been found here, suggesting that this was the control centre for much of the city's defensive and trap mechanisms. It leads on to the Flaybell Cathedral.<br />
<b>Flaybell Cathedral</b><br />
In the centre of St. Claremonts lies this grand temple, dedicated to the twelve fallen angels whom according to legend built Tetyth from the lake depths. Extravagant statues line its spiral staircase, revealing a sacred chamber at the very top. A skylight lets down light from above, onto the titanic statue of an angel wielding a dual-ended staff, with a bell at one end and a sickle at the other. Some believe this is where Tetyth's citizens tried to talk to the gods.<br />
<b>- Cathedral Library</b><br />
It is said that in the core of Flaybell Cathedral lies an ancient archive of giant books and reference tables, chronicling the dawn of Heaven and Earth as well as some of the land's most intricate, forbidden magic. Knowledge is the greatest treasure this place contains, and who knows what might happen if it was presented to the right people?</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkslategray"><b><u>Mireno Cemetery</u> - please reply in darkslategray</b><br />
A subterranean cemetery built under the decaying city of Mireno. Little remains of the original city which has long since fallen to destruction and decay, but most of note is the underground catacombs where demons are said to walk, even after death. According to legend, the Cemetery houses, amongst others, the bodies of six priests who used their power to open a way to what archives describe as the &quot;holy land&quot;. Vicious Pokémon now live in the area, toughened by the unforgiving terrain, and will attack anything that gets in their way. Within the deepest areas of the cemetery, amongst the graves and traps, ominous powers are said to sleep, awaiting anyone foolhardy enough to plumb its deepest, darkest secrets...<br />
<b>Ghost Town</b><br />
The only remains of Mireno left standing, this crumbling hamlet is a place where thieves often lurk and hide, far away from the eyes of authority. Adventurers often find their inventory compromised when they stay too long in this area, but some have also found snippets of thieves' intel on how to evade many a trap and danger.<br />
<b>Pilgrimage Way</b><br />
A dark path found under the surface of the Ghost Town which leads into the actual cemetery. Peculiarly bright torches, said to have illuminated the passage since they were lit, line the walls of this gloomy cavern.<br />
<b>Cemetery Entrance</b><br />
An area infested with ivy that forms a central junction between the catacombs and the underground lake. Trap entrances prevent anyone from entering further areas without first finding the key to unlock them...<br />
<b>Catacombs</b><br />
Divided into a north and south region, the catacombs are said to hold the bodies of the six Priests who found a way to the &quot;holy land&quot;, alongside other individuals who sought great power in strength and magic. Their graves are believed to still possess the forbidden power and knowledge they received, but these are also said to be guarded by minions, centuries after death.<br />
<b>Underground Lake</b><br />
An area beyond the Cemetery, this lake formed from rainwater that seeped through the ground, slowly pooling here in a hole deep in the layers of rock. Although the waters look clear, the lake is a lot deeper than it appears, and rumours say that if the waters of the lake could be drained, the gateway to a gruesomely evil power will open.<br />
<b>Crystal Sanctuary</b><br />
A remote region accessible only by strange magic circles about the Underground Lake. Giant crystals of various colours lie embedded in the pitch-black walls within chambers inaccessible between each other, but on inspection little else of interest seems to lie here... or does it?<br />
<b>Pieta</b><br />
This area, said to lie somewhere beyond the Underground Lake, appears to exude death itself. Poisonous fungi line its depths, making breathing nigh impossible. Death itself is believed to reside in the furthest sector, though few have survived in their futile attempts to prove this.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: springgreen"><b><u>Yggdrasil</u> - please reply in springgreen</b><br />
The holy domain of Ursula, goddess of Riviera, is said to lie in a tree near the entrance to Elendia. Normally inaccessible, records exist of instances when in times of need, Ursula revealed herself and her domain to extend her powers for Riviera's salvation. Rumoured to be a pocket dimension in time and space, all accounts of Yggdrasil describe it as a wondrous place, much larger than it seems on the outside. The sources of Ursula are said to be located in the higher areas of Yggdrasil, guarded by entities known as the Cefiro; without which Riviera would be plunged into certain danger...<br />
<b>Peseta Everglades</b><br />
The lower wetlands of Yggdrasil, where a surprising variety of plants and Pokémon live in the water that seems to sustain the tree Yggdrasil. Flat stones form a gradual passage that leads to the central core of Yggdrasil.<br />
<b>Manalith Garden</b><br />
Leading the way up Yggdrasil's giant trunk-like pillar is a stairwell, formed by arcing blocks of stone that look like they fell apart from a greater structure long ago, as well as curving tree trunks severed to allow other parts of Yggdrasil to grow. It is said that wisps of power lies embedded within some of the nooks and crannies in the ancient rocks. In the higher areas, the wind blows at dangerous speeds and anyone who might happen to be up here could easily be blown off to their demise.<br />
<b>Eternal Eden</b><br />
Curved stone blocks surrounding the central core form the upper tier of the spiralling stairs, protecting the sacred vegetation. Enchanted stone bridges appear to lead towards the higher places in Yggdrasil.<br />
<b>The World Tree</b><br />
Yggdrasil's absolute core, said to give life to all. At this height, winds with strength comparable to that of tornadoes and gales sometimes blow, preventing anyone from even opening their eyes and threatening to plunge them to their deaths below.<br />
<b>- Aquarium Springs</b><br />
Three of these magical aquariums flow with pure water that sustains Ursula's power, as well as that of Yggdrasil's. Led to by stony passages the trees do not impede on, the rarest of herbs thrive in these pristine conditions. It is said that only two springs exist in Yggdrasil while the last Aquarium resides in Ursula's central domain.<br />
<b>Divine Ray</b><br />
The highest sector of Yggdrasil where Ursula, goddess of Riviera, stands guard, amidst holy blue light streaming from above amongst maze-like growths of crystal fibres. The uppermost part of this area is believed to be closest to the heavens, and a monolith holding the gods' wisdom lies here bathed in the sacred light of Heaven.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkviolet"><b><u>The Maze of Shadows</u> - please reply in darkviolet</b><br />
Atop a floating island of rock known as the Isle of Goriate, the Maze of Shadows is believed to be where the gods repelled the demons' most devastating attack on their domain, before the ancient covenant was broken and the Grim Angels were created. As a result, the place is thoroughly enshrouded in cursed power, resembling a dangerously spiky crystalline dome. The sighting of the Maze of Shadows, also known in Riviera's archives as the counterpart to Yggdrasil, is said to be an omen that precedes the doom of the world, as Seth, the Sealed One, counterpart to Ursula and holy angel of destruction, sleeps in eternal slumber, only to awaken if the seal over it is ever broken, revealing the domain of darkness to all...<br />
<b>Clemonia Stratum</b><br />
Actually accessed by Heaven's Gate, this is a region of Heaven's Gate long since tainted by darkness. Eerie, cursed light gives the ominous stairway a grim, purple tint, and glinting eyes sometimes appear in the shadows.<br />
<b>Ethereal Way</b><br />
A tainted bridge, much like the levitating stones in Heaven's Gate, bridges the gap between the former and the Isle of Goriate. However, where the floating chains and rocks are concerned, it's a no less difficult path to traverse.<br />
<b>The Isle of Goriate</b><br />
The floating island where the Maze of Shadows is located. From the Ethereal Way, another stairwell leads the way up to the legendary dark labyrinth. Remains of demons and angels, as well as fragments of the weapons they used, lie strewn across the area.<br />
<b>- Granada Fortress</b><br />
A fort where it is said the Magi, proxies of the gods, helped hold back the onslaughts of demons on the Island of Goriate. Scarred deeply by battles long past, it may be possible that some of the terrible weaponry used then still lies here.<br />
<b>Road to Darkness</b><br />
A road that leads from the topmost part of Goriate into the limits of the Maze of Shadows; this winding path actually is far longer in distance than it appears to be. Guardians of the Maze are said to lie in wait here to destroy anyone who would trespass deeper.<br />
<b>Triple Strata</b><br />
Three areas, formed by nothing but translucent energy platforms in varying eerie lights of red, blue and green, form the Maze of Shadows where travel is only possible via teleportation circles. Along the way it is said the Progenitors of Darkness, agents of pure evil, form the main defence mechanism to protect Seth. Anyone who stumbles within these tiers is said to feel no passing of time, and the unaware are doomed to walk through these tiers for all eternity.<br />
<b>Summit of the Gods</b><br />
A fourth tier extended from the Triple Strata, enshrouded in the same evil shade of purple that cloaks the Maze of Shadows as seen from outside, said to be placed inside a dimensional rift. It is within this accursed core that Seth resides, harmless until the seal upon its destructive power is broken...</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: silver"><b><u>Parveeju Temple</u> - please reply in silver</b><br />
Located in the dark wilderness north of Elendia, this mysterious monument stands with a heavily ominous presence. Few have dared enter its walls, and those who do find its chamber illuminated by violent purple fire. Grim-looking murals painted in sinister shades adorn the wall, and little else can be said of the marble-tiled sanctum, except for a bizarre sense of distortion in the air that hints towards something otherworldly. Few of Riviera's ancient texts mention Parveeju at all, though in some of the instances where it is brought up, it is suggested that a forbidden battleground lies beneath the temple floors, apparently banished by the heavens. However, none mention a clear method as to how to access this fabled area, and most adventurers give up after many months of futility. Others have spent their lives in attempts to unlock the secrets of Parveeju, without so much as a hint of success...<br />
<b>Land of Judgement</b><br />
The lair that lies below Parveeju Temple, resembling a crumbling colosseum where spirits do battle against adventurers foolish enough to come here, tools and puppets for the entertainment of the Banished One...</span></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10px"><b>Riviera Rules of Exploration</b></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px">- Elendia's subareas may be explored without having to begin in a specific area. For all other areas, adventuring must begin in the topmost subarea, and the other subsequent areas will be explored in turn as mentioned by their descriptions. Exceptions, such as the Silver Palace and Royal Tomb, are optional subareas that lead to &quot;dead ends&quot;; these are indicated and need not be explored to advance deeper into the areas. However, to explore these optional subareas you need to explore the subarea they fall under.<br />
- Adventuring may not begin in Yggdrasil or the Maze of Shadows.<br />
- Parveeju Temple may be briefly explored, but its secrets will not be revealed to those without the means and requirements to access them.</span></div>

<div style="text-align: center"><b><span style="font-size: 12px">RIVIERA</span></b>&#8203;</div><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px">Many millenia ago, it is said, gods and demons clashed in a legendary war known in the annals as Ragnarok. Earth was thrown into chaos by the violence that ensued, and the army of the deathly dimension began to encroach on the boundaries of Heaven itself, threatening to overthrow it completely and forever plunge the world into permanent darkness and despair. With this threat in mind, it is recorded that the gods proceeded to break an ancient covenant for the salvation of the world -- sacrificing their power, they created embodiments of destruction known as the Grim Angels; each bearing a divine weapon with which they tore through the armies of chaos, and brought Ragnarok to its end.<br />
<br />
Drained of their omnipotent might, the gods were said to have left the remains of their power within the realm of Riviera where the critical clash between the Grim Angels and demons took place, and entrusted its inhabitants to safeguard the land forevermore, until the day of the gods' return. In time, Riviera became a natural wilderness, where hardy adventurers and explorers journey to in attempts to seek out the mysteries of the land -- with some help of Flying or Surfing Pokémon, as no boats or ports exist in Riviera.<br />
<br />
Little else remains of Riviera's history, and in present day, few know of the legend behind the island's past. Even amongst those who still believe in it, few know of the truth behind the power that was said to be locked deep inside Riviera: should the need arise to defend the world's balance, the power of divine destruction within Riviera will be unlocked, purifying the world and taking the world out in the process...<br />
<span style="color: chartreuse"><b><u>Nelde Ruins</u> - please reply in chartreuse</b><br />
Southwest of Elendia lies a forest, within which lies the ancient ruins of Nelde -- home of the Binon royal family, who died out in the last few centuries. The Binon royal family was said to be a family of naturalist magicians who were at one with nature, and thus constructed their home alongside the forest trees. In the present day, the tree which the ruins were built around has grown into the stone, forming a monumental testimony of the power of nature over mankind. Alongside the local Pokémon, some of the ruins' magic traps are still in place to catch any intruders who might threaten the sanctity of the region.<br />
<b>Wiese Forest</b><br />
The forest that surrounds the Nelde Ruins. Its fertile soil has given rise to a wild variety of flora, some of which can no longer be found anywhere else on Riviera, though not all are safe to touch or consume. Adventurers are not recommended to delve too deeply into the forest, however -- it is said that within the deeper areas of Wiese Forest lies a magical labyrinth of trees, from which escape is nigh impossible.</span><br />

</blockquote><span style="color: chartreuse"><span style="font-size: 9px">The girl came onto the shore, exhausted and glad to be alive. She had heard of this place, ruins covered the realm, its former glory possibly capable of telling her of her own. She had heard talk that dieties, legends, even Thanatos himself dwelled upon what was once civilization. Upon hearing these words, she took her friends, placing them in their Poké Balls, all except one. She took her trusted Volante, putting it all on her to help them make it there. The Pidgey tried hard as she could, but she weighed four pounds, her cargo 140. The flight was smooth halfway into the trip, but from there on, Volante struggled to bear the weight set upon her tiny frame. They started at a foot above the sea, then, at the midpoint, ten, eight, six inches. Three quarters there, her ankles skimmed the sea. As land then grew, the water reached her knees. As they approached, it went up to her waist. And when the land was but a stone's throw off, the trusted Volante finally gave. Both bird and cargo fell into the deep, at mercy of the waves to guide them right. They did their duty, and at last, the girl and her pet bird had reached the blessed coast. Now the girl advanced into the forest that stood before her, a sight to behold, her pet Volante in its Poké Ball, in the hopes of learning from her own past...</span></span></div>

A desolate area cloaked in light where it is said that the Grim Angels clashed with demons for the final time, rendering the once sacred landscape barren and dilapidated. Ruins of what appear to be palaces and temples lie strewn across the rocky area, and other than stone upon marble upon metal, little else of interest exists here, save for a few prominent landmarks such as the paths of floating stones. Still, some adventurers come here occasionally for a look at Heaven's Gate's few sights, and also to chance upon finding angelic remains from centuries long past.<br />
<b>Remote Sanctuary</b><br />
A shimmering forcefield, known as the Riviera Barrier, appears to surround the area this ruined shrine, and this is where adventurers to Heaven's Gate must begin their journey from. No one has any idea why the barrier exists, but some theorise that it forms an interdimensional rift that brought the supposed heavenly passage to Riviera's soil.</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Red">&quot;It's been a while my friend, come on out and have a look around.&quot; LC muttered to himself, tapping the centre button of the Pokeball in his hand, causing it to spring open and release, with a burst of light, his oldest travelling companion.<br />
&quot;Maro Maro Wak!&quot; came the eponymous reply from the Bonekeeper Pokemon, released from his Pokeball for the first time in a considerable while. <br />
&quot;I think it's time we went on an adventure again, it's been too long.&quot; LC added to his companion. The two had arrived at Heaven's Gate, which according to his copy of &quot;The Riviera for Dummies&quot; was the supposed site of the final battle of Ragnarok between the Demonic hordes and the Grim Angels. Indeed, it certainly looked like some sort of battle had taken places here in these blasted lands, rubble strewn around liberally and consistently as far as the eye could see. A noted beauty spot it wasn't, but it was here that they would make their first steps into their adventure in the Riviera.<br />
<br />
They had reached this barren land in the most unusual of manners, Surfing in on Adonis, LC’s recently adopted Luvdisc, a real experience seeing as Adonis was considerably smaller than LC himself, and the poor Luvdisc had struggled slightly with being used as a surf board by a fully grown human, but the strength of his love and happiness at having been picked up from the Adoption Centre after so long had pulled the little Rendezvous Pokémon through, and he was now taking a well deserved rest in his Pokeball.<br />
<br />
Running his hand along his belt, LC checked that each of the six Pokeballs held there were secured: the empty ball of Marowak plus a few newer companions; Phanpy, Bagon, Zangoose, Luvdisc and Teddiursa, all new to the team and still young, weaker than Marowak and unlikely to fancy these conditions much. Still, they had plenty of adventures ahead of them and it was time for LC and Marowak to do some catching up. LC strode onwards into the desolate ruins of Heaven's Gate, looking forwards to beginning a fresh adventure in this harsh place.<br />

This quiet, peaceful village is all that remains of civilisation in Riviera, and is said to have stood since Ragnarok's passing. Most adventurers who come to Riviera stop by this central location as a rest stop, stocking up on energy and materials before moving on to other locations to begin their exploration. The friendly locals often dispense assistance and advice to adventurers in need, but most are unwilling to delve into information about the world outside Elendia, citing various dangers...<br />
<b>Crystal Caverns</b><br />
This beautiful cavern lined with crystals is where Elendia's Magic Guild has stationed themselves, where they carry out all sorts of research ranging from elemental manipulation to mythology. Within one of the caverns lies the Magic Guild's headquarters which also doubles as a library, and the members may approach you for help in locating items outside of Elendia if needed. It's also said that an ancient, magical teleportation circle lies within the labyrinth.</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: lemonchiffon"><span style="font-size: 9px">Rick was extremely pumped for his latest adventure, simply from reading all he could find about the area he was heading for. Riviera, a desolate and wild land, only one existing area of civilisation left in the area, and that was where Rick was heading right now. His target destination, the Crystal Caverns, is a cave lined with crystals, beautiful to look at, and valuable to mine, although from what Rick could see no mining is performed around the area, at least not when this manual was made, and since he received it from a rather dodgey looking salesmen on his boat ride to the Arcane Realm, he wasn’t really sure how accurate and up to date the book was. It hasn’t failed him thus far, though, and by what the book said about Riviera, it probably wouldn’t be the type of place to suddenly have a huge boom in development and tranformed into a huge industrial estate. Of course, he probably would have heard about that from someone anyway, a huge city spawning out of nowhere in the last twenty years or so, as Rick believed the manual certainly couldn’t be any older than that. He stared down at his belt, and looked at the Pokeballs that were residing there. Currently, there was only one Pokemon he wanted to see, and that Pokemon is his starter Pokemon, a Combee named Belle. Clicking the center button, he released her into the area, and she began her usual routine of rushing around busily, yet doing nothing at all for a few minutes before Rick decided to stop her. “We’re heading to the Crystal Caverns,” Rick stated, holding out the manual to Belle “-which is displayed here. It looks like a great place to explore, huh?” Belle nodded, or at least the closest thing that she could do to a nod, shifting her whole body up and down, and slowly fluttered onwards as Rick walked alongside her, heading towards the expanse that was the <b>Crystal Caverns</b> in hope of adventure, excitement, and possibly even a new partner along the way if they’re lucky. They weren’t holding their hopes high, though.</span></span></div>

<b><u>Crystal Caverns</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Handymankg2</u></b><br />
A hodgepodge of forgotten ruins and majestic vegetation, the village of Elendia is still quite a sight to behold even in its friendly and calm ambience, with villagers going about their daily business. While there doesn't seem to be much in the way of outsiders, the friendly smiles and glances cast your way every now and then by the locals indicates that they're quite used to the presence of people passing. Your destination, however, lies in one isolated part of the village where the tiled ground opens up to a subterranean passage.<br />
<br />
Going down a series of steps cut into the ruined rock, you notice the way ahead, while sheltered from most of the wind and sun outside, is still mostly lit by the light shining through the gaps in the stone and refracted by the crystal ore lining the floor and walls. With this gentle ambience, you note that it's perhaps not so much a surprise that the caverns have been dedicated to the purposes of research and study, given the conducive environment and mystical qualities. Even Belle seems a little more energetic than usual, as though her segmented body has absorbed some of the gently filtered light, putting a few erratic acrobatics in her flight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Careful, Nono, you don't want to -- ACK!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Waaaaah! Look out!&quot; <i>Tinkle</i><b>crash!</b><br />
<br />
Jumping at the echoing cacophony, you briskly step along the passage, across a sturdy wooden bridge hanging over a shallow cave stream, into an area where the cave ceiling is high and the walls are lined with books seated in makeshift shelves, but your attention is mostly drawn to the commotion in the centre. Bits of broken beakers and flurried papers lie strewn willy-nilly across the platforms of rock, with a young girl who doesn't seem to be any older than twelve lying in the middle, rubbing her head ruefully. Next to her a young man with dark purple hair tries his best to pick up the various paraphernalia, helped by an older woman with neat green hair and spectacles. &quot;Owwie...&quot; groans the girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aloso, you simply must work together with your assistant. Your making an oddjob runner of her is causing much detriment to the progress of your research.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, but Miss Ardyd...&quot; Whining in response to the lady's chidings, the young man stops as he spots you and Belle staring onwards. &quot;Oh!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I must say we weren't expecting visitors.&quot; Standing upright as she realigns her glasses, the woman named Ardyd notes your presence with a small smile. &quot;Is there something we can do for you?&quot;</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red"><div style="text-align: center"><b><u>Heaven's Gate</u></b>&#8203;</div><br />
<b><u>Remote Sanctuary</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Lonely Cubone</u></b><br />
Paired with your faithful partner after a long dry spell of inactivity, you find yourself refreshed to be adventuring alongside him once more in realms wild and unexplored. The journey in getting here, while undeniably exhilirating in its own way, certainly can't compare with what's to come as you stand outside the ruined shrine said to open up into sacred zones beyond mortal ken. Taking a step into the shrine, you feel as though the air around you has become choked, distorted, before you move into the open space illuminated ahead of you.<br />
<br />
In spite of what you've already read about the area, the sight of the seemingly endless field of stones and chains all suspended in mid-air is enough to take your breath away, but you feel that awe is not the only sensation you're experiencing. A peculiar sense of constriction has your very heart captive, clouding your mind with layers of doubt and tension so subtle you realise might not have been noticed earlier. Even Marowak appears to be a little more jumpy, gripping his weapon tightly as he casts suspicious glances about.<br />
<br />
For a while, it almost seems that the tinted landscape has you completely captive, until an alert bark from Marowak casts your attention downwards; as the two of you stare down the flight of giant stone steps you see a cloaked figure advance towards you -- or should that be floating? Judging by the way it almost glides up the steps you're not even sure if the individual in the grey shroud is a person. As they near you spot a distinct, yellow ellipse at the back of the garment's long hood, when suddenly with a faint cry the figure collapses, revealing the pale face of a young woman lined by silky, black hair as her hood opens...</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: chartreuse"><div style="text-align: center"><b><u>Nelde Ruins</u></b>&#8203;</div><br />
<b><u>Wiese Forest</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Excessive Spare Time</u></b><br />
<br />
With the seawater dripping off you, each step you take brushes you against the cool breezes wafting from the forest's shade, sending involutary shivers across yourself as the water evaporates with the wind. The thought of delving deep into the fabled ruins sustains you, however; that you might discover more to the elusive truth of your past, and feeling confidence return with a state of dry clothes you trek onwards. The sounds of the forest surround you; infinite clicking of insects, flickering of various flora, even the spirits of the woods themselves seem alerted by your presence, looking on you in almost pleasant surprise. A variety of creepers and fungi litter the floor, most of which you've never recalled seeing in your life, while the homely stretches of cloaked expanse are punctured by spotlights of sun, poking through the gaps left behind by the towering trees.<br />
<br />
The pleasant, albeit monotonous experience continues for about twenty minutes' worth of walking, until you absentmindedly bump your foot against some debris and gravel. Looking ahead to your right, you spy a series broken stone blocks leading up to what appears to be a path -- likely, to the monument you've been searching for. A sudden wave of wind blows from behind your head, startling you as it careens past your ears and cheeks, and in that instant you have a faint, yet niggling impression of a whisper in your ear. Turning to its origin you see nothing but a stretch of trees and mushrooms, leading deeper into the darker forest, and even as you stare you feel the strange sensation of something tugging at your subconscious, only fragmenting into ethereal memory as your mind becomes aware of this. It seems, at least, two choices lay in front of you, but which will you choose?</span></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: lemonchiffon"><span style="font-size: 9px">Walking through the village, Rick was slightly stunned at how elegant and peaceful it actually was. For the only habitable place in the region (as far as Rick knew), it wasn’t exactly thriving with people, although Rick did see some villagers walking by on their daily business, and from the looks and smiles sent Ricks way, he felt a lot better about being here. Of course, the smiles and the glances could just be because Rick looked slightly strange, exploring the village bemusedly with a Combee as the only foreseeable Pokemon with him, but Rick felt it was something more than that, that they were actually just nice people rather than simply courteous. Of course, he’d have no way of telling how nice they were without actually meeting any of them, and he supposed he would have to meet someone along his journey, as otherwise it wouldn’t really be much of a journey after all. Especially considering the location he was going to was supposed to be some sort of magic guild, and therefore should at least have some people in it. Friendly as these villagers or not, Rick wasn’t certain, but the stereotype of old, bearded and angry mages popped to his mind rather quickly. But stereotypes were often proved wrong. Rick considered as he walked onwards towards his destination how much he himself was a stereotype, and chuckled slightly. The son of a Fighting type master having a favourite type of Fighting, and collecting them as his main goal as a trainer, as well as being the son of a natural scientist, and starting with a bug type Pokemon. He was fulfilling the stereotype of ‘his fathers son’ alright, but he honestly didn’t mind, unless he turned into the single minded angry father of his which he grew to love. He smiled, but stopped his track of thoughts as he realised he had reached the location he was heading for, and isolated part of the village where the tiled ground opened up into a underground passage. He smiled at Belle, who buzzed excitedly, flying around in a circle and then zooming inside, forcing Rick to follow a little quicker than he would have liked.<br />
<br />
Quickly stepping into the passage, and practically jumping down to steps in an attempt to keep up with his partner, Rick noticed that the way ahead actually looked pretty stunning, the entire tunnel being sheltered from the outside, yet still in perfect light, the rays of light shining through the gaps in the stones and being refracted by the crystal ore that was lining both the floor and the walls. He reached out to touch the wall, and was surprised at how cold it was, smiling. This underground area would make a welcome change from the hot adventures of past, as this place was rather mild if you asked Rick. With the gentle atmosphere around the tunnel, Rick could see why such a place would be chosen for research, the environment looking very peaceful, and would most likely not often be interrupted by the sounds of the rest of the village or tourists. Rick sighed, realising that he would interrupt the peace of their studies when he entered, but if Belle had her way, she would be interrupting the peace a lot more than Rick would, buzzing around and looking happily at every single thing on the wall (searching for honey in an underground cave, Rick expected). Rick sighed, and grabbed hold of his Pokemon when she flew close to him, murmuring “Be quiet”, before letting her go, but giving her a look that was clear to say ‘any monkey business, and you’ll be back in your pokeball.’ After that, Belle calmed down significantly, and simply flew alongside Rick, still happy to be here though, and deciding that if she was silent, Rick wouldn’t mind, performing a few acrobatic twists and twirls in midair behind Rick. He sighed, she wasn’t usually this energetic, but he supposed it could be the magic in the air, or something of the sort. While he didn’t strictly believe in magic, he didn’t deny its existence, and would love to see if it really was a true thing, or if the people were simply tricking simple minded folk in the village. <br />
<br />
His thoughts were interrupted by the sounds of voices nearby, people speaking in load tones, and then suddenly a crashing sound resounding from nearby, further down the passage, and Rick decided rather quickly that he should go an investigate, beckoning to Belle, and walking quickly along the passageway that separated Rick from whatever the noise was, Belle fluttering behind him, catching up perfectly fine with the boy. They eventually came to a sturdy wooden bridge, hanging over what appeared to be some sort if in cave stream. It looked beautiful, the river and the crystals shining on eachother, but Rick didn’t really have time to waste, as someone may well have been hurt by the crashing sound, whatever it was. He eventually arrived in the area that the noise was coming from, what appeared to be a makeshift study, with many books lined on shelves which lined the wall. Ricks attention was drawn to the center more than anything else, mind. Bits of broken beaker and unorganised paper lay scattered on the platforms of rocks, what appeared to be a girl no older than twelve lying in the middle of the stack, rubbing her head. Rick assumed she must have been what caused this mess. Next to her, a young purple haired man was attempting to pick up the various objects, a older woman with green hair and spectacles aiding also. Rick couldn’t help but chuckle a bit. Odd coloured hair was always something Rick couldn’t understand why people would have. It just makes you seem odd and different in the minds of others, although he supposed people want to be different in some cases. The older lady began to speak, and the young boy whined back, apparently having the young girl as his assistant, but from what was being said, Rick seemed to think she was being used as a bit of a mule, being forced to carry whatever this ‘Aloso’ guy refused or couldn’t be bothered too. He also gained the knowledge that they were still researching something, which was good at least. The group then noticed Rick, and he suddenly felt a slight surge of timidity. He decided he might as well speak considering all eyes were on him. “Well, honestly, I came down here to find out more about the work you do downhere, as well as witness the beautiful Crystal Caverns for myself.” He stopped there, as he honestly didn’t have much more to say, and Belle certainly wasn’t helping, no, she was fluttering near the bookshelves, looking around in an attempt to find honey. “So, I heard you mention research. Well, what sort do you do down here?” Hoping it was in his place to ask, he stopped, looking timid and smiling the best he could, but of course, not beaming or overdoing it.</span></span></div>

&quot;Beautiful, mm? Well, perhaps it's because we spend a good amount of time here, but it's not much really. The land of Riviera possesses greater awe and beauty as told by the legends, but it's not as though we can simply waltz about the untamed wilderness as we like,&quot; remarks the woman, walking towards and grasping your hand in a curt handshake. &quot;I'm Ms. Adryd, although, you can call me Claudia. This is my apprentice, Aloso, and his assistant Nono... and you are?&quot; As you introduce yourself, Belle flitters back down to the company while Aloso and Nono walk over as their names are called.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rick, I see. You asked about research? Here in the Crystal Caverns, we are devoted to the study of Riviera's history -- I wouldn't say mythology; you'd be quite astounded at the finds and discoveries generations have made over the years, although we haven't admittedly been making such accomplishments in progress lately,&quot; continues Claudia. &quot;Being rich in diverse biology, ancient civilisations and other various aspects of interest, Riviera has a wealth of knowledge yet to be rediscovered... sadly, it's not easy for us to venture much further than the outskirts of Elendia itself. We simply aren't equipped with the resources to safely mount smaller expeditions on a more frequent basis, and at any rate large expeditions risk having adverse effects on the environment.<br />
<br />
&quot;As a matter of fact, we were going to Rosalina Island later tonight for our current research project, but...&quot; Heaving a small sigh, Claudia rubs her temple as you notice Nono and Aloso exchange annoyed glares. &quot;Well, it's just been one delay after another. Three months ago our requested supplies and instruments were pushed back in production, only reaching our shores six weeks later, and then there was the Ledah Festival last month that needed us to supply pyrotechnical support. Now with this state of sheer disarray, it seems that we'll have to give tonight's attempt a miss, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
As she mulls over the problem, she glances at you, suddenly jerking as though realising something. &quot;Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't quite mean to ramble on, but the issue certainly is a little... disheartening, to say the least. You're a trainer, aren't you Rick? I don't suppose... you could help us with our research? I don't think we can leave the caverns this evening, and it's quite imperative an exploration is performed tonight, or we'd have to wait for another month at least.&quot;<br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: lemonchiffon">Rick listened intently to the woman speak, and smiled slightly when he heard that Riviera actually contained greater awe and beauty than this. Honestly, Rick found this place completely awe inspiring, so if something more inspiring existed anywhere nearby, Rick would have to stop by later. “Well, honestly, this is definitely considered beautiful in my eyes. I was brought up somewhere that’s nowhere near as inspiring as this place, the only thing beautiful about it being the moon, and I have no claim to that seeing as it’s, well, everywhere.” Rick stopped, and smiled, listening to her mention the wilderness of the area. That was something Rick had certainly heard about, as it was listed rather boldly in the guide he had that he should not venture into certain parts of the area unless he was fully prepared. Rick wasn’t fully confident that he was prepared, as he forgot to pack much for this journey, being too psyched to remember the vitals. The woman Rick was speaking too stopped talking, and reached forwards, grasping Ricks hand and firmly shaking it. He smiled in turn at each of the people she mentioned, before opening his mouth to speak when it was his turn. “Richard Naphir, but call me Rick, please, I can’t stand my full name.” He grinned, and darted his eyes towards Belle, who flittered back down next to Rick, smiling with all three mouths at the people in front of her, and Rick expected she’d be beaming if she could. “And this is Belle, my Combee and Starter Pokemon.” Rick listened as she continued, explaining that they studied the mythology of Riviera, again something Rick knew very little about. Following from that, they had made lots of discoviries in recent years about it. It was more intriguing by the second.<br />
<br />
Rick smiled weakly, however, as she mentioned that they hadn’t been discovering such amazing thinks in recent times, and although the things she was saying sounded amazing, the group hadn’t managed to find much new at all in the recent years. Apparently, they didn’t have the technology or the resources to make any expeditions out of the place, and they didn’t have enough staff, as any large expeditions would cause unwanted affects on the environment of Riviera. He perked up, however, when he heard that they would be heading to a place known as Rosalina island to do their current research there. Rick had never heard of the place, but nonetheless, this could be his chance to go an a expedition across Riviera, something he would look forwards to quite a bit, as it would give him a great chance to marvel in the sights and Pokemon contained there. But, there had to be a but. She soon went on to delays, and although the delays all sounded rather interesting, Ricks heart was still dropping rather quickly, especially when she stated rather clearly that they might have to give up tonight expedition. But then, she grew silent, and looked at Rick in a way that slightly chilled him, especially when she made a rather sudden and random jerk in no direction in particular. She slowly began to speak again, and Ricks face lit up. He may well get the chance to explore this place after all, and given the opportunity, who would honestly say no? However, it may well be dangerous out there, and did he really want to risk any of his partners being hurt again? Turning to Combee, the bee Pokemon smiled, and nodded as if to say ‘I give my permission’, so Rick turned back and willingly began to speak.<br />
<br />
“I’d be happy to help. Just tell me what I need for the journey, I may buy what I don’t have, and then I’ll be willing to leave when you’re ready for me to do so.” He grinned cheesily, this was going to be fun, Rick could tell.</span></span></div>

With the seawater dripping off you, each step you take brushes you against the cool breezes wafting from the forest's shade, sending involutary shivers across yourself as the water evaporates with the wind. The thought of delving deep into the fabled ruins sustains you, however; that you might discover more to the elusive truth of your past, and feeling confidence return with a state of dry clothes you trek onwards. The sounds of the forest surround you; infinite clicking of insects, flickering of various flora, even the spirits of the woods themselves seem alerted by your presence, looking on you in almost pleasant surprise. A variety of creepers and fungi litter the floor, most of which you've never recalled seeing in your life, while the homely stretches of cloaked expanse are punctured by spotlights of sun, poking through the gaps left behind by the towering trees.<br />
<br />
The pleasant, albeit monotonous experience continues for about twenty minutes' worth of walking, until you absentmindedly bump your foot against some debris and gravel. Looking ahead to your right, you spy a series broken stone blocks leading up to what appears to be a path -- likely, to the monument you've been searching for. A sudden wave of wind blows from behind your head, startling you as it careens past your ears and cheeks, and in that instant you have a faint, yet niggling impression of a whisper in your ear. Turning to its origin you see nothing but a stretch of trees and mushrooms, leading deeper into the darker forest, and even as you stare you feel the strange sensation of something tugging at your subconscious, only fragmenting into ethereal memory as your mind becomes aware of this. It seems, at least, two choices lay in front of you, but which will you choose?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: chartreuse"><span style="font-size: 9px">The girl now took some time to consider the two paths from which she had to choose. Would she take the fragmented ruins or travel deeper into the forest? She took one look at both. There was the stone path, perhaps leading to a monument, one that could be of her own heritage. But there was another route, one which was more convincing in its promise to unveil her roots. But then she stopped and remembered the rumors. Mr. Death himself inhabited this location, and already, the girl had almost come to her own end several times. But what would be worse, a life lived with no knowledge of the past, or death in the attempt to discover it? She considered all of this and decided that she would travel even deeper into the dark of the forest. She gathered all her strength and walked straight in...</span></span></div>

<b><u>Lonely Cubone</u></b><br />
Paired with your faithful partner after a long dry spell of inactivity, you find yourself refreshed to be adventuring alongside him once more in realms wild and unexplored. The journey in getting here, while undeniably exhilirating in its own way, certainly can't compare with what's to come as you stand outside the ruined shrine said to open up into sacred zones beyond mortal ken. Taking a step into the shrine, you feel as though the air around you has become choked, distorted, before you move into the open space illuminated ahead of you.<br />
<br />
In spite of what you've already read about the area, the sight of the seemingly endless field of stones and chains all suspended in mid-air is enough to take your breath away, but you feel that awe is not the only sensation you're experiencing. A peculiar sense of constriction has your very heart captive, clouding your mind with layers of doubt and tension so subtle you realise might not have been noticed earlier. Even Marowak appears to be a little more jumpy, gripping his weapon tightly as he casts suspicious glances about.<br />
<br />
For a while, it almost seems that the tinted landscape has you completely captive, until an alert bark from Marowak casts your attention downwards; as the two of you stare down the flight of giant stone steps you see a cloaked figure advance towards you -- or should that be floating? Judging by the way it almost glides up the steps you're not even sure if the individual in the grey shroud is a person. As they near you spot a distinct, yellow ellipse at the back of the garment's long hood, when suddenly with a faint cry the figure collapses, revealing the pale face of a young woman lined by silky, black hair as her hood opens...</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: red">As he walked along the arid, yet fascinating landscape of Heaven's Gate, LC couldn't help but feel a little apprehensive. The place was undoubtedly...creepy, the war that raged here in aeons past still lingered both physically in the columns and chains that floated ominously around them and metaphorically. The atmosphere was not pleasant, and the silence was eerie, LC trying to breath as softly as possible as his footsteps made a dull crunch, the only noise to be heard. Even the usually stoic Marowak seemed to be uncomfortable in these surroundings, clutching his bone tightly like a child using a blanket for protection and reassurance.<br />
<br />
Some time later, they came to the head of a flight of huge stone stairs, which stretched forth as far as the eyes could see. The stone seemed to be Basalt, or something similar, as it was a Dark rock, which didn't help LC's general apprehension about the place. Drifting off into a daydream, he was swiftly brough back to the present by a bark from below.<br />
<br />
Maro! Marowak!<br />
<br />
Jerking his head quickly, LC followed Marowak's pointing hand a short distance before he saw something that made him freeze to the spot, a chill running down his spine. A shrouded figure was on the stairs, draped in a long gray cloak which covered the form of the...occupant. Involuntarily stepping back, LC and Marowak watched as the figure slowly drifted towards them, seemingly without feet or any sort of obvious locomotion. Marowak swung his Bone-Arm back, ready to attack, but a swift hand gesture from LC made him stay his hand as they observed. As the figure drew nearer, a yellow ellipse became visable at the back of the cloak, but almost the moment LC caught sight of the mark, the cloak and occupant fell to the ground, the hood falling back and revealing a face. LC was somewhat relieved to see that the figure was human, of a woman around his own age with black hair. The face though was very pale, and the woman wasn't moving at all.<br />
<br />
Stepping forwards, LC gestured again to Marowak to stay vigilant against suprise attacks, and spoke to the woman, unsure if she could hear and even if she could, if she was able to reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you hear me? What just happened? What was that?&quot; he kept his voice soft, not wanting to attract any further attention, shaking slightly from fear, and moved, gingerly, a little closer to get a better look at the figure before him...<br />

&quot;You'll help us? Most excellent, Rick; I can't thank you enough that you've offered to assist.&quot; Briefly expressing her gratitude, Claudia walks over to the shelves while Nono and Aloso continue picking up the mess, gingerly picking up shards and piling papers.<br />
<br />
&quot;We had planned to go tonight; the three of us, I mean, but given current circumstances as you know we simply can't go. You'll be by yourself, but I daresay a Trainer with Pokémon stands as much chance as a group of researchers if not more,&quot; muses Claudia, holding a thick book in her hand which she opens for you as she returns. Lines of writing, bearing distinct signs of having been rewritten over with newer ink as the old markings faded away, run down the pages and around a pair of intricately drawn diagrams. &quot;What you're looking at, Rick, is a Lunar Lily: a herbaceous species of flower unique to Rosalina Island and only blooms on the night of a full moon, before withering away at daybreak. It's not entirely rare to find these, but what we're looking for is the item you see in the other picture.&quot; Looking on the right page, you see what appears to be a gemstone shaped like a teardrop of liquid.<br />
<br />
&quot;In extremely rare instances, the water that pools at the bottom of a Lunar Lily crystallises into what people know as a Phoebe's Tear when a Lunar Lily blooms. There have been accounts that indicate the Phoebe's Tear possesses incredible magical properties; apparently mostly to do with restorative powers. That happens to be what we're looking for in our research -- however, as you've probably guessed, Phoebe's Tears can only be found whenever there is a full moon, and the next one's tonight.&quot; Looking back at you, Claudia continues, &quot;Now you see it's so important that the expedition is held tonight. We can't guarantee you'll find anything, though, but we're very appreciative that you've agreed to undertake this task in our place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Normally we would pack a number of items to safeguard ourselves, but given your situation you probably won't need them. It's certainly best to pack lightly to prevent any potential detriment to oneself or the environment, as a general piece of advice, and your Pokémon should be able to provide any self-defence if the need should arise,&quot; informs Claudia. &quot;There shouldn't be anything else, except for just one other thing... would you mind visiting the Hobbit Smithy? There's something we've left with the blacksmith, Chappi. Tell him Claudia sent you; it's something you'll need for your journey.&quot;</span><br />

As Marowak stands guard for anything that might appear out of nowhere, you try your best to rouse the female stranger out of her alarming state. Even as you hold her hand in yours you are shocked at how chilling her fingers are to the touch; as though it was the blade of a sword conducting the heat away from your hand. Looking into the aimless gaze of her half-shut eyes, wild panic starts to fill you when the young lady shudders with a cough, followed by several more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Agh... What... happened?&quot; Leaning forward on her own, the cloaked girl puts a hand to her forehead, still in an apparent daze of her own. Unsure of how to react, both you and Marowak can only watch as she massages her temples, before she turns around to look at you. Now that her eyes have fully opened you're startled to see how intense the crimson shades of her irises are, even as she meets your gaze with a clear expression of apprehension.<br />
<br />
&quot;You... saved me?&quot; she whispers, and in that instant you see her shoulders relax. &quot;I... thank you. If you hadn't roused me, I... I would... I don't think that I would have...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maro! Maromaro!&quot;<br />
<br />
The aggressive growling of your partner suddenly breaking the awkwardness and discomfort of it all, you quickly stand to attention at the signal; undoubtedly something most troubling must be approaching. You hear the air seem to slice up towards you in a sudden zephyr, harsh against your cheeks, and out of nowhere the shadow of a Flying Pokémon waves across you in its darkness. Cries of &quot;Skaaaarrr!&quot; are heard, getting dangerously louder with each passing second as the wind intensifies, before the flying figure makes its entrance proper a few metres in front of you. The Skarmory is not alone; riding on its back is another young woman; her untidy cobalt hair in spikes, a scar across her glaring face, her adventurer's cloak in tatters and a menacing scythe bound across her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you thought I would just walk away like nothing happened? No chance of that!&quot; she hisses at the shivering girl in the cloak, before glaring at you. &quot;If you don't want to be sliced to ribbons, stranger, you'll get out of here. I've seen enough death as it is; no need for you to join the ranks of the dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span><br />

<b><u>Excessive Spare Time</u></b><br />
Deciding on the path deeper in the forest, you make your way towards the darkened path, leading yourself further away from the ruined building in your quest to discover a hint of your past. For as far as your eyes can see the road ahead is strewn with little more than vegetation and darkness; the canopy from above seeming to drown out the sun's presence, leaving but enough light by which to see the way in front of you. Various smells and scents fill your senses, doubtlessly originating from the wide range of unknown flora surrounding you, and even as you walk you feel an uplifting spring in your step -- as though being in this mysterious forest has attuned your body to a calmer, much more peaceful frequency.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ras?&quot; &quot;Xegg! Exegg!&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly feeling your foot strike against something light, yet brittle, you seize to a sudden halt as the sounds of something tumbling into the leaves are heard. Peering ahead you spy six little elliptical figures rolling about in disarray, as well as a small orange creature floundering amongst the undergrowth. Struggling, the creature eventually rights itself on its spindly legs and larger, clawed forelimbs, while the other objects gather to form a sextet, and you find fourteen pairs of eyes glaring daggers at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Paras!&quot; &quot;Exeggcute!&quot; they cry, hopping up and down in clear anger. It seems that you've kicked into these local Pokémon by accident, and they're much less than happy about the treatment they received...</span></span></div>

The Skarmory is not alone; riding on its back is another young woman; her untidy cobalt hair in spikes, a scar across her glaring face, her adventurer's cloak in tatters and a menacing scythe bound across her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you thought I would just walk away like nothing happened? No chance of that!&quot; she hisses at the shivering girl in the cloak, before glaring at you. &quot;If you don't want to be sliced to ribbons, stranger, you'll get out of here. I've seen enough death as it is; no need for you to join the ranks of the dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"><br />

LC was jerked out of the awkwardness of the moment by the call from his partner behind him, and whirled around on the spot, hand instinctively shooting down to the Pokeballs on his belt, even though his strongest companion was already stood in front of him, gripping his bone tightly as he looked up. Tracing Marowak's eyeline, LC looked up, brushing his blonde fringe out of his eyes, and saw the source of his friends concern, a large bird descending straight towards them, causing the air to blow towards them colder than usual, chilling LC slightly more than before. <br />
<br />
As the bird drew close, it cried out it's name in a shrill scream:<br />
<br />
<i>Skaaaaaarrr Skaaarrmory</i><br />
<br />
The piercing sound caused LC to wince slightly and step back, and even the usually stoic Marowak's fur was on end in places, claws running slowly along his weapon for reassurance as the bird stopped just a few feet away. Mesmerized by the size of the Steel Bird Pokemon, LC hardly noticed it's rider until she spoke, past him and to the girl who was still on knees behind him. Her voice was as cold as the wind that seemed to blow through her, talking softly but menacingly. LC stepped across, putting himself between the two women, and in turn the Cobalt-haired aggressor adressed him, glaring with a ferocity which unnerved LC even more than before:<br />
<br />
&quot;Step aside, unles you fancy being cut to ribbons.&quot; Looking into her eyes, LC could see that this was not just bluster, for they were cold and almost soulless. The woman was clearly scarred, not just physically on her face, but something about her aura made LC feel that it would not be wise to mess with her. That and the massive Scythe on her back, which probably had a part in that decision making process as well. Still, the first woman was clearly defenceless and as much as he didn't fancy standing up to this woman, he didn't believe that he would walk away untouched as a witness either.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want with her?&quot; He asked, Marowak retreating to be by his side as he attempted to speak with the woman. &quot;You should do her no further harm.&quot; He glanced back at the stricken girl, still wrapped in the cloak to check on her, but then turned back to face the danger, trying not to show the fear that coursed through him, and waited for her reply...<br />

&quot;What I want with her? You're a little too old to be asking such stupid questions; at least you should've learned by now that there're questions best left unasked.&quot; As the Skarmory rider looks down on all of you, you feel the cloaked woman shuffle behind you, holding onto you by the shoulders for support; another chilling sensation going through you as her fingers brush against your neck like iced water. &quot;Now are you going to step out of the way, or am I going to have to carve a way out of your --&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>He's not going to do either.</i>&quot; An unfamiliar voice, coming like fingernails scratching a blackboard, rasp in your ear, until you realise that the voice's owner is none other than the cloaked girl behind you. Surprised, you try moving yourself to no apparent avail; somehow without you noticing your arms have become locked against your body in a solid grip like an iron vice. Looking to your side, you see the girl's face from the corner of your eye -- no longer trembling and helpless, but now with a most inexplicably sinister stare, almost piercing the woman on the Skarmory in front of you.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?! You...!&quot; &quot;Maro!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Ah-ah-ah.</i>&quot; The sound of weapons being drawn slice through the air as the woman grabs her scythe and Marowak points his bone, but much to your alarm you find three metal spikes suddenly positioned dangerously close to your neck; as your viewpoint travels along them you discover their origin: poking out of the girl's cloak sleeve where a hand might have otherwise been. &quot;<i>One false move, and his blood decorates the rocks.</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Accursed witch!&quot; snarls the scythe wielder, &quot;Let him go! Now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>You're hardly in a position to be making demands,</i>&quot; sneers the now not-quite-so-helpless girl, and reinforcing her point you feel the tip of her spikes pricking the skin where your jugular is. &quot;<i>Throw down your weapons. Skarmory goes into its PokéBall now, or else.</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Keh!...&quot; The stalemate, ticking into seconds that feel like hours, eventually sees the other woman landing her Skarmory, clearly knowing that at this point she has no other option as you stand captive. Cawing indignantly, Skarmory is retrieved in a flurry of red light, leaving the woman to fling her scythe and PokéBall to the rocks in a reluctant clang. Looking downwards, you see Marowak meet your gaze with anger and worry blazing in its eyes, before he too drops his signature weapon.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Heh...</i>&quot; A painful jolt jars into your behind as the girl shoves you with her kneecap, knocking you and Marowak to the dust in an unexpected show of her strength. Tumbling across the unforgiving stone, you feel the breath quite taken from you when the woman grabs you by the arm, holding you close. &quot;No questions,&quot; she insists in a harsh whisper. &quot;This is between me and her. If you don't run...&quot;<br />
<br />
Whatever the woman says next, you find yourself deaf to what she says as the sight before you petrifies your other senses. As the girl's thin lips twist into a smile bordering on demonic, the hood around her head seems to fuse into her hair, and without warning the tip of the hood rips open at the sides, lined with sharp-looking fangs like a grotesque mouth. Both her hands reveal themselves as the spiked formations you felt earlier; catching the light shining from above in piercing glints that make you wince just to look at.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Special delivery for the Gates of Hell. Kya ha ha ha ha!&quot;</i> Screeching like a banshee with a most murderous look in her eyes, the girl who's become one with her cloak saunters towards you...</span><br />

Certain that fighting your way out is the only option if not best, you release two of your trusted companions for your defence; both of them raring to go as Exeggcute and Paras chitter furiously. Quickly responding to your orders Torchlight and Volante work at reducing the enemies' accuracy; Volante kicking up a violent <b>Sand-Attack</b> from the forest floor as Torchlight breathes out a compounded choking cloud of <b>Smokescreen</b>. From within the cloud of obscurity you hear the two Grass-types, not having expected the near-blind conditions, yelping in surprise and fright. A possible thought that you might have settled this crisis early on spreads relief in your mind, but all of a sudden several energy orbs burst from the dust cloud, falling to your feet before they explode, followed by another squall, and yet another. As the <b>Barrage</b> rains over the three of you your Pokémon try their best to dodge the blows, but as this happens a wave of glittering purple powder finds its way over you. Instantly you feel sick to your stomach as the pores inadvertently find their way into your respiratory system, and doubling up in nausea you see both Torchlight and Volante likewise fall victim to Paras' <b>Poisonpowder</b>, as the explosions from Exeggcute's attack displaces enough of the smoke for you to see through them.<br />
<br />
With their targets back in sight your Pokémon dive in for twin <b>Tackle</b>s, albeit with pained looks on their faces, and as they ram into their foes you note with grim pride that they, at least, seem just as strong as the wild Pokémon if not stronger. Arcing into midair Volante screeches a caw of battle, swinging back into Paras in an elegantly executed <b>Fly</b> manoeuvre that sends the Mushroom tumbling. At once, Exeggcute hops in front of the scrambling Paras in apparent defence, glowing as it launches another <b>Barrage</b> that knocks both you and your Pokémon backwards. Picking yourself up, you note that Exeggcute still seems pretty capable of battling on while Paras has taken more than considerable damage thanks to Volante's elemental advantage, but things aren't looking too good for your team either...</span></span></div>

Ptomaine was never as harsh on its victims. She knew what this meant: poisoning. And it had just hit the entire team. <i>Of all the times!</i> She searched furiously for something to quell this, not for herself, but for her two friends.

Without any curatives at hand to stave the effects of poison, the best you can do is grit your teeth and grip your guts as you send both your Pokémon back into the fray. Being the most agile out of all Pokémon on the field Volante dives in for another <b>Fly</b>, swooping with a battle cry as her talons rake across Paras' body, but oddly enough you find a peculiar *plink* sound reaching your ears just as Volante makes contact with her target, while Torchlight heaves another helping of <b>Smokescreen</b> all about. Unfortunately, as the translucent cloud makes its way around the targets, you spot to your dismay the sheen of a <b>Reflect</b> barrier put in place; you realise it must have buffeted the physical blow Volante weathered upon Paras earlier.<br />
<br />
Sensing, likewise, that the ante has received a crank in the upnotch direction, both your Pokémon rev themselves for greater action to come; Volante driving home another <b>Fly</b> to Exeggcute and Torchlight ramming into Paras with a fullbodied <b>Tackle</b>, but a rippling sheen across your opponents confirm that the Reflect threat is still very much active. In spite of this, neither of your brave Pokémon show any signs of giving up despite the poison going through their systems; the two of them smashing in another <b>Fly</b> and <b>Tackle</b> in respective dissemination. A poofing cloud of powder suddenly erupts from Paras as it keels over, just as Exeggcute's twelve eyes glint with a strange blue glow. Even as Exeggcute and Paras fall limply to the ground you're shocked to see Volante crashland alongside the collapsed Torchlight; the effects of <b>Hypnosis</b> and <b>Effect Spore</b> distinctly at play, putting both of your Pokémon to sleep. Somehow -- whether from the effects of battle, or the mysterious gases wafting from the forest, you're not sure what -- you find your limbs losing their sense of touch, followed by a thorough sense of dull numbness overriding the remainder of your sensory functions, and the last thing you remember is your cheek thudding against the forest floor as the haze clouding your eyes drowns your vision in darkness...<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center">***&#8203;</div><br />
&quot;...Kid. Hey, kid! Wake up! Don't go dying on me now!&quot;<br />
<br />
The sounds of a gruff, unfamiliar voice are the first things you hear, after who knows how long, and with some considerable effort you feel your eyelids slide open, revealing the face of a goateed, middle-aged man looking down at you...</span></span></div>

&quot;You'll help us? Most excellent, Rick; I can't thank you enough that you've offered to assist.&quot; Briefly expressing her gratitude, Claudia walks over to the shelves while Nono and Aloso continue picking up the mess, gingerly picking up shards and piling papers.<br />
<br />
&quot;We had planned to go tonight; the three of us, I mean, but given current circumstances as you know we simply can't go. You'll be by yourself, but I daresay a Trainer with Pokémon stands as much chance as a group of researchers if not more,&quot; muses Claudia, holding a thick book in her hand which she opens for you as she returns. Lines of writing, bearing distinct signs of having been rewritten over with newer ink as the old markings faded away, run down the pages and around a pair of intricately drawn diagrams. &quot;What you're looking at, Rick, is a Lunar Lily: a herbaceous species of flower unique to Rosalina Island and only blooms on the night of a full moon, before withering away at daybreak. It's not entirely rare to find these, but what we're looking for is the item you see in the other picture.&quot; Looking on the right page, you see what appears to be a gemstone shaped like a teardrop of liquid.<br />
<br />
&quot;In extremely rare instances, the water that pools at the bottom of a Lunar Lily crystallises into what people know as a Phoebe's Tear when a Lunar Lily blooms. There have been accounts that indicate the Phoebe's Tear possesses incredible magical properties; apparently mostly to do with restorative powers. That happens to be what we're looking for in our research -- however, as you've probably guessed, Phoebe's Tears can only be found whenever there is a full moon, and the next one's tonight.&quot; Looking back at you, Claudia continues, &quot;Now you see it's so important that the expedition is held tonight. We can't guarantee you'll find anything, though, but we're very appreciative that you've agreed to undertake this task in our place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Normally we would pack a number of items to safeguard ourselves, but given your situation you probably won't need them. It's certainly best to pack lightly to prevent any potential detriment to oneself or the environment, as a general piece of advice, and your Pokémon should be able to provide any self-defence if the need should arise,&quot; informs Claudia. &quot;There shouldn't be anything else, except for just one other thing... would you mind visiting the Hobbit Smithy? There's something we've left with the blacksmith, Chappi. Tell him Claudia sent you; it's something you'll need for your journey.&quot;</span></span>

<br />
Rick listened intently as they spoke. Apparently, he was going alone for this journey. Well, he wouldn’t really be alone he supposed, he still had all of his Pokemon with him, so he wouldn’t be short on company. He smiled up at Belle, who fluttered around, still frantic, almost going straight into a bookshelf, but managing to stop herself and turn with great precision, fluttering to Ricks side and stopping after receiving a slight scowl from Rick. But Rick could tell it was only a matter of time before Combee attempted to restart again. Rick continued to acknowledge the conversation, and although Rick didn’t quite know why at least one of the group couldn’t come with him, he remained silent, waiting to receive his actual task. It appeared that his actual task would be to receive a Lunar Lily, some sort of flower that from the sounds of things was extremely rare, only found on this Rosalina island on the night of a full moon, before withering away again in the morning. Well, it at least seemed rare to Rick, but according to Claudia it wasn’t much so, rather, another item on the island being the rare object. A gemstone shaped like a teadrop was the required object, and by the picture, it looked like quite a nice object to have for yourself, and Rick could understand why anyone would want it. Rick was shocked to find out exactly how it was created, mind, apparently being formed by the water that accumulates at the bottom of the Lunar Lily, known as Phoebes tear. <br />
<br />
It also supposedly had magical qualities, apparently more to do with healing or restorative powers, and according to them that was exactly what they needed for their research. And like she said, Rick would have worked it out by now, but the object could only be obtained on the night of a full moon. Why they couldn’t go on another full moon, or one prior to this event to find the object Rick wasn’t certain, but he supposed he was just in the right place at the right time as far as they were concerned, which is something that he’s fine with. Rick did indeed see why it was important that it was held tonight, and also he understood vaguely why none of them could go, but he still was slightly annoyed at the whole travelling across an unfamiliar land by himself. Although he had done it before, it still wasn’t something he would chose to do if he could. She then went on to talk about the fact Rick probably wouldn’t need any items due to being a Pokemon trainer, and the fact he should probably pack light to avoid any detriment (Rick wasn’t honestly sure what that word meant) to the environment or himself for that matter, and she brought up the valid point that his Pokemon would be able to provide any self defence if the need was to come to light. He was then informed that he should probably visit the blacksmith, as the blacksmith possessed something that Rick would need on the journey. <br />
<br />
“Thank you for giving me an opportunity like this, I won’t let you down.” Rick stated, before turning to leave the caves, beckoning to Combee. The pair headed back along the path they came, and out the cave into the outskirts of Elendia once again. Rick glanced at Combee once again, who honestly couldn’t stay still. The buzzing was in fact getting fairly annoying, so he stated clearly “Belle, do you mind stopping the frantic buzzi-” He stopped in his tracks. Belle had indeed stopped the buzzing, but was now glowing a shining bright light. Her three heads suddenly fused together into one blob, before the blob grew a head out of the front of itself, the glowing light forming into a face, with two red eyes, pincer like appendages and a pair of what looked like some form of antenna. Wings spouted from the sides of the blob, similar to they were as Combees, except larger. Two, thin arms came out of the blob, with twin spiked fingers on each hand. Then, the bottom half of the body formed, a thin strand going downwards and suddenly expanding into what looked like some sort of dress, in a weird shape made up of seven hexagons, the dress being black and yellow. A small stinger like object hung slightly out of the middle hexagon, and the glowing light stopped, Rick being the proud new owner of what was a Vespiquen, who quickly turned around and looked at Rick, before looking at herself, flexing her wings and her arms. She was about 3 feet tall, and flew over to Rick, who hugged her proudly. The pair then turned, Rick having a large grin on his face, and with a requited nod they headed towards the Hobbit Smith.</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: lemonchiffon"><div style="text-align: center"><b><u>Elendia</u></b>&#8203;</div><br />
<b><u>Hobbit Smithy</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Handymankg2</u></b><br />
After a brief distraction culminating in the evolution of your starter, you make your way over to your next location within the village of Elendia; a short walk back through some of the local houses to a small establishment much like the village houses, but with a notably unique air and position of its own. Even as you near a few yards from the smithy's door the sounds of clanging metal and hefty grunting can be heard, and stepping into the hut you see a midget of a man bent over a rod of mysteriously glinting material, hammering away as a Sudowoodo sturdily holds the other end, sparks of energy fizzling from the strange ore with each hit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent, Sudowoodo; now we just need to... eh?&quot; Noticing your presence, the man glances towards you; years of hard work and experience having left their distinct prints on his darkened face. &quot;A Trainer, eh? If you came by Hobbit Smithy it must be for a reason. I'm Chappi; seventh in a line of nothing but the best in blacksmiths for continents around. What might I do you for, sonny?&quot;<br />
<br />
You take a while to explain yourself, with a few gestures from Bellatrix helping you as Chappi nods in understanding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Figures. It's about that time of the month, I guess, but I have to hand it to Claudia for wanting to try.&quot; Shaking his head, Chappi hops off the stand he was perched on, moving to one of several messy workstations he has lining the place. &quot;You probably don't know this, kid, but these days Lacrima Castle's not particularly attractive to tourists. The Arcs were a reclusive people, I'll give them that, but even they're not the sort to suddenly disappear for months without so much as a peep... it's nothing but bad news out there, kid; it's in the wind and the trees if you listen closely enough.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, don't let me stop you. Here's what you came for: an Item Ball,&quot; nods Chappi as he returns in front of you, taking your hand firmly and placing an orblike object in your palm; upon closer inspection you find that it doesn't look any different from a normal PokéBall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't let how simple it looks fool you, kiddo. Item Balls've been used for ages in the past, and nobody makes 'em like we do at Hobbit Smithy,&quot; Chappi grunts, thumping his chest in pride. &quot;Adventurers place crucial inventory in these things, and like PokéBalls do they keep their contents safer than any Trainer's grubby hands could ever do. No offence intended, kid,&quot; he adds, somewhat to your relief. &quot;You might want to get a headstart, kid. The sooner you finish that mission o' yours, the less you'll have to risk yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thanking Chappi, you prepare to leave, moving out of the open doorway as Chappi's voice trails behind you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, and kid! If you happen to find anything else a little out of the ordinary, don't forget to pop by!&quot;<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center">***&#8203;</div><br />
Only moments later as you walk about the outskirts of Riviera, the sound of another voice is heard from behind you; turning, you see a teenage boy with rutile hair and a purple, spiked helmet running towards you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... Rick, is it? I'm sorry we haven't had the pleasure of meeting earlier, but Miss Adryd asked me to hand you this. It's one of the few maps that we have of Rosalina Island; it might help you for your task,&quot; pants the adolescent as he catches his breath, handing you a yellowing piece of paper. &quot;My name is Triz, by the way; mining assistant to Elendia's Magic Guild. The others are hard at work recreating some of the equipment we can with the mined crystals... I do see you've retrieved the required inventory from Mr. Hobbit. I assume you have a Flying or Surfing Pokémon at hand, do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Not having expected this question, you mentally breeze through your current roster, looking at Belle who returns your gaze with a helpless shrug; even in evolution she clearly isn't capable of sustained flight with a passenger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, dear. Well, I'm afraid I have to get back to assist the others, but if you're in need of transport I can only think of two possibilities -- you might find a Pokémon you can use in the more natural areas in Elendia, or... well, there is another method of getting to Rosalina, but it's pretty risky. If you don't mind that probability, you could come look for me back in the Caverns. Just be discreet about asking; I don't want Miss Adryd to know.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Triz leaves you and Belle to your thoughts, an obstacle has already reared itself against you and the accomplishment of your quest. A few options are numbered for you, but whichever your decision you'll need to make it wisely and quickly...</span></span></div>

Without any curatives at hand to stave the effects of poison, the best you can do is grit your teeth and grip your guts as you send both your Pokémon back into the fray. Being the most agile out of all Pokémon on the field Volante dives in for another <b>Fly</b>, swooping with a battle cry as her talons rake across Paras' body, but oddly enough you find a peculiar *plink* sound reaching your ears just as Volante makes contact with her target, while Torchlight heaves another helping of <b>Smokescreen</b> all about. Unfortunately, as the translucent cloud makes its way around the targets, you spot to your dismay the sheen of a <b>Reflect</b> barrier put in place; you realise it must have buffeted the physical blow Volante weathered upon Paras earlier.<br />
<br />
Sensing, likewise, that the ante has received a crank in the upnotch direction, both your Pokémon rev themselves for greater action to come; Volante driving home another <b>Fly</b> to Exeggcute and Torchlight ramming into Paras with a fullbodied <b>Tackle</b>, but a rippling sheen across your opponents confirm that the Reflect threat is still very much active. In spite of this, neither of your brave Pokémon show any signs of giving up despite the poison going through their systems; the two of them smashing in another <b>Fly</b> and <b>Tackle</b> in respective dissemination. A poofing cloud of powder suddenly erupts from Paras as it keels over, just as Exeggcute's twelve eyes glint with a strange blue glow. Even as Exeggcute and Paras fall limply to the ground you're shocked to see Volante crashland alongside the collapsed Torchlight; the effects of <b>Hypnosis</b> and <b>Effect Spore</b> distinctly at play, putting both of your Pokémon to sleep. Somehow -- whether from the effects of battle, or the mysterious gases wafting from the forest, you're not sure what -- you find your limbs losing their sense of touch, followed by a thorough sense of dull numbness overriding the remainder of your sensory functions, and the last thing you remember is your cheek thudding against the forest floor as the haze clouding your eyes drowns your vision in darkness...<br />

The sounds of a gruff, unfamiliar voice are the first things you hear, after who knows how long, and with some considerable effort you feel your eyelids slide open, revealing the face of a goateed, middle-aged man looking down at you...</span></span>

She considered taking a look around, but then she realized that not even she knew where she was. She slowly stood up and, while she pondered dusting herself off, ultimately decided against it, lest she go through <i>that</i> ordeal again. She decided to examine her state after regaining consciousness She could walk upright, that was a good sign, she could breathe properly, her heartbeat was normal, nothing was stiff, her hand-eye coordination was good, no hallucinations. Surprisingly good for somebody who was barfing up her own organs, last time she checked.
