<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray"><b><u>Cemetery Entrance</u></b></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray"><b><u>Hayward</u></b></span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Conceding with Yuanli's views, you ponder the riddling inscriptions as you pore through your inventory -- with the little information that is provided, you're quite certain that the item in question is one of edible varieties, and the line &quot;of creatures adamant&quot; helps you to eliminate some of the other choices you have. Eventually deciding on a berry that you conveniently happen to have multiples of, you bravely extend a hand with the Pinap in your fingers, depositing the fruit at the bottom of the stone slab. Stepping back, you wait for something to happen, but nothing can prepare you for what takes place after a few moments -- right before your eyes, the skin of the Pinap Berry darkens in patches, until the entire of the spice-laden food is a disgusting, rotten shade of black. Deflating like a punctured beach ball, the berry releases a cloud of its stinging scent that ends in a putrid pong, before crumbling into the ground; somehow you have an image of the berry screaming as its freshness was wrenched away. Moments later, a low, ominous rumbling fills the passage as the stone sinks back underground, allowing you entry.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;They don't mince words, whoever put this in place. I suppose we should be thankful that a costlier toll was not demanded of us,&quot; sighs Yuanli, shaking his head. &quot;I fear that the tasks to fulfill will only become more insurmountable, but we must press on.&quot;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Everyone concedes in silence as you enter through the ivy-invested gateway, a sharp chill diving down your spine with your passing under its cover, and you can only feel stronger apprehension as the group moves into an open area of the catacombs. You find that while no torches stand in this area, light is provided by a variety of bizarre, spherical fungi sprouting about the landscape like freaky little light bulbs -- any other vegetation is sparse, with but several types of creepers and pitiful stems, curled and malformed by the lack of light and proper nourishment, almost like hands of the buried alive desperately trying to break free but to no avail.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;Very little information exists on the cemetery of Mireno. Even the research group who requested my services could only offer what they themselves had heard,&quot; Yuanli recalls to you. &quot;Some stories say that Mireno was initially a subterranean location of worship, others say it was a facility of study -- of whom, or what, I'm afraid no one can quite remember. But what is generally agreed on is that six priests attempted to, by means of Mireno, forge a gateway to what they called &quot;the promised land&quot;. No one knows what they meant, but since then Mireno turned into the wasteland everyone recognises. In fact, very few locals dare to speak of it directly, I hear, believing the name itself to be cursed. They say that the ruined village above is testament to Mireno's power...&quot; The sage pauses. &quot;What can be confirmed is that since the time of those priests, traps laid throughout the years are effective even today. If this would follow like the challenge earlier, Will, we must proceed in utmost caution, more than before... Chroma, if you don't mind, a <b>Flash</b> would help us out.&quot;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;SABL!&quot; You almost see the gears grind behind the imp's crystalline eyes, as a spectrum of light bursts out of Chroma's face, widening such that you can see the surroundings more clearly: a pair of dark caverns, heading to your extreme left and right, and deep in the wall ahead you're shocked to see another cavern -- the shocking characteristic being a series of sharp, steel formations the shape of fangs choking the entrance, with a single circular symbol embedded in the centre that makes you think of an eye.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;Another seal... My guess is that this new obstacle is far more stringent than the one we faced earlier,&quot; remarks Yuanli. &quot;Whatever lies behind it likely derived its origin of some fiendish power; unfortunately our final objective -- that is, to return the item to Mireno's centre -- lies beyond said barrier, and I doubt teleportation could bypass this. I can feel the intensity within these bones of mine.&quot; Indeed, looking to Chroma and Medéo you find both of them frowning as one; whatever they're sensing and you're not, they don't like it one bit.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;Much as I would prefer to spend less time in this miasma, it seems we have no choice.&quot; Turning to you, Yuanli nods as he continues, &quot;Without a better understanding of this place and its key, we cannot hope to succeed... Will, considering how your keen insights have brought us this far, I believe it will not be inappropriate if you decided the navigation for us. We need to explore the depths of the catacombs available to us posthaste in order to advance with the breaking of this seal.&quot;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Two choices lie around you for the moment, and now that Yuanli has placed the decision in your hands, what will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Faced with a decision about which passage to take, a myriad of questions filled Will’s mind and swirled around like a twister. The boy was certain that something sinister had happened in this subterranean location. <i>But what?</i> He recalled Yuanli’s tale of the six Priests, their attempt to open a portal to the “Promised Land,” and the resultant uninhabitation of Mireno. Will couldn’t even begin to guess what the priests had done, and had to admit that such mystical matters were quite beyond him.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Feeling slightly overwhelmed, Will massaged his forehead and glanced at Medeo. What had they gotten into? Ever since he had set foot below ground, a sense of foreboding had steadily grown inside of him. He now had the feeling that this old graveyard might not be all it had originally seemed. Secrets lay buried here. Mysteries dwelt here, occupying the seemingly vacant tunnels. As he recalled Yuanli’s warning, Will realized that one thing was certain, whichever fork he chose, they would have to proceed cautiously, as there was just no way they could predict when they might be walking straight into a trap.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">While Yuanli, Chroma, and Medeo awaited his decision, Will inspected the entrances to both passageways. As far as he could discern, there was nothing noticeably different about either one. Both appeared the same to him, but the boy knew that looks could be deceiving. The quiet, secluded tunnels seemed like the perfect place for wild Pokemon seeking shelter. He shuddered at the thought of encountering the massive rock-snake Onix in its home territory. Will tentatively sniffed the air surrounding the right entryway first, then the left, thinking he might just take the time tested advice of '<i>When in doubt, follow your nose,</i>’ however, neither tunnel smelled foul to him and he couldn’t detect the scent of any Pokemon. Shrugging again, he silently made his way back to the right tunnel, and motioned for the others to follow him.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">As he stared at the gaping opening to the rocky, right-hand corridor, Will cautioned Medeo, “Be careful, mate. There’s no telling what might be living down here or hiding in the shadows. Stay close now. I’m sure there will be side tunnels that branch off in all kinds of directions. It wouldn’t do us any good to get separated.” Medeo agreed and Will commented dryly, “If we get lost in here we could end up wandering around in the dark forever.”</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">The black-clad Trainer and the elegant Medicham chose the right tunnel, not knowing what they might find at its end…</span></span><br />

With the tide of battle turned around so abruptly and viciously, Rayne and Andromeda find themselves heavily disadvantaged as Pepper's summoned weather begins to grace the grounds with drizzle. All around, the Fire-types and Ogden continue holding off the Duskull, bursts of steam and flickering electricity dancing in midair swarms, but warranting more concern are the spectral cyclops standing stonily ahead. With twin cries <b>Night Shade</b> blasts issue from both their eyes, striking their targets home as the inverse laws of speed aid them in getting an attack in first. Unfortunately, the heavier gravitational field proves its undoing as Tortuga unleashes a lavish <b>Hydro Pump</b> from where he positioned himself, slamming into his Dusclops foe squarely below the eye; the technique's accuracy boosted by Gravity's effects albeit also washing off the gummy chocolate. However, as Pepper glances over his Blastoise it becomes noticeable that the heavy attack has drained Tortuga more than it normally would as he pants heavily -- at once, it hits the both of you that with Dusclops' only ability <b>Pressure</b> active, time would be more of the essence with each attack starkly reducing the battle capabilities of your Pokémon. Howling, Andromeda lets fly a hurricane's worth of <b>Thunder</b>, spiralling into the mummified spirit for major damage through the circuitry of the rainy weather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dus... dusclops.&quot; A knowing gaze is exchanged between both Dusclops, before their suspended fists rise as one in mid-air, and as energies in yellow and cyan gather sickened emotions of foreboding build in your guts. A <b>Thunderpunch</b> flies towards Tortuga while an <b>Ice Punch</b> heads at Andromeda; Tortuga succeeding in <b>Withdraw</b>ing into his shell to lessen the blow as Andromeda's dual Achilles' heel causes her to thrash about in numbness, discomfort and pain all at once. Eyes burning with proverbial fire Andromeda stomps the tiled floor, summoning stalagmites of ice where her foot meets the ground as the ice building up on her body splinters into multiple clods and shards. Pushed by her anger at being damaged, the <b>Avalanche</b> goes over fast and furious, burying Dusclops in a veritable mountain of the frozen liquid. The calm after the blizzard is soon shattered as Andromeda calls on a repeat <b>Rock Slide</b>, this time wrenching some loose bricks off the walls to further knock her opponent back six feet under, just as a wisp of air wafts out of Tortuga's shell and worms its way at the other Dusclops. A low moan is heard as Pepper's foe begins feeling the dull effects of <b>Brain Freeze</b>, but with your efficiency compromised severely, just how much longer can you last?...</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: DarkSlateBlue"><span style="font-size: 9px">With the ghosts’ abilities now activated the slope of the hill the two trainers had to climb was made all that more steep. Watching the outcome of Andromeda’s attacks gave Rayne an idea. Rayne quickly scanned his surroundings, weighing which target would be the best to aim at. The castle walls seemed like a decent target, but he didn’t want to risk collapsing the walls and burying the whole group in the process. The bridge would not be wise either seeing as it was the only route for trainers travelling by foot. The water below? Possible, but he didn’t know how effective that would be. Oh well. Rayne would worry about that bit later. All he knew was that the slick, wet burial mound that engulfed the ghost begged to be frozen over.<br />
<br />
“Andromeda! Try freezing the Dusclops’ casket while it’s still trapped with your most powerful <span style="color: DeepSkyBlue"><b>Ice Beam</b></span>. If it freezes, use all your <span style="color: White"><b>strength</b></span> to toss it up as high as you can; let gravity do the rest. Once it escapes its trap welcome it back with a <span style="color: LightBlue"><b>Draco Meteor</b></span>!” Rayne finished, a bit of a grin forming, excited at the prospect of witnessing the draconic meteor shower. This boosted gravity might even lend a hand in adding to the destruction … or so he hoped.</span></span></div>

<b><u>Moonlit Garden</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Dark Fire &amp; SilverWind</u></b><br />
With the tide of battle turned around so abruptly and viciously, Rayne and Andromeda find themselves heavily disadvantaged as Pepper's summoned weather begins to grace the grounds with drizzle. All around, the Fire-types and Ogden continue holding off the Duskull, bursts of steam and flickering electricity dancing in midair swarms, but warranting more concern are the spectral cyclops standing stonily ahead. With twin cries <b>Night Shade</b> blasts issue from both their eyes, striking their targets home as the inverse laws of speed aid them in getting an attack in first. Unfortunately, the heavier gravitational field proves its undoing as Tortuga unleashes a lavish <b>Hydro Pump</b> from where he positioned himself, slamming into his Dusclops foe squarely below the eye; the technique's accuracy boosted by Gravity's effects albeit also washing off the gummy chocolate. However, as Pepper glances over his Blastoise it becomes noticeable that the heavy attack has drained Tortuga more than it normally would as he pants heavily -- at once, it hits the both of you that with Dusclops' only ability <b>Pressure</b> active, time would be more of the essence with each attack starkly reducing the battle capabilities of your Pokémon. Howling, Andromeda lets fly a hurricane's worth of <b>Thunder</b>, spiralling into the mummified spirit for major damage through the circuitry of the rainy weather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dus... dusclops.&quot; A knowing gaze is exchanged between both Dusclops, before their suspended fists rise as one in mid-air, and as energies in yellow and cyan gather sickened emotions of foreboding build in your guts. A <b>Thunderpunch</b> flies towards Tortuga while an <b>Ice Punch</b> heads at Andromeda; Tortuga succeeding in <b>Withdraw</b>ing into his shell to lessen the blow as Andromeda's dual Achilles' heel causes her to thrash about in numbness, discomfort and pain all at once. Eyes burning with proverbial fire Andromeda stomps the tiled floor, summoning stalagmites of ice where her foot meets the ground as the ice building up on her body splinters into multiple clods and shards. Pushed by her anger at being damaged, the <b>Avalanche</b> goes over fast and furious, burying Dusclops in a veritable mountain of the frozen liquid. The calm after the blizzard is soon shattered as Andromeda calls on a repeat <b>Rock Slide</b>, this time wrenching some loose bricks off the walls to further knock her opponent back six feet under, just as a wisp of air wafts out of Tortuga's shell and worms its way at the other Dusclops. A low moan is heard as Pepper's foe begins feeling the dull effects of <b>Brain Freeze</b>, but with your efficiency compromised severely, just how much longer can you last?...<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: DarkSlateBlue"><span style="font-size: 9px">“Andromeda! Try freezing the Dusclops’ casket while it’s still trapped with your most powerful Ice Beam. If it freezes, use all your strength to toss it up as high as you can; let gravity do the rest. Once it escapes its trap welcome it back with a Draco Meteor!”<br />
<br />
Pepper glanced at Rayne through drizzled weather. &quot;Shifting gravity into our favor, why didn't I think of that?&quot; The man blinked, then gave him a suspicious grin, pondering what a diddler could possibly have up his sleeve. Hopefully, if his tortoise past IRON DEFENSE was still in play then Dusklops TRICK ROOM might have some effect on him as well. Though the plan could end up rather reckless. He wasn't, of course, and if he had been, he would have ditched them as early as possible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quick, that brain freeze won't hold for long! <s>BOUNCE</s> up and take full advantage of GRAVITY's pull and crash down on Cloppers, there.&quot; When Tortuga didn't respond, he raised a brow. &quot;I'll assume you don't like this idea very much.. Hmm, I agree.. With plenty of moisture in the air a chilling <b>BLIZZARD</b> would do fine, and if he should freeze use a <b>FLASH CANNON</b> to shatter the ice. Finally, all remaining energy into a <b>WATER SPOUT</b> atatck.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tortuga glared at Dusclops in stony silence, but Pepp let a lazy, sheepish grin spread on his face. &quot;What would you say if we capture a DUSCLOPS or DUSKULL and use Drought and Pathos interrogate with their abilities? Arceus only knows my psychic type could use the practice...&quot; </span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DarkSlateBlue"><b><u>Lacrima Castle: Wilheim Path</u></b><br />
<b>Stark:</b> Your trek across the cliff path continued to be just as eventful as before; that is, not that eventful at all. The sound of your boots meeting the ground broke the silence of the night twice every second, and while at first the sound bugs you, soon it fades once more into the periphery of your mind. The castle was still a ways away, by the looks of it, another thirty minutes or so at this pace would have you at the bridge. What you begin to notice is that this walk is far too quiet … the sound of your steps breaks the silence again, and you half curse at noticing that again. But, the silence around cannot be ignored; it’s dead quiet. The sea that spreads outwards beneath you is very calm tonight, no waves are hammering up the cliff’s face. There’s no wind, no pokemon, nothing … aside from your own footsteps that is. Curious, you scan all around you for anything living, and finally you spot three shadows cut across the abnormally large moon. Two Murkrow and a Honchkrow you identify quickly. They are much too far to hear however. <br />
<br />
Sure the silence was curious, but you don’t feel terrified; you know you’re not alone on this mysterious island. Whether the company you know is here, is friendly or not, is an entirely different concern. Suddenly, another shadow cuts across the night sky. This time it was much closer. The shape flutters overhead with amazing speed, circles around, before diving straight at you with incredible velocity. Instinctively you reach for a pokeball, but before your hand has the chance to unclip a pokeball the shape changes directions once more, disappearing above the cliff with a shriek of terror. Not entirely sure what to make of the exchange, you take a few hesitant steps forward. Realising the flying beast is not coming back for you; you walk on, occasionally stealing glancing above you for another kamikaze dive. <br />
<br />
Several more minutes pass uneventfully and now you could definitely feel an incline in the slope of the path, signalling the last stretch of the Wilheim Path. From farther down the path you could tell that once the slope steepened a bit, it curled around a bend where you could no longer see the path, before emerging once more in your line of sight right at the foot of the bridge that would lead you to the castle. Knowing your goal is now less than ten minutes away you pick up your pace slightly, reaching that bend that you had spotted earlier. You take the turn, not thinking much of the blind corner. No one could have been prepared for what waited for you around the corner. It wasn’t the sudden appearance of another human on the path that startled you, but rather who that person was. You were looking straight into your own eyes; the man in front of you was you!<br />
<br />
“You came?! This … this can’t be … this is just like before. Impossible.” The man … you … babbled. There was no mistaking it. The man’s voice was yours, a little hoarse and tired, as if you’d aged a bit, but definitely your voice. “I only … why? I only stopped for a second … this is just like before … just like.” His voice was frantic, scared, crazed. You were speechless. The man was wearing exactly what you had on at the moment, although his garb was tattered and covered in blood. The same red coat, every article of clothing the same, and yet this man was not you; this man was off. He looked like he was insane. His eyes darted incredulously from place to place, stopping on your awe-stricken face every few moments. The man’s breathing quickened, he started mumbling to himself, pulling at his hair (he was missing several chunks; apparently he pulled hard) and fidgeting. <br />
<br />
“No … no … haha … ha … no … impossible … unbelievable … just like before.” He was definitely insane, and being around him made you uncomfortable. “You … I mean me … me in the past … no not in the past … this is the present … listen … make all the right choices … don’t make my mistakes … you’ll end up where I am …” After giving you his warning, the man pushed you to the side and ran for it; the opposite way you were heading. To your horror you watch as the dark shape from before hurtles downwards from the sky, slamming hard into the man’s body. You reach out to him, but he was past the point of no return. He tried to catch his balance on the edge of the path, but lost that battle. The sound of his body shattering onto a protruding rock preceded the splash by a fraction of a second. He was gone. Suddenly you feel really woozy, and you lean against the cliff face for support. As you slide down to take a seat your head naturally cocks back and for a brief second you think you can see a face looking down at you from above the lip. You blink once, and the face is gone; must have imagined it. First the flying beast, now this? What was wrong with this island? <br />
<br />
It is only then that you notice that the rock face across from you had eyes; eyes that were staring directly at you with evident anger. The eyes blink and you flinch, not really expecting it. The eyes open up once again, but now they were pulling out of the rock, gaining three dimensional shape. The dark purple eye sockets followed, then the floating hands, finally the full body of a majorly pissed off Haunter hovered above you.<br />
<br />
“Haunter!” It accuses sharply, pointing one of its crooked fingers at you. You woke this Haunter from its slumber and it is not at all happy to see you. <br />
<br />
<i>How will you react?</i></span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DarkSlateBlue">Stark grabbed a pokéball and released its contents to reveal Pidgey. &quot;Pidgey use your <span style="color: Red"><b>Agility</b></span>to pick up your speed. Then hit that Haunter with a <span style="color: Red"><b>Faint Attack</b></span>. If it still wants more kick up a <span style="color: Red"><b>Whirlwind</b></span> to try to drive it away.&quot;<br />
<br />
Normally he wouldn't be so apt to just rush into a battle, but the encounter with... well himself, had him a little out of sorts. Not to mention the nauseous feeling he had from when he... or future he had fallen off the cliff edge. Was this really to be his Fate? Insanity and bone crunching death at the edge of the path? So much for the future looking bright. Maybe he shouldn't have come to this place after all.<br />
<br />
His eyes traveled back to the Haunter. He had faced a number of ghosts in the past. Something about always getting himself mixed up in some kind of crazy supernatural adventure seemed to follow him wherever he went. It almost made him wish he owned a proton pack. Still, his experience had taught him that when dealing with ghosts, not everything was always what it seemed. Not that it wasn't still disconcerting seeing yourself insane and clumsy. He was definitely spooked. Then there was that flying thing.<br />
<br />
He tried to picture what it could have been. It didn't look like any bird he'd ever seen. Of course, it was dark and the creature was moving extremely fast, so ruling out it being a bird would be like saying a meowth isn't a cat because it walks on two legs instead of four. Whatever was going on around here, he only had two choices. Leave or push on through. Either one could mean he would end up with the same Fate as the man, him, who went nuts and fell to his doom, but the future wasn't written yet and he would only give himself a headache if he tried to wrap his mind around all of the problems with the Destiny/Free Will debate. Better to keep moving forward and do the best that he could with the knowledge he had. He had told himself, and just the thought of that was freaky enough, to make the right choices. He wasn't sure what that meant, but it had to be more important than what it seemed on the surface. No matter what the future couldn't get any worse than what it had been for him.<br />
<br />
Stark shook his head to clear the thoughts from his mind. Speculation wasn't going to get him anywhere and Pidgey was going to need him. Pushing himself up off the ground, he stood up and focused on the battle above. The future would have to wait. For now he had to live in the present and presently he had an upset ghost to deal with. &quot;Alright Pidgey! Go Get 'em!&quot;<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Chartreuse"><b><u>Nelde Ruins: Wiese Forest</u></b><br />
<b>Demon Skittles:</b> Having no problem at all locating the fringe of Wiese Forest, Prestige and yourself march into the forest, ready to begin a new chapter of your adventures. At first the going is slow, seeing as this new terrain is less suitable to your choice of footwear. The soft soil of the forest parts much more easily under the pressure of your heels in comparison to the rocky substrate that makes up the other parts of Riviera. Prestige did not miss your slightly altered swagger, but kept the comments to himself for the time being. Judging by his face he was having a hard time restraining himself. Almost instantaneously you notice a change in your Kadabra’s demeanour, his face contorting slightly, a crease forming on his forehead. <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… Hold on …&gt;</i> He beams to you in alarm. <i>&lt;… Take two steps to your left, and then continue walking in the same direction …&gt;</i> Mildly confused, you do as he instructs, shooting him a questioning stare. Before you get the chance to ask him about what had just occurred, Prestige’s voice once again cuts into your head. <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… You were two steps from setting off some sort of trap …&gt;</i> You glance backwards to where you would have stepped had he not warned you, but don’t see a thing. <i>&lt;… It’s not physical. I can’t see it at all, but I can sense it. Whoever laid this out knew what they were doing, because I couldn’t pick up its signature until we were within three yards of the thing …&gt;</i> You follow Prestige’s gaze to the trap, but once again find that your eyes are not registering anything out of the ordinary; just grass and leaves. Suddenly you realise how lucky it was that you were wearing those heels. Had you not and instead worn hiking boots, or running shoes, you probably would have walked right into the trap before your extrasensory partner noticed the magical trap. <br />
<br />
Before either of can analyse the situation further a shrill screams cuts through the forest, not terribly far from where you were, followed by a deep thud. Initially you wonder if someone had stepped into a nearby trap, but what you hear next dispels that theory: <br />
<br />
“H-h-h-h-help … some-some-so-someone? HELP!” Up ahead through the trees, in a moderately sized clearing you spot the distressed man. He is sitting on the ground, eyes fixed ahead in terror, kicking and clawing as fast as he can away from whatever he’s staring at. This time it’s the man’s gaze that you follow, and then you notice it … his stalker, and you can’t believe what you’re seeing. While the trees slightly obstruct your view, there is no doubt about it. You are staring at a giant, green Victreebel. From where you stand you would estimate its height to be roughly eight feet. As if the immense size of the thing wasn’t enough of a tip off, the colour most certainly sent warning flags flying. The normally bright yellow flower portion of the pokemon is the exact same colour as its leaves; meadow green. The red lips that normally line the top of its mouth have also been painted green of a slightly different shade. The stalk, the terminal leaf, everything but its eyes, all green. You watch in disbelief as this monstrosity slowly closes the distance between hunter and prey. <br />
<br />
“HELP!” The man yells again. The Victreebel swiftly lashes out with a vine, smacking the man face with such force it almost feels as if you’ve been slapped. With another vine it easily coils the ankle of the helpless man, with ease lifts him over its head, and slams the man into the ground. The Victreebel retracts its vines, cackling to itself, as the defenceless man blindly searches for his glasses that were flung off in the process. How he moved at all after that display was beyond you. As he searches, the grass type begins spitting up thick globs of acid all about the place, making the clearing a minefield of corrosive garbage for the man to sift through. Clearly, the mutant Victreebel is just toying with its prey for the time being. Soon, however, it would land the final blow and walk off with its catch. <br />
<br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Chartreuse">Upon hearing the desperate cries of what seemed to be a man in need, Alina hobbled off into the trees as fast as she could, cursing and stumbling through the forest as the roots that protruded from the ground hindered her. Upon reaching a clearing she found the man who was crying out for help, his eyes wide with terror as he tried to claw and scramble away from whatever had him in such a panic. The trainer followed the man's gaze into the trees to find the source of this man's fear: a giant, green Victreebel.<br />
<br />
Letting out another loud curse Alina stumbled back and dug through her pockets to find a suitable Pokemon to deal with this beast. Meanwhile, the Victreebel continued his assault, smacking the man with its vines violently and wrapping another vine around his ankle, picking him up and throwing him to the ground. Alina watched and winced helplessly as the man forced himself up to search for his glasses, which had been flung off in the process. She couldn't help but commend him for his endurance. After all, she definitely knew she couldn't take a beating like that...<br />
<br />
The Victreebel cackled maliciously at its prey, then spat up thick globs of purple acid around the clearing to toy with its prey further. Alina winced again, this time in disgust. &quot;I never really cared for grass types,&quot; she said to Prestige. &quot;Now you see why...&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally finding the right pokeball, Alina quickly tossed it into the clearing, releasing her Charmander, Alberta. She heard Prestige scoff behind her, then heard the familiar telepathic voice ring through her head. <i>&quot;Ignatius would have been a better choice for this Pokemon. Alberta doesn't have nearly enough experience to handle this thing--&quot;</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sure she does,&quot; frowned Alina. The Charmander, however, stared up at the giant Victreebel, then at the minefield of acid, then to her trainer, giving Alina a look of utter horror.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Fine, but don't cry to me when the forest catches fire because of that flame on her tail, or a poor use of fire type moves,&quot;</i> Prestige sighed, waddling over to the clearing to use his psychic powers to find the man's glasses for him. <i>&quot;She could be more dangerous than the Victreebel if you're not careful. Trees ARE flammable, Alina.&quot;</i> <br />
<br />
Alina shook her head, then turned her attention to Alberta who looked rather annoyed that she had to get her trainer out of another mess.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alberta, I want you to use <b>Ember</b> to drag it out of the trees first. I don't want to start a forest fire, so be careful,&quot; Alina ordered, glancing over at Prestige. &quot;Use <b>Dragon Dance</b> to warm up and end with a <b>Fire Fang</b>.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alberta nodded sadly, longing for another relaxing vacation already. She carefully made her way into the minefield of acid, then began her own assault to distract the Victreebel away from the man. Alina, now seeing the grass type more clearly, saw that its colors were slightly off... it seemed more green than what she remembered a Victreebel to be. Was this its natural colors, or was it altered? It was completely green, and that didn't seem quite right. However, she dismissed the questions in her head, deciding there would be a time to ask them afterward. The trainer herself then carefully made her way over to the man, avoiding huge globs of acid on her way and keeping one eye on the Victreebel. She hoped that Alberta would be enough to distract the Victreebel while she made her way into the clearing, and if that wasn't enough then Prestige would surely be able to protect her with a Barrier or Light Screen until she got the man to a safer place. Once Alina had reached the man she held her hand out to try to help the stranger up. Prestige had found his glasses and handed them to the stranger while Alina introduced herself and asked, &quot;You alright, sir? It's a stupid question to ask after being thrown around like that, I know. What are you doing way out here..?&quot;</span></span></div>

In desperate times only desperate measures prevail -- or how did that saying go again? Regardless of the wisdom's source, it doesn't take long for the both of you to catch onto the brainwave Rayne's caught on. Maybe it was the stunning effects of the attacks you used or the unexpected comeback, but for whichever reason the Dusclops duo seem too occupied to strike first: an opportunity that does not go unnoticed as another blast of ice, strong as a wintry <b>Blizzard</b>, jets out of Tortuga's ports and cannons. Honed by the gravitational field, the widespread snowstorm strikes both Dusclops simultaneously, and not long afterwards Andromeda pushes the remainder of her frosty prowess in an <b>Ice Beam</b> towards her directed foe. Already caked thoroughly with rime and debris, Dusclops can only take the freezing laser that further adds to its icy prison, for even with the rules of Trick Room in place it doesn't help with complete immobility.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dus. Clops. Clops.&quot; Steady as it goes, the Dusclops faced by Pepper and Tortuga is the first to move, its hands first recovering out of the cold with a <b>Fire Punch</b> blazing the melted trail -- and per his orders, Tortuga stares steely ahead; his opponent no longer under the freeze status. The same though cannot be said of the other Dusclops on the field, and lumbering ahead Andromeda brings her fearsome face down to seize the imprisoned ghost. While the existing conditions turned the speed aspect of her earlier boost against herself, the offensive half of Andromeda's Dragon Dance still held strong, and with that increment she displays a bout of incredible <b>Strength</b>, wrenching Dusclops from the loose ice and stone. Still locked in its status effect, Dusclops is none the wiser until the laws of physics activate into Andromeda's trajectory, bringing it down with a resounding crash.<br />
<br />
None too pleased about the bout that it's undergone during hibernation, Dusclops heats things up as a <b>Will-o-wisp</b> spirals from its eye, grazing against Andromeda and leaving a raw burn in its wake, bringing another screech out of the dragon as she feels the base of her neck sizzle in discomfort. Hardly any time passes by before Andromeda is given another reason to shout: a sharp <b>Shadow Punch</b> to her face delivered by the other Dusclops, no longer content with sticking to fixed adversaries. Having observed the battle so far, Tortuga emerges out of his shell as does his cannons, blasting a <b>Water Spout</b> as far as his vitality dictates. Only moments ago plagued by ice, the two Dusclops shudder as the healthier Blastoise rains boosted terror onto them, but their troubles are not quite over as Andromeda, thoroughly incensed by the concerted attack, erupts a <b>Draco Meteor</b> out of her open jaws. A collection of streaking mystical energy pours forth from its point of origin, half hovering in midair before falling as one, and the stark sclera of Andromeda's foe spells its panic only too clearly. Like watching a house falling down you see blocks of stone and ancient dust rise from ground zero, feeling the shockwaves left behind the meteoric swarm rattle your bones through the damaged flooring. A surge of smoke follows, spattered with glints of mysterious red light, and by the time to coast clears to the sounds of your Pokémon heaving and panting, Andromeda's Dusclops is nowhere to be seen...</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: aqua"><div style="text-align: center"><b><u>Tetyth City</u></b>&#8203;</div><br />
<b><u>Carnea District</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Cod of War</u></b><br />
With one enemy down and only one more to go, experience in judgement informs you that in spite of improved odds caution is still the better course of action considering reprisals from Octillery were a likely consequence. Sure enough, true to your prediction Octillery flails its tentacles in apparent anger, its head shaking like a machine gun with the rat-tat-tat-tat of a released <b>Bullet Seed</b> headed straight for the Walrein warrior. It takes quick reacting on Arctacea's part in firing back a <b>Bullet Seed</b> of his own to prevent the Grass-type move from striking Eriden for super-effectiveness, and for a while neither barrage seems to back down in intensity, until the botanic strength from Octillery's mouth filters out; the probability involved in the multi-hit technique not apparently favourable to the crimson mollusc, leaving it to be battered by the remainder of Arctacea's move.<br />
<br />
&quot;Till till octill!&quot; Its voice reaching a fever pitch in anger, Octillery proceeds to fire a screaming <b>Psybeam</b> at Arctacea, slamming into the little Snover as he gives a squeak -- performing a brief lookover, you're relieved to find that no signs of confusion have set in. Waving his arms in near mimicry of his foe, Arctacea swings up a <b>Giga Drain</b> out of his fingertips, snatching fragments of health and energy alike out of Octillery, who doesn't seem to enjoy the draining any better than the seeding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmmm!&quot; A loud grunt of concentration from Eriden is heard; glancing aside you see him force his hand ahead as though pushing something heavy and invisible, and feeling the water puddling beneath you shift ahead you turn your attention downwards. In one accord the water appears to surge ahead by Eriden's hydrokinesis, coming and swirling together around Octillery before erupting upwards in a small-scale, though no less grand <b>Waterfall</b>. Holding the physical aquatic move steady, Eriden nods at Arctacea -- a signal that the frozen fir catches on from their teamwork together, and relying on the guaranteed accuracy from his initiated weather Arctacea releases his <b>Blizzard</b>, sending snow and ice at the rising torrent of water. Soon enough, the liquid formation glazes over with a layer of ice, spreading and creaking until Octillery is well and truly bound inside its cruel grasp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Time to end this. Once and for all!&quot; Taking a few steps forward on his flipper feet, Eriden flexes his pectorals in an apparent move to psyche himself up for one big finish, though considering his lower limbs you wonder what sort of epic display he has in mind. As if answering your doubt about his mobility, the surrounding waters begin to build up once more, this time piling up about Eriden and slowly but surely lifting him in suspension. With a war cry Eriden promptly points ahead, sending the wave forward and carrying him with it, leaving wisps of dark energy in his departure. Recognising the moves <b>Surf</b> and <b>Crunch</b>, your mind is broken out of his reminiscing as Eriden crashes into the ice pillar with a resounding shatter. Briefly recalling that Walrein pack enough power in their fangs to reduce icebergs to dust, you peer from behind the huffing man to see Octillery in the centre of a diamond dust storm, its tentacles eagle-sprawled in its unconscious state. <b>Level-up for Arctacea</b>.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, you two. We've lost enough time as it is, having to contend with this obstacle,&quot; chides Eriden. &quot;The road ahead is difficult as it is; we could all do with less of these interruptions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Having just engaged in a rather active battle, the ensuing minutes of progress as your reunited group shuffles onward is considerably less eventful. Everywhere you turn you see tarnished walls of marble, some having already given up the struggle against time's ravages leaving only pitiful piles of rubble behind. Closer inspection on a few occasions informs you that at various points in time long past, the water must have risen enough to submerge at least half the houses' height -- certainly, it's a good thing you now have the privilege of entering the sunken city at low tide.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are several ways of entering the inner part of the city, but all go through the huge battle arena people know as Colosseo,&quot; explains Eriden, when you come to a sloping set of impenetrable walls. &quot;The fastest way, though, as far as our knowledge extends would be through here,&quot; he continues, pointing to an unforgiving door right ahead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh, I remember this! You had to do something to the panel thingy over there!&quot; Seroba quips brightly. Looking in the direction of her excitement you spot a red panel upon a raised platform; you get a very strong impression that it was purposed to be stood upon.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's right. When we discovered this part of the city Seroba stood on the panel, prompting the door to shift itself open,&quot; Eriden nods. &quot;That was the first time, though -- the second time we encountered this sector, Seroba failed to activate the door. It was only when I took her place that the door opened, allowing her access inside Colosseo. The elders believe that in Tetyth's past the higher classes joined their inferiors in partaking of Colosseo's pleasures, but had a specially coded doorway that only they who possessed its one-time key could enter the passage that led to the best seats, and the most immediate way into the Aura Plateaus... An individual would stand here and keep the gateway open for the most important people, and when all had entered the individual would be locked out without someone to hold the door for them. A variety of places in Tetyth have similar random codes, so the elders said. They were designed such that only the elite could truly walk free in their city, and even now continue to carry on their selfish wishes.&quot; Walking over to the panel, Eriden places a hand onto the red surface; for a brief moment a series of symbols you don't recall ever seeing before flash brightly, before vanishing into the brick shade. &quot;Looks like this time we need someone weighing 160 to 180 kilograms to stay here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha! That someone won't be me. I'm WAY too light for that!&quot; declares Seroba proudly, then narrows her eyes in a most teasing manner. &quot;Say, you're not trying to tell our friend here how much I <i>do</i> weigh, are you, Eriden?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would gain nothing from such a venture, Seroba; nor would I have the motivation to. It serves absolutely no meaningful purpose,&quot; mutters Eriden. &quot;Unfortunately, I cannot remain here to open the gate for you; the both of us must accompany Jamie through his journey.&quot; Standing up to face you, the expression on Eriden's face is solemnly clear. &quot;I apologise, Jamie. But if we are to continue, you must leave one of your Pokémon here to keep the door open. I'm afraid that the nature of the passage prevents anyone from using the PokéBall's capture net to retrieve their Pokémon, so whomever you can leave behind, you need to make the choice well.&quot;<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkslategray"><div style="text-align: center"><b><u>Mireno Cemetery</u></b>&#8203;</div><br />
<b><u>Catacombs</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Hayward</u></b><br />
With no choice but to plunge ever deeper into the forbidden graveyard, you make your selection as to where to go next, hoping that you haven't already bitten off more than you can chew. Silently nodding, Yuanli points his staff in the direction of your choosing, leading the group towards the southern catacombs. Keeping a vigil with light filtering from his eyes, Chroma rotates his head like a living flashlight, although in retrospect there isn't a lot to look at. Where the ghost town had been pitiful, the cemetery itself was thoroughly steeped in despair with no alteration in its grim landscape. Unable to hide the fear in your eyes you glance at Medéo, who looks a mite perturbed himself...<br />
<br />
&quot;Sabl! SABL SABL SABL!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good heavens!&quot; Suddenly seizing up in a halt, Yuanli's gesture surprises you, but it soon pales in comparison to the discovery just metres ahead. Lying with blood trailing from its fingertips and its clothes in mere shreds, a human corpse sprawls on the ground. Bravely Chroma totters to the head, gingerly pulling it up by the hairs, yelping as the grisly visage is clear for all to see. While you don't recognise the figure you can tell that however the person died, the petrified scream tells you it was in nothing less than sheer agony.<br />
<br />
&quot;Poor, wretched soul...&quot; sighs Yuanli, shaking his head and stroking his beard as ever, and meeting your concerned gaze he can only nod. &quot;I'm afraid your guess is correct, Will. Though he was one of those who stole from us, this was a fate I did not wish to befall him. Judging by the exposure of his skeleton and lacerations on his skin, he must have suffered grievous Dark and Poison attacks... what now, Chroma?&quot; Looking kindly at his Sableye, the sage receives a piece of tattered paper from the trusted Pokémon. &quot;You found this in the poor man's hand? Now what might this be that this person would save above his own life?...&quot; Mulling over the note, Yuanli frowns considerably before giving you the paper for a look yourself:<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center">Articuno 2<br />
Zapdos 3<br />
Moltres 4&#8203;</div><br />
Unlike the earlier riddle, you notice at once that this particular list has absolutely no hint as to what it might mean, but before you can pose any more consideration on the matter a sinister hissing sound is heard.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>What's thissss?! More intruderssss?! They would tresssspassss the sssssacred ground of our massssterssss?!</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...!&quot; Turning his head upwards, Chroma focuses his eyes on the area ahead, revealing a large snake towering in its uncoiled state, revealing fearsome markings on its collar. Stepping out from behind, a dark blue feline and black canine emerge, no less angry than the fully evolved Pokémon between them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sneasel, Houndour, Arbok,&quot; identifies Yuanli. &quot;To think that we would have to do battle so soon... Will, are you ready?&quot;</span></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DarkSlateBlue">The vanishing act of the Dusclops would normally raise an alarm in Rayne’s mind, but the distinct red sparks that peppered the smoke and rubble following Andromeda’s attack had the opposite effect. Rayne let out a tiny sigh of relief when the dust settled and only one cyclops remained. Although relief flooded him momentarily, he couldn’t quite shake the feeling of dread at the sight of those ominous red lights. Maybe the gut feeling he had earlier was correct, maybe this whole island was corrupted by Malice; that was an unpleasant thought. While the Malice situation was certainly a pressing one, at the moment Rayne had more immediate concerns to worry about. <br />
<br />
One more Dusclops remained standing, while its two opponents were quickly wearing their energy thin. They would need to end this battle quickly. Rayne looked over his grounded Salamence wondering to himself how much more she could withstand. Not much he concluded. Without her speed, or flying ability, that burn that drained her health and attack capabilities, the reduced special attack capabilities and the pressure set up by the ghost type. The fact that she was still conscious was quite the feat. Rayne made a mental note to get some defensive moves for his crippled dragon once he got off this island, seeing as she was clearly deficient in that regard. <br />
<br />
As much as Rayne wanted to recall Andromeda, he didn’t want to leave Pepper hanging with a one on one battle that could go either way. Andromeda could provide cover for Tortuga at the very least, but for that she would need to be rid of her affliction. As quickly as he could Rayne rummaged through his bag, locating the berry pouch with relative ease. Finding the right berry would be a bit more challenging, but to his great relief he spotted the pale blue berry near the top of the pile. With the <a href="http://forums.upnetwork.net/threads/18-Jirachi-s-Casino-Records-1?p=9062#post9062" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.upnetwork.net%2Fthreads%2F18-Jirachi-s-Casino-Records-1%3Fp%3D9062%23post9062&amp;hash=012444b28493dc10b633b07d8264605e" rel="nofollow noopener">Rawst Berry</a> firmly in his hand, Rayne ran over to Andromeda.<br />
<br />
“There, eat this girl.” The dragon didn’t look twice, snatching the berry from Rayne’s hand hungrily. “You did great there, champ. Do you think you got enough in the tank to help Tortuga out?” He asked, patting Andromeda lightly on her jaw. <br />
<br />
“Mence!” She replied firmly, but Rayne could tell she was hurting. Andromeda spotted the hesitation in Rayne’s eyes and stomped her foot with determination. She wanted to help her comrade out. <br />
<br />
“Right … then … use <b>Ominous Wind</b> and follow up with <span style="color: RoyalBlue"><b> Hydro Pump</b></span>.” Rayne cleared the path for Andromeda, hoping she wouldn’t need to exert herself much past this round. As he walked back to a safe distance he looked over at the Pepper and Tortuga, giving them a small nod of encouragement before turning his attention back to the one eyed menace that still had them locked in this battle.</span></span></div>

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray"><b><u>Hayward</u></b></span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">With no choice but to plunge ever deeper into the forbidden graveyard, you make your selection as to where to go next, hoping that you haven't already bitten off more than you can chew. Silently nodding, Yuanli points his staff in the direction of your choosing, leading the group towards the southern catacombs. Keeping a vigil with light filtering from his eyes, Chroma rotates his head like a living flashlight, although in retrospect there isn't a lot to look at. Where the ghost town had been pitiful, the cemetery itself was thoroughly steeped in despair with no alteration in its grim landscape. Unable to hide the fear in your eyes you glance at Medéo, who looks a mite perturbed himself...</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;Sabl! SABL SABL SABL!&quot;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;Good heavens!&quot; Suddenly seizing up in a halt, Yuanli's gesture surprises you, but it soon pales in comparison to the discovery just metres ahead. Lying with blood trailing from its fingertips and its clothes in mere shreds, a human corpse sprawls on the ground. Bravely Chroma totters to the head, gingerly pulling it up by the hairs, yelping as the grisly visage is clear for all to see. While you don't recognise the figure you can tell that however the person died, the petrified scream tells you it was in nothing less than sheer agony.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;Poor, wretched soul...&quot; sighs Yuanli, shaking his head and stroking his beard as ever, and meeting your concerned gaze he can only nod. &quot;I'm afraid your guess is correct, Will. Though he was one of those who stole from us, this was a fate I did not wish to befall him. Judging by the exposure of his skeleton and lacerations on his skin, he must have suffered grievous Dark and Poison attacks... what now, Chroma?&quot; Looking kindly at his Sableye, the sage receives a piece of tattered paper from the trusted Pokémon. &quot;You found this in the poor man's hand? Now what might this be that this person would save above his own life?...&quot; Mulling over the note, Yuanli frowns considerably before giving you the paper for a look yourself:</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray"><div style="text-align: center">Articuno 2&#8203;</div></span></span><div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Zapdos 3</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Unlike the earlier riddle, you notice at once that this particular list has absolutely no hint as to what it might mean, but before you can pose any more consideration on the matter a sinister hissing sound is heard.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;<i>What's thissss?! More intruderssss?! They would tresssspassss the sssssacred ground of our massssterssss?!</i>&quot;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;...!&quot; Turning his head upwards, Chroma focuses his eyes on the area ahead, revealing a large snake towering in its uncoiled state, revealing fearsome markings on its collar. Stepping out from behind, a dark blue feline and black canine emerge, no less angry than the fully evolved Pokémon between them.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;Sneasel, Houndour, Arbok,&quot; identifies Yuanli. &quot;To think that we would have to do battle so soon... Will, are you ready?&quot;</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray"><i>&quot;Sneasel, Houndour, Arbok,&quot;</i> Yuanli noted. <i>&quot;To think that we would have to do battle so soon... Will, are you ready?”</i></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Will nodded solemnly. “I am if you are,” he replied, quickly stuffing the tattered scrap of paper into his jacket pocket. He had no idea what the mysterious message about the Legendary Birds meant, nor could he begin to guess at how Arbok was able to speak the human language, but he did realize that it wasn’t the time for bothering with such riddles.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkslategray"><span style="font-size: 9px">Reaching into his messenger bag, Will quickly withdrew a shiny steel Poké Ball. Holding the silver capture capsule at arm’s length, he pressed the round trigger switch and a brilliant scarlet light appeared, which morphed itself into the form of a pudgy humanoid before fading, revealing the sumo Pokémon, Makuhita.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Released from the cramped confines of his containment orb, the Makuhita Suméo immediately reached inside one of his boxing gloves, withdrew some leftover food scraps, and began munching happily. Accustomed to being the decoy in his teenage trainer’s hair-brained schemes, Suméo now found himself in an unfamiliar role. He had never actually battled before and his topknot wiggled nervously at the sight of their advancing opponents. To his credit, he did his best to hide his anxiety. The carefree expression never left his face.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">As Suméo stood beside his Poké-brother Medéo, facing the fearsome-looking threesome, Will couldn’t help but notice how dissimilar his two fighting-types were. Medéo was tall, slender, and moved gracefully, while Suméo was short, portly, and slow. Like all Medicham, Medéo could last a month on a single berry, whereas Suméo could barely go for ten minutes without snacking. When it came to personalities, the two Pokémon were like diamonds and pearls. Hard, unyielding, and energetic, Medéo’s nature was the epitome of toughness while Suméo embodied smoothness; relaxed, happy-go-lucky, and laid-back.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Clearing his head in an effort to better focus on the upcoming skirmish, Will pushed his temporary observation on his partners’ personalities from his mind and thought hard to come up with a strategy. He knew that the Yoga Pokemon’s psychic capabilities would allow it to hit the poison snake for super-effective damage, while the obese little brawler’s <b>Thick Fat</b> would act like a layer of insulation, shielding him slightly from the ice and fire attacks of the remaining two dark types. </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">“Suméo, you take Sneasel. Medéo, Arbok is yours!” Will directed. &quot;We'll leave Houndour for Yuanli and Chroma.&quot; Medéo nodded and faced the cobra Pokémon, quickly adopting the <i>Gyarados-Sweeps-His-Tail</i> offensive Kung-Fu Stance. Suméo lazily took another bite of food.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">“With all due respect,” Will continued, nodding deferentially in Yuanli’s direction. “You might not favor such tactics, but I’m gonna go with what works for me… Medéo, Suméo, <b>Fake Out</b>, both of you, now! While they're stunned, Medéo, <b>Meditate</b> and Suméo, <b>Bulk</b> yourself <b>Up</b>! Then hit Arbok with a <b>Zen Headbutt</b>, Medéo, and Suméo, you follow up with an <b>Arm Thrust</b> for Sneasel!”</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Trusting that Yuanli and Chroma would deal with Houndour, Will encouraged his partners to look sharp and give their best effort in the upcoming fight…</span></span><br />

The sight of one of your preferred species in Pokémon clearly enthralls you, although given what you've only just experienced you decide to play this next approach with some diplomacy as well as deterrence. Assuming a pose of coming in peace you wait to see what happens as Bellatrix, understanding what you're trying to achieve, flitters back a few paces to give you some space. Save for the chirping sounds of local Bugs distances away, nothing seems to take place as you patiently bide your time, until a couple of the little Poliwag bravely totter out in view. Slowly, as they shift towards your feet, the others begin shuffling from behind their hiding spots, and as they gather you're quite certain this time that from the smallest tadpole to the largest Poliwhirl, the look of apprehension in their eyes is unmistakable; some even have bruises over their bellies and arms for some others, an assortment of fresh ones to fading ones.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wrath wrath poli!&quot;<br />
<br />
The gruff call instantly parts the group, forming two lines as you glance ahead -- the musclebound frame of a Poliwrath strides out to meet you, looking you over with wide, frowning eyes as it nears. You hear Bellatrix's buzzing kick up a pitched notch before you raise a hand, a silent message for her to calm down while Poliwrath continues to size you up. Some of the Poliwag, looking up at their evolved brethren, begin whispering excitedly, yet hushedly as the partial Fighting-type grunts and nods.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wrathpoli, poliwrathpoli. ...Poli, poliWRATH!&quot;<br />
<br />
You briefly see Poliwrath raise its hands at you, and in the instant of a blink you are immediately greeted with the sight of hordes of Grass Pokémon -- Weepinbell, Tangela, Parasect, swarming the grounds of the Moonlit Garden. Attempting to turn your head for a better look, you're shocked to find Poliwag and Poliwhirl flailing helplessly from the onslaught, attacked by the plant creatures without abandon. They are not the only ones -- groups of Wooper and Lombre fall victim to the attack, and everywhere you turn only super-effective carnage is seen. A dull, defeated cry makes you turn your head; you see a withdrawing, lumbering mass leave Poliwrath battered upon the tiles, a gleaming droplet within a long, twisted arm that niggles at your memory, before another blink brings you back to reality: Bellatrix holding onto your arm concernedly as Poliwrath stands, solemn as ever as the other tadpoles bow their heads.<br />
<br />
&quot;Poli, poli.&quot; Producing an item you identify to be a King's Rock from its hands, Poliwrath casts a forlorn gaze at the object. Slowly the pieces begin forming in your mind, as you realise the images Poliwrath showed you with its <b>Hypnosis</b>: the local Water-types were attacked by botanic opponents, likely more than once over a period of time, and they left with -- fear trembles briefly in your head, as you recognise the pilfered item -- something the Poliwag group desperately need. You recall briefly that Poliwhirl can't evolve with only a King's Rock; with no humans on Rosalina Island, the Moondrop must somehow have been key with the evolution inducer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wrath?&quot; Returning its gaze to you, the quiet plea is clear in Poliwrath's eyes...</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: darkslateblue"><span style="font-size: 9px">As the Poliwag families eventually came out from their hiding place, Rick couldn’t help but be shocked by the state of them. A good amount of them were bruised badly by something, or possibly someone. Perhaps attempting to negotiate with the creatures wasn’t the best of ideas, and his mind quickly went back to an event that happened only minutes ago with the Tangela. Was it worth the risk to keep standing here while these Pokemon were clearly in a damaged, and therefore probably vengeful, state? They were gathered fairly close to Rick now, apprehension showing in their eyes as they looked up at Rick. His heartstrings were being pulled quite substantially; who would do such a thing to a group of these cute little Pokemon? It was hard to tell if Bellatrix shared the same beliefs, but she was at least being tolerant, which is always good. A gruff call suddenly caught Ricks ears as the group parted in front of Rick, a Pokemon making its way forwards through the center of two groups. It was obvious that this Pokemon was the leader of the small pack, and Rick easily identified the Pokemon as a Poliwrath, its lean muscled structure along with the hypnotic spiral making it recognizable from a mile away. It seemed to be frowning at Rick, which further added to his suspicion that he was unwelcome here, and that he should depart as soon as he could. He again dismissed these thoughts, though; as he loved the Pokemon species too much to simply leave them here completely bruised and weakened. They’d be easy prey for the Tangela in this sort of shape, and he didn’t want anyone else to go through the wild savageness of an angered group of Tangela. At least he had Bellatrix to protect him; they didn’t. As the Poliwrath came nearer, it was obvious that Bellatrix was losing her patience with an angry buzz, but Rick raised his hand to silence her. She would have to be a bit more tolerant for a while longer. It appeared that the Pokemon was sizing him up, and he hoped that he’d see Rick wasn’t a threat, but a help to the little blue water types. The younger Pokemon appeared to be whispering excitedly as Poliwrath continued to look at Rick, making him feel slightly under pressure, whispering excitedly often signifying a fight about to happen. They all hush as the fighting type nods gruffly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wrathpoli, poliwrathpoli. ...Poli, poliWRATH!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick watched as Poliwrath raised his hands towards him, when he was suddenly witnessing a completely different picture. Hordes of grass Pokemon (Tangela, Weepingbell, Parasect) appeared to be swarming around the moonlit garden in which the Poli family lived. As Rick attempted to turn his head, he was shocked by the sights he was witnessing. It seemed to be some sort of cruel massacre, the grass types mercilessly ripping and slicing at the water types, who flailed and attempted to escape from the cruelty. The picture was disgusting, and it wasn’t just the Poliwag family being attacked, other water types also subject to the destruction and grief being caused. A cry from nearby alerts Rick, and it is not too different to the one just heard. It was Poliwrath for certain, but it looked utterly defeated, a grass type lumbering over Poliwrath in what looked like some sort of Tangela who held some sort of droplet item, but before further study could be initiated he was pulled back into reality. Bellatrix buzzed loudly, and Rick noticed that she was still holding onto his arm, and the Pokemon around hadn’t been harmed any more than they were prior. Or perhaps, maybe this onslaught had been the cause of this bruising. As the Poliwrath held out a Kings Rock, Rick pieced the puzzle together slowly in his mind. Poliwrath must have been showing him the past with a hypnosis attack, and holding the Kings Rock seemed to show Rick that they must have lost an item of value. The moondrop! That must have been somehow pivotal in the evolution of the Pokemon, as Rick remembered that Politoads evolved through trading, but no trainers existed here. Why would those Pokemon want it? Regardless, it was theft, and he couldn’t allow such blatant crime to be allowed. No, he would help these Pokemon get their item back.<br />
<br />
Rick nodded plainly and obvious, and asked “I’ll help you. Where do I find them?”</span></span></div>

<b>Kori Gotcha:</b> The severity of the situation is not lost on you as you begin to feel anger build up within you. The frustration of not being able to communicate would drive just about any person half past crazy, and yet you stand there not being able to quite place the pieces of the puzzle together. You know what you needed to do, but not how to pass that information along to your partner. Without commands Combusken was sure to get hurt, and that thought you could not stand. But then you also had yourself to worry about. If you lose this battle, you would fail the challenge.<br />
<br />
The grim warning of the invisible man runs through your head: <i>“Succeed and untold fortunes await you, fail … well ... you know what awaits you if you fail.”</i>. Maybe knowing what awaits you with failure would have been best, but judging by the way he uttered that final sentence was too discomforting. Panic and anger well up inside you once more as you watch the next round of battle unfold. Not given any instruction, Combusken is helpless as the Beedrill swoops down and unleashes a <b>fury</b> of <b>attack</b>s on him. Not caring too much for your obvious disadvantage the bee pokemon circles around shoots a stream of <b>pin needle</b>s at your Combusken. Instinct saves your fire fowl this time, as he rolls to one side and then forwards in a perfectly executed evasive maneuver. Combusken looks back at you with a worried expression and then shifts his gaze to your belt, then back up to meet your eyes; urgency now written all over his features. The Beedrill, angry that its latest attack was foiled, throws itself into a tantrum, glancing Combusken’s thigh with a rather feeble <b>Rage</b> attack. <br />
<br />
Combusken didn’t seem to take notice of this last attack. Instead it ran back to you, urgently pointing at your pokeball clip with one of his claws. Now it was his turn to play charades with you. Combusken closed his eyes slowly and deliberately before bringing his two hands to both his temples, making it look as if he was concentrating or meditating. He then snapped his eyes open, and pointed at your belt again. Out of nowhere the wind shifted, and you were all too aware that the Beedrill was barreling towards your distracted Combusken. The foe slams into Combusken with enough force to send the chicken hurtling through the air, and although you can tell that it hurt, the stare in Combusken’s eyes told you that he felt it was worth it.<br />
<br />
<i>What will you make of Combusken’s hint?</i><br />
</span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Chartreuse">Seeing Combusken barreling through the air sent a shiver up Kori's spine. It was because of his inaction that his beloved Pokemon was hurt. Everything was all on Kori to figure out not only that stupid voices riddle, but now Combusken's moves. Combusken's look of meditation and then the throwing motion, the little fighter figured something out and it was up to Kori before Combusken sustained any more damage. Another round of attacks from that Beedrill and it'll be all over for the both of them. It was at this realization though that Kori figured it out, this same realization making him feel incredibly stupid. He slapped his forehead as hard as he could. If whatever supernatural forces present had not been in play, the sound would have reverberated throughout the entire forest. <br />
<br />
Kori reached down to his belt that held his Pokeballs and pulled one out. He pushed the button expanding the little balls size and then tossed it out onto the field. In midair the Pokeball popped open and out came Kori's only hope for circumventing this not just the Beedrill, but the problem of not being able to speak with tongues, Kori's only psychic type pokemon, Girafarig. When Girafarig was released from it's ball, it rushed over to Kori and smiled, jumping up on top of him and licking the side of his face. Girafarig whinnied in happiness at seeing his trainer, or at least it would have if the forest's magic hadn't kept it from uttering a sound. Girafarig realized the problem and became confused. Kori held Girafarig's face and looked into it's eyes, concentrating his thoughts the best that he could.<br />
<br />
<i>That's right Girafarig, we got ourselves one heck of a weird problem here and I think your the only way that we're going to be able to get out of this one. For whatever reason, there's no sound from anything so I'm going to need you to help me out. I want you to help me relay my orders to Combusken alright! Now I need you to tell Combusken that I need him to use <b>Agility</b> to match that Beedrill's growing speed, then I need him to overwhelm it with <b>Ember</b> and <b>Vacuum Wave</b>. With all of that damage he's taken so far his Blaze ability should kick in soon. I need you in this game too Girafarig. After relaying my attacks to Combusken, I want you to get in there with a <b>Zen Headbutt</b> and knock the crap out of that damn Beedrill. After that, I want you to use <b>Astonish</b> to keep it from doing any more damage, and then try and heal Combusken with <b>Wish</b>. Give it everything you have Girafarig, this is your debut show.</i> thought Kori. He only hoped that his thoughts came through to Girafarig.</span></span></div>

In desperate times only desperate measures prevail -- or how did that saying go again? Regardless of the wisdom's source, it doesn't take long for the both of you to catch onto the brainwave Rayne's caught on. Maybe it was the stunning effects of the attacks you used or the unexpected comeback, but for whichever reason the Dusclops duo seem too occupied to strike first: an opportunity that does not go unnoticed as another blast of ice, strong as a wintry <b>Blizzard</b>, jets out of Tortuga's ports and cannons. Honed by the gravitational field, the widespread snowstorm strikes both Dusclops simultaneously, and not long afterwards Andromeda pushes the remainder of her frosty prowess in an <b>Ice Beam</b> towards her directed foe. Already caked thoroughly with rime and debris, Dusclops can only take the freezing laser that further adds to its icy prison, for even with the rules of Trick Room in place it doesn't help with complete immobility.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dus. Clops. Clops.&quot; Steady as it goes, the Dusclops faced by Pepper and Tortuga is the first to move, its hands first recovering out of the cold with a <b>Fire Punch</b> blazing the melted trail -- and per his orders, Tortuga stares steely ahead; his opponent no longer under the freeze status. The same though cannot be said of the other Dusclops on the field, and lumbering ahead Andromeda brings her fearsome face down to seize the imprisoned ghost. While the existing conditions turned the speed aspect of her earlier boost against herself, the offensive half of Andromeda's Dragon Dance still held strong, and with that increment she displays a bout of incredible <b>Strength</b>, wrenching Dusclops from the loose ice and stone. Still locked in its status effect, Dusclops is none the wiser until the laws of physics activate into Andromeda's trajectory, bringing it down with a resounding crash.<br />
<br />
None too pleased about the bout that it's undergone during hibernation, Dusclops heats things up as a <b>Will-o-wisp</b> spirals from its eye, grazing against Andromeda and leaving a raw burn in its wake, bringing another screech out of the dragon as she feels the base of her neck sizzle in discomfort. Hardly any time passes by before Andromeda is given another reason to shout: a sharp <b>Shadow Punch</b> to her face delivered by the other Dusclops, no longer content with sticking to fixed adversaries. Having observed the battle so far, Tortuga emerges out of his shell as does his cannons, blasting a <b>Water Spout</b> as far as his vitality dictates. Only moments ago plagued by ice, the two Dusclops shudder as the healthier Blastoise rains boosted terror onto them, but their troubles are not quite over as Andromeda, thoroughly incensed by the concerted attack, erupts a <b>Draco Meteor</b> out of her open jaws. A collection of streaking mystical energy pours forth from its point of origin, half hovering in midair before falling as one, and the stark sclera of Andromeda's foe spells its panic only too clearly. Like watching a house falling down you see blocks of stone and ancient dust rise from ground zero, feeling the shockwaves left behind the meteoric swarm rattle your bones through the damaged flooring. A surge of smoke follows, spattered with glints of mysterious red light, and by the time to coast clears to the sounds of your Pokémon heaving and panting, Andromeda's Dusclops is nowhere to be seen...</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: DarkSlateBlue"><span style="font-size: 9px">An excellent to the battle indeed. The final earth shattering Draco Meteor delivered by Andromedea had been the first Advanced Move Pepper had ever bared witness to, though possessing a few members with AM's of their own, patiently waiting to utilize their techniques. His vision blurred momentarily before the shapes of a lone pokemon formalised themselves on his retinas and he discovered, much to his relief, that Dusclops was alone. Death perhaps? With Rayne's Dusclops nowhere to be found, that left Pepp and his Blastoise with their exhausted foe, though the tortoise quite fatigued himself, he prayed Tortuga had enough energy to pull off a final assault.<br />
<br />
Pepper turned slightly at the sound of a lance slicing the air and saw Patrick trotting across the garden to join them in front of the newly formed crater. He looked somewhat relieved while Pepper noted Ledah and Grimace, now visible, flitting along behind him happily. <br />
<br />
The rain had since started to pick up, much to the displeasure of their fire types, and Pepper's 'unusual choice in clothing' had finally proven its worth. &quot;Hey Patrick! I guess only one of us had come weather prepared, huh?&quot; teasing his cloaked adorned friend, while his own tattered rubber outfit, with matching Weepin Cap, repelled the rain. &quot;So,&quot; he began after a few moments, &quot;maybe we should finish things off by firing off a pair of <b>WATER GUN</b>s. That is all.&quot; <br />

<b><u>Carnea District</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Cod of War</u></b><br />
With one enemy down and only one more to go, experience in judgement informs you that in spite of improved odds caution is still the better course of action considering reprisals from Octillery were a likely consequence. Sure enough, true to your prediction Octillery flails its tentacles in apparent anger, its head shaking like a machine gun with the rat-tat-tat-tat of a released <b>Bullet Seed</b> headed straight for the Walrein warrior. It takes quick reacting on Arctacea's part in firing back a <b>Bullet Seed</b> of his own to prevent the Grass-type move from striking Eriden for super-effectiveness, and for a while neither barrage seems to back down in intensity, until the botanic strength from Octillery's mouth filters out; the probability involved in the multi-hit technique not apparently favourable to the crimson mollusc, leaving it to be battered by the remainder of Arctacea's move.<br />
<br />
&quot;Till till octill!&quot; Its voice reaching a fever pitch in anger, Octillery proceeds to fire a screaming <b>Psybeam</b> at Arctacea, slamming into the little Snover as he gives a squeak -- performing a brief lookover, you're relieved to find that no signs of confusion have set in. Waving his arms in near mimicry of his foe, Arctacea swings up a <b>Giga Drain</b> out of his fingertips, snatching fragments of health and energy alike out of Octillery, who doesn't seem to enjoy the draining any better than the seeding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmmm!&quot; A loud grunt of concentration from Eriden is heard; glancing aside you see him force his hand ahead as though pushing something heavy and invisible, and feeling the water puddling beneath you shift ahead you turn your attention downwards. In one accord the water appears to surge ahead by Eriden's hydrokinesis, coming and swirling together around Octillery before erupting upwards in a small-scale, though no less grand <b>Waterfall</b>. Holding the physical aquatic move steady, Eriden nods at Arctacea -- a signal that the frozen fir catches on from their teamwork together, and relying on the guaranteed accuracy from his initiated weather Arctacea releases his <b>Blizzard</b>, sending snow and ice at the rising torrent of water. Soon enough, the liquid formation glazes over with a layer of ice, spreading and creaking until Octillery is well and truly bound inside its cruel grasp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Time to end this. Once and for all!&quot; Taking a few steps forward on his flipper feet, Eriden flexes his pectorals in an apparent move to psyche himself up for one big finish, though considering his lower limbs you wonder what sort of epic display he has in mind. As if answering your doubt about his mobility, the surrounding waters begin to build up once more, this time piling up about Eriden and slowly but surely lifting him in suspension. With a war cry Eriden promptly points ahead, sending the wave forward and carrying him with it, leaving wisps of dark energy in his departure. Recognising the moves <b>Surf</b> and <b>Crunch</b>, your mind is broken out of his reminiscing as Eriden crashes into the ice pillar with a resounding shatter. Briefly recalling that Walrein pack enough power in their fangs to reduce icebergs to dust, you peer from behind the huffing man to see Octillery in the centre of a diamond dust storm, its tentacles eagle-sprawled in its unconscious state. <b>Level-up for Arctacea</b>.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, you two. We've lost enough time as it is, having to contend with this obstacle,&quot; chides Eriden. &quot;The road ahead is difficult as it is; we could all do with less of these interruptions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Having just engaged in a rather active battle, the ensuing minutes of progress as your reunited group shuffles onward is considerably less eventful. Everywhere you turn you see tarnished walls of marble, some having already given up the struggle against time's ravages leaving only pitiful piles of rubble behind. Closer inspection on a few occasions informs you that at various points in time long past, the water must have risen enough to submerge at least half the houses' height -- certainly, it's a good thing you now have the privilege of entering the sunken city at low tide.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are several ways of entering the inner part of the city, but all go through the huge battle arena people know as Colosseo,&quot; explains Eriden, when you come to a sloping set of impenetrable walls. &quot;The fastest way, though, as far as our knowledge extends would be through here,&quot; he continues, pointing to an unforgiving door right ahead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh, I remember this! You had to do something to the panel thingy over there!&quot; Seroba quips brightly. Looking in the direction of her excitement you spot a red panel upon a raised platform; you get a very strong impression that it was purposed to be stood upon.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's right. When we discovered this part of the city Seroba stood on the panel, prompting the door to shift itself open,&quot; Eriden nods. &quot;That was the first time, though -- the second time we encountered this sector, Seroba failed to activate the door. It was only when I took her place that the door opened, allowing her access inside Colosseo. The elders believe that in Tetyth's past the higher classes joined their inferiors in partaking of Colosseo's pleasures, but had a specially coded doorway that only they who possessed its one-time key could enter the passage that led to the best seats, and the most immediate way into the Aura Plateaus... An individual would stand here and keep the gateway open for the most important people, and when all had entered the individual would be locked out without someone to hold the door for them. A variety of places in Tetyth have similar random codes, so the elders said. They were designed such that only the elite could truly walk free in their city, and even now continue to carry on their selfish wishes.&quot; Walking over to the panel, Eriden places a hand onto the red surface; for a brief moment a series of symbols you don't recall ever seeing before flash brightly, before vanishing into the brick shade. &quot;Looks like this time we need someone weighing 160 to 180 kilograms to stay here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha! That someone won't be me. I'm WAY too light for that!&quot; declares Seroba proudly, then narrows her eyes in a most teasing manner. &quot;Say, you're not trying to tell our friend here how much I <i>do</i> weigh, are you, Eriden?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would gain nothing from such a venture, Seroba; nor would I have the motivation to. It serves absolutely no meaningful purpose,&quot; mutters Eriden. &quot;Unfortunately, I cannot remain here to open the gate for you; the both of us must accompany Jamie through his journey.&quot; Standing up to face you, the expression on Eriden's face is solemnly clear. &quot;I apologise, Jamie. But if we are to continue, you must leave one of your Pokémon here to keep the door open. I'm afraid that the nature of the passage prevents anyone from using the PokéBall's capture net to retrieve their Pokémon, so whomever you can leave behind, you need to make the choice well.&quot;<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span><br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: aqua">The anger of the Octillery was expected as it gave a tentacle flail before firing at Eriden with a Bullet Seed barrage, only to be met with one from Arctacea as the Snover stood valiantly against the machine gun effect of the octopus, and as he remembered the growth spurt given at the start Jamie could see well that his foe wasn't winning, the water pokemon's attack giving out as it was peppered by the one more aligned with the grass element. Irate at this turnaround, Octillery turned attention from the Walreinman to the Snover, unleashing a Psybeam in retaliation as the ice type squeaked from the special strike. Furrowing his brow, Jamie was more relaxed once he found the Snover in relative sanity, the fir tree waving his stubby arms much like his fishy foe as he siphoned energy and health from the octopus, the enemy disliking it as much as the seeding and poison from before. It was wearing down, and seemed ready for a coup de grace.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmmm!&quot;<br />
<br />
Watching with a degree of awe, the waters below his feet seemed to flow with Eriden's magicks until a forceful torrent of water, akin to a geyser or waterfall, sent the Octillery skywards, and on a nod, Arctacea used his own powers over ice to blast the aquatic pillar with a forceful blizzard, the trainer shivering from anticipation and cold in equal measures as the unfortunate octopus was literally encased in ice, at the mercy of the pair. To which end the Walreinman once again called upon the powers of water, this time in an impressive wave which he rode before smashing down onto the pillar with a magical crunch assault, and as the boy noted the power the Ice Break pokemon had, he too acknowledged that the Octillery, laying spread eagle, would likely not be getting up for a while yet, the battle in their favour in terms of offense, but not time.<br />
<br />
Continuing on Eriden's orders or advice, after a pat on the back for Arctacea for the effort in subdueing two evolved foes with assistance, the group continued on their way, Jamie noticing the ruins in the area and the possibility that he was in at low tide, by the water mark on the buildings, until they stopped just outside a very intimidating door, much like a bulwark than anything else. With a quick skim over the walls, Jamie pondered that the area must have been used to keep anything from getting in. His theory was soon pseudo-confirmed by the explanation of the wall and a large red tile of sorts. On hearing the weight category required to open the doors, his heart sunk a few inches further towards his feet upon hearing the grave note that Eriden added.<br />
<br />
Closing his eyes in concentration, he frowned as he tried to remember the rough weight category. '<i>If 160 is 352, and 180 is about 400 or so, that blocks out most of my team, including Wraith. There's really only one left who fits that category, but whether he's recovered from that hiding he received earlier remains to be seen.</i>' Reaching for the Moon Ball, he released the contents of it, the Lunatone still smarting from the Tentacruel encounter, but at least conscious in spite of the heavy damage taken.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, it hurts seeing you in a state like this Meteos...&quot; he sighed, putting a hand on the crest of the rock pokemon as it floated before him, yet the psychic chime from the pokemon was still as honed as ever.<br />
<br />
'<i>I'm only in pain, not completely defe-ow, defeated. I'm feeling quite energetic, merely pained. Where exactly would we be, as I just awoke around five minutes ago...ergh.</i>'<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now we're in Tetyth City, it's complicated but we managed to get away from that Tentacruel. We're in a bit of bother, however. You see, there's this huge door in our way, and we need someone who's between 160 and 180 kilograms to hold a button down to open the door...&quot; Jamie cheeped to the psychic, whose eyes narrowed slightly, from both consternation and bracing pain. &quot;The problem is, once we're through, you'll have to stay behind as the door'll close behind us when we're through.&quot;<br />
<br />
'<i>I see now, you need a weight to get through which you'll have to leave behind for the time being...but from what you say, the recall system of a pokeball won't work behind the door. The basic system of a ball sends energy to a pokemon, consuming it in the same energy and pulling it into the capture device, much like a snare or teleportation device...</i>'<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait...teleportation? I hadn't thought of that...&quot; Jamie mused to himself looking towards the door, then Meteos. While the door would prevent direct retrieval, there wasn't anything suggesting it could block direct relocation through it from a place. Turning towards the aquafolk, Meteos in tow, he spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mentioned the door prevents the capture net from working as a retrieval device, but where there's a way into a building without breaking the walls, there's a greater form of movement. Here's how it'll be. Meteos here is of the correct weight to hold the button down. When we're ready, he'll reduce his psychic hold on himself to land on the plate, opening the door. Once we're through, he'll try and bypass the door with a <b>teleport</b> technique. If it merely blocks the recall system, there's a likelihood it won't prevent teleportation from working, and it's much easier for a Lunatone to teleport itself than a group of people. If it doesn't work, however, then it seems he'll have to stay behind. You sure you're willing to stick behind though, Meteos?&quot;<br />
<br />
'<i>There's the chance of further encounters with water pokemon, which I feel I will be a mere burden towards. Even if I can't get through the door, I should be alone for a while and will be able to rest up for an attempt to teleport to safety if threatened.</i>'<br />
<br />
Looking towards his first capture, Jamie gave a smile and a nod, the Meteorite pokemon slowly heading for the platform, the trainer hoping that the teleport technique would work. If not, he'd be one pokemon down for a while yet...</span></span></div>

<b><u>Dark Fire &amp; SilverWind</u></b><br />
Having vanquished one of the optic beasts after more than considerable struggle, some time is briefly left to recovery as Andromeda downs a much-appreciated Rawst Berry and Pepper to focus on his own situation. Already drained by Dusclops' sapping powers, Tortuga grunts amidst a stinging blast of <b>Night Shade</b> delivered by the remaining spirit, but nonetheless he focuses his cannons on the offensive ghost. While for most Pokémon the attack would not normally warrant concern, from a Blastoise's signature anatomy the <b>Water Gun</b> emerges strong like a fire hydrant's discharge, barreling into the bound mummy. The technique is closely followed as Andromeda calls for more power, tapping also into the deathly atmosphere to release powerful zephyrs of <b>Ominous Wind</b> from her cruelly curved wings. Like little devils the winds tear at Dusclops, plaguing it as it calls out stoicly as ever before, but with indisputable pain showing in its voice. With the rain continuing to pour harshly both Tortuga and Andromeda exchange knowing glances, before releasing a combined torrent of water at Dusclops, barreling it into the floor in a flash of glittering red against the liquid spattering all around. As each Pokémon falling to their forelegs to catch their breath both of you feel another shimmer of energy ripple through everything -- yourselves, the environment -- above all, an experience of peculiar but nevertheless welcomed tranquility. Sure enough, a look ahead reveals this Dusclops to have vanished along with its other, and with the Mean Look lifted the surviving Duskull look at each other in alarm. One by one, the screeching ghosts pull back in exponential numbers, retreating into the night's darkness as they fade from view, leaving you and your allies behind in the thinning drizzle. <b>Level-up for Drought, Andromeda, Grimace, Tortuga and Ledah.</b><br />
<br />
&quot;You're not shabby yourselves, you two,&quot; Ogden declares, the unrestrained violence gone from his voice as you turn around, a few stray sparks fizzling out as they dance off the man's weapon. &quot;...I must apologise for my outburst earlier. All things considered, it was still quite unacceptable, and if it hadn't been for you...&quot; Another frown creases Patrick's brow. &quot;We should pause for a while. It's been an ordeal-filled night for you two, as me. We need some time to recover and decide on our next move.&quot;<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center">***&#8203;</div><br />
A half hour later, amidst erected tents and reclining Pokémon, the two of you sit around a fire cobbled together with smouldering plant material and surrounded by debris out of Ogden's earlier rampage. The warrior had, with a flick of his lance, discharged a short burst of electricity to spark off combustion, then reached for his belt where several cylindrical barrels lay. &quot;Battery-powered,&quot; he had grunted, answering a question you may or may not have considered, as he shook out the spent reserves of his weapon and replaced them, before returning to stoking the fire in grim silence. For the moment, it seems you've earned a short reprieve, but for how long? Seems that you'll all be stuck for some time; it might be a good opportunity to review what you know, or mull on where you might go from here...<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>Handymankg2</u></b><br />
The mere nature of the Grass-type escapade convincing you to help out the poliwogs, your immediate offer sends notably renewed excitement amongst the aquatic Pokémon. The younger ones immediately start huddling about you in apparent wonder, while some of the older ones keep their ground, though not without wide-eyed gazes cast at you and Bellatrix. Shuffling over, Poliwrath takes your hand in a firm handshake with such force, you have a sharp idea that if the Fighting-type exerted any further you might end up without a right hand to call your own. Solemnly Poliwrath meets your eyes once again before raising its palm, indicating direction roughly in the zone of where you had entered the garden -- turning back, you realise that Poliwrath is pointing to the forested area in Rosalina Island. Vaguely remembering passing by when you had scaled Wilheim Path, it takes you a few moments as Poliwrath retreats his palm to conclude that the evolved tadpole cannot offer you any further insight, much to its apparent regret. Nevertheless you give the Water-types a promise of affirmation; you will certainly return with the item that was taken from them, and with that you and Bella depart from the castle grounds.<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center">***&#8203;</div><br />
It doesn't take you long to reach the forest's outskirts, but conversely, you find yourself suddenly a lot more hesitant at the borders of the woods. Even from here you can tell that, at least, this is <i>not</i> the sort of location anyone would pick for a camping trip, except perhaps those who had a taste for the deathly despairing. Each tree looks like an entity twisted in petrified agony; their pain betrayed by the grotesques patterns in which they turn. Is this where the marauding plant Pokémon army had come from? Unease creeps into your mind, along with it, possibly a few tinges of sympathy -- if this was where you had to live you feel that immediately moving would be a top priority for you as well, but nonetheless, you still had a mission to do and a promise to keep.<br />
<br />
With your hand holding Bellatrix's, you begin your journey into Rosalina Forest, a tremble rippling up your leg with each step you take. You note a distinct drop in the volume of Bella's buzzing as she maintains her high alert mode; both of you are quite certain that at some point, confrontation will not only be necessary, but it will come fast and furious --<br />
<br />
<b><i>SWOOSH.</i></b><br />
<br />
&quot;Vezzzzpiquen!&quot;<br />
<br />
Feeling Bella's claw abruptly fly out of your hand, you barely register the absence of your starter when the sensation of scratch marks on your hand is promptly replaced by something striking your chest, wrapping around your arms, pulling you backwards and slamming you against a tree. Seeing Staryu, it takes you a few seconds before you recognise Bella's shrill shrieking, and squinting in the darkness you see her eyes and talons flash angrily as she struggles against her bindings... blue bindings, in fact, that you find gruesomely familiar. Sure enough, as your eyes reorient themselves to allow for night vision you see several Tangela holding her down against a tree; it doesn't take long for you to realise that the same must have happened to you. Worse still, the Tangela aren't the only ones -- with dread you recognise the assortment of other Grass Pokémon that seem to have appeared out of nowhere amongst the darkness, along with others in their ranks. Murkrow and Hoothoot perch on branches, while Oddish and Seedot line the ground with the others, almost like a public execution...<br />
<br />
&quot;Skrreeee!&quot; The Tangela gathered about Bella drawing your attention, you're horrified to see glittering blue powder surround your Pokémon as she valiantly continues to struggle, only to slump as the <b>Sleep Powder</b> works its effects on her. Rage surges in you, prompting you to attempt in making a break for it, but the lashings around you are, if anything, more secure than the <b>Grass Knot</b> you had fallen under earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;TAN-growth.&quot; At the commanding voice, you notice a shuffle amongst the other Pokémon; doubtlessly in preparation for the head honcho to come. As it emerges from its apparent hiding place, you recall the shadow that had made off with the Moondrop in Poliwrath's memory: this Tangrowth must be the very same culprit that had led the uncalled-for assault on Moonlit Garden.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tan, tangrowth, tangrowth.&quot; Almost like an actual, hooded executioner, Tangrowth silences the crowd with a single wave of its extendable arm and begins steadily stepping towards you. What now? You make another desperate wring but the vines holding you are no less unforgiving than they were moments ago, though as your fingers feel their way around you realise that maybe, just maybe, you could reach along your belt and fling out a PokéBall to defend yourself...</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: aqua"><div style="text-align: center"><b><u>Tetyth City</u></b>&#8203;</div><br />
<b><u>Colosseo</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Cod of War</u></b><br />
With the information given to you, a simple process of elimination leaves your prior injured Lunatone as the proverbial sacrifice for you to move ahead. Left with a contigency plan you are hopeful will succeed, Meteos hovers briefly over the access panel before lowering himself with a gradual phasing of his natural levitation. For a while nothing appears to happen, but as Meteos completely disables his full lifting powers and places his full weight on the tile it briefly gleams, as though a small wave of water just washed over it. &quot;Hey, look!&quot; exclaims Seroba, &quot;It's opening!&quot; Indeed, as you turn you find that almost silently, barely with a creak, the heavy alloy door slides upwards at a speed you'd never expect from something of such bulk, until the entirety of the way ahead is revealed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's go. Unless the elders were mistaken, these doors were designed to disallow an extended window of time for entrance.&quot; At Eriden's urging, you find yourself pacing quickly towards the dark passage, but nevertheless you cast a glance of concern back at Meteos. Would the teleportation tactic work? Even as this thought passes you by and your other foot lifts from the ground outside, you barely hear the same bare creak you just recall from only moments before...<br />
<br />
&quot;The door!&quot; Even with Eriden's shout, the time it takes for the words to leave his mouth is sufficient for the gate to clang shut; an exchanged expression of shock is all that passes between you and Meteos. An alarmed interjection from the Lunatone is heard, following a fizzle of energy as Meteos tries putting the plan into action, but after a few moments of waiting you find that no meteorite floats beside you. Nor are you capable of hearing the mental messages familiar to the Psychic Pokémon. &quot;That... was unexpected. It seems the desires of the past burn strongly, even today,&quot; Eriden sighs, as the realisation hits that you have effectively been cut off from Meteos. &quot;I'm sorry, Jamie. But there's nothing more we can do here; we need to move ahead. I cannot say for sure that Colosseo is completely safe for traversing.&quot;<br />
<br />
With no other option available to you, and having already factored in the worst-case scenario of separation, you sullenly plod forward through the dank hallway. You can only imagine that surely, this passage must have been at least lit for Tetyth's elite to see by; they can't possibly have endured the murky conditions you presently find yourself in, for certain. For now all you can trust in are Eriden and Seroba leading you ahead.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Halt for a moment, you two,&quot; mutters Eriden, after... how long? You couldn't quite tell in the surroundings of darkness, but having just been stopped and given a refreshed chance to identify your surroundings you find a strangely sweet smell -- not something you'd expect in an arena, to say the least. The path ahead seems to open up to another gateway, and you notice light filtering in from above, as well as a peculiar chittering sound.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jamie, if you're not minding.&quot; In the renewed light, you see Eriden bring a finger closer to your face; immediately you find the smell increase in intensity. A sticky liquid appears to drip from the warrior's digit. &quot;Seroba, are you thinking what I'm thinking?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm... yep! That's definitely Surskit nectar! Mmmm...&quot; Even in the darkness you can almost hear her grin in usual glee. &quot;But that means...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's a very strong likelihood that Masquerain have set up residence in this place. Despite evolving from Water-types, Masquerain profess a strong dislike for water. My guess is that a swarm moved in to raise their young in this sheltered area.&quot; The berserker pauses, &quot;Unfortunately, now that they have claimed this zone as their territory, we will be treated with hostility if we simply barge in. We need something that can, at least, offer us some protection against a populous insect swarm. Something that insects don't like in general will do, but there is the problem of numbers...&quot;<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkslategray"><div style="text-align: center"><b><u>Mireno Cemetery</u></b>&#8203;</div><br />
<b><u>Catacombs</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Hayward</u></b><br />
Thrust into battle, and not particularly healthy odds at that, you bring out Suméo the Makuhita to at least even up the numbers. Not usually a key member of your offensive tactics, it takes Suméo a while before he realises the situation he's now in, but what he lacks in reaction time you know he makes up for in optimism. A briefing follows as you indicate the tactics and targets, but while your Fighting-type Pokémon prepare their stances Arbok hisses menacingly, no less aggressive than before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, Will. I understand your perspective.&quot; Tapping his staff, Yuanli nods at his trusted partner, &quot;You know what to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sabl!&quot; Hopping alongside his new battle comrades, Chroma matches the evil eye against his canine foe; almost in mimicry of Medéo Arbok swishes its tail side to side, all the while glaring daggers almost enough to physically wound by the sight alone. &quot;<i>Sssssic them!</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...!&quot; Faster than the eye can catch, both your Pokémon dive forward at their respective enemies, but while this happens you barely catch a glimpse of another opposing force on the other side head at you at a highly similar pattern if not greater velocity. Dumbly, Suméo falls to the side as Medéo jumps back from his smacking of Arbok's face, a concerned look from the latter of the two operatives as Sneasel grins grimly; none of you anticipated that the opposition might have had access to the <b>Fake Out</b> skill as well. &quot;Be careful, Chroma! Start out strong with a <b>Power Gem</b>!&quot; calls Yuanli.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sabl sab sabl!&quot; Focusing energy into his eyes of gemstone, it doesn't take long before a series of projectiles, hardly different from Chroma's ocular diamonds, scatter above Houndour and rain effective damage upon it. As Arbok continues staring at Medéo the yoga practitioner simply flexes his muscles huffily, tightening them in a <b>Bulk Up</b> session, but as Suméo raises his chubby arms it appears that luck is not on his side. &quot;Snea? Snea, snea hee hee sneasel.&quot; Much as you are hardly an expert in Pokémon linguistics, Sneasel's derogatory tone and pose inform you of the <b>Taunt</b> when you hear it, and Suméo is no exception as he switches his limbs to chest-thumping mode instead, voicing his distinct disapproval of the partial Ice Pokémon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maku, maku maku hitaaaaa!&quot; None too pleased about the Sneasel's remarks, Suméo dashes ahead -- at a speed you find surprising, more so given the lack of a Fake Out boost. With his <b>Arm</b>s raised, the pudgy Pokémon proceeds to <b>Thrust</b> them at Sneasel for its comeuppance, and being twice weak against Suméo's element of specialisation you can only imagine how much the Sneasel must be hurting; news you certainly don't mind hearing. Assured of his colleague's status, Medéo hums one of his mantras, clearing all unwanted thoughts in his head before he lunges forward; a <b>Zen Headbutt</b> striking Arbok squarely on the head. Enraged by the unexpected comeback, Sneasel breathes an angry <b>Icy Wind</b> straight at your Makuhita, only for his natural <b>Thick Fat</b> to weaken the blow considerably.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Do you actually think you can clinch victory? From usssss, in the providence of our massssterssss?</i>&quot; A shiver goes down your spine as Arbok announces its diatribe. &quot;<i>Try sssssome of thisssss!</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
As Arbok opens its mouth wide, you half expect an attack to come from the poisonous maw, but while nothing appears to emerge your ears are seized by the most goosebump-raising, nerve-wracking <b>Screech</b> you've ever recalled hearing. Even as nothing strikes your body, you feel an intensely torturous pulse worm its way through you, and the enclosed state of the area only makes the high-pitched echoes even worse. Next to you, Yuanli is in no better state, and the three Pokémon allied with you struggle between staying alert and blocking their ears to shut out the disgusting dissonance.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Had enough?</i>&quot; Arbok sneers as Chroma falls back, shaking the remnants of a <b>Fire Fang</b> from his arm while you and Yuanli heave your breaths with sweat dripping down your brows. &quot;<i>Leave thesssse sssssacred groundssssss, or behold our wrath!</i>&quot;<br />
<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray"><b><u>Hayward</u></b></span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Thrust into battle, and not particularly healthy odds at that, you bring out Suméo the Makuhita to at least even up the numbers. Not usually a key member of your offensive tactics, it takes Suméo a while before he realises the situation he's now in, but what he lacks in reaction time you know he makes up for in optimism. A briefing follows as you indicate the tactics and targets, but while your Fighting-type Pokémon prepare their stances Arbok hisses menacingly, no less aggressive than before.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;Alright, Will. I understand your perspective.&quot; Tapping his staff, Yuanli nods at his trusted partner, &quot;You know what to do.&quot;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;Sabl!&quot; Hopping alongside his new battle comrades, Chroma matches the evil eye against his canine foe; almost in mimicry of Medéo Arbok swishes its tail side to side, all the while glaring daggers almost enough to physically wound by the sight alone. &quot;<i>Sssssic them!</i>&quot;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;...!&quot; Faster than the eye can catch, both your Pokémon dive forward at their respective enemies, but while this happens you barely catch a glimpse of another opposing force on the other side head at you at a highly similar pattern if not greater velocity. Dumbly, Suméo falls to the side as Medéo jumps back from his smacking of Arbok's face, a concerned look from the latter of the two operatives as Sneasel grins grimly; none of you anticipated that the opposition might have had access to the <b>Fake Out</b> skill as well. &quot;Be careful, Chroma! Start out strong with a <b>Power Gem</b>!&quot; calls Yuanli.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;Sabl sab sabl!&quot; Focusing energy into his eyes of gemstone, it doesn't take long before a series of projectiles, hardly different from Chroma's ocular diamonds, scatter above Houndour and rain effective damage upon it. As Arbok continues staring at Medéo the yoga practitioner simply flexes his muscles huffily, tightening them in a <b>Bulk Up</b> session, but as Suméo raises his chubby arms it appears that luck is not on his side. &quot;Snea? Snea, snea hee hee sneasel.&quot; Much as you are hardly an expert in Pokémon linguistics, Sneasel's derogatory tone and pose inform you of the <b>Taunt</b> when you hear it, and Suméo is no exception as he switches his limbs to chest-thumping mode instead, voicing his distinct disapproval of the partial Ice Pokémon.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;Maku, maku maku hitaaaaa!&quot; None too pleased about the Sneasel's remarks, Suméo dashes ahead -- at a speed you find surprising, more so given the lack of a Fake Out boost. With his <b>Arm</b>s raised, the pudgy Pokémon proceeds to <b>Thrust</b> them at Sneasel for its comeuppance, and being twice weak against Suméo's element of specialisation you can only imagine how much the Sneasel must be hurting; news you certainly don't mind hearing. Assured of his colleague's status, Medéo hums one of his mantras, clearing all unwanted thoughts in his head before he lunges forward; a <b>Zen Headbutt</b> striking Arbok squarely on the head. Enraged by the unexpected comeback, Sneasel breathes an angry <b>Icy Wind</b> straight at your Makuhita, only for his natural <b>Thick Fat</b> to weaken the blow considerably.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;<i>Do you actually think you can clinch victory? From usssss, in the providence of our massssterssss?</i>&quot; A shiver goes down your spine as Arbok announces its diatribe. &quot;<i>Try sssssome of thisssss!</i>&quot;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">As Arbok opens its mouth wide, you half expect an attack to come from the poisonous maw, but while nothing appears to emerge your ears are seized by the most goosebump-raising, nerve-wracking <b>Screech</b> you've ever recalled hearing. Even as nothing strikes your body, you feel an intensely torturous pulse worm its way through you, and the enclosed state of the area only makes the high-pitched echoes even worse. Next to you, Yuanli is in no better state, and the three Pokémon allied with you struggle between staying alert and blocking their ears to shut out the disgusting dissonance.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;<i>Had enough?</i>&quot; Arbok sneers as Chroma falls back, shaking the remnants of a <b>Fire Fang</b> from his arm while you and Yuanli heave your breaths with sweat dripping down your brows. &quot;<i>Leave thesssse sssssacred groundssssss, or behold our wrath!</i>&quot;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">What will you do now?</span></span>

<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Below the surface of Mireno, the trainer Will Hale covered his ears, cringing in discomfort as Arbok’s Screech reverberated around the confined catacombs. Nearby, both of Will’s companions, the Makuhita Sumeo and the Medicham Medeo, wore pained expressions and strove to maintain their concentration despite the piercing noise.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Will wiped sweat from his forehead with the back of his wrist and glanced at Yuanli, wondering what his new friend was planning. The old sage took deep, panting breaths while his faithful Sableye Chroma stood at hand, nursing a singed arm.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">As Arbok continued to hiss out threats, Medeo and Sumeo turned to Will with “What-do-we-do-now?” looks on their faces. The boy however, wasn’t about to be intimidated by their opponents’ scare tactics. Putting on a determined expression, he did his best to keep his cool, solemnly nodding his intention to carry on. He had promised to help Yuanli with his quest to return a cursed artifact, and he wasn’t about to let the oldster down now. They had come too far together.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Thinking hard to come up with a plan, Will once again admitted to himself that he had no idea how the poison cobra had learned to talk, but reasoned it might have something to do with the sinister activities that had supposedly taken place below the now-forsaken hamlet. With the exception of the Chatot species, the only other talking Pokemon Will knew of were cartoons in children’s animated programs. He wondered what other unusual abilities Arbok might be hiding.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">After a moment of further thought, Will shook his head, dragged a hand through his short brown hair, and addressed his fighting-type comrades. “Alright, mates, look sharp!” he cautioned. “Medeo, keep after Arbok! Sumeo, stay on Sneasel!”</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">The mystic and sumo nodded, turning to face their adversaries as Will continued, issuing instructions. “<b>Flash</b>, Medeo! Then get in close and mix it up with <b>Psycho Cut </b>before Arbok can recover. Be ready to defend with <b>Double Team</b> if you get in trouble!” Medeo nodded and fixed his serpentine opponent with a steely gaze.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">“Sumeo, you go with a <b>Force Palm - Body Slam</b> combo!” Will cried, hoping one of the strikes would induce temporary muscle paralysis, priming the ice weasel for the Makuhita's next attack. “Then follow up with <b>Smellingsalt</b>!” </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Although Sumeo’s dopey grin never left his face, the nervous wiggle of his topknot betrayed him for a second time, and Will knew his partner was also doing his best to stay calm in the face of their fearsome foes. </span></span><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">The rotund wrestler lazily took another bite of leftovers as Will waited to see how things would play out...</span></span><br />

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Chartreuse"><b><u>Nelde Ruins: Wiese Forest</u></b><br />
<b>Demon Skittles:</b> As Alberta steps through the trees and fires off an <b>ember</b> towards the laughing Victreebel, you walk over towards the fallen man. Prestige hands the man’s glasses back to him and he thanks you, still slightly choked from the experience. On the other side of the clearing you hear the surprise of the enlarged grass type as a stray flame grazes its skin. <br />
<br />
“Tree?” You flick a glance back and spot your Charmander dancing to amp herself up. The Victreebel rocks its head from side to side, following the movements of the fire lizard curiously. It seems as if it is amused at the show put on by your fire type. <br />
<br />
“You alright, sir? It's a stupid question to ask after being thrown around like that, I know. What are you doing way out here..?” You ask the man, confident Alberta can handle herself. <br />
<br />
“H-h-h-uh?” The man looks at you, still shaking with fear, which is reflected in his eyes. “That’s … that’s … later … later. That, V-v-v-victreebel, you’ll need more pokemon … it’s powerful beyond belief.” He concludes, and you once again flick back to witness the fight unfold. The Victreebel still seems amused as Alberta circles around slowly, trying to get an opening for her next attack. As she circles the Victreebel remains still, following only with its eyes. With an amazing burst of speed your Charmander leaps forward, fuelled by the <b>dragon dance</b> she performed earlier. Her mouth glows with an intense flame, but just as she is about to sink her teeth into the flesh of the green Victreebel, the mutant skips forward with an even more impressive display of speed, smacking your airborne Charmander with its vine with enough force to send Alberta flying into a tree trunk at the edge of the clearing. That speed was dazzling to witness, and then the strength and agility this Victreebel had was just as impressive.<br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… The man is thinking that Alberta has no chance against this mutant. He thinks the only way to win is to send out another pokemon to help Alberta out. …&gt;</i> Beams Prestige. From that round of battle it’s hard to argue. A two on one is probably the best way to go.<br />
<br />
<i>Will you send out another pokemon to join the fray?</i><br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Kori Gotcha:</b> The realisation hits you like a ton of bricks. With a psychic type enlisted in your party, communicating with your “deaf” Combusken through “mute” lips seems like a joke now. Your Girafarig appears by your side within moments, happily joining you in your time of need. It doesn’t take long for him to realise something is terribly wrong. He opens his mouth to say something and just like before, no sound comes out. Having only one way to communicate with the psychic giraffe you focus your thoughts on one thing only; communicating. <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… That's right Girafarig, we got ourselves one heck of a weird problem here and I think your the only way that we're going to be able to get out of this one. For whatever reason, there's no sound from anything so I'm going to need you to help me out. I want you to help me relay my orders to Combusken alright! …&gt;</i> You think, hoping your partner can read your thoughts. The nod you receive in response confirms that Girafarig has indeed heard you, so you fire off your commands. Girafarig nods once more and closes his eyes. You turn to look at Combusken who is the one to nod now, getting the instructions through the messenger. Ecstatic that everything has finally worked out you confidently gaze at your opponent, who still looks in good shape. <br />
<br />
The Beedrill, noticing a new comer goes into action right away, but what happens next is not something you were anticipating. The Beedrill’s stinger glows an intense yellow, the same shade of yellow that the orb had been when it expanded to turn into this Beedrill. The stinger radiates with bright pulses, before three “missiles” fire off from the stinger and stick in the ground. It doesn’t take long for these projectiles to begin to expand just like the Beedrill before them. Amazingly the transformation does not take long, but a fraction of the time it took the Beedrill, and now you are staring at three Weedle on the ground. Clearly, with the addition of a second foe, the Beedrill will attempt to even out the field. The Weedle will run interference against your Girafarig while it remains focused on Combusken. <br />
<br />
Combusken, who had obviously figured out the Beedrill’s plan wastes no time launching into the offensive. While Beedrill was birthing new foes, Combusken had raised his <b>agility</b>. Now, a bright <b>ember</b> flies and nails the bee right on, a patch of burned skin clearly left behind. At the same time, Girafarig stomps ahead, picking up speed and lowers his head just in time to completely obliterate one of the Weedle. The sphere you stand in pulsates brilliantly as the Weedle is converted back into pure energy by the attack. Combusken now, closes his eyes to focus on his next attack. Before the Beedrill can attack, Combusken slams his outstretched palm into the ground, creating a powerful wave of air to rush towards the unsuspecting insect. Agitated by the sneak attack which cheated the attacking order the Beedrill launches itself needles first at Combusken, spearing him with a powerful <b>poison jab</b>. Both Combusken and Beedrill wince in pain; Combusken from the attack, Beedrill from its burn. Girafarig in the meantime has turned on the second Weedle, trying to <b>astonish</b> the interference. While the attack lands without a hitch, it is not enough to dispatch this Weedle. Now it is the two Weedle, who combine their forces; one bites Girafarig’s leg, the other using its stinger to jab at Girafarig’s back leg. Girafarig rears as the super effective <b>bug bite</b> on its front leg sinks in. While in the reared position Girafarig neighed, or would have if sound was working. Several seconds later a shooting star cuts across the battlefield; its effect being delayed slightly.<br />
<br />
This round of battling had certainly picked up the pace and you can’t help but feel excited as you watch the action take place in front of you. But you are not out of the woods yet, there is still battling to be done.<br />
<br />
<i>What will you do now?</i></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: DarkSlateBlue"><b><u>Lacrima Castle: Wilheim Path</u></b><br />
<b>Stark:</b> A little out of sort you command your partner who eagerly begins to carry them out. Not wasting a single moment the small bird launches himself into an <b>agility</b> attack, his wings beating furiously as he accelerates away from his starting position. The stat boosting attack doubles for an evasive maneuver, Pidgey flying off just in time to avoid the Haunter’s <b>hypnosis</b> waves. Despite having missed his target the Haunter snickers, hard to tell at what, but apparently it found something rather amusing. Not caring much for his opponent’s amusement, Pidgey changes directions in his flight, now barrelling towards the ghost. Just before Pidgey makes contact with the cackling ghost, one of Haunter’s unattached arms fly ahead of its body and punches your bird pokemon, causing a multitude of black sparks to shower off of the impact. The <b>sucker punch</b> was enough to derail your Pidgey, the momentum carrying him smack into the face of the cliff. The sickening thud of your pokemon crashing into the solid backdrop was more than enough to make you shudder. <br />
<br />
“Heeeeeeeeelp…” Despite your partner's desperate situation, you instinctively turn to look at the source of the plea, up towards the bridge that leads into the impressive castle on the horizon. Being quite a distance away, you have to squint to make out the dark figures standing on the bridge. Though you can’t be certain, it looks as if a woman in a long dress is being apprehended by two armoured men. The woman is clearly being unruly and not letting these men grab a hold of her, thrashing about aggressively every time they try to find a firm grip. Finally one of them finds a seam and is able to grab her left arm. In response the woman shoots her right knee forward, finding her target between the man’s legs. Cringing, as only a male could at the sight, you watch as the assailant crumples to his knees. In retaliation the second man whacked the woman with what looked like a thick club, however, the way the man spun as he made contact made this club look like it was attached to his backside; like a muscular tail. Not surprisingly the woman shrieks in pain and falls over herself, most likely unconscious. <br />
<br />
“You scum … me.” To your surprise the woman had not been knocked out, but she was clearly not strong enough to fight off these men. “… away with this.” The distance between you and the bridge only made it possible to hear the woman when she raised her voice. The man that had been kneed in the holy place aggresively lifts the woman off the ground and drapes her over his shoulder. Despite her kicking and punching, the two men begin to walk off triumphantly, laughing as they walked casually towards the castle. The laugh of the two men as they carried the woman away made you feel sick to your stomach, a feeling of disgust washing over you. What were they going to do to her?<br />
<br />
“Haunt … er!” The shrill voice of the ghost pokemon brings you back to your current situation. While you were distracted the Haunter has laid quite a beating on your injured Pidgey. To your alarm you just then notice that one of Pidgey’s wings is broken; most likely from that crash into the cliff. With his last bit of strength, wincing through the pain your brave bird flaps his wings, yelping in pain with every beat. With every beat however you feel the wind pick up behind you more and more. Finally a loud rush of air flows past your sending your cloak flailing about and picking up dust and rocks from all over. With one final flap of his wings, Pidgey raises a powerful gust which swoops through the battle ground, sending everything away including the Haunter. As the wind carries the ghost off into the distance you can hear it cackling still. With the immediate danger gone, Pidgey chirps proudly and folds his wings back to his sides; the right wing sticking out unnaturally. <br />
<br />
Between taking care of your injured bird and worrying about the woman, you have a lot to think over and several decisions to make.<br />
<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Chartreuse"><b><u>Nelde Ruins: Wiese Forest</u></b><br />
<b>Shadowshocker:</b> As soon as the instructions left your mouth Lacrimus flew into action. The Gligar’s acceleration is immediate, and within a fraction of a second you see the dark blur that is your flying scorpion dip to snag the paralyzed Combee. With the Combee in tow Lacrimus alters his flight trajectory into a tight U, slamming the knocked out bee into your waiting grasp. Knowing the sluggish thing couldn’t chew at the moment, you crush the Cheri Berry you had prepared, letting the juices run into one of the slightly agape mouths of Combee. In an almost immediate response to the antidote the Combee’s eyes began darting from direction to direction, anxiously searching for its miraculous cure. Only too glad to comply, you lightly stuff the Cheri Berry pulp into the mouth of the recovering Combee.<br />
<br />
Not wanting to waste another second in this vulnerable position, you turn on your heels and bolt as fast as you can away from your ambush site. Apparently, not fast enough. You can hear the venom in Lacrimus’ voice as he curses audibly in his tongue. A slender flutter of his wings had him flipping in midair, now flying backwards in front of you, a sight that could only mean the reappearance of the resilient Ariados. Lacrimus tensed his wings, building up as much tension as he possible could in his chest muscles, before unleashing an immensely powerful gust of wind. The force of the wind sent every loose particle in the immediate vicinity hurtling in the opposite direction of your sprint. The soil from the forest floor could not keep its grip on the ancient roots, and it too spiralled into the Gligar’s distractive technique. The displeased screech of the spider informed you of the successful attack, but before the feeling of safety could really sink in you notice darts flying past you in a scattered pattern. To your relief you don’t feel any of the poisonous darts hit you; the Ariados was shooting blindly through the opaque veil of particles. <br />
<br />
So as to not give it another shot you pick up your pace further, tugging at the poisonous darts in the Combee’s back. Lacrimus was once again flying in front of you now, leading you in the least obstructed path. Although you could not hear the spider pokemon anymore, you had a feeling that the Ariados would not give up that easily. The look in its eyes as it watched its soon-to-be meal escape right under its “nose”, well, that was enough to let you know that this Ariados would probably chase you to the other end of the forest before quitting the chase. Having no other choice you run, run as fast as your legs would let you. <br />
<br />
As fast as your legs would let you … why was your left leg suddenly feeling a bit heavier? Not a bit, actually, it felt significantly heavier. Now that you noticed it, it actually felt as if your whole body was heavy. Every second the air around you thickened. Now it felt like you were running through chest deep water, and now molasses. What was going on? Startled you look down at your left leg, the source of this odd sensation. It didn’t take long to notice the suddenly all too visible dart sticking out of your left hamstring. Now it felt as if you’re running through sand, impossibly slow. The realisation hit you harder than freight train … the poison that soaked the dart set into action immediately; both a potent localized anaesthetic and an effective neurotoxin. Before you could really contemplate the consequences of …<br />
<br />
Floor … <br />
<br />
Darkness …<br />
<br />
* * * * * <br />
<br />
Now it felt like you were buried in concrete. Somehow you manage to force your eyelids open, and the sight that awaited you took several agonizing moments to reach your brain. You were in a dark room, that much you could tell, but no detail was taking shape. Maybe the poison hadn’t worn off yet. The recognition of a sharp pain in your left hamstring disproved that theory. Your attempt at wincing was not much better than your previous eye-opening ordeal. By the time your eyelid muscles responded to the automatic pain reflex, the pain was pretty much gone. It was as if someone had taken your nerves while you were blacked out, and replaced them with wires that raced around the whole world before they ended at their target. If opening and closing your eyes took seconds, you didn’t want to think how difficult walking would be. <br />
<br />
“Ah … so you’re finally up.” A raspy, female voice cut your contemplating off. Your brain had no problem realising this voice grated your very nerves. She had the kind of voice that was instantly annoying beyond belief; the kind of voice that sent goose bumps all along your arms when your brain functioned properly. Why did your brain have no problem integrating her voice? You were suddenly aware that this woman was actually hovering right over your face, blocking the light source from you. Goose bumps ran down your arm, just now reacting to her voice. How annoying. “Haghahag … cough … hak … you were slow to recover, child … hak hak … at least you survived … cough … much better than most humans would have fared.” Her disgusting wheezing and coughing and laughing made you want to vomit, or maybe it was the lingering effect of the poison. You could feel your muscles moving in response to the gag reflex, but before the natural motion of things could dish out its product; your muscles stopped moving, and then relaxed.<br />
<br />
“I wouldn’t move … cough … if I were you … baha … you may have beat Sheila’s poison … but … hak … the poison running through your veins now … haghaghak … is much more deadly.” She laughed a disgusting, blood curdling laugh; her lungs so full of mucous you’d think she would have drowned a long time ago. Again you feel like vomiting, but again your muscles tense and then relax. “Don’t even try child … now tell me … hak … I would love to know … bahag … before I end your life, how you managed to steal the Queen Bee … who sent you here child … haha … if you are a child at all.” Your jaw muscles and tongue are suddenly much more solid feeling than the rest of your body, the neural connections inhibited no longer. Was this hag controlling your body? Was she allowing you to speak? Whatever it was, you were granted the ability to speak, yet full body movement still eluded you. Better make the best of it. Apparently your life depended on it. <br />
<br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Chartreuse">What was it with him embarking on journeys to look for new teammates, only to get gagged and bound by sinister forces? As Shadow regained his thought processes it was the first line to rise from the internal sea of confusion, but bit by bit Shadow struggled to put the pieces together in spite of his dulled status. The Ariados had not been a wild Pokémon; she was the Pokémon of this new ancient player on the scene with an apparent vendetta of her own. Clearly what she lacked in vitality and health, she more than made up for it in general nastiness. Worse still, the odds were in her complete favour and she didn't seem particularly receptive to attempts at diversion, either -- not that the scientist had any idea what she meant. He couldn't see beyond the direct, honest approach, and any concern for his team and the Combee would have to wait. If he fudged this no amount of concern would help at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Madame, I speak with honesty -- I have not come across the Queen Bee of your mention,&quot; he coughed, hoping his tone sounded open as opposed to defiant. &quot;Until some hours ago I had never come across this forest before, either, on my own accord as an adventurer. In which case, I also emphasise my complete lack of affliaton in coming here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reflexively Shadow bit his lip -- a struggling task, all things considered. As best he could, he tried not to consider the consequences of the new venom if time dragged on...</span></span></div>

<br />
<b>Kori Gotcha:</b> The realisation hits you like a ton of bricks. With a psychic type enlisted in your party, communicating with your “deaf” Combusken through “mute” lips seems like a joke now. Your Girafarig appears by your side within moments, happily joining you in your time of need. It doesn’t take long for him to realise something is terribly wrong. He opens his mouth to say something and just like before, no sound comes out. Having only one way to communicate with the psychic giraffe you focus your thoughts on one thing only; communicating. <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;… That's right Girafarig, we got ourselves one heck of a weird problem here and I think your the only way that we're going to be able to get out of this one. For whatever reason, there's no sound from anything so I'm going to need you to help me out. I want you to help me relay my orders to Combusken alright! …&gt;</i> You think, hoping your partner can read your thoughts. The nod you receive in response confirms that Girafarig has indeed heard you, so you fire off your commands. Girafarig nods once more and closes his eyes. You turn to look at Combusken who is the one to nod now, getting the instructions through the messenger. Ecstatic that everything has finally worked out you confidently gaze at your opponent, who still looks in good shape. <br />
<br />
The Beedrill, noticing a new comer goes into action right away, but what happens next is not something you were anticipating. The Beedrill’s stinger glows an intense yellow, the same shade of yellow that the orb had been when it expanded to turn into this Beedrill. The stinger radiates with bright pulses, before three “missiles” fire off from the stinger and stick in the ground. It doesn’t take long for these projectiles to begin to expand just like the Beedrill before them. Amazingly the transformation does not take long, but a fraction of the time it took the Beedrill, and now you are staring at three Weedle on the ground. Clearly, with the addition of a second foe, the Beedrill will attempt to even out the field. The Weedle will run interference against your Girafarig while it remains focused on Combusken. <br />
<br />
Combusken, who had obviously figured out the Beedrill’s plan wastes no time launching into the offensive. While Beedrill was birthing new foes, Combusken had raised his <b>agility</b>. Now, a bright <b>ember</b> flies and nails the bee right on, a patch of burned skin clearly left behind. At the same time, Girafarig stomps ahead, picking up speed and lowers his head just in time to completely obliterate one of the Weedle. The sphere you stand in pulsates brilliantly as the Weedle is converted back into pure energy by the attack. Combusken now, closes his eyes to focus on his next attack. Before the Beedrill can attack, Combusken slams his outstretched palm into the ground, creating a powerful wave of air to rush towards the unsuspecting insect. Agitated by the sneak attack which cheated the attacking order the Beedrill launches itself needles first at Combusken, spearing him with a powerful <b>poison jab</b>. Both Combusken and Beedrill wince in pain; Combusken from the attack, Beedrill from its burn. Girafarig in the meantime has turned on the second Weedle, trying to <b>astonish</b> the interference. While the attack lands without a hitch, it is not enough to dispatch this Weedle. Now it is the two Weedle, who combine their forces; one bites Girafarig’s leg, the other using its stinger to jab at Girafarig’s back leg. Girafarig rears as the super effective <b>bug bite</b> on its front leg sinks in. While in the reared position Girafarig neighed, or would have if sound was working. Several seconds later a shooting star cuts across the battlefield; its effect being delayed slightly.<br />
<br />
This round of battling had certainly picked up the pace and you can’t help but feel excited as you watch the action take place in front of you. But you are not out of the woods yet, there is still battling to be done.<br />
<br />
<i>What will you do now?</i><br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Chartreuse"> Finally Kori and his team were making headway but a new problem presented itself. Kori was locked with Combusken and Girafarig out on the battle field. With the forest reacting to the number of combatants on the field, Kori was afraid to see what would happen if he sent out Paras or Pachirisu, and he was also afraid of seeing what would happen if he recalled Combusken. No, Kori had to stick to his guns and push on through. Kori looked directly at Girafarig and began thinking about another set of battle orders, sure that Girafarig would pick them up.<br />
<br />
<i>Girafarig! <b>Double Kick</b> those Weedle off of your legs and <b>Zen</b> Headbutt both of them back where they came from! After that, I need you to tell Combusken to bring that Beedrill down with a <b>Thunder Punch</b> and then use <b>Rock Slide</b>. If this battle is still not done after that, tell Combusken to use Crush Claw!</i> Kori mentally ordered. </span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray"><div style="text-align: center"><b><u>Mireno Cemetery</u></b>&#8203;</div><br />
<b><u>Catacombs</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Hayward</u></b><br />
All things considered, you're now quite certain that something must have happened a long time ago beneath the abandoned town of Mireno -- something big, something sinister; you don't need all the fiddly details to conclude that whatever happened, it was bad news. Valiant as they are, you see unease mirrored in both your Pokémon, and even the wrinkles upon Yuanli's forehead take a renewed, solemn crease. Regardless of what you might be facing in the future, you have a pressing need to fight that which you are facing <i>now</i>, and you promptly bark fresh orders for your fighters. Bringing a palm forward, Medéo taps into his focus to bring about a <b>Flash</b> of light emanating from his palm, instantly drowning out the mystical torches lining the walls with the stronger illuminescence. Where Arbok's Screech had affected your group entirely, a return of karma has all three enemies blinking their eyes from the unexpected irritation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well played, Will. Now, Chroma, a <b>Water Pulse</b> would be most preferable.&quot; Reaching for another trick up his Ghost-type sleeve, Chroma pulls up a shimmering ball which he hurls, instantly exploding across the side of the disoriented Houndour. A howl is heard from the fiery canine as the liquid seems to hiss as it drips, while in front of you Medéo raises his other hand in the air; a graceful arc slashed downwards as the resultant <b>Psycho Cut</b> screams across the dark floor. Almost like it was being strangled Arbok writhes as it coils sharply, unintelligible curses stringing from its mouth; you have a hunch that the attack struck Arbok by its vital spot. Peering to your right, you see Suméo catch Sneasel in the <b>Force Palm</b> of his hand, sending the feline skidding backwards by the magnitude of the strike, boosted from the anger it had cursed your Pokémon with earlier.<br />
<br />
Renewed confidence marking his chubby complexion, Suméo pushes himself forward for the next move, but contrary to what you hoped for Sneasel swings its leg under the Makuhita's bulk, playing his weight against him in a <b>Low Kick</b>. Instantly you feel an urge to step towards Suméo as he struggles to pick himself up, but Arbok draws your attention as it snarls.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Ssssso... you would choossssse to perish here... We will honour your decisssssion!</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will, look out!&quot; Your time in Mireno so far has led you to place good faith in your new companion's interjections, and Yuanli's alert call is not one you ignore. Leaping back with Medéo you barely avoid a sizzling spray of substance spraying from the snake's jaws; while you're no idea what it is the piercingly pungent smell clearly informs you that distance would be the best policy. Medéo on the other hand is not as lucky as his arm catches a stray spurt, and he cries at the poison eating at his limb.<br />
<br />
&quot;<b>Gunk Shot</b>. It's the strongest Poison-type attack known to Pokémon of that type, and judging by how it's affecting the floor... we can't take this lightly,&quot; mutters Yuanli, before he takes a glance to the left. &quot;Chroma, the time for support is at hand; a <b>Reflect</b> if you don't mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sabl...&quot; Drawing back from the Houndour, spatters of an <b>Ember</b> just fizzling out from his chest, the ever-trusty spirit taps into more of his Psychic capabilities. Much like how he had safeguarded the Drapion earlier, a glimmering panel appears in front of your team which Suméo hurries behind, leaving the trio of scowling Pokémon watching at the protective screen. &quot;Excellent work, Chroma. Now, another <b>Power Gem</b>!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sabl sabl sabl!&quot; Another array of glittering jewels leaves Chroma's eyes, barrelling straight into the frustrated <b>Flamethrower</b> of Houndour; while it doesn't stop the assault completely you notice with a smirk it does have the effect of turning Chroma's ballistic missiles into fiery ballistic missiles, received with another yelp by the Dark Pokémon. Determined to complete his task, Suméo rushes at Sneasel with his arms waving around again, but this time Sneasel rushes ahead to meet him. Briefly disappearing for a split second, Sneasel smacks Suméo by his cheek with a glancing <b>Faint Attack</b>; you note the move to be mostly resisted but enough to send Suméo staggering to the side, a development you note with a frown as serious as Sneasel's grin. &quot;<i>Thissss isssss the bessssst of thossssse who might tempt death... Your remains will decorate the wallssssss of thissssss cave, I promisssssse that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn't even seem to be taking us seriously,&quot; Yuanli notices with worry, as you spot the faint magenta glow of <b>Stockpile</b> surrounding Arbok. &quot;Perhaps we need to rethink our focus for the... What's that?&quot; In the direction pointed by Yuanli's rod, you see what has newly caught the veteran's eye: even as he lies on the limestone ground a glow has likewise began to surround Suméo...<br />
<br />
What will you do?</i></span><i><br />
<br />
Note: Hayward, if you'd not like your Makuhita to evolve now, just send me a quick PM and I'll rectify this update.</i></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray"><b><u>Catacombs</u></b></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray"><b><u>Hayward</u></b></span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">All things considered, you're now quite certain that something must have happened a long time ago beneath the abandoned town of Mireno -- something big, something sinister; you don't need all the fiddly details to conclude that whatever happened, it was bad news. Valiant as they are, you see unease mirrored in both your Pokémon, and even the wrinkles upon Yuanli's forehead take a renewed, solemn crease. Regardless of what you might be facing in the future, you have a pressing need to fight that which you are facing <i>now</i>, and you promptly bark fresh orders for your fighters. Bringing a palm forward, Medéo taps into his focus to bring about a <b>Flash</b> of light emanating from his palm, instantly drowning out the mystical torches lining the walls with the stronger illuminescence. Where Arbok's Screech had affected your group entirely, a return of karma has all three enemies blinking their eyes from the unexpected irritation.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;Well played, Will. Now, Chroma, a <b>Water Pulse</b> would be most preferable.&quot; Reaching for another trick up his Ghost-type sleeve, Chroma pulls up a shimmering ball which he hurls, instantly exploding across the side of the disoriented Houndour. A howl is heard from the fiery canine as the liquid seems to hiss as it drips, while in front of you Medéo raises his other hand in the air; a graceful arc slashed downwards as the resultant <b>Psycho Cut</b> screams across the dark floor. Almost like it was being strangled Arbok writhes as it coils sharply, unintelligible curses stringing from its mouth; you have a hunch that the attack struck Arbok by its vital spot. Peering to your right, you see Suméo catch Sneasel in the <b>Force Palm</b> of his hand, sending the feline skidding backwards by the magnitude of the strike, boosted from the anger it had cursed your Pokémon with earlier.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Renewed confidence marking his chubby complexion, Suméo pushes himself forward for the next move, but contrary to what you hoped for Sneasel swings its leg under the Makuhita's bulk, playing his weight against him in a <b>Low Kick</b>. Instantly you feel an urge to step towards Suméo as he struggles to pick himself up, but Arbok draws your attention as it snarls.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;<i>Ssssso... you would choossssse to perish here... We will honour your decisssssion!</i>&quot;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;Will, look out!&quot; Your time in Mireno so far has led you to place good faith in your new companion's interjections, and Yuanli's alert call is not one you ignore. Leaping back with Medéo you barely avoid a sizzling spray of substance spraying from the snake's jaws; while you're no idea what it is the piercingly pungent smell clearly informs you that distance would be the best policy. Medéo on the other hand is not as lucky as his arm catches a stray spurt, and he cries at the poison eating at his limb.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;<b>Gunk Shot</b>. It's the strongest Poison-type attack known to Pokémon of that type, and judging by how it's affecting the floor... we can't take this lightly,&quot; mutters Yuanli, before he takes a glance to the left. &quot;Chroma, the time for support is at hand; a <b>Reflect</b> if you don't mind.&quot;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;Sabl...&quot; Drawing back from the Houndour, spatters of an <b>Ember</b> just fizzling out from his chest, the ever-trusty spirit taps into more of his Psychic capabilities. Much like how he had safeguarded the Drapion earlier, a glimmering panel appears in front of your team which Suméo hurries behind, leaving the trio of scowling Pokémon watching at the protective screen. &quot;Excellent work, Chroma. Now, another <b>Power Gem</b>!&quot;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;Sabl sabl sabl!&quot; Another array of glittering jewels leaves Chroma's eyes, barrelling straight into the frustrated <b>Flamethrower</b> of Houndour; while it doesn't stop the assault completely you notice with a smirk it does have the effect of turning Chroma's ballistic missiles into fiery ballistic missiles, received with another yelp by the Dark Pokémon. Determined to complete his task, Suméo rushes at Sneasel with his arms waving around again, but this time Sneasel rushes ahead to meet him. Briefly disappearing for a split second, Sneasel smacks Suméo by his cheek with a glancing <b>Faint Attack</b>; you note the move to be mostly resisted but enough to send Suméo staggering to the side, a development you note with a frown as serious as Sneasel's grin. &quot;<i>Thissss isssss the bessssst of thossssse who might tempt death... Your remains will decorate the wallssssss of thissssss cave, I promisssssse that...&quot;</i></span></span><i><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;It doesn't even seem to be taking us seriously,&quot; Yuanli notices with worry, as you spot the faint magenta glow of <b>Stockpile</b> surrounding Arbok. &quot;Perhaps we need to rethink our focus for the... What's that?&quot; In the direction pointed by Yuanli's rod, you see what has newly caught the veteran's eye: even as he lies on the limestone ground a glow has likewise began to surround Suméo...</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">What will you do?</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px">Note: Hayward, if you'd not like your Makuhita to evolve now, just send me a quick PM and I'll rectify this update.</span></i>

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px">Evolve away!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">In the catacombs deep beneath the surface of Mireno, Yuanli lifted his walking staff and pointed it in Sumeo’s direction. The chubby yellow-gold Makuhita lay sprawled, face down on the ground, glowing weakly. He had only been able to get in one attack before being tripped up by the enemy Sneasel. Moments later, the ice weasel had succeeded in knocking him to the ground a second time with just a glancing hit. Will knew that his partner must undoubtedly feel upset about how its first battle was faring.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Hoping to lift the spirits of his fallen comrade, Will called out comforting words to him. “Don’t listen to their threats, Sumeo! You’ll grow stronger with time!” the boy encouraged. “Then, not only will you be able to win 1 on 1 battles, but you’ll also be able to take down ten Pokemon alone as well!” </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">With the faint glow still emanating from Sumeo, Will continued, issuing instructions to both of his teammates. “Let’s stop them now! <b>Belly Drum</b>, Sumeo! Then hit Sneasel with a <b>Close Combat</b>! Medeo, forget Arbok for a minute. Before Sumeo attacks, <b>Psych</b> yourself <b>Up</b> just like him, then help him take on Sneasel with a <b>Force Palm</b>!”</span></span><br />

Quickly recognising the light now surrounding your Makuhita, you shout encouragment along with commands to help fuel the process further. Even as the words echo through the chamber Suméo begins to undergo rapid changes; his normally pudgy body quickly gaining even more mass and bulk than you'd anticipated, seeming to push his prostrate position into a hefty hulk. The knot atop his head appears to vanish, replaced by a swirling formation almost similar to a cloak extending from the back of his noggin. Where his spherical hands extended from his short arms now lie threateningly wide palms the size of your head, and by the time the light fades gone is the childlike wrestler you used to know; pushed by the battle a Hariyama now stands in Suméo's place, flexing his hands that ripple with new muscle.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Foolsssss! Do you think a paltry evolution will be sssssufficient?!</i>&quot; hisses Arbok. &quot;<i>Now die!!</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chroma, <b>Double Team</b> post-haste!&quot; orders Yuanli, and by the severity of both master's and enemy's tones the Sableye once again springs into action. You spy Chroma scuttle along the rocky floor, soon followed by two -- then three, then four. Spreading out as Houndour comes bounding at them, the group of Chroma leave the charging canine with its fangs bared headed for the sage, only for the old man to promptly swing the tip of his staff forward. With a dull thud the wooden point meets the Houndour by the skull on its forehead, stunning it enough to stop it in its tracks much to your amused observation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will, now! Use your focus; we can't keep this gambit up forever!&quot; calls the veteran, reaching into his pouch for a few red berries. &quot;Ha! An Occa Berry for you, young one!&quot; he cries, flinging the fruit into Houndour's <b>Fire Fang</b>; the resulting contact releasing a small explosion of spice enough to make your eyes water at the edges as the Fire-resistant berry weakens the attack. &quot;Chroma, <b>Fury Swipes</b> to <b>Detect</b>! Exercise utmost caution!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;SABL SABL SABL!&quot; Without your attention on the gremlins, it surprises you as Team Chroma unlatches themselves from the roof of the chamber, dropping onto Arbok who reacts with an enraged roar, tearing at it with repeated notches all over its skin. A glob of <b>Sludge Bomb</b> flies over you, followed by another that nearly grazes Medéo by the side, but you know you have no time to waste on seeing if Chroma's evasive methods are effective. Cornered like a rat, Sneasel glares at the two fully evolved Fighting Pokémon before charging ahead; its hand glinting with a harsh <b>Ice Punch</b> that Suméo takes -- with even more weight and fat to take the physical blow, Suméo barely even seems to register the technique before he smacks his <b>Belly</b> like a <b>Drum</b>, forcing his very essence into physical strength...<br />
<br />
&quot;Sneaaaaasel!&quot; hollers the ice feline, an evil glint in its eye that both you and Suméo catch, and before you realise it Arbok and Houndour have relinquished their quarries as they advance over to Suméo. A strike, joined by another, then combined with a series of smacks as you recognise the <b>Beat Up</b> strategy in horror; having taken the most damage, would Suméo make it?<br />
<br />
&quot;Medicham!&quot; A valiant cry comes from Medéo as he finishes his <b>Psych Up</b>, all of Suméo's battle power now his as well, breaking into a quick jog just as the snake and the dog disperse. While Suméo staggers in recovery Medéo wastes little time in a direct <b>Force Palm</b> to Sneasel's chest; the undiluted power of the Fighting strength unlocked by the Medicham sending the Sneasel into the dirt as a screaming projectile. Barely before it has a chance to recover Suméo has already forced himself upon Sneasel, swinging both his hands in a spectacular slam upon it, barely letting a squeal escape as both his magnificent palms cover the Ice-type in the show of <b>Close Combat</b>. Lifting his limbs in a scattering of dust Suméo reveals Arbok's underling, in no shape at all to continue fighting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will. Now that Suméo's just evolved, my guess is that he's tired himself out,&quot; Yuanli points to you tersely; indeed the Hariyama appears to support himself on one huge hand. &quot;I think you know as well that Belly Drum and Close Combat are skills that drain the user considerably as well, in exchange for unimaginable power... it might be suitable to pull Suméo out to a safe zone temporarily. Arbok and Houndour, noting this, will likely target him first.&quot;<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span></div>
