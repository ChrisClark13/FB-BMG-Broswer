<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Quickly recognising the light now surrounding your Makuhita, you shout encouragment along with commands to help fuel the process further. Even as the words echo through the chamber SumÃ©o begins to undergo rapid changes; his normally pudgy body quickly gaining even more mass and bulk than you'd anticipated, seeming to push his prostrate position into a hefty hulk. The knot atop his head appears to vanish, replaced by a swirling formation almost similar to a cloak extending from the back of his noggin. Where his spherical hands extended from his short arms now lie threateningly wide palms the size of your head, and by the time the light fades gone is the childlike wrestler you used to know; pushed by the battle a Hariyama now stands in SumÃ©o's place, flexing his hands that ripple with new muscle.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;<i>Foolsssss! Do you think a paltry evolution will be sssssufficient?!</i>&quot; hisses Arbok. &quot;<i>Now die!!</i>&quot;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;Chroma, <b>Double Team</b> post-haste!&quot; orders Yuanli, and by the severity of both master's and enemy's tones the Sableye once again springs into action. You spy Chroma scuttle along the rocky floor, soon followed by two -- then three, then four. Spreading out as Houndour comes bounding at them, the group of Chroma leave the charging canine with its fangs bared headed for the sage, only for the old man to promptly swing the tip of his staff forward. With a dull thud the wooden point meets the Houndour by the skull on its forehead, stunning it enough to stop it in its tracks much to your amused observation.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;Will, now! Use your focus; we can't keep this gambit up forever!&quot; calls the veteran, reaching into his pouch for a few red berries. &quot;Ha! An Occa Berry for you, young one!&quot; he cries, flinging the fruit into Houndour's <b>Fire Fang</b>; the resulting contact releasing a small explosion of spice enough to make your eyes water at the edges as the Fire-resistant berry weakens the attack. &quot;Chroma, <b>Fury Swipes</b> to <b>Detect</b>! Exercise utmost caution!&quot;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;SABL SABL SABL!&quot; Without your attention on the gremlins, it surprises you as Team Chroma unlatches themselves from the roof of the chamber, dropping onto Arbok who reacts with an enraged roar, tearing at it with repeated notches all over its skin. A glob of <b>Sludge Bomb</b> flies over you, followed by another that nearly grazes MedÃ©o by the side, but you know you have no time to waste on seeing if Chroma's evasive methods are effective. Cornered like a rat, Sneasel glares at the two fully evolved Fighting PokÃ©mon before charging ahead; its hand glinting with a harsh <b>Ice Punch</b> that SumÃ©o takes -- with even more weight and fat to take the physical blow, SumÃ©o barely even seems to register the technique before he smacks his <b>Belly</b> like a <b>Drum</b>, forcing his very essence into physical strength...</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;Sneaaaaasel!&quot; hollers the ice feline, an evil glint in its eye that both you and SumÃ©o catch, and before you realise it Arbok and Houndour have relinquished their quarries as they advance over to SumÃ©o. A strike, joined by another, then combined with a series of smacks as you recognise the <b>Beat Up</b> strategy in horror; having taken the most damage, would SumÃ©o make it?</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;Medicham!&quot; A valiant cry comes from MedÃ©o as he finishes his <b>Psych Up</b>, all of SumÃ©o's battle power now his as well, breaking into a quick jog just as the snake and the dog disperse. While SumÃ©o staggers in recovery MedÃ©o wastes little time in a direct <b>Force Palm</b> to Sneasel's chest; the undiluted power of the Fighting strength unlocked by the Medicham sending the Sneasel into the dirt as a screaming projectile. Barely before it has a chance to recover SumÃ©o has already forced himself upon Sneasel, swinging both his hands in a spectacular slam upon it, barely letting a squeal escape as both his magnificent palms cover the Ice-type in the show of <b>Close Combat</b>. Lifting his limbs in a scattering of dust SumÃ©o reveals Arbok's underling, in no shape at all to continue fighting.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;Will. Now that SumÃ©o's just evolved, my guess is that he's tired himself out,&quot; Yuanli points to you tersely; indeed the Hariyama appears to support himself on one huge hand. &quot;I think you know as well that Belly Drum and Close Combat are skills that drain the user considerably as well, in exchange for unimaginable power... it might be suitable to pull SumÃ©o out to a safe zone temporarily. Arbok and Houndour, noting this, will likely target him first.&quot;</span></span><br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Inside Jirachiâs Casino a boy dressed in a black jacket and black trousers sat in front of a slot machine, hammering away, while a small Meditite merrily collected all the coins its trainer had won in a little bucket. The manager of the place, a young woman with shiny, waist-length black hair and emerald green eyes cheered for her customers via a microphone, exclaiming that the more Pikachus one got in a row, the more coins one earned. A bell clanged loudly nearby, signaling that one lucky patron had just won the jackpot, and the dazzling room was suddenly flooded in a wave of celebratory roars and screams.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Feeling good about their current win streak, the boy and the mystic left their slot machine, strode over to a Roulette table, and cheerfully dumped out their pail of coins in front of an astonished casino dealer. The two friends shared an eager smile and excitedly shook hands before the boy announced his bet. âEverything on Red Togepi!â he confidently exclaimed, as the Meditite grinned and nodded its onion-shaped head in agreement. With that, the other two gamblers at the table, a lad wearing a bright yellow Souwester hat and tattered overcoat, and a Collector wearing a Runpapa-esque sombrero, gaped their mouths and sweatdropped at the duoâs enthusiasm.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Moments later however, the boy and his Meditite companion sat in glum silence on the frontsteps of Jirachiâs Casino. The brown-haired youth was as still as a Silcoon awaiting evolution. Had it not been for the rise and fall of his shoulders accompanying an occasional sigh, passersby would have certainly mistaken him for a statue. At his feet lay an empty coin case. Overhead, a massive animatronic model of the Wish-granting Pokemon waved a hand hypnotically, beckoning gamers to enter and test their luck. Outlined in bright multicolored bulbs, the clubâs mascot bathed the terrace and the forlorn pair in iridescent neon light. Chin in hands, elbows on knees, grey-green eyes staring at nothing in particular, the boy sat lost in thought, wondering if &quot;fortune would ever guide his hand.&quot;</span></span><br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">* * *</span></span>&#8203;</div> <br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">In the Catacombs deep beneath the surface of Mireno, the trainer Will Hale grinned broadly at the thought that his gamble had paid off. For the first time in his life, <i>Lady Luck</i> had smiled on him. The <b><span style="color: white">Belly Drum-Close Combat</span></b> combo and teamwork strategy he ordered had worked, and with only Houndour and Arbok left, they now had numbers on their side.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Thinking hard to come up with a plan, Will massaged his forehead and turned to his partners. Glancing at Sumeo, the boy marveled that it had evolved into the mighty Hariyama during its first ever battle and reasoned that being united in determination towards the same goal as Medeo and Chroma had caused it to reach its final stage so soon. Sumeo grinned happily at Will and took another bite of its Leftovers, trying to replenish its spent strength. Returning the smile, Will noticed that despite its cheerful exterior, Sumeo labored to get a full breath. Will realized that its evolution, combined with the two energy-sapping attacks, must have drained it considerably.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">âFall back, mate!â Will directed, motioning for the hulking sumo wrestler to retreat and take a break. âMedeo, cover him with <b><span style="color: white">Reflect</span></b>, then follow Chromaâs lead with <span style="color: white"><b>Double Team</b></span>!â The Medicham nodded and elegantly hopped from foot-to-foot readying itself for battle. Recalling Yuanliâs admonition to stay focused, Will suddenly had an idea and instantly called out further orders. âWhile our enemies are distracted by the clones, look for an opening then hit Houndour with a <span style="color: white"><b>Focus Punch</b></span>!â</span></span><br />

Having succeeded in felling one of your two foes, you call for defensive efforts to focus on SumÃ©o, certain as Yuanli that your Hariyama is now the weaker link in spite of the effort he put in. With almost renewed difficulty at the massive increase of his body mass the Arm Thrust PokÃ©mon shuffles back as MedÃ©o readies a <b>Reflect</b> screen for him to take cover behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Ssssso... you continue to defy ussssss, eh?</i>&quot; Arbok sneers, and you suddenly get the impression that the snake isn't particularly bothered by Sneasel's defeat. &quot;Gnot rseh tegavl asot ka ewehte cifric fas...&quot; In a language you've never heard before Arbok begins to chant, no longer with the sinister lisp you know but in a much harsher, ominous tone that you wonder if it hadn't magicked the new voice from somewhere else... or were even more darker forces at work here? Nothing prepares you, though, as Sneasel's body is captured by a red light, glittery and vaguely reminiscent of the PokÃ©Ball capture mechanism, suddenly disintegrating the silhouetted creature into a million fragments...<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; The exclamation from Yuanli, if anything, indicates to you that the sage has never experienced such a phenomenon either, but the apparent death of Sneasel does not end there; shimmering in its fragmented state, the crimson essence wafts over like poisonous gas, surrounding Houndour who seems to accept the energy with a knowing grin. To your horror a white flash of light abruptly surrounds the hellhound, masking its body from your view, but you already realise the end result of what has just taken place -- an arrowed tail, a pair of sharply raked horns, and a leaner, meaner frame emerge from the light of evolution. &quot;I don't believe it,&quot; whispers Yuanli, as Houndoom paws the ground and howls, sending shivers down your vertebrae. &quot;What cursed power is this?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Ahhh... Sssssurprisssssed? You'll have an afterlifetime to deal with that little conundrum... We'll make you beg for it!</i>&quot; A stray splatter of acid is fired as Arbok hisses, returning to its usual method of communication. Snapping its jaws, Houndoom lunges forward as the Chromas chitter in alarm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay strong, Chroma!&quot; Yuanli calls as the Sableye scatter, &quot;You still have the advantage of numbers! Will, <i>now</i>!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Medicham!&quot; Nodding, MedÃ©o recognises the signal to continue his command, and it doesn't take long for the focus the Medicham is known for to kick in. Almost like magic the original MedÃ©o is joined by his summoned brethren, all posed similarly alongside him as their palms begin to glow...<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>You won't get away with that thissssss time!</i>&quot; Spitting venomously, Arbok releases a cloud of <b>Haze</b> from its mouth as Houndoom puts its nose to the ground. To their individual shock, MedÃ©o looks about as his newly generated brothers vanish as the fog takes them, while the sounds of Chroma squeaking is heard as the fiery canine glares at one of them. A shockwave of <b>Dark Pulse</b> blasts forth out of Houndoom's open mouth, slamming into the real Chroma identified by Houndoom's <b>Odour Sleuth</b>ing; with a dangerous grin Arbok spits a glob of <b>Acid</b> that catches MedÃ©o by surprise, causing him to stumble back as his focus is broken. Things aren't looking as good as you might've hoped all of a sudden...</span></span></div>

<b><u>Moonlit Garden</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Handymankg2</u></b><br />
The mere nature of the Grass-type escapade convincing you to help out the poliwogs, your immediate offer sends notably renewed excitement amongst the aquatic PokÃ©mon. The younger ones immediately start huddling about you in apparent wonder, while some of the older ones keep their ground, though not without wide-eyed gazes cast at you and Bellatrix. Shuffling over, Poliwrath takes your hand in a firm handshake with such force, you have a sharp idea that if the Fighting-type exerted any further you might end up without a right hand to call your own. Solemnly Poliwrath meets your eyes once again before raising its palm, indicating direction roughly in the zone of where you had entered the garden -- turning back, you realise that Poliwrath is pointing to the forested area in Rosalina Island. Vaguely remembering passing by when you had scaled Wilheim Path, it takes you a few moments as Poliwrath retreats his palm to conclude that the evolved tadpole cannot offer you any further insight, much to its apparent regret. Nevertheless you give the Water-types a promise of affirmation; you will certainly return with the item that was taken from them, and with that you and Bella depart from the castle grounds.<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center">***&#8203;</div><br />
It doesn't take you long to reach the forest's outskirts, but conversely, you find yourself suddenly a lot more hesitant at the borders of the woods. Even from here you can tell that, at least, this is <i>not</i> the sort of location anyone would pick for a camping trip, except perhaps those who had a taste for the deathly despairing. Each tree looks like an entity twisted in petrified agony; their pain betrayed by the grotesques patterns in which they turn. Is this where the marauding plant PokÃ©mon army had come from? Unease creeps into your mind, along with it, possibly a few tinges of sympathy -- if this was where you had to live you feel that immediately moving would be a top priority for you as well, but nonetheless, you still had a mission to do and a promise to keep.<br />
<br />
With your hand holding Bellatrix's, you begin your journey into Rosalina Forest, a tremble rippling up your leg with each step you take. You note a distinct drop in the volume of Bella's buzzing as she maintains her high alert mode; both of you are quite certain that at some point, confrontation will not only be necessary, but it will come fast and furious --<br />
<br />
<b><i>SWOOSH.</i></b><br />
<br />
&quot;Vezzzzpiquen!&quot;<br />
<br />
Feeling Bella's claw abruptly fly out of your hand, you barely register the absence of your starter when the sensation of scratch marks on your hand is promptly replaced by something striking your chest, wrapping around your arms, pulling you backwards and slamming you against a tree. Seeing Staryu, it takes you a few seconds before you recognise Bella's shrill shrieking, and squinting in the darkness you see her eyes and talons flash angrily as she struggles against her bindings... blue bindings, in fact, that you find gruesomely familiar. Sure enough, as your eyes reorient themselves to allow for night vision you see several Tangela holding her down against a tree; it doesn't take long for you to realise that the same must have happened to you. Worse still, the Tangela aren't the only ones -- with dread you recognise the assortment of other Grass PokÃ©mon that seem to have appeared out of nowhere amongst the darkness, along with others in their ranks. Murkrow and Hoothoot perch on branches, while Oddish and Seedot line the ground with the others, almost like a public execution...<br />
<br />
&quot;Skrreeee!&quot; The Tangela gathered about Bella drawing your attention, you're horrified to see glittering blue powder surround your PokÃ©mon as she valiantly continues to struggle, only to slump as the <b>Sleep Powder</b> works its effects on her. Rage surges in you, prompting you to attempt in making a break for it, but the lashings around you are, if anything, more secure than the <b>Grass Knot</b> you had fallen under earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;TAN-growth.&quot; At the commanding voice, you notice a shuffle amongst the other PokÃ©mon; doubtlessly in preparation for the head honcho to come. As it emerges from its apparent hiding place, you recall the shadow that had made off with the Moondrop in Poliwrath's memory: this Tangrowth must be the very same culprit that had led the uncalled-for assault on Moonlit Garden.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tan, tangrowth, tangrowth.&quot; Almost like an actual, hooded executioner, Tangrowth silences the crowd with a single wave of its extendable arm and begins steadily stepping towards you. What now? You make another desperate wring but the vines holding you are no less unforgiving than they were moments ago, though as your fingers feel their way around you realise that maybe, just maybe, you could reach along your belt and fling out a PokÃ©Ball to defend yourself...</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">Mind if I evolve my Duskull in this battle? I've been looking for a good opportunity and this seems like one.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkslateblue">It took only a few minutes for Rick to reach the desired location, his buggy partner still loyally floating besides him. A moment of frisson passed through his body; he was about to go on a mission, a real mission, to help others in the world. It was almost as if he was a secret agent of some form, almost, but not quite. Secret Agents are paid for their work, the only payment Rick wanted was to see the look on the Poli-pals faces. The moment was lost when he actually took a glance at the woods themselves. It wasnât exactly the kindest place in the world, every tree being completely unique, all of them twisted as if they were being forced apart at the seams, yet resisting with all their mightâs the horror of pure death. But nothing was pulling them as far as Rick could see, nothing was even touching them. It was a horrible sight, but he had to ignore it if he was going to keep himself moving forwards. Rick held his hand towards his hive queen, and soon was grasping on, a small courage emerging inside him as the pair then began to walk into what was known as Rosalina Forest, fear still spreading through Ricks body with every step and breath he took. Bellatrixâs buzzing slowly becomes lighter as she scanned the area for some threat, as the pair of you knew that a fight would soon be occurring, and from the looks of the flashback that the Polis had given him, it was going to be dangerously sudden and brutal. What fun.<br />
<br />
SWOOSH.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vezzzzpiquen!&quot;<br />
<br />
Without warning, the large swishing noise spread nearby and hung on the wind momentarily, but Rick was less worried about the swishing sound and more by the cry of his partner. Her claw was abruptly launched from Ricks hand, flying backwards somewhere and leaving some scratch marks on the skins surface. The shocking sensation was soon replaced with something striking his chest, wrapping round his arms, and smashing him into a tree. The pain was immense, and Rick could barely recognise anything for a few seconds, his eyes and mind out of focus due to the blow his head had just taken. Bellatrix shrieked once again, though, and this manage bring Ricks mind back into focus. Squinting into the darkness, his glaze met upon her eyes and talons, which angrily tried to break free from the restraining attack. In fact, Rick noticed that they were blue bindings holding the Vespiquen, and he knew exactly what had happened. Glancing around as his eyes shifted to the best night vision his body could manage at the moment, it seemed that several Tangela were holding her down against a tree. With her trapped in such a way, it was obvious that Rick had true been trapped by the same blue menaces. Not only were the Tangela in the area, but other grass Pokemon seem to have come out of the darkness, Murkrow and Hoothoot sitting on branches, whereas Oddish and Seedot lined the ground. This was truly a grass Pokemon army, and Rick was not looking forwards to what was about to happen.<br />
<br />
A cry from the Tangela surrounding Ricks starter were frightening to say the least, his bug maiden being restrained as hard as the blue creatures could manage as blue powder was slowly dispersed around her. It was obvious what was about to occur, and Rick knew he should be trying to help her. Pushing himself forwards, he attempted with all his might to break free and save his starter, but nothing was of use, if anything his grass knot chains had become harder than ever, and it seemed he wouldnât be escaping anytime soon. A commanding voice heralded the arrival of the master of the army, the notorious Tangrowth which was powerful enough to take out Poliwrath with ease. Ricks eyes stared upon the creature, and couldnât help but feel sickened. The creature was like a giant, oversized weed, with vines coming out any and everywhere on its body, yet all he Pokemon seemed to make it like the giant plant was some form of god. More like a devil, in Ricks eyes. The Tangrowth gestured with one of its long appendages, and the entire crowd grew silent, the grass type moving closer and closer to Rick in preparation to do his worse, or at least it would seem that way. Thinking fast, Rick looked at his alternatives, and soon found that his hand was free enough to retrieve one of his Pokemon. Smiling slightly, but not giving too much away hopefully, he suddenly threw the Pokeball of his second Pokemon up into the air, the ball opening to reveal the paranoia that was Mad-Eye Moody. She was a ghostly spectre of a Duskull, but she was one of the most paranoid creatures youâll ever see, and a quick look at her surroundings with a beady eye was all she needed to be tipped into aggressive mod. âMoody, Iâm in trouble here. Try and disperse some of the opponents with a <b>Firestream</b>, and follow with a <b>Disble</b> on the vines holding me.â Rick finished his orders, and hoped it would be enough to survive.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Having succeeded in felling one of your two foes, you call for defensive efforts to focus on SumÃ©o, certain as Yuanli that your Hariyama is now the weaker link in spite of the effort he put in. With almost renewed difficulty at the massive increase of his body mass the Arm Thrust PokÃ©mon shuffles back as MedÃ©o readies a <b>Reflect</b> screen for him to take cover behind.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;<i>Ssssso... you continue to defy ussssss, eh?</i>&quot; Arbok sneers, and you suddenly get the impression that the snake isn't particularly bothered by Sneasel's defeat. &quot;Gnot rseh tegavl asot ka ewehte cifric fas...&quot; In a language you've never heard before Arbok begins to chant, no longer with the sinister lisp you know but in a much harsher, ominous tone that you wonder if it hadn't magicked the new voice from somewhere else... or were even more darker forces at work here? Nothing prepares you, though, as Sneasel's body is captured by a red light, glittery and vaguely reminiscent of the PokÃ©Ball capture mechanism, suddenly disintegrating the silhouetted creature into a million fragments...</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;What?!&quot; The exclamation from Yuanli, if anything, indicates to you that the sage has never experienced such a phenomenon either, but the apparent death of Sneasel does not end there; shimmering in its fragmented state, the crimson essence wafts over like poisonous gas, surrounding Houndour who seems to accept the energy with a knowing grin. To your horror a white flash of light abruptly surrounds the hellhound, masking its body from your view, but you already realise the end result of what has just taken place -- an arrowed tail, a pair of sharply raked horns, and a leaner, meaner frame emerge from the light of evolution. &quot;I don't believe it,&quot; whispers Yuanli, as Houndoom paws the ground and howls, sending shivers down your vertebrae. &quot;What cursed power is this?!&quot;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;<i>Ahhh... Sssssurprisssssed? You'll have an afterlifetime to deal with that little conundrum... We'll make you beg for it!</i>&quot; A stray splatter of acid is fired as Arbok hisses, returning to its usual method of communication. Snapping its jaws, Houndoom lunges forward as the Chromas chitter in alarm.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;Stay strong, Chroma!&quot; Yuanli calls as the Sableye scatter, &quot;You still have the advantage of numbers! Will, <i>now</i>!&quot;</span></span><br />

Almost like magic the original MedÃ©o is joined by his summoned brethren, all posed similarly alongside him as their palms begin to glow...</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;<i>You won't get away with that thissssss time!</i>&quot; Spitting venomously, Arbok releases a cloud of <b>Haze</b> from its mouth as Houndoom puts its nose to the ground. To their individual shock, MedÃ©o looks about as his newly generated brothers vanish as the fog takes them, while the sounds of Chroma squeaking is heard as the fiery canine glares at one of them. A shockwave of <b>Dark Pulse</b> blasts forth out of Houndoom's open mouth, slamming into the real Chroma identified by Houndoom's <b>Odour Sleuth</b>ing; with a dangerous grin Arbok spits a glob of <b>Acid</b> that catches MedÃ©o by surprise, causing him to stumble back as his focus is broken. Things aren't looking as good as you might've hoped all of a sudden...</span></span>

He hoped that Sumeoâs fortuitous evolution and the dispatching of Sneasel was the signal that his luck was changing, however once again the fickle hand of fate dealt him a nasty blow in the form of a second fully-evolved adversary. Recalling that the Dark Pokemonâs fire attacks had the ability to leave burns that could never be healed, Will cautioned Medeo to be on guard. âLook sharp, mate! Watch out for Houndoomâs flames!â</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">As Medeo danced about from foot to foot awaiting orders, Will clenched his teeth and thought hard to come up with a strategy. Try as they might, so far their all-out frontal assault had not yielded very good results. Will felt maybe it was time for something a little more unconventional. It would require excellent timing and a bit of luck. Will knew it would be risky, but if they could pull it off, it might help them regain some momentum.</span></span><br />

Hopefully, the two will be caught off guard and hit each other. Before they can figure out what happened, give Houndoom a <b><span style="color: white">Mega Kick</span></b> that will knock him right into Arbok!â</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Will nodded at Yuanli. âWeâre going to need some help to pull this off! Would it be possible for Chroma to blind Houndoom and Arbok with a <b><span style="color: white">Flash</span></b> of light at the exact moment Medeo vanishes? The brightness might help to disorientate them and may buy Medeo some time? After that, feel free to attack away!â</span></span><br />

Surrounded on all sides by hostile enemies and with your main PokÃ©mon out of commission, you barely manage to squeeze out a member of reinforcements just in time; Mad-Eye materialising in a brilliant flash of white that halts Tangrowth in its tracks and sends waves of chittering through the gathered crowd. Her singular eye quickly informing her of all she needs to know, Mad-Eye gives off little more than a hiccup before she releases a flurry of burning bubbles from her spectral flame, floating through the holes in her mask. Instantly Tangrowth starts shuffling back but still gets struck by a healthy fraction of the <b>Firestream</b>, deeply groaning as sizzling spots explode about its knotted frame. Some of the nearby PokÃ©mon youngsters, unable to dodge stray globules, begin to wail as their botanic bodies singe from the angry wounds that appear, and even as you pry off the <b>Disable</b>d vines you realise that a situation of growing unrest is on your hands. The Tangela, divided between holding you back and avoiding another possible burning attack, grudgingly give you room as Mad-Eye stares them down, but Bellatrix is still held prisoner...<br />
<br />
&quot;Growth.&quot; With a wave of its arm the Vine PokÃ©mon silences the others; indeed, as you look around you find that some of the older, evolved ones are raring to attack, and if the entire group had been galvanised into action you know that escape, let alone victory, would be impossible. Meeting eyes with Tangrowth you see the silent message in its determined, beckoning gaze: the time called for a battle between single PokÃ©mon to decide the fates of everyone; there would be no room for mercy or restraint between you two, and the first move falls to you...<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span><br />

<b><u>Hayward</u></b><br />
&quot;Hmmmm... Not an unwise decision, Will,&quot; nods Yuanli, sweat flickering down his beard. &quot;The theory of subterranean creatures should be sufficently sound. Now, hurry!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Medi!&quot; Needing no further signal, MedÃ©o bravely dives ahead; poison still licking down his arms as he does so much to the hissed delight of his enemies. Breaking into charges of their own, both Arbok and Houndoom seem considerably certain of a fresh kill when MedÃ©o briefly tenses; a split second later the strangled cries of the catacomb denizens are heard as Chroma fires a <b>Flash</b> from his eyes, strong as a floodlight. Almost as though the sheer illuminescence was eating in their skin, Houndoom and Arbok collide in their momentary blindness, momentum in their attack modes causing them to tear at each other; Arbok spitting curses at both you and its subordinate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doo--?&quot; &quot;Cham medi!&quot; Barely seconds after wrenching itself free from Arbok's <b>Bind</b> Houndoom finds itself spiralling back again, slamming into Arbok's collar as MedÃ©o brings down his leg, only moments ago poised in a delivered <b>Mega Kick</b>. A cloud of dust raises as the two scatter amongst the mould and debris, hacking dirt clods and grave fragments as they stagger. &quot;<i>You incompetent, bumbling fool! Roasssssst them!</i>&quot; screeches Arbok, and while you think to yourself that if it were you, there'd be no way you'd take that sort of lip from a superior, Houndoom nevertheless releases a <b>Heat Wave</b> from its maw. Instantly you throw yourself out of the way, PokÃ©Dex observations fresh on your mind; tasting dust you cough as you pick yourself up. Rubbing the dirt off your arms you see Yuanli beat smouldering embers off his robes, but your battlemates clearly did not share similar privilege. Raised welts and scorch marks make their presence known as you look at the two of them, and you hope sincerely that the burns aren't the untreatable sort...<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>What'sssss the matter? Had enough?</i>&quot; Arbok taunts, &quot;<i>Perhapsssss now would be a good time to bury you...!</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think so! Keep it together, Chroma!&quot; the sage declares. &quot;<b>Shadow Ball</b>, now!&quot; &quot;...S... Sabl!&quot;<br />
<br />
Somehow, despite soldier senses telling you to run, you find yourself fixed to the spot as you watch orbs of compacted <b>Mud Bomb</b> fly towards hurled grenades of ghostly energy, meeting in mid-air like two armies clashing. In less than a second you feel shockwaves of wind and dust, raised up for the first time in what you think must be centuries, tear at you from the resulting explosion, thoroughly coating your clothes and unprotected skin. Another glimmer of red, another furious roar amongst the chaotic symphony, and retching stale air you take a few moments to bring your face back to looking forward. No longer does Houndoom plague your vision, but as you gather with the other males you notice Arbok's glare of complete and utter venom at being the last mon standing on its end; cornered as such it is more than likely going to be even more dangerous...<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslateblue">As Mad-eyes firestream comes to reality, the fire burns into the oppressive Tangrowth, before following to hit into some of the nearby younger Pokemon, wailing as the fire collides with them, their body singing as it contacts their botanic bodies. Glad to be free, Rick pries the tangelas rope like appendages from his body, able to stand up perfectly again. What Rick had caused was a large state of unrest, which was good. Perhaps if the Pokemon feared him and his team more then they'd be more likely to let them go unharmed. Of course, this was just wishful thinking, but as Rick knew from another adventure of his, wishes sometimes come true. Though, without the aid of a legendary wish maker, he knew not to be so hopeful, and began to glance around the Pokemon who'd attacked him. The Tangela grudgingly gave Rick room as he stood, now free, as it seemed as though they didn't want another breath of fire, and quite right too. Fire wasn't exactly the nicest feeling on a human, not to mention a living plant. As Rick scanned the premises, he found that Bellatrix was indeed still captured, and he groaned. It could never be as simple as a one hit victory, could it? <br />
<br />
âWell, one step at a time buddy.â He murmured to Mad-Eyes, who's jittery feeling didn't change. The Duskull barely felt safe in the company of Ricks entire team, let alone when surrounded by a bunch of creatures never seen by the ghost before. The sight of the twisted trees just added more to the paranoia, and Tangrowth itself was like a creature out of her nightmares. That would be, should she actually have nightmares, she didn't sleep much. âSo, what now?â Rick asked, but wasn't really hoping for a response. If she was in this sort of state, Mad-Eye would barely acknowledge her trainers existence unless ordered to do something.<br />
<br />
Turning back to the Tangrowth, the Pokemon seemed to set out some form of order, silencing all the other Pokemon in t he area. Looking around the area, Rick identified several of the Pokemon as potential aggressors. Great. Although Rick could now send out some more team members to deal with them, most of his team members were nowhere near experienced to deal with one Tangela, let alone a large pack of grass and other foresty types. Ricks eyes locked with Tangrowths, and he couldn't help but smile. A one on one battle seemed to be what the grass type was hinting at, and Rick was more than happy to oblige, it was the best chance of him getting back Vespiquen anyway. It seemed like he was being given the first move, so give the first move he would.<br />
<br />
âRight then girl, start off strong and quick with a <b>Confuse Ray</b> at Tangrowth. Follow with a <b>Astonish</b> into <b>Shadow Punch</b>. Bella's at stake, here, so I expect your best quality.â Mad-Eye showed no sign of acknowledgement, simply floating past Rick ominously and preparing for battle. This would be it.</span></span></div>

The news of an ordeal by combat spread through the crowd, causing a plague of murmurs amongst the PokÃ©mon as they jostle -- some pushing backwards to allow for room, others distinctly uncomfortable with the idea. Both Mad-Eye and Tangrowth glare each other down, neither flinching as the crowd performs a disorganised shuffle, eventually spreading out to an area about half the size of a normal battle arena. From the corner of your vision you see Bellatrix still relentlessly restrained by a group of the lesser Vine PokÃ©mon, and you feel your fist clench reflexively as you recall what's at stake here. A silent nod is issued to Mad-Eye along with orders, and almost like a light bulb her shroudlike silhouette explodes in light. Another wave of interjections is heard through the huddled PokÃ©mon but somehow, the noise pales against the illuminescence of your Duskull's evolution. As she expands into a firmer conical shape, two legs begin to form from beneath the bottom of Mad-Eye's cloak; a pair of hands sprout on her side along with a wisp atop her head. With the fading of the light you see Mad-Eye's new bandaged body meet the ground with a barely audible thump, continuing to glare ahead with her singular crimson eye.<br />
<br />
While the revelation of a newly evolved opposition sends flurried discussion amongst the wild PokÃ©mon, you find that the same cannot be said of Tangrowth. Continuing to meet Mad-Eye's angry gaze Tangrowth piledrives its vines into the ground, and an immediate storm of tendrils erupt from all around you, interlocking like bars of a cage -- Tangrowth's <b>Block</b> attack, you realise, seaing you in and preventing any chance of escape. With no change in her expression Mad-Eye raises her knuckles to her sclera, and instantly a flash of <b>Confuse Ray</b> covers Tangrowth like a searchlight. Eyelids droop as an air of befuddlement sets into Tangrowth's eyes, and taking advantage the trance her opponent is in Mad-Eye fires her hands forward. An <b>Astonish</b>ed look replaces the dulled expression on the Vine PokÃ©mon's face as the ghostly palms smash into its wobbling frame, soon followed by a <b>Shadow Punch</b> that Mad-Eye delivers after rearing backwards briefly. Withdrawing her spectral knuckles, Mad-Eye stands valiantly against the staggering plant, but without warning a flashing orb fires from Tangrowth's mass of vines, and in the time of a few seconds Mad-Eye grunts as the <b>Energy Ball</b> detonates against her. All around you, the crowd continues to mutter...</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;Doo--?&quot; &quot;Cham medi!&quot; Barely seconds after wrenching itself free from Arbok's <b>Bind</b> Houndoom finds itself spiralling back again, slamming into Arbok's collar as MedÃ©o brings down his leg, only moments ago poised in a delivered <b>Mega Kick</b>. A cloud of dust raises as the two scatter amongst the mould and debris, hacking dirt clods and grave fragments as they stagger. &quot;<i>You incompetent, bumbling fool! Roasssssst them!</i>&quot; screeches Arbok, and while you think to yourself that if it were you, there'd be no way you'd take that sort of lip from a superior, Houndoom nevertheless releases a <b>Heat Wave</b> from its maw. Instantly you throw yourself out of the way, PokÃ©Dex observations fresh on your mind; tasting dust you cough as you pick yourself up. Rubbing the dirt off your arms you see Yuanli beat smouldering embers off his robes, but your battlemates clearly did not share similar privilege. Raised welts and scorch marks make their presence known as you look at the two of them, and you hope sincerely that the burns aren't the untreatable sort...</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;<i>What'sssss the matter? Had enough?</i>&quot; Arbok taunts, &quot;<i>Perhapsssss now would be a good time to bury you...!</i>&quot;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;I don't think so! Keep it together, Chroma!&quot; the sage declares. &quot;<b>Shadow Ball</b>, now!&quot; &quot;...S... Sabl!&quot;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Somehow, despite soldier senses telling you to run, you find yourself fixed to the spot as you watch orbs of compacted <b>Mud Bomb</b> fly towards hurled grenades of ghostly energy, meeting in mid-air like two armies clashing. In less than a second you feel shockwaves of wind and dust, raised up for the first time in what you think must be centuries, tear at you from the resulting explosion, thoroughly coating your clothes and unprotected skin. Another glimmer of red, another furious roar amongst the chaotic symphony, and retching stale air you take a few moments to bring your face back to looking forward. No longer does Houndoom plague your vision, but as you gather with the other males you notice Arbok's glare of complete and utter venom at being the last mon standing on its end; cornered as such it is more than likely going to be even more dangerous...</span></span><br />

Through a combination of teamwork and luck, Will, Yuanli, and their Pokemon had defeated two of their villainous opponents. The Poison Cobra, Arbok, who had seemed to Will to be the threesomesâ leader, was all that remained now. It was a Pokemon specie known for its unforgiving nature. Will knew it would not willingly give up once it had targeted its victim.</span></span><br />

The boy knew that an up-close fight would be risky, but he had confidence in his mystical partnerâs natural dexterity and knew Sumeo would be providing some cover. âLook sharp, move quickly, and watch out it for venom and fangs!

<span style="color: DarkSlateBlue"><b><u>Lacrima Castle: Wilheim Path</u></b><br />
<b>Stark:</b> A little out of sort you command your partner who eagerly begins to carry them out. Not wasting a single moment the small bird launches himself into an <b>agility</b> attack, his wings beating furiously as he accelerates away from his starting position. The stat boosting attack doubles for an evasive maneuver, Pidgey flying off just in time to avoid the Haunterâs <b>hypnosis</b> waves. Despite having missed his target the Haunter snickers, hard to tell at what, but apparently it found something rather amusing. Not caring much for his opponentâs amusement, Pidgey changes directions in his flight, now barrelling towards the ghost. Just before Pidgey makes contact with the cackling ghost, one of Haunterâs unattached arms fly ahead of its body and punches your bird pokemon, causing a multitude of black sparks to shower off of the impact. The <b>sucker punch</b> was enough to derail your Pidgey, the momentum carrying him smack into the face of the cliff. The sickening thud of your pokemon crashing into the solid backdrop was more than enough to make you shudder. <br />
<br />
âHeeeeeeeeelpâ¦â Despite your partner's desperate situation, you instinctively turn to look at the source of the plea, up towards the bridge that leads into the impressive castle on the horizon. Being quite a distance away, you have to squint to make out the dark figures standing on the bridge. Though you canât be certain, it looks as if a woman in a long dress is being apprehended by two armoured men. The woman is clearly being unruly and not letting these men grab a hold of her, thrashing about aggressively every time they try to find a firm grip. Finally one of them finds a seam and is able to grab her left arm. In response the woman shoots her right knee forward, finding her target between the manâs legs. Cringing, as only a male could at the sight, you watch as the assailant crumples to his knees. In retaliation the second man whacked the woman with what looked like a thick club, however, the way the man spun as he made contact made this club look like it was attached to his backside; like a muscular tail. Not surprisingly the woman shrieks in pain and falls over herself, most likely unconscious. <br />
<br />
âYou scum â¦ me.â To your surprise the woman had not been knocked out, but she was clearly not strong enough to fight off these men. ââ¦ away with this.â The distance between you and the bridge only made it possible to hear the woman when she raised her voice. The man that had been kneed in the holy place aggresively lifts the woman off the ground and drapes her over his shoulder. Despite her kicking and punching, the two men begin to walk off triumphantly, laughing as they walked casually towards the castle. The laugh of the two men as they carried the woman away made you feel sick to your stomach, a feeling of disgust washing over you. What were they going to do to her?<br />
<br />
âHaunt â¦ er!â The shrill voice of the ghost pokemon brings you back to your current situation. While you were distracted the Haunter has laid quite a beating on your injured Pidgey. To your alarm you just then notice that one of Pidgeyâs wings is broken; most likely from that crash into the cliff. With his last bit of strength, wincing through the pain your brave bird flaps his wings, yelping in pain with every beat. With every beat however you feel the wind pick up behind you more and more. Finally a loud rush of air flows past your sending your cloak flailing about and picking up dust and rocks from all over. With one final flap of his wings, Pidgey raises a powerful gust which swoops through the battle ground, sending everything away including the Haunter. As the wind carries the ghost off into the distance you can hear it cackling still. With the immediate danger gone, Pidgey chirps proudly and folds his wings back to his sides; the right wing sticking out unnaturally. <br />
<br />
Between taking care of your injured bird and worrying about the woman, you have a lot to think over and several decisions to make.<br />
<br />
<i>What will you do now?</i></span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DarkSlateBlue">&quot;Good work Pidgey,&quot; Stark complimented his bird despite the sudden degree of urgency he found himself in. No matter what, he had to work fast. For all the weirdness he had found himself in, there was still the need, the desire inside him to help those in need. And whoever that girl was looked like she needed some help. The trainer knelt down by his partner and pulling his pack off as he did so. The wing appeared hert and as much as he wanted to race after the girl, he had to take care of his partner. At least take care of him enough to keep the injury from becoming any worse than it was. He quickly shuffled through his pack digging through clothes and items cursing the fact that he should learn to be more organized one of these days until he finally found what he was looking for. A small brown bag within which laid a block of Shoal Salt. the trainer took the salt and held it out to his partner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, Pidgey. Take this, it will help you heal while you rest,&quot; Stark said as he pulled out his pokeball and returned his partner once the bird had the salt. Zipping up his pack, he slung it back over his shoulder as he stood up and looked toward the bridge near the castle. Stark's eyes narrowed a little in determination. So far things had been so strange, but his only choice now was to push forward. He couldn't let the woman suffer if he had a chance to save her.<br />
<br />
The trainer rushed toward the bridge taking care to watch hi footing on the treacherous path. His eyes darted in all directions in an almost paranoid manner. That haunter was still out there somewhere and he wasn't about to get caught off guard. After all, he had already had his share of surprises. All of which had him quite unnerved. Regardless, he kept on his route with plans to enter the castle, rescue the damsel, and get out safely. At least he hoped that was what would happen cause becoming a loon who perished falling off a cliff was not exactly the destiny he wanted to look forward to.</span></span></div>

Having brought down the fight to a three-on-one almost seems to do you no favours; knowing how Arbok has been to you for the entire duration of the battle you have a hunch that the next leg will likely be the deadliest. Figuring it a good idea to use power in numbers you call for SumÃ©o's help: while the Hariyama has not had a proper recovery he's managed to get his breath back and pulls himself up with several valiant thumps to his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Rrrrrrrarrrrgh!</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chroma, now! <b>Sucker Punch</b>!&quot; Yuanli commands, and just as he did with the Drapion earlier, the gem-encrusted imp flies like a miniature dark comet as Arbok lunges, fangs dripping with venom -- only to be stopped in mid-charge as Chroma, reappearing from under his dark shroud, punches its lower jaw shut. A determined glance from Yuanli gives you all the signal you need; with a <b>Helping Hand</b> sparking off his back MedÃ©o rushes ahead, and with several graceful swings of his arms he delivers a sharp set of <b>Psycho Cut</b>s across Arbok's marked collar. Both the two humanshape PokÃ©mon fall back as Arbok appears to waver in its pain, but nevertheless a sense of foreboding remains...<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Look out, you two!&quot; hollers Yuanli, but even he has noticed Arbok's tail too late; a swift swish later the cobra has its tail end wrapped tightly about Chroma and MedÃ©o in a crushing <b>Bind</b>, and with the most evil expression it's held so far, more so when it was hissing out threats, Arbok raises its appendage and brings it down like a guillotine's blade. The resultant <b>Earthquake</b> sends both you, Yuanli and SumÃ©o flying backwards, and after a few moments of struggling on your legs you manage to get to your feet on the ground, now strewn with rubble and severely shaken. Up ahead you see both MedÃ©o and Chroma lying on the ground, dangerously under a sneering Arbok.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>I warned you</i>,&quot; hisses Arbok, venom tipping its fangs and its voice alike. &quot;<i>You put up a fight, I'll give you that much... But thesssssse are your ssssstrongessssst, aren't they? Oncccccce I've finisssssssshed with them... You're pretty much finisssssssshed yourssssselvesssss, aren't you?</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You would... do well not to underestimate us,&quot; coughs the sage, and you're a little shocked to see him with his clothes dishevelled by the Ground attack, but still standing strong in spite of his age. &quot;Rage has consumed you, wise Arbok, and it will be your undoing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Bravery and falsssssse hopessssss won't ssssssave you now!</i>&quot; leers the beast, but even as it taunts you a sneaking suspicion niggles in your mind, and sure enough -- &quot;<i>What?!</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure you've noticed it by now, but... this is an alternate form of the <b>Shadow Sneak</b> attack.&quot; Folding his arms, Yuanli calmly beckons your attention to Chroma, now with his clawed hands dug into the cracked ground. Looking to Arbok, you now realise what has happened: surrounding the snake's body are countless tendrils of darkness, restricting it from any movement beyond tightened writhing. &quot;With the ground you kindly broke for us, Chroma was able to use the infinite amount of shadows not lit up beneath the surface... The battle has taken its toll on you as well. For what we are about to do, angering you, I must apologise.&quot; Turning his head back at you, the old man nods serenely. &quot;Now, Will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Medi!&quot; The assured knowledge of this to be the final strike is all the motivation your Medicham needs; pushing himself back up he raises a fist, glimmering with the bond you have with him as trainer and PokÃ©mon. Swinging like a wrecking ball, the blow slams into Arbok's centre, a <b>Return</b> for all the damage that its troupe has caused you, and in the torment by Chroma's puppetry Arbok gives out a cry as though life was being literally strangled out of it. Drawn out and breathless, you remember the way the Pinap Berry you laid out had simply decomposed into nothing; was the same thing happening here? As the final fragments of the attack dance across its skin Arbok suddenly gives out, exploding in a cloud of the now familiar red sparks before dissipating into oblivion. <b>Level-up for MedÃ©o and SumÃ©o</b>.<br />
<br />
For a while no one speaks; there is no denial that the three-on-three has drained you and your allies considerably. As the others catch their breath you glance ahead where Arbok and its cronies had stood guard -- three gravestones, each inscribed in symbols you don't recognise, lie silently upon their mounds, but more of interest are the three floating objects, one above each grave, glowing faintly with mysterious light. Squinting, you notice the items resemble smaller versions of Unown, but unlike the actual living symbols these only appear to be trinkets -- albeit shimmering, suspended trinkets; one in the shape of an I, another the design of a T, the last one in the form of a Y...</span></span></div>

<b><u>Colosseo</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Cod of War</u></b><br />
With the information given to you, a simple process of elimination leaves your prior injured Lunatone as the proverbial sacrifice for you to move ahead. Left with a contigency plan you are hopeful will succeed, Meteos hovers briefly over the access panel before lowering himself with a gradual phasing of his natural levitation. For a while nothing appears to happen, but as Meteos completely disables his full lifting powers and places his full weight on the tile it briefly gleams, as though a small wave of water just washed over it. &quot;Hey, look!&quot; exclaims Seroba, &quot;It's opening!&quot; Indeed, as you turn you find that almost silently, barely with a creak, the heavy alloy door slides upwards at a speed you'd never expect from something of such bulk, until the entirety of the way ahead is revealed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's go. Unless the elders were mistaken, these doors were designed to disallow an extended window of time for entrance.&quot; At Eriden's urging, you find yourself pacing quickly towards the dark passage, but nevertheless you cast a glance of concern back at Meteos. Would the teleportation tactic work? Even as this thought passes you by and your other foot lifts from the ground outside, you barely hear the same bare creak you just recall from only moments before...<br />
<br />
&quot;The door!&quot; Even with Eriden's shout, the time it takes for the words to leave his mouth is sufficient for the gate to clang shut; an exchanged expression of shock is all that passes between you and Meteos. An alarmed interjection from the Lunatone is heard, following a fizzle of energy as Meteos tries putting the plan into action, but after a few moments of waiting you find that no meteorite floats beside you. Nor are you capable of hearing the mental messages familiar to the Psychic PokÃ©mon. &quot;That... was unexpected. It seems the desires of the past burn strongly, even today,&quot; Eriden sighs, as the realisation hits that you have effectively been cut off from Meteos. &quot;I'm sorry, Jamie. But there's nothing more we can do here; we need to move ahead. I cannot say for sure that Colosseo is completely safe for traversing.&quot;<br />
<br />
With no other option available to you, and having already factored in the worst-case scenario of separation, you sullenly plod forward through the dank hallway. You can only imagine that surely, this passage must have been at least lit for Tetyth's elite to see by; they can't possibly have endured the murky conditions you presently find yourself in, for certain. For now all you can trust in are Eriden and Seroba leading you ahead.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Halt for a moment, you two,&quot; mutters Eriden, after... how long? You couldn't quite tell in the surroundings of darkness, but having just been stopped and given a refreshed chance to identify your surroundings you find a strangely sweet smell -- not something you'd expect in an arena, to say the least. The path ahead seems to open up to another gateway, and you notice light filtering in from above, as well as a peculiar chittering sound.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jamie, if you're not minding.&quot; In the renewed light, you see Eriden bring a finger closer to your face; immediately you find the smell increase in intensity. A sticky liquid appears to drip from the warrior's digit. &quot;Seroba, are you thinking what I'm thinking?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm... yep! That's definitely Surskit nectar! Mmmm...&quot; Even in the darkness you can almost hear her grin in usual glee. &quot;But that means...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's a very strong likelihood that Masquerain have set up residence in this place. Despite evolving from Water-types, Masquerain profess a strong dislike for water. My guess is that a swarm moved in to raise their young in this sheltered area.&quot; The berserker pauses, &quot;Unfortunately, now that they have claimed this zone as their territory, we will be treated with hostility if we simply barge in. We need something that can, at least, offer us some protection against a populous insect swarm. Something that insects don't like in general will do, but there is the problem of numbers...&quot;<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span><br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">Apologies for the late-as-2012-conspiracy-theories reply, was in a bit of a block.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: aqua">It was a shot in the dark, and one that would be advantageous to him if successful, but as he watched the Lunatone descend slowly onto the platform, Jamie wondered if his teleportation plan would work perfectly. After a few tense moments, in which Meteos' eye seemed to dull slightly, indication total levitational deactivation, a cry from Seroba alongside an unusual gleam of tile gave him the idea that the door indeed activated to the rock pokemon's weight, the massive door lifting at a surprising speed. To Eriden's urging, the three of them headed through the doorway, safely inside, and as Jamie noted this, his heart rose slightly...<br />
<br />
...until the door slammed shut with incredible speed behind him, a guillotine to communication, and as he longed for the rock to be beside him, the blank in his mind said so otherwise, and as his small smile drooped, he knew deep inside that the burden of Meteos was unfairly lifted by the greed of the ancients. As much as it hurt, he knew that his efforts to recall or talk to the Meteorite would be in vain. With a heavy heart, and a whispered apology to deaf ears, Jamie turned and headed down the dark passageway into Colosseo.<br />
<br />
It wasn't known how long he had walked for when Eriden called for the group to stop, the air somehow taking a rather sweet tone to it, strange for a place like this, but as the Walreinman took a digit to his nose, he noticed what seemed to be the cause of the scent, a sort of syrup quickly identified as Surskit nectar by Seroba, her voice as cheerful as ever, until Eriden gave his judgment of the situation. With what he knew of Masquerain, they were effectively bug pokemon who were skilled in intimidation tactics, and as stated by Eriden before were disliking of water. However, as insects, his mind went into drive as he considered the best option available. As he pondered, he immediately had a good idea as to the best use, reaching for a ball.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know bugs are generally afraid of birds, and knowing the effect of Intimidate, it would seem best to try and block the effect while keeping a safe haven for the younger bugs. In case we get attacked, which seems likely, he's also running a few more unorthodox moves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dropping the ball, his Honchkrow appeared, the black crow seemingly relaxed in the nectar, before turning to Jamie, the bird's natural eyesight letting him see his master in the dark, who put his finger to his lips as though ordering the bird to keep a low profile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yakuza, we're entering a nursery in an arena, so try not to be too scary. When we enter, try and keep a low profile, but if any bugs come near, send out a <b>haze</b> to try and lose them. In case any of them become threatening, <b>peck</b> them back, but only if they strike first. Try and conserve your elemental energies, but if we're swarmed, give a widespread <b>dark pulse</b> to drive the bugs back. However, only attack if attacked first, remember we're just passing through.&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning to his allies, he gives a nod before moving out.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Having brought down the fight to a three-on-one almost seems to do you no favours; knowing how Arbok has been to you for the entire duration of the battle you have a hunch that the next leg will likely be the deadliest. Figuring it a good idea to use power in numbers you call for SumÃ©o's help: while the Hariyama has not had a proper recovery he's managed to get his breath back and pulls himself up with several valiant thumps to his chest.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;<i>Rrrrrrrarrrrgh!</i>&quot;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;Chroma, now! <b>Sucker Punch</b>!&quot; Yuanli commands, and just as he did with the Drapion earlier, the gem-encrusted imp flies like a miniature dark comet as Arbok lunges, fangs dripping with venom -- only to be stopped in mid-charge as Chroma, reappearing from under his dark shroud, punches its lower jaw shut. A determined glance from Yuanli gives you all the signal you need; with a <b>Helping Hand</b> sparking off his back MedÃ©o rushes ahead, and with several graceful swings of his arms he delivers a sharp set of <b>Psycho Cut</b>s across Arbok's marked collar. Both the two humanshape PokÃ©mon fall back as Arbok appears to waver in its pain, but nevertheless a sense of foreboding remains...</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;No! Look out, you two!&quot; hollers Yuanli, but even he has noticed Arbok's tail too late; a swift swish later the cobra has its tail end wrapped tightly about Chroma and MedÃ©o in a crushing <b>Bind</b>, and with the most evil expression it's held so far, more so when it was hissing out threats, Arbok raises its appendage and brings it down like a guillotine's blade. The resultant <b>Earthquake</b> sends both you, Yuanli and SumÃ©o flying backwards, and after a few moments of struggling on your legs you manage to get to your feet on the ground, now strewn with rubble and severely shaken. Up ahead you see both MedÃ©o and Chroma lying on the ground, dangerously under a sneering Arbok.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;<i>I warned you</i>,&quot; hisses Arbok, venom tipping its fangs and its voice alike. &quot;<i>You put up a fight, I'll give you that much... But thesssssse are your ssssstrongessssst, aren't they? Oncccccce I've finisssssssshed with them... You're pretty much finisssssssshed yourssssselvesssss, aren't you?</i>&quot;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;You would... do well not to underestimate us,&quot; coughs the sage, and you're a little shocked to see him with his clothes dishevelled by the Ground attack, but still standing strong in spite of his age. &quot;Rage has consumed you, wise Arbok, and it will be your undoing.&quot;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;<i>Bravery and falsssssse hopessssss won't ssssssave you now!</i>&quot; leers the beast, but even as it taunts you a sneaking suspicion niggles in your mind, and sure enough -- &quot;<i>What?!</i>&quot;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;I'm sure you've noticed it by now, but... this is an alternate form of the <b>Shadow Sneak</b> attack.&quot; Folding his arms, Yuanli calmly beckons your attention to Chroma, now with his clawed hands dug into the cracked ground. Looking to Arbok, you now realise what has happened: surrounding the snake's body are countless tendrils of darkness, restricting it from any movement beyond tightened writhing. &quot;With the ground you kindly broke for us, Chroma was able to use the infinite amount of shadows not lit up beneath the surface... The battle has taken its toll on you as well. For what we are about to do, angering you, I must apologise.&quot; Turning his head back at you, the old man nods serenely. &quot;Now, Will.&quot;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">&quot;Medi!&quot; The assured knowledge of this to be the final strike is all the motivation your Medicham needs; pushing himself back up he raises a fist, glimmering with the bond you have with him as trainer and PokÃ©mon. Swinging like a wrecking ball, the blow slams into Arbok's centre, a <b>Return</b> for all the damage that its troupe has caused you, and in the torment by Chroma's puppetry Arbok gives out a cry as though life was being literally strangled out of it. Drawn out and breathless, you remember the way the Pinap Berry you laid out had simply decomposed into nothing; was the same thing happening here? As the final fragments of the attack dance across its skin Arbok suddenly gives out, exploding in a cloud of the now familiar red sparks before dissipating into oblivion. <b>Level-up for MedÃ©o and SumÃ©o</b>.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">For a while no one speaks; there is no denial that the three-on-three has drained you and your allies considerably. As the others catch their breath you glance ahead where Arbok and its cronies had stood guard -- three gravestones, each inscribed in symbols you don't recognise, lie silently upon their mounds, but more of interest are the three floating objects, one above each grave, glowing faintly with mysterious light. Squinting, you notice the items resemble smaller versions of Unown, but unlike the actual living symbols these only appear to be trinkets -- albeit shimmering, suspended trinkets; one in the shape of an I, another the design of a T, the last one in the form of a Y...</span></span>

The battle against the supernatural guardians had taken its toll on both trainers and Pokemon alike and fatigue was etched into the faces of all assembled in the subterranean chamber. Will stole a glance at Medeo and Sumeo, sitting back-to-back on the ground. The lithe mystic and hulking sumo panted heavily, trying desperately to catch their breaths, still not fully recovered from their efforts. Clearly, they would have to rest before Will could call on them to fight again. It was a dire prospect, as Will knew they had to be on guard and ready for anything. He had a bad feeling that the remainder of their underground journey was going to be even more perilous than its start.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Reaching quickly into his messenger bag, Will withdrew the fighting-typed duoâs steel-topped capture capsules and held them out at armâs length. Aiming the storage devices at his recuperating partners, the boy pressed the trigger switch and returned the exhausted pair, complimenting them on their hard work and determination as he placed the silver Pokeballs back into his satchel.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Advancing cautiously upon the gravesites, Will narrowed his eyes in concentration, trying to discern the trio of objects' identity, when all at once he realized with a jolt that they were none other than miniature replicas of the symbol Pokemon, Unown. Resembling ancient hieroglyphs, Unown had long been studied by researchers in an attempt to catalogue all their various formes. Will was fairly certain 28 unique shapes had now been recorded. The three in front him looked like the letters <i>I</i>, <i>T</i>, and <i>Y</i>. It wasnât clear how they produced their own light or what gave them the power of levitation.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Will stood for a moment with his hand on his chin, deep in thought, trying to unravel this latest mystery. Having no luck, he turned to Yuanli with a confused look and muttered, âWell, Iâm stumped. What do you think? Could this have something to do with that <i>Legendary Birds</i> paper?â</span></span><br />

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: aqua"><div style="text-align: center"><b><u>Tetyth City</u></b>&#8203;</div><br />
<b><u>Colosseo</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Trilobyte</u></b><br />
Keen on avoiding conflict as far as possible, you deem Yakuza the Honchkrow to be the best possible choice and release the Big Boss PokÃ©mon from his confines. With only the faint sound of his wings flapping in nearly complete darkness, you step out into the open arena, feeling your heart pound against the beating of Yakuza's feathers. Collections of miniscule glints that you can only assume are hundreds of pairs of eyes stare down at you from above; you figure the colonies must have somehow populated the area to the extent of blocking out the skylight metres above. You give another nod in the direction of Eriden and Seroba as you feel your way gingerly along the curving walls.<br />
<br />
Inch by inch you step up through the ancient stones holding up Colosseo, with little more than Yakuza's natural affinity for the dark assisting you in the conditions of extremely poor visibility, vaguely feeling your allies moving just as slowly behind you. Every now and then you grimace as your fingers brush past formations of sticky substance, having long since stuck to the crumbling structure and leaving their rotting deposits behind, building layer upon layer. Eventually, though, you realise that you have definitely come closer to Colosseo's exit as you notice now that not only are the glinting eyes moving, you can see shapes -- some round, some flat, squiggling amongst the higher echelons. It is here that you and Yakuza both decide that a <b>Haze</b> is a good idea to cover your tracks, and with little more than an extremely faint hiss the raven issues a cloud of dark gas all around you, blanketing your vision completely... all of a sudden you find that even the silhouette of Yakuza has left you amidst the fog. As it occurs to you that perhaps, just perhaps, obscuring your own vision even further was probably not quite a good idea in practice, your divided concentration between finding Yakuza and cursing your figurative lack of foresight opts to cost you...<br />
<br />
*<b>BUMP</b>*<br />
<br />
Like a lightning strike all to itself the sound of a pebble, absent-mindedly struck by your foot, thunders in the echoey building as it trundles down the stones, soon followed by a symphony of chattering and skittering. Several gusts of wind tear at you from above, and at once you feel the Haze alleviate -- as the shining arcs of <b>Defog</b> vanish you catch a glimpse of several Masquerain headed for you, surrounded by masses of moving blue.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Instantly, the warrior behind you leaps into action, flinging <b>Ice Shard</b>s towards the insect mob. Several of the more ambitious Surskit are promptly struck down, knocked out of their trajectory as they lunge at your group, squealing as they fall while Yakuza tends to the others, delivering <b>Peck</b> attacks to strike the ones Eriden misses. All at once the crowd of pond skaters disperses noisily, not quite intent on dealing with a cryogenic master and mafia bird, but their evolved seniors are not as easily thrown off. A bright <b>Flash</b> illuminates the arena and you instantly seize up involuntarily, catching an eyeful of the moths' terrifying visages. Swiping noises fill the air, tossing your sense of hearing into confusion, but all too soon the surprised yells of Seroba and Eriden cause you to turn back in alarm: in what light remains you spy long ropes from above binding the two merfolk in <b>String Shot</b>. &quot;Mas mas!&quot; shrieks the Eyeball PokÃ©mon in the centre, and on command the remaining Masquerain start flapping their copter wings upwards, dragging their unwilling prey as Eriden and Seroba struggle against their bonds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honchkrow!&quot; Furious, both at the enemy for their interference and pursuit, Yakuza releases the <b>Dark Pulse</b> he's tasked with from beak, sending wide circles of negative energy cannonballing into the airlifting PokÃ©mon and knocking them backwards. With thuds and grunts your allies fall to the floor, but still trapped in their unlikely prisons, and the last Masquerain -- whom, at this point, you're certain is the de facto chief -- flutters dangerously above you with an equally nasty glimmer in its real eyes. Looks like you're on your own in this confrontation...</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkslategray"><div style="text-align: center"><b><u>Mireno Cemetery</u></b>&#8203;</div><br />
<b><u>Catacombs</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Hayward</u></b><br />
Certain for the moment that you should be safe, and recognising that your fighters have exhausted themselves quite extensively, you retrieve them in their PokÃ©Balls and proceed to examine the strange phenomenon ahead of you. Although you accurately identify the floating objects as resembling Unown, their purpose and reason for being here, suspended in enigmatic manner no less, eludes you, and you beckon to Yuanli for his opinion on the matter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmmm...&quot; Standing beside you as strokes his beard, Yuanli frowns in the strongest concentration you've seen him so far. &quot;I daresay your assumption that these symbols are linked to the paper we discovered might be closer to the truth than we know, Will. Unfortunately, even the knowledge I possess cannot provide an immediate answer for the questions before us. We must investigate further. ...On another hand, now that we've defeated the guardians protecting these graves, I see no reason why we cannot inspect these items now. But proceed cautiously, everyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stepping forward you find yourself faced with the Y Unown symbol, and carefully, almost as if it might burn your hand, you reach out for the mysterious artifact. Surprisingly you discover that the Y easily comes off from the suspending radiance, falling into your grip as the light fades, leaving only a faintly visible aura around the item. Closely looking at it a few times over, it seems little more than an ankh, made of polished mineral that gives it a texture suspiciously similar to bone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will... look at this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuanli's whisper snatches your attention once again and, taking precise steps so as to not feel the ground crumble under your feet, you walk over to the sage who has now bent over, gazing at the leftmost grave while holding the I ankh in his hand. Raising a finger Yuanli directs you to minute writing you had not earlier noticed, intricately marked in neat rows:<br />
<br />
<i>Iduna, the priest of rebirth.<br />
Below Xenon in fire,<br />
Above Yumel in lightning,<br />
Above Xenon in ice.</i><br />
<br />
You repeat the words to yourself, but no matter how many times you do so the words simply don't make sense, and a glance to Yuanli only yields an equally puzzled expression. Confused with the bombardment of information now presented to you, you decide that if anything, you should at least look at the remaining graves:<br />
<br />
<i>Teula, the priest of courage.<br />
Below Iduna in fire,<br />
Above Iduna in lightning,<br />
Above Iduna in ice.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Yumel, the priest of creation.<br />
Below Teula in fire,<br />
Above Askus in lightning,<br />
Above Teula in ice.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;What might this all mean?&quot; ponders Yuanli, glancing between the graves, their mysterious inscriptions, as well as the slip of paper you'd only just taken moments ago, but seems like hours past. &quot;There must be some connection amongst all these clues eluding us... Perhaps the answer lies in tales or lore, or in another realm we have yet to encounter?... Maybe we should reconvene in the central chamber, Will. We can't do a thing if we stagnate here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finding no alternative or reason to remain within the burial area apparent to you, you concede to return to middle ground, questions continuing to buzz through your head with each step. Were you on the wrong track, or had you even found one at all? Aimlessly you gaze across the dank landscape when suddenly, you realise that something <i>has</i> changed -- where you had left the sealed door with no way of opening it, you now see that half of the door's patterns have started to glimmer with strange, red light...</span></span></div>

With Volante taken out of the picture you have little alternative but to release Torchlight for battle, and with a few instructions laid out the Cyndaquil eagerly jumps in. Out from his mouth a cloud of <b>Smokescreen</b> billows forth, cloaking the male Nuzleaf who gives a disgruntled cry at having his view obscured. &quot;Now, Cormag! Follow with <b>Icy Wind</b>!&quot; Seizing the chance, Duessel calls for another encore of his Murkrow's freezing weather, and cawing loudly Cormag sends another miniature snowstorm into the smoke cloud. For a while, nothing seems to happen, until several curved, focused pockets of air explode out of the fog. Instinctively you raise your arms, but even with the move's inaccuracy a shot of <b>Razor Wind</b> still succeeds in catching you by the gut -- not sharp enough to cut cloth or skin but strong enough to knock you over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you alright, Miss?&quot; You have little chance to reply before Duessel hoists you by the wrist, bringing you back to a stand. With the swishing zephyrs separating the Smokescreen and Nuzleaf in full view, the three males charge in as one with their respective limbs raised. A <b>Peck</b>, <b>Scratch</b> and <b>Tackle</b>, carried over by the simultaneous force of three PokÃ©mon, cleanly throws the leaf-topped PokÃ©mon off his feet, sending him tumbling into the undergrowth's dirt. For a while he tries pushing himself upwards, but his wooden arms eventually collapse after a few moments' passing. <b>Level up for Grinder</b>.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's too late. We weren't fast enough!&quot; At Duessel's grimace, you peer upwards only to immediately wish you hadn't. In the trees above you scores of Nuzleaf stand defiantly on the branches, glaring at you like Swellow on Wurmple. &quot;Stay close,&quot; hisses Duessel, a command quickly heeded as you press your back against his in defensive position; the tension oozing about you like a plague of poisonous gas.<br />
<br />
Half expecting pain to begin raining all over your body, you are momentarily surprised as music begins reaching your ears: a hauntingly whistled aria that almost seems beautiful if not for the situation. A buzzing sixth sense informs you that something is very wrong, and sure enough as you turn you see to your horror Duessel collapsing on his knees with little more than a grunt. Frantically, you look at Torchlight and Grinder who only follow suit as your gaze sweeps by, and before too long as the music's volume increases you feel your senses failing, your strength fading. As your vision blurs, the last thing you feel is a muffled sensation of the cold earth striking your face...<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center">***&#8203;</div><br />
&quot;Missy? Missy, wake up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roused by the voice of Duessel, you blearily open your eyes. How long had passed since you fainted <i>this</i> time? It was irrelevant, in any case, reminding yourself that time held no meaning in this forest. Sitting up you identify your current surroundings with a jolt: the house that Duessel and you had lodged in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuzleaf are known to make music by blowing through flutes they make from leaves. When they do so, listeners -- people and PokÃ©mon suffer a variety of effects. In any case the encounter brought us back to square one... as it always has.&quot; As Duessel bows his head -- in regret or frustration, you're not particularly sure -- you take a look outside; the trees the same state as when you had left.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did we do wrong?&quot; he mutters, scratching his head. &quot;I don't think we were wrong in thinking along the lines of a clock, but if that's the case... hm. Maybe the season of the forest we were in had something to do with the direction? Could it help to reread the instructions?&quot;<br />
<br />
What do you think?</span><br />

The girl was disappointed in herself, as she had presumed Duesssel to be in her. She screwed up the information and lead them in the exact wrong way. She wondered what it was like to be him, an aging hermit lost in the middle of a forest trying to keep him that way, promised a way out by a teen-aged girl whose very bumbling had screwed them out of it. But to be fair, she thought, it was a path so convoluted that even he couldn't figure it out, why should an inexperienced youth? Maybe, she thought, there was a bright side to all this. <i>Yeah, right...</i> she thought. She didn't know what would be, so she decided to quit feeling sorry for herself and focus on what was: clearly something didn't add up, and she needed to see what. She decided that, ultimately, looking up all the notes was the right way to go. &quot;Yeah, lets take a look. Maybe there's something we overlooked&quot; she replied, hoping to avoid a response of &quot;what do you mean, we?&quot;</span></span></div>

Were you on the wrong track, or had you even found one at all? Aimlessly you gaze across the dank landscape when suddenly, you realise that something <i>has</i> changed -- where you had left the sealed door with no way of opening it, you now see that half of the door's patterns have started to glimmer with strange, red light...</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray"><i>&quot;Hmmmm...&quot;</i> Yuanli muttered, gently stroking his hoary beard as he pondered Willâs question. The old sage frowned, his brow furrowing in concentration, and Will immediately guessed that the mysterious trinkets had the oldster confused as well. Will had never seen his elderly companion look so focused and pensive. He hoped Yuanli would be able to discover a connection between the floating objects and the <i>Legendary Birds</i> paper. Will hated to think that they wouldnât be able to complete their task. Thankfully, he didnât have to wait long however, because at just that moment, Yuanli spoke.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray"><i>&quot;I daresay your assumption that these symbols are linked to the paper we discovered might be closer to the truth than we know, Will. Unfortunately, even the knowledge I possess cannot provide an immediate answer for the questions before us.â</i> Will put on a slightly disappointed expression at that remark, but Yuanli continued. <i>âWe must investigate further. ...On another hand, now that we've defeated the guardians protecting these graves, I see no reason why we cannot inspect these items now. But proceed cautiously, everyone.&quot;</i></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">While he was upset that Yuanli had been able to add no further insight, Will felt thankful for the opportunity to investigate the mysterious levitating objects in front of him and approached the Y Unown symbol. Hesitantly, the boy reached out his arm and extended his fingers. As they wrapped around the mystical item, Will half-expected to receive some sort of supernatural shock or burn, or for the object to be fixed magically in place, however the Y Unown came away easily in his hand and felt hard, cool, and smooth like bone.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">As Will studied the Y Unown, turning it over again and again in the palm of his hand searching for a hint of its significance, Yuanli suddenly breathed out, <i>&quot;Will... look at this.&quot;</i></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Though it was scarcely more than a whisper, Yuanliâs exclamation told Will that the old sage had just found something of considerable importance. Stuffing the Y Unown into his trouser pocket for now, Will turned and carefully made his way towards the oldster, not wanting to upset even the dust covering the floor of the catacombs, fearing that in doing so, he might possibly disturb their recent find.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Yuanli was bent over, carefully examining a nearby grave. As Will crept closer, his new friend motioned to a few lines of barely visible text, scrawled upon the surface of one of the graves. This is what Will read:</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray"><i>Iduna, the priest of rebirth.</i></span></span><br />
<i><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Below Xenon in fire,</span></span></i><br />
<i><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Above Yumel in lightning,</span></span></i><br />
<i><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Above Xenon in ice.</span></span></i><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Dragging a hand through his short brown hair, Will exhaled and read the riddle-like words over again in his head. A quick glance at Yuanli revealed that his elderly companion was similarly befuddled. Will shrugged apologetically signaling that he was stumped before turning to the remaining two burial plots, quickly scanning their inscriptions for any further clues that might help to unravel this latest mystery.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray"><i>Teula, the priest of courage.</i></span></span><br />
<i><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Below Iduna in fire,</span></span></i><br />
<i><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Above Iduna in lightning,</span></span></i><br />
<i><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Above Iduna in ice.</span></span></i><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray"><i>Yumel, the priest of creation.</i></span></span><br />
<i><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Below Teula in fire,</span></span></i><br />
<i><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Above Askus in lightning,</span></span></i><br />
<i><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Above Teula in ice.</span></span></i><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray"><i>&quot;What might this all mean?&quot;</i> Yuanli queried, his eyes darting from grave to grave, before finally resting on the <i>Legendary Birds</i> paper. <i>&quot;There must be some connection amongst all these clues eluding us... Perhaps the answer lies in tales or lore, or in another realm we have yet to encounter?... Maybe we should reconvene in the central chamber, Will. We can't do a thing if we stagnate here.&quot;</i></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Seeing they had no choice but to turn back, Will nodded and silently followed Yuanli and Chroma in the direction of the sealed door. Just as Yuanli had earlier, Will wondered what it all meant and wrestled with the riddles in his mind over the course of their short return trek. Lost in thought, Will gazed absentmindedly across the barren central chamber upon their arrival, expecting to find nothing more than the familiar dead end, however a faint red light emanating from the sealed door suddenly caught his attention and caused him to bolt in surprise.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslategray">Looking at the glowing gate, Will wondered whether it might hold a new clue and felt thankful that now maybe their quest would be able to continue after all. Nodding his head in the direction of the glimmering door, Will asked the old sage, âWell, what do you think? Why donât we go check it out? Maybe weâll find a leadâ¦â</span></span><br />

The news of an ordeal by combat spread through the crowd, causing a plague of murmurs amongst the PokÃ©mon as they jostle -- some pushing backwards to allow for room, others distinctly uncomfortable with the idea. Both Mad-Eye and Tangrowth glare each other down, neither flinching as the crowd performs a disorganised shuffle, eventually spreading out to an area about half the size of a normal battle arena. From the corner of your vision you see Bellatrix still relentlessly restrained by a group of the lesser Vine PokÃ©mon, and you feel your fist clench reflexively as you recall what's at stake here. A silent nod is issued to Mad-Eye along with orders, and almost like a light bulb her shroudlike silhouette explodes in light. Another wave of interjections is heard through the huddled PokÃ©mon but somehow, the noise pales against the illuminescence of your Duskull's evolution. As she expands into a firmer conical shape, two legs begin to form from beneath the bottom of Mad-Eye's cloak; a pair of hands sprout on her side along with a wisp atop her head. With the fading of the light you see Mad-Eye's new bandaged body meet the ground with a barely audible thump, continuing to glare ahead with her singular crimson eye.<br />
<br />
While the revelation of a newly evolved opposition sends flurried discussion amongst the wild PokÃ©mon, you find that the same cannot be said of Tangrowth. Continuing to meet Mad-Eye's angry gaze Tangrowth piledrives its vines into the ground, and an immediate storm of tendrils erupt from all around you, interlocking like bars of a cage -- Tangrowth's <b>Block</b> attack, you realise, seaing you in and preventing any chance of escape. With no change in her expression Mad-Eye raises her knuckles to her sclera, and instantly a flash of <b>Confuse Ray</b> covers Tangrowth like a searchlight. Eyelids droop as an air of befuddlement sets into Tangrowth's eyes, and taking advantage the trance her opponent is in Mad-Eye fires her hands forward. An <b>Astonish</b>ed look replaces the dulled expression on the Vine PokÃ©mon's face as the ghostly palms smash into its wobbling frame, soon followed by a <b>Shadow Punch</b> that Mad-Eye delivers after rearing backwards briefly. Withdrawing her spectral knuckles, Mad-Eye stands valiantly against the staggering plant, but without warning a flashing orb fires from Tangrowth's mass of vines, and in the time of a few seconds Mad-Eye grunts as the <b>Energy Ball</b> detonates against her. All around you, the crowd continues to mutter...</span></span>

<br />
<span style="color: darkslateblue">Rick watched carefully as the crowd of local dwelling Pokemon slowly began to hear of the nearby combat about to begin, a plague of murmurs causing the Pokemon to shift their locations, some pushing backwards in order to allow room for the conflict, whereas some Pokemon looked distinctly more against the battle. Either way, this battle had to happen, and there was nothing that either the locals nor Rick could do to stop it, and he wouldn't have it any other way. Adventures have got to have risk, and this was perhaps the greatest risk of them all, the risk of his companion Pokemon, as well as now subsequently his own, life. Mad-Eye stares down the opposing Tangrowth, neither seeming more intimidated than the other, and it isn't that surprising. Mad-Eye rarely shows emotion other than paranoia, yet currently she seemed to be a little more calm than usual, more focussed. It must be because of the pressure of the event, Rick assumed. From the corner of his eye, Rick could still see his precious Bellatrix being restrained by the tangling creatures, and felt his hand clench into a fist. He had to win. Nodding to Duskull, the battle was set to begin, but then... what was happening? Mad-Eye's body was suddenly consumed with a glowing and bright shining light, and for the second time in recent days, Rick was to witness an evolution. Her body suddenly expanded and changed, her tow tiny and weak arms turning into full fledged fists, her twin eyes becoming one, non-shifting eye, two legs formed quickly from underneath the cloak, and finally the form of a Dusclops emerged from the light, and Rick was instantly calmed. He knew now, more than ever, that he was going to win, if it was the last thing he did. He was immensely proud of his comrade, the small Duskull he had hand picked from the adoption center all that time ago, and most of all couldn't wait to see how well her battling skills had increased with the evolution. Later on, he'd have to check how her paranoia was going along, but for now it seemed fine, and there was too much at stake to dawdle. <br />
<br />
The Pokemon around seemed to be equally awed in some cases, but Tangrowth itself wasn't intimidated in the slightest. That was a tad worrying, but Rick knew that his new companion would easily be able to defeat the plant. Or, rather, hoped she would. The Tangrowth was still a fully evolved monstrosity, and probably had maintained quite a lot of training in order to get itself to the position it was in. This was going to be tough. Suddenly, Tangrowth stuck its vines into the ground, before a cage of vines emerged all around what had now become a small arena, meaning that Rick and Mad-Eye had no further method of escape. That was fine by Rick; he refused to leave without his companion Pokemon, anyway. Mad-Eye didn't change her expression as she sprung into action, launching a blinding blast of confusing light, Tangrowth instantly managing to be effected by the status effect, leaving the grass type's mind wandering. Following that, the Dusclops brought her fist forwards, smacking it up into Tangrowth and changing the plant's expression to that of surprise. Quickly, Mad-Eye brought her other fist round, and slammed it into Tangrowth, the shadow punch seeming to damage the opponent. Withdrawing her fists back, Mad-Eye stands strong against her opponent, waiting for further orders. Tangrowth moves before they can be issued, launching a energy ball forwards into Dusclops, smacking into Mad-Eye, but not changing her expression. Rick quickly considered what action to take, and started to speak.<br />
<br />
âGood job on the evolution Mad-Eye, I'm really proud, girl. Start off with a <b>Night Shade</b>, then lock it in place with a <b>Mean Look</b> whilst you charge and release a <b>Firestream</b>.â Rick nods to her, and the Dusclops re-shifts her attention back to her opponent, ready to fight for her queen bee friend's safety.</span></span></div>

<b><u>Colosseo</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Trilobyte</u></b><br />
Keen on avoiding conflict as far as possible, you deem Yakuza the Honchkrow to be the best possible choice and release the Big Boss PokÃ©mon from his confines. With only the faint sound of his wings flapping in nearly complete darkness, you step out into the open arena, feeling your heart pound against the beating of Yakuza's feathers. Collections of miniscule glints that you can only assume are hundreds of pairs of eyes stare down at you from above; you figure the colonies must have somehow populated the area to the extent of blocking out the skylight metres above. You give another nod in the direction of Eriden and Seroba as you feel your way gingerly along the curving walls.<br />
<br />
Inch by inch you step up through the ancient stones holding up Colosseo, with little more than Yakuza's natural affinity for the dark assisting you in the conditions of extremely poor visibility, vaguely feeling your allies moving just as slowly behind you. Every now and then you grimace as your fingers brush past formations of sticky substance, having long since stuck to the crumbling structure and leaving their rotting deposits behind, building layer upon layer. Eventually, though, you realise that you have definitely come closer to Colosseo's exit as you notice now that not only are the glinting eyes moving, you can see shapes -- some round, some flat, squiggling amongst the higher echelons. It is here that you and Yakuza both decide that a <b>Haze</b> is a good idea to cover your tracks, and with little more than an extremely faint hiss the raven issues a cloud of dark gas all around you, blanketing your vision completely... all of a sudden you find that even the silhouette of Yakuza has left you amidst the fog. As it occurs to you that perhaps, just perhaps, obscuring your own vision even further was probably not quite a good idea in practice, your divided concentration between finding Yakuza and cursing your figurative lack of foresight opts to cost you...<br />
<br />
*<b>BUMP</b>*<br />
<br />
Like a lightning strike all to itself the sound of a pebble, absent-mindedly struck by your foot, thunders in the echoey building as it trundles down the stones, soon followed by a symphony of chattering and skittering. Several gusts of wind tear at you from above, and at once you feel the Haze alleviate -- as the shining arcs of <b>Defog</b> vanish you catch a glimpse of several Masquerain headed for you, surrounded by masses of moving blue.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Instantly, the warrior behind you leaps into action, flinging <b>Ice Shard</b>s towards the insect mob. Several of the more ambitious Surskit are promptly struck down, knocked out of their trajectory as they lunge at your group, squealing as they fall while Yakuza tends to the others, delivering <b>Peck</b> attacks to strike the ones Eriden misses. All at once the crowd of pond skaters disperses noisily, not quite intent on dealing with a cryogenic master and mafia bird, but their evolved seniors are not as easily thrown off. A bright <b>Flash</b> illuminates the arena and you instantly seize up involuntarily, catching an eyeful of the moths' terrifying visages. Swiping noises fill the air, tossing your sense of hearing into confusion, but all too soon the surprised yells of Seroba and Eriden cause you to turn back in alarm: in what light remains you spy long ropes from above binding the two merfolk in <b>String Shot</b>. &quot;Mas mas!&quot; shrieks the Eyeball PokÃ©mon in the centre, and on command the remaining Masquerain start flapping their copter wings upwards, dragging their unwilling prey as Eriden and Seroba struggle against their bonds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honchkrow!&quot; Furious, both at the enemy for their interference and pursuit, Yakuza releases the <b>Dark Pulse</b> he's tasked with from beak, sending wide circles of negative energy cannonballing into the airlifting PokÃ©mon and knocking them backwards. With thuds and grunts your allies fall to the floor, but still trapped in their unlikely prisons, and the last Masquerain -- whom, at this point, you're certain is the de facto chief -- flutters dangerously above you with an equally nasty glimmer in its real eyes. Looks like you're on your own in this confrontation...</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: aqua">As the bird led the three of them through the dark tunnels, Jamie inwardly started to curse his eyes for their inability to determine shapes through the darkness, with only the odd glint of curious eyes giving him the little light source and the ancient walls guiding him, his face wrinkling as his hand slid over older deposits, and eventually the view of what seem to be other shapes came into view amidst shadows. With but a small whisper, Yakuza gave a small hiss as the haze clouded over, and at once the young man's ideal plan was derailed as he realised that visibility had effectively died completely, as he felt his way through, failing to notice the pebble in his path until it was much too late.<br />
<br />
A crack of thunder seemed to echo throughout the chamber as the stone shot down some stairs, and as he swore under his breath he tensed up as the skittering increased exponentially, just as the defog technique gave Jamie two important pieces of information: One, the Masquerain had either found the stray HM and had learned it naturally as a result or were the offspring of a trainers' released into the wild, and two, the four of them were most certainly screwed in an attempt to stealth through without disturbing the nesting insects.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot;<br />
<br />
Eriden's cry as ice shards cut into the impending horde was all he needed to know as Yakuza started to give errant pecks towards the others, the more ambitious Surskit learning quickly to avoid getting involved with a large crow and a larger Walrein-human cross. Almost as sudden as the haze dispersing, a burst of light from the flash caused the trainer to flinch as he saw the menacing eyes, knowing fully well those were merely decorative yet still intimidating, and as his mind was full of confusion a pair of yells diverted his attention immediately to the string shots binding his merfolk allies, one particularly mean Masquerain seemingly controlling the operation as the other bugs started to drag the two away.<br />
<br />
Which was when Yakuza released his dark pulse, the widespread ring of darkness knocking the captors back and sending Eriden and Seroba thumping unceremoniously into the ground. While he could merely cut them free with an ally, there was the matter of the alpha Masquerain above him, eyeing him up as though he were filth, and even as he thought of the wrongdoings disturbing the nest, he knew the foe was reluctant to obey as he turned to Yakuza, the bird seemingly <b>intimidated</b> by the patterns of the wings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yakuza, look sharp! It might look scary, but deep down inside it's still a bug. Take flight and strike with a quick <b>Drill Peck</b> before falling back and knocking him back with a <b>psychic</b> burst. Afterwards, keep him puzzled with an <b>Unfinished Symphony,</b> but keep your relative distance from him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gazing back at the Masquerain, Jamie knew that the only way out would be by knocking this bug out and sending the nest packing from this corner of Colosseo, as bullish as it was. Zeugnum could easily slice their bonds open afterwards, but the priority was to keep himself in one piece.</span></span></span></div>

<span style="color: chartreuse"><b><u>Nelde Ruins</u> - please reply in chartreuse</b><br />
Southwest of Elendia lies a forest, within which lies the ancient ruins of Nelde -- home of the Binon royal family, who died out in the last few centuries. The Binon royal family was said to be a family of naturalist magicians who were at one with nature, and thus constructed their home alongside the forest trees. In the present day, the tree which the ruins were built around has grown into the stone, forming a monumental testimony of the power of nature over mankind. Alongside the local PokÃ©mon, some of the ruins' magic traps are still in place to catch any intruders who might threaten the sanctity of the region.<br />
<b>Wiese Forest</b><br />
The forest that surrounds the Nelde Ruins. Its fertile soil has given rise to a wild variety of flora, some of which can no longer be found anywhere else on Riviera, though not all are safe to touch or consume. Adventurers are not recommended to delve too deeply into the forest, however -- it is said that within the deeper areas of Wiese Forest lies a magical labyrinth of trees, from which escape is nigh impossible.</span><br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: chartreuse">Approaching the forest with great awe, Bill felt inspired by his surroundings that he should definitely go on this adventure. The majestic surroundings and calming nature definitely kept things a more peaceful set for the young man. He was not the only one who felt this way; his Totodile, Gold, was also enchanted by the surroundings. Both of them knew, however, the danger that lies ahead, or at least what they had heard. Despite the sheer beauty, the forest in itself was a very dangerous place. The duo realized this, but with the Nelde Ruins just waiting to be explored by the trainer, his decision to travel into the forest intensified. He took a compass from his silver backpack and referred to it. The two were standing at the western side of the forest, meaning they would try to get to the place by heading east.<br />
<br />
&quot;You ready Gold?&quot; asked Bill to his crocodile-esque partner. He turned around to see that the little scamp had already taken off toward the forest, ready for adventure. &quot;Hey! Wait for me!&quot; he exclaimed while chasing his jovial Pokemon.</span></span></div>

Originally a city in the centre of a lake, southeast from where Elendia is located, Tetyth was said to have been cursed in the distant past when the local inhabitants angered the gods with their extravagance and arrogance. Due to this the once beautiful city of splendour and prosperity was submerged within the waters, killing all the people in the city's limits and leaving behind the city's rich treasures and archives. In light of this, adventurers and researchers have made attempts to explore the sunken ruins, in order to discover more about the ancient lake city that has now become infested with PokÃ©mon. However, not all investigative expeditions have been successful; many of the city's traps are still very active, and those who set foot on Tetyth's abandoned soil have returned with claims that the water has a mind of its own...<br />
<b>Tetyth Lake</b><br />
With no port to cast off, Surfing on a PokÃ©mon is the only other way to access Tetyth across the watery depths. Usually the waters seem calm, but it is rumoured that feral aquatic PokÃ©mon have staked their territory in various bits of the lake, ready to attack any intruders...</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: aqua"><i>âLittle else remains of Riviera's historyâ</i><br />
<br />
A statement of true testimony in the texts about Riviera. Sitting atop a Milotic Matthew pondered the statement; the waves beautifully bouncing from underneath his feet, the sun shining down on such a sea causing the light to reflect into new shades of colours. The turquoise water flicked up at every instance of movement of the snake-like PokÃ©mon as the liquid touched his feet, splashing up like a serpent tongue and flicking back again. As majesty of nature was followed by his own PokÃ©mon, Matthew leant back on the neck of Hera as he took the most comfortable position, allowing for relaxation and visibility of the great land as it disappeared into the distance.<br />
<br />
He was a long way from home, but that's what the young man loved about adventuring. The adventure was unpredictable, challenging, exciting, adrenaline pumping and altogether magnificent, a real way of bonding with one's PokÃ©mon under the lands of Fizzy Bubbles, no other region touching its verisimilitude; the lands varying so much by location, the extent of the distance so great that no other region could be so vast and yet so welcoming. Sure, it wasn't the easiest to get round, but the variety kept Matthew interested, prevented him from moving onto another region.<br />
<br />
Shaking said thoughts of moving from his mind, Matthew dropped his hand down into the water, the aerodynamics of the collision causing it to run straight through the water, spraying water as it amplified on the Milotic's blue scales, overshadowing the beauty of the water to highlight the beauty PokÃ©mon's features as it did; Hera marvelling in her looks as they changed so dramatically from the Feebas she once was. It had been a journey for the water-type, coming from a scientifically modified PokÃ©mon in Cortoza with another trainer to having been traded to Matthew, he took the PokÃ©mon back to the land where it evolved; the perfect carriage from the Team Rocket crew that he had so thoroughly tried to fight and thwart in every move.<br />
<br />
Breathing in a deep breath of sea-air, Matthew went back to his golden PokÃ©dex; learning up on the land of Riviera as he went, his finger flicking down on his touch pad as it scrolled down, his eye finally catching a certain aspect of the land that interested him.<br />
<br />
<i>The place where citizen's spoke to God's huh?</i> the adult thought to himself. Having dedicated his team to the mythology of those who came before and the fossils they entailed, Matthew knew that anywhere with Gods was going to interest him.Tapping on the side of his Milotic, the PokÃ©mon began to speed up, the beauty of his surroundings no longer mattered, the thought of discovering as much as he could of the Flaybell Cathedral and the library it contained was far more exciting that nature at that point in time. <br />
<br />
âThe Tetyth Lake is the starting point to the Cathedral and that is where we shall goâ</span></span></div>
