&quot;What I want with her? You're a little too old to be asking such stupid questions; at least you should've learned by now that there're questions best left unasked.&quot; As the Skarmory rider looks down on all of you, you feel the cloaked woman shuffle behind you, holding onto you by the shoulders for support; another chilling sensation going through you as her fingers brush against your neck like iced water. &quot;Now are you going to step out of the way, or am I going to have to carve a way out of your --&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>He's not going to do either.</i>&quot; An unfamiliar voice, coming like fingernails scratching a blackboard, rasp in your ear, until you realise that the voice's owner is none other than the cloaked girl behind you. Surprised, you try moving yourself to no apparent avail; somehow without you noticing your arms have become locked against your body in a solid grip like an iron vice. Looking to your side, you see the girl's face from the corner of your eye -- no longer trembling and helpless, but now with a most inexplicably sinister stare, almost piercing the woman on the Skarmory in front of you.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?! You...!&quot; &quot;Maro!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Ah-ah-ah.</i>&quot; The sound of weapons being drawn slice through the air as the woman grabs her scythe and Marowak points his bone, but much to your alarm you find three metal spikes suddenly positioned dangerously close to your neck; as your viewpoint travels along them you discover their origin: poking out of the girl's cloak sleeve where a hand might have otherwise been. &quot;<i>One false move, and his blood decorates the rocks.</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Accursed witch!&quot; snarls the scythe wielder, &quot;Let him go! Now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>You're hardly in a position to be making demands,</i>&quot; sneers the now not-quite-so-helpless girl, and reinforcing her point you feel the tip of her spikes pricking the skin where your jugular is. &quot;<i>Throw down your weapons. Skarmory goes into its PokéBall now, or else.</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Keh!...&quot; The stalemate, ticking into seconds that feel like hours, eventually sees the other woman landing her Skarmory, clearly knowing that at this point she has no other option as you stand captive. Cawing indignantly, Skarmory is retrieved in a flurry of red light, leaving the woman to fling her scythe and PokéBall to the rocks in a reluctant clang. Looking downwards, you see Marowak meet your gaze with anger and worry blazing in its eyes, before he too drops his signature weapon.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Heh...</i>&quot; A painful jolt jars into your behind as the girl shoves you with her kneecap, knocking you and Marowak to the dust in an unexpected show of her strength. Tumbling across the unforgiving stone, you feel the breath quite taken from you when the woman grabs you by the arm, holding you close. &quot;No questions,&quot; she insists in a harsh whisper. &quot;This is between me and her. If you don't run...&quot;<br />
<br />
Whatever the woman says next, you find yourself deaf to what she says as the sight before you petrifies your other senses. As the girl's thin lips twist into a smile bordering on demonic, the hood around her head seems to fuse into her hair, and without warning the tip of the hood rips open at the sides, lined with sharp-looking fangs like a grotesque mouth. Both her hands reveal themselves as the spiked formations you felt earlier; catching the light shining from above in piercing glints that make you wince just to look at.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Special delivery for the Gates of Hell. Kya ha ha ha ha!&quot;</i> Screeching like a banshee with a most murderous look in her eyes, the girl who's become one with her cloak saunters towards you...</span>]</span>

Things had not gone well. Not in the slightest. LC had clearly completely misjudged the situation, and now with the cloak-woman racing towards them, fangs, claws and all, it wasn't looking good for him, Marowak or the woman whom until recently had been protected by a Skarmory. He wanted to apologize to the lady, but the look on her face told him pretty conclusively that now was not a good time for such actions, they had to save themselves or at least buy some time. Desperate times called for desperate measures, and LC begun to explain his plan:<br />
<br />
&quot;Try and get your weapon and Skarmory back, we'll keep her away from you for now. Marowak is not defenceless, even without his own weapon.&quot; he muttered to the woman alongside him, gesturing to her Scythe and Pokeball laying on the rock not far from them. His plan rather revolved around the witch-like abomination before them being easily distracted, but it was all they had for now. &quot;Marowak, we need to slow her down: incite your Earth Power to turn the ground itself against her, if that doesn't work, lets try and see how flammable that cloak is with a Flame Wheel!&quot; Marowak nodded as LC and he took a step forwards to position themselves between the attacker and the woman with the Scythe. Trying to remain as calm as possible so as fear would not overtake him, LC clutched at his belt and held Marowak's Pokeball tight. <br />
<br />
Despite trying to keep himself grounded in the dangerous reality, LC couldn't help but wonder what could be the root of this confrontation. Heaven's Gate was known as the final battlefield of the Grim Angels and the Demonic hordes that invaded these lands, and were these two anything to do with that cataclysmic event? Or some other strife? Whatever the answer may be, now was not the time for questions, far from it. Now was the time for staying alive. </span></span></div>

A multitude of raging thoughts, above all the will to survive, pound through your brain as the desperation and malice in the air afflict you. For certain there's a lot more than meets the eye, perhaps even more than you might be capable of imagining, but to answer these queries now would be impossible except in the afterlife. With an expression twisted in an unfathomable cross between what might be irritation, loathing and worry all mixed together, your unlikely saviour scowls at you before she disappears behind your back. Looking back at the monster girl, you find that in spite of her apparent frenzy and bloodlust her movements seem uncoordinated as she steps forward. However, as Marowak places his palm on the rock you spy a flash of violent purple energy across the ground, and before you know it you feel a slashing thump swipe across your stomach faster than you can blink. As the air is smashed out of your lungs you clutch your gut painfully; peering sideways you see Marowak in much the same agonised pose. Had the attack occurred in response to Marowak's offensive stance?<br />
<br />
&quot;Wak maro!&quot; Briefly recovering from the unprecedented strike, Marowak finally pounds the stair with a determined fist, sending a wave of his <b>Earth Power</b> into the stone, unfettered by the lack of his weapon. Lines of shining yellow light spiderweb through the rocky surface, cutting out distinct plates of the earth as they surround the cloaked enemy before erupting in an explosion of gaiakinetic energy. With a shriek the demonic girl finds herself tossed backwards, and given an opening Marowak lunges valiantly forward, kicking in knowledge he possessed since long ago as he blazes in a <b>Flame Wheel</b>'s fireball. Like a falling meteor your Pokémon rams into his enemy, but even as his body burns and you squint your eyes you discover that no other combustion appears to be occurring; a train of thought soon derailed as a snapping sound breaks your concentration. To your utmost horror the fanged hood has somehow revolved about the girl's head, now holding Marowak in its crushing grasp as she screeches in victory.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Feisty, are we? How'd you know I like my meal piping hot? But don't worry... Once I'm done with this morsel, I'll be sure to tend to you. Eeeheeheeheeheehee!</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
Rendered helpless, you watch despairingly as Marowak is flipped upwards like a burger, suspended briefly before the inevitable drop and devour, when you hear the other new voice ring out like a lightning bolt.<br />
<br />
&quot;<b>Pursuit</b>!&quot; Riding a missile surrounded in jet-black power, the warrior woman speeds in on Marowak as her Skarmory hones in like a bullet, barely snatching your Ground-type a split second after the cloak jaws snap shut. A sharp swerve, followed by a jerk on your shoulders, and you soon find yourself hanging in mid-air from Skarmory's firm but painless talon grip. &quot;Now, Skarmory! <b>Agility</b>!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Skaaaar!&quot; As Dark energy gives way to Psychic power, Skarmory careens against the wind faster than you might have expected out of a metallic avian, but your new visual perspective weighs most heavily on your mind. Granted, you had come searching for sights, but most certainly not from a precarious bird's eye view while under the threat of a manic half-human. Somehow Skarmory seems to pay little mind to your instinctive flailing, bravely navigating towards the chains and rocks, when --<br />
<br />
&quot;What in the -- NO!&quot; At the woman's curse, you turn around to immediately wish you hadn't made the involuntary action; a symbol of flame, gaining size and intensity with distance as it heads towards you, threatening to swallow the entire group. &quot;Skarmory, <i>faster</i>!&quot;<br />
<br />
Little else reaches your senses at that point, aside from a scorching wave of heat and Skarmory's cry of agony, followed by a ripping sound as the material of your shirt slips through the Armour Bird's cringing claws; a death knell louder even than the collective screams above you. Stones and metal, accompanied by a cacophonic orchestra of noise of chaos, fills your mind as you hurtle...<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center">***&#8203;</div><br />
Minutes or hours? You can't tell for certain, but as you open your eyes you know that for certain you've been put out of commission for quite a while. As your sensory functions refamiliarise themselves you feel a series of definitive throbbing pains through your body; a combination of burns, cuts and bruises, but surprisingly less severe than you might have otherwise expected from the near-death experience. The scarred face of the scythe wielder appears before you; her dark blue eyes soft in their gaze, and for some reason you have the distinct impression that she had been crying for a while, at least.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're alive!&quot; she whispers, again surprising you with how gentle she's being, &quot;Thank goodness, you're alive!&quot; Dull thuds pulse in your limbs as you find yourself scooped in an embrace; the woman's hair pressed against your neck as she holds you like a long-lost friend. Was this really the cold, no-nonsense lady you'd only just met some time ago, you can't help but wonder, as she eventually relents with a sad look on her face. Looking around, you find yourself on the floor of what seems to be the ruins of an ancient temple having already lost its gleam. Some distance away Marowak and Skarmory lie, resting off their exhaustion and injuries.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry you had to get involved in this.&quot; The woman speaks, and meeting her gaze you sense unease within her, as though she's deliberated over what to say for a while and still hasn't found the right words. &quot;I understand that you likely have a lot of questions for me, but first...&quot; For a moment, the steely, resolute quality in her countenance returns, and you know that things have only taken another turn for the serious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me -- what do you know about the Grim Angels?&quot;</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: chartreuse"><div style="text-align: center"><b><u>Nelde Ruins</u></b>&#8203;</div><br />
<b><u>Wiese Forest</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Excessive Spare Time</u></b><br />
&quot;Cyndaquil and Pidgey? Aha, no need to worry, little girl.&quot; Standing upright, the man chuckles as he pats you kindly on the shoulder. &quot;You should worry about yourself a little more; you've been out of it for quite a while. Best eat up well and regain your strength.&quot;<br />
<br />
Feeling your sight return as the stranger -- clothed in most unkempt tatters, you notice -- leads you gently by the hand, you find yourself in what appears to be a makeshift house constructed out of messily, but sturdily arranged sticks and logs, much like a traditional abode constructed by rainforest tribes with a fire in the middle. Through a hole in the roof the exotic smells of a meal merrily bubbling on a cooking pot wafts into the forest outside (at which, you are somewhat dismayed to find, has already darkened with the blackness of night), and surrounding a reasonable buffer zone a variety of soft moss has been laid out as makeshift carpeting, on which you are elated to see Volante and Torchlight soundly sleeping.<br />
<br />
&quot;They've already recovered and had their fill for the night. Of course, considering that Pokémon are more used to the effects of their moves than Trainers, you took a far longer time to recuperate. If Cormag there hadn't spotted you, though, while we were looking for dinner, I'd say the three of you would've been chow for Victreebel.&quot; At the man's gesture you spot a greater-crested blackbird Pokémon standing on its own cleverly crafted perch. &quot;Murkrow!&quot; it says, spotting you looking at it, while the man guides you to a well-made wooden chair on which you gingerly sit.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to say, though; it's not every now and then someone turns up in the Wiese Forest. Mostly Cormag and I find the bodies of souls unfortunate to wander in these parts unprepared, victims of the local flora and fauna. When you're in a forest this big it's a human eat plant eat Pokémon cycle to survive, and the forest itself is considerably feral. Still, so long as you don't play by your chances too much, you'll get by. It's the only way to live as long as I've managed.&quot; Apparently monologuing, the man goes over to the pot, scooping up some of its contents into a wooden bowl with a slightly bent ladle, soon bringing its steaming contents to you with a small spoon to match. Peering down, you find your stomach churn at the bizarre, stewed shade of green, dotted with lashes of crimson and brown.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry,&quot; he advises, &quot;I've already proven through trial and error which the good ones are.&quot; Still somewhat unsure, you carefully bring a spoonful of the peculiar stew to your lips, discovering to your wonder that the brew is most invigorating to its taste, and the mushrooms just well done with the right amount of chew to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;The name's Duessel. Leon Duessel,&quot; introduces the stranger at last, smiling as he watches you tuck in. &quot;And who might you be?&quot;</span></span></div>

<b><u>Wiese Forest</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Excessive Spare Time</u></b><br />
&quot;Cyndaquil and Pidgey? Aha, no need to worry, little girl.&quot; Standing upright, the man chuckles as he pats you kindly on the shoulder. &quot;You should worry about yourself a little more; you've been out of it for quite a while. Best eat up well and regain your strength.&quot;<br />
<br />
Feeling your sight return as the stranger -- clothed in most unkempt tatters, you notice -- leads you gently by the hand, you find yourself in what appears to be a makeshift house constructed out of messily, but sturdily arranged sticks and logs, much like a traditional abode constructed by rainforest tribes with a fire in the middle. Through a hole in the roof the exotic smells of a meal merrily bubbling on a cooking pot wafts into the forest outside (at which, you are somewhat dismayed to find, has already darkened with the blackness of night), and surrounding a reasonable buffer zone a variety of soft moss has been laid out as makeshift carpeting, on which you are elated to see Volante and Torchlight soundly sleeping.<br />
<br />
&quot;They've already recovered and had their fill for the night. Of course, considering that Pokémon are more used to the effects of their moves than Trainers, you took a far longer time to recuperate. If Cormag there hadn't spotted you, though, while we were looking for dinner, I'd say the three of you would've been chow for Victreebel.&quot; At the man's gesture you spot a greater-crested blackbird Pokémon standing on its own cleverly crafted perch. &quot;Murkrow!&quot; it says, spotting you looking at it, while the man guides you to a well-made wooden chair on which you gingerly sit.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to say, though; it's not every now and then someone turns up in the Wiese Forest. Mostly Cormag and I find the bodies of souls unfortunate to wander in these parts unprepared, victims of the local flora and fauna. When you're in a forest this big it's a human eat plant eat Pokémon cycle to survive, and the forest itself is considerably feral. Still, so long as you don't play by your chances too much, you'll get by. It's the only way to live as long as I've managed.&quot; Apparently monologuing, the man goes over to the pot, scooping up some of its contents into a wooden bowl with a slightly bent ladle, soon bringing its steaming contents to you with a small spoon to match. Peering down, you find your stomach churn at the bizarre, stewed shade of green, dotted with lashes of crimson and brown.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry,&quot; he advises, &quot;I've already proven through trial and error which the good ones are.&quot; Still somewhat unsure, you carefully bring a spoonful of the peculiar stew to your lips, discovering to your wonder that the brew is most invigorating to its taste, and the mushrooms just well done with the right amount of chew to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;The name's Duessel. Leon Duessel,&quot; introduces the stranger at last, smiling as he watches you tuck in. &quot;And who might you be?&quot;</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: chartreuse">&quot;In all honesty, sir, I don't know myself.&quot; said the girl. &quot;They just dug me out of the ruins a couple months ago, now all but three people hate me. You and Cormag are two of them. I just call myself the Dark Mistake now, at least, until I learn who I am. Hey, thanks for the stew.&quot; the girl continued, genuinely grateful that nobody ended up plant food. &quot;Guess I'll be thinking twice about where I walk.&quot; She regretted having not packed anything beforehand, she never had any money to get it with. It had been a while since she was actually invited to a feast, as opposed to getting run out of it like the last time. But she had one question to ask, especially since it meant her survival in this wood. &quot;Mr. Duessel, you said earlier that you knew how to tell good plants from bad. Could you please tell me which ones in this forest are safe to eat?&quot;</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslateblue"><b><u>Lacrima Castle</u> - please reply in darkslateblue</b><br />
Located on Rosalina Island, the northeasternmost island in Riviera territory, Lacrima Castle is also popularly known as &quot;the castle bathed in moonlight&quot;. Until some decades ago, a race of people known as Arcs lived within the castle grounds, but little has been heard from them ever since and the Arcs are believed to have simply died out. Swarmed by a variety of Pokémon, Rosalina Island is a considerably feral location in Riviera, and with the Arcs' apparent disappearance it has been overcast by a peculiar shroud that appears to cloud the island in night's darkness. Adventurers to Lacrima Castle find that it is always night there, though the silvery moon shines bright upon the seemingly ominous, yet melancholy structure. The only methods of getting to Lacrima Castle would be via the help of a Surfing or Flying Pokémon, although it is rumoured another method of transport exists somewhere...<br />
<br />
<b>Wilheim Path</b><br />
A coastal road that goes about a cliff, leading to where Lacrima Castle stands. Due to its position near the water, the weather is often warm, and migratory birds can be seen enjoying the breeze. Some of the grasses and herbs found here are known to have various healing properties.<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px">The salty air engulfed his lungs, Pepper Jack and his faithless crew were traveling the sea's again, in search of the unfounded treasures hidden from the scum of the earth, like himself. The Diddle road comfortably on the back of his tortoisey partner, Tortuga, the blastoise. The waves were gentle as the duo surfed through the night, awaiting their arrival to Rosalina Island, where Lacrima Castle resides. The thing that peeked his interest most was the moonlight scenery. Ledah would definitely would love the change in pace, slow things down and soak in the moonlight.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;I hope this visit will make up for that embarrassing loss at the PokeRinger.. God only knows I let her down in more ways than one.&quot;</i>, Pepper thought, Rosalina was now in clear view and Blastoise also noticing, began to make hast. <i>&quot;.. Who knows what could be there. If anybody else had decided to tour the island the same night as him, or even people that could inhabit the island.. I may as well expect the worst..&quot;</i><br />
<br />
After ten minutes or so of losing himself in thought, Tortuga had beached himself on the shore, prompting his trainer to fumble off his gigantic shell and on to the gravely shores of Rosalina Island. Pepper jumped to his feet, brushing off what bits of pebble that stuck to his clothing. This whole Riveria region was new to him, but it was exciting enough to start something fresh. Perfect opportunity to introduce some of his newer members of the squad into training, and improve on some of the older members technique. There was always room for improvement, and maybe even a new addition to the team. It had been some time since The Diddler had successfully captured anything on his own, relying on the adoption services and the egg house for most of his crew, perhaps he could find a memorable partner in these parts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks alot Tuga, but I think I'll be able to take it from here,&quot; he said as a light shot forth from a Vampire Ball in his hand and engulfed Tortuga. Word has it that a trail leading to the castle shouldn't be too far off from the beach. Raising his head, he looked at a castle in the distance, <i>&quot;What is it you hide? And why did you kill that man? By nights end I promise to uncover mysteries that shouldn't be, but he didn't deserve to die..&quot;</i><br />

As you trudge your way through the sand seeping into dirt and grass, engrossed in your plans in exploration on the island forever bathed in perpetual hues of melancholy and darkness, you feel the warm oceanic breeze blow against your costume with a bizarrely prominent presence. Sounds of rustling grass echo all about you, forming a hissing chorus that you can't decide between fearful or furious at your new arrival, and high above you the cries of nocturnal Pokémon can be heard; distant silhouettes triumphant against the light of a crescent moon. Feeling a gentle calm blanket your senses, it doesn't take you very long to trek up the gradual trail towards the forgotten citadel.<br />
<br />
Soon enough you stand beholding Lacrima Castle in its glory; a dark structure more imposing up close than you pictured in your mind across a cobbled path lined with imposing gargoyle statues, cloaked in an inscrutable aura that perhaps could only be described as profound sadness, accompanied by the chirping of local fauna. It seems that the castle grounds are thriving for opportunity of adventure and partnership, but where will you begin? Will the surrounding gardens be suitable for your needs, or would you be better off headed up the castle towers instead? The choice is up to you...</span><br />

&quot;Hmmmm. Got this to say first though, miss. I can't ever say I've ever heard or encountered anything quite like what you said. Of course, they say Riviera's got plenty secrets locked deep within the land, but I suppose there's always a first time for everything.&quot; Ladling himself a good portion of the plant stew, Duessel sits on his own seat opposite yours. &quot;Beg pardon for my expression of surprise, though; I'd've thought your asking priority would be to get out of here soon as possible. No one in their right mind would look at staying here for the long term as an option -- no offence intended, of course, my dear.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you're looking for survival tips though, miss -- can I call you that? The Dark Mistake's a bit of a mouthful, <i>chomp smack chomp</i> -- I'm afraid I can't give you a set recommendation for cuisine. Forests are chock full of unique species, and some have the most annoying habits of mimicking each other for camouflage or growing random poisons. There are, however --&quot; At this, Duessel turns about, picking up a tattered tome from the shadowed floor before standing up to hand it to you, &quot;Some tips I picked up from unfortunate individuals. It doesn't pay to be unprepared, although there are often enough scenarios that you can't prepare for.&quot;<br />
<br />
Placing your emptied bowl down on the ground you accept the book, in actuality little more than ancient bits of paper put together in a folder. One particularly creased piece of paper, captioned <b>Edible Fungi</b>, stands out to you, but browsing over its contents you find only a list of bewildering instructions:<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center"><i>The ones that are shrivelled are lethal unless they glow in the dark, in which case they might be safe.<br />
The red ones are lethal unless they are shrivelled, in which case they might be safe.<br />
The brown ones are safe unless they are spotted, in which case they might be lethal.<br />
The black ones are lethal unless they have smooth caps, in which case they might be safe.<br />
If you're not sure, and it is spotted, then you can be sure it's safe.</i>&#8203;</div><br />
&quot;Of course, there's no better teacher than experience like my elders used to say, although naturally not all lessons are pleasant... speaking of elders, you wouldn't happen to know what year it is, would you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Recalling what you heard from others, you report the figure to Duessel, at which the older man performs an amusing (if also somewhat alarming) spittake, spraying chewed mushroom and herbs across the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Has it been so long?&quot; he asks wearily, running a hand through his hair, &quot;Forty-five years, now, I've been in this mystical forest, and yet I've not aged a single day.&quot; As he suddenly looks most sorrowful, you can't help but feel a pang of empathy at Duessel's expression. &quot;It's one of the effects of this place, they told me. They'd warned me not to venture into Wiese Forest or I'd never return. 'Course, having trekked through Mireno and Tethys and lived to tell the tale, I had to blaze my trail here, didn't I? Thought I'd prove them all wrong. I thought perhaps I was living a dream, but now it seems the curse of this wretched wood claimed more victims to keep me eternally accompanied.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unconsciously you bite your lip as Duessel massages his forehead, lost within his own thoughts. If what he says is true -- and, in fact, you've no reason to doubt him given his frankness and hospitality -- you could be stuck in here for far long than you've bargained for...</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: lemonchiffon"><div style="text-align: center"><b><u>Elendia</u></b>&#8203;</div><br />
<b><u>Hobbit Smithy</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Handymankg2</u></b><br />
After a brief distraction culminating in the evolution of your starter, you make your way over to your next location within the village of Elendia; a short walk back through some of the local houses to a small establishment much like the village houses, but with a notably unique air and position of its own. Even as you near a few yards from the smithy's door the sounds of clanging metal and hefty grunting can be heard, and stepping into the hut you see a midget of a man bent over a rod of mysteriously glinting material, hammering away as a Sudowoodo sturdily holds the other end, sparks of energy fizzling from the strange ore with each hit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent, Sudowoodo; now we just need to... eh?&quot; Noticing your presence, the man glances towards you; years of hard work and experience having left their distinct prints on his darkened face. &quot;A Trainer, eh? If you came by Hobbit Smithy it must be for a reason. I'm Chappi; seventh in a line of nothing but the best in blacksmiths for continents around. What might I do you for, sonny?&quot;<br />
<br />
You take a while to explain yourself, with a few gestures from Bellatrix helping you as Chappi nods in understanding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Figures. It's about that time of the month, I guess, but I have to hand it to Claudia for wanting to try.&quot; Shaking his head, Chappi hops off the stand he was perched on, moving to one of several messy workstations he has lining the place. &quot;You probably don't know this, kid, but these days Lacrima Castle's not particularly attractive to tourists. The Arcs were a reclusive people, I'll give them that, but even they're not the sort to suddenly disappear for months without so much as a peep... it's nothing but bad news out there, kid; it's in the wind and the trees if you listen closely enough.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, don't let me stop you. Here's what you came for: an Item Ball,&quot; nods Chappi as he returns in front of you, taking your hand firmly and placing an orblike object in your palm; upon closer inspection you find that it doesn't look any different from a normal PokéBall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't let how simple it looks fool you, kiddo. Item Balls've been used for ages in the past, and nobody makes 'em like we do at Hobbit Smithy,&quot; Chappi grunts, thumping his chest in pride. &quot;Adventurers place crucial inventory in these things, and like PokéBalls do they keep their contents safer than any Trainer's grubby hands could ever do. No offence intended, kid,&quot; he adds, somewhat to your relief. &quot;You might want to get a headstart, kid. The sooner you finish that mission o' yours, the less you'll have to risk yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thanking Chappi, you prepare to leave, moving out of the open doorway as Chappi's voice trails behind you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, and kid! If you happen to find anything else a little out of the ordinary, don't forget to pop by!&quot;<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center">***&#8203;</div><br />
Only moments later as you walk about the outskirts of Riviera, the sound of another voice is heard from behind you; turning, you see a teenage boy with rutile hair and a purple, spiked helmet running towards you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... Rick, is it? I'm sorry we haven't had the pleasure of meeting earlier, but Miss Adryd asked me to hand you this. It's one of the few maps that we have of Rosalina Island; it might help you for your task,&quot; pants the adolescent as he catches his breath, handing you a yellowing piece of paper. &quot;My name is Triz, by the way; mining assistant to Elendia's Magic Guild. The others are hard at work recreating some of the equipment we can with the mined crystals... I do see you've retrieved the required inventory from Mr. Hobbit. I assume you have a Flying or Surfing Pokémon at hand, do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Not having expected this question, you mentally breeze through your current roster, looking at Belle who returns your gaze with a helpless shrug; even in evolution she clearly isn't capable of sustained flight with a passenger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, dear. Well, I'm afraid I have to get back to assist the others, but if you're in need of transport I can only think of two possibilities -- you might find a Pokémon you can use in the more natural areas in Elendia, or... well, there is another method of getting to Rosalina, but it's pretty risky. If you don't mind that probability, you could come look for me back in the Caverns. Just be discreet about asking; I don't want Miss Adryd to know.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Triz leaves you and Belle to your thoughts, an obstacle has already reared itself against you and the accomplishment of your quest. A few options are numbered for you, but whichever your decision you'll need to make it wisely and quickly...</span></span>

I think I need to note this sort of thing.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: lemonchiffon">As Rick approached, the sound of clanging metal and heavy grunting resounded in his ears, readying himself to meet whom he hoped would be a friendly person, but Blacksmiths seemed to fall into the stupid strong person category that Rick father was so adamant about, even though he probably actually fell into the category himself. Stepping inside the hut, Rick noticed that the person wouldn’t fall into that stereotype after all, being surprisingly short for someone who should be stereotypical classified as quite tall and broad shouldered. He was bent over a rod of a mysterious glinting material, unlike one Rick had ever seen before in his life, but then again, he didn’t see too much at all living in Viridian City, other than the occasional gym battle or rare flying type Pokemon. This sort of place was completely alien to Rick, but he realised after his first adventure that he likes alien environments, as they provide him with such a feeling he couldn’t get from any other place. He smiled as he saw what was a Pokemon he’d never seen in real life before, but watched battle on television once or twice, and Rick loved the bizarre sort of fighting style that the Pokemon often used. The Pokemon was holding one side of the material as it was being hit, some form of energy being knocked off in sparks as the hammer slammed into it with a certain rhythm that Rick started to get used to as he walked a bit further in. The man began to speak, and then noticed that you were there, glancing towards Rikc as Rick was able to see the mans face more clearly. He looked like he was certainly experienced, marks on his face showing much dedication and work that must have gone into his job over the past years of his life, perhaps even all his life. Rick supposed he’d end up like that one day, after he finished adventuring, working away his life at whatever job he chose to specialise in. Rick was surprised when he heard him say seventh in line. Rick had barely ever heard of a family line that works like that in such a way, not even kings or queens were generally ever seven in line, having been ousted or pushed in at some point of their legacy. You decide now was the time to describe why you’re here, so you do so.<br />
<br />
“Basically, I’ve been sent by Claudia at the Crystal Caverns to you in order to get something I need for my journey. I’m being sent to Rosalina Island in order to find a certain type of plant that only pops up at a full moon, called a Lunar Lilly. Apparently, the water that forms in the bottom of that plant has some sort of healing properties, and I’ve been sent by the Magic Guild to find some of this stuff to help them on some sort of project they’re planning. I was looking for an adventure, and basically, she provided it, so I’ve come here to get something they apparently left with you.” The man then decided to speak, and Rick listened with all ears, hoping to find out anything about the place he would be going too. He stated that it would be nothing but bad news out there, to which Rick replied “Apparently, bad news follows me wherever I go, so going to it for once might be a nice change.” He smiled. Rick saw Bellatrix perk up as she saw what they were receiving; she quite liked things that she hadn’t seen before, similar to Ricks personality and something he guessed she’d picked up along the way. Upon looking down at what Chappi put in his hands, he noticed it was just a pokeball. He continued to stare at it for a few seconds, before opening his mouth, but being cut off by Chappi. He explained that it was in fact different to a pokeball, and Rick believed him, and taking the mans advice, he thanked him and left, nodding as Chappi said to return if he saw anything out of the ordinary.<br />
<br />
Moments later, as Rick reached the outskirts of the town, you turn and see a kid with purple hair and a spiked helmet running towards him, and he began to speak quickly, giving Rick a map which he accepted thankfully. His name was Triz, apparently, and he then asked a question that Rick was certainly not expecting, but was vital nonetheless. He quickly glanced at Bellatrix, who simply shrugged back, and he gulped. And then the boy gave him two suggestions. As much as he would like to capture another member of his team, he only had one slot left, and he really wanted to keep that open for now. Later in the journey, perhaps something, but for now, he’d rather not capture anything that will restrict him. He decided then, as his only option, he’d go to the Crystal Caverns and ask about the other method of getting there. He’d just have to remember to be prompt about it, and not to arouse any suspicions from anyone else, as he guessed it must be illegal, dangerous, or worse.</span></span></div>

<span style="color: aqua"><b><u>Tetyth City</u> - please reply in aqua</b><br />
Originally a city in the centre of a lake, southeast from where Elendia is located, Tetyth was said to have been cursed in the distant past when the local inhabitants angered the gods with their extravagance and arrogance. Due to this the once beautiful city of splendour and prosperity was submerged within the waters, killing all the people in the city's limits and leaving behind the city's rich treasures and archives. In light of this, adventurers and researchers have made attempts to explore the sunken ruins, in order to discover more about the ancient lake city that has now become infested with Pokémon. However, not all investigative expeditions have been successful; many of the city's traps are still very active, and those who set foot on Tetyth's abandoned soil have returned with claims that the water has a mind of its own...<br />
<b>Tetyth Lake</b><br />
With no port to cast off, Surfing on a Pokémon is the only other way to access Tetyth across the watery depths. Usually the waters seem calm, but it is rumoured that feral aquatic Pokémon have staked their territory in various bits of the lake, ready to attack any intruders...<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: aqua">He stood on the bank of the lake, looking out at the pristine waters, as though a child searching for something lost, his eyes slowly rotating in their joints one way, before juddering and shifting the other. Eventually, he reached for his belt and pulled two balls off of it. One of them, a standard pokeball. The other, a much more exotic-looking Moon Ball, the reason he was here. Having jogged his memories of a previous adventure, one where he met a new ally and stopped the suffering of innocent pokemon, he recalled the trip to this land, one made on foot. It was just yesterday, the time that his entourage reached the lands near Tetyth Lake, that an abnormal triggering of his mind, caused by the resident of the Moon Ball, had occurred. The situation was clearly accidental, simply the by-product of unfortunate circumstances in training. As he closed his eyes in reminiscence, the mind of the boy came to life in his head.<br />
<br />
<i>Two men, or two creatures, one would not know. A mysterious amber-crowned fairy. A completely different world, devoid of pokemon. A sudden ray of light from above. The cheers of a crowd for a champion that never existed. A meeting with a monster that was only illusion. Two iron birds, as real as a shadow. An empty void...</i><br />
<br />
A sudden flash of light, and a creature appeared by his side. While under normal circumstances he would have simply recalled it, the beast was out for a reason, for he had heard some rumours of the lake before him. Rumours concerning a large library within a sunken city, within which he sought information regarding the mystery in his mind, which memories were fact, which were fiction. A second flash of light, and he turned his head, staring into the crimson eye of the very resultant of his new quest, one much more personal than his old one of seeking treasures supposedly within the waters.<br />
<br />
&quot;Meteos.&quot; He stated simply.<br />
<br />
'<i>Tetyth Lake. This is the place, Jamie.</i>' The sound of the masculine voice, laced with a hint of uncertainty, entered the boy's head, a natural occurance due to the psychic latency of Lunatone. As the Meteorite pokemon floated above the ground, Jamie turned to his other pokemon, one which had been an ally of his for a long time. Thick muscles wrapped in a dirty blue skin, jaws as large as a bear trap, and a pair of muddy fins on the head, as well as the tail, and it was evident that the pokemon beside him was one fit for the watery environment, yet oddly suited to life on land as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wraith, we move, now. Take heed, for the waters seem irritable...&quot;<br />
<br />
As the Swampert lumbered into the lake, hefty body kept afloat by its large surface area, the human clumb aboard while the moon-shaped rock simply hovered by his side, as the larger pushed away from the shore and made for the centre of the lake, the psychic pokemon's eyes alight with energy seemingly searching for any entry to the city that was rumoured to exist, and where it was sure his master would discover what plagued his mind. While the act itself was fully error of judgment, a confusion missing his master's Honchkrow and instead striking the master's head, it felt sorrow for the art, for it was his job to defend his master. It had always been for the past thousand years or so, it simply meant a new master.</span></span></span></div>

<b><u>Thunder Punch</u></b><br />
As you trudge your way through the sand seeping into dirt and grass, engrossed in your plans in exploration on the island forever bathed in perpetual hues of melancholy and darkness, you feel the warm oceanic breeze blow against your costume with a bizarrely prominent presence. Sounds of rustling grass echo all about you, forming a hissing chorus that you can't decide between fearful or furious at your new arrival, and high above you the cries of nocturnal Pokémon can be heard; distant silhouettes triumphant against the light of a crescent moon. Feeling a gentle calm blanket your senses, it doesn't take you very long to trek up the gradual trail towards the forgotten citadel.<br />
<br />
Soon enough you stand beholding Lacrima Castle in its glory; a dark structure more imposing up close than you pictured in your mind across a cobbled path lined with imposing gargoyle statues, cloaked in an inscrutable aura that perhaps could only be described as profound sadness, accompanied by the chirping of local fauna. It seems that the castle grounds are thriving for opportunity of adventure and partnership, but where will you begin? Will the surrounding gardens be suitable for your needs, or would you be better off headed up the castle towers instead? The choice is up to you...</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: darkslateblue"><span style="font-size: 9px">The castle was alot gloomier than he had first expected, but it was one of the most marvelous structures he ever had the pleasure to lay eyes upon. It was massive; meaning that he'll be needing a local to navigate around the castle, to the <b>Moonlit Garden</b> first, then explore the rest of the castle soon after preparing for the possible danger. <br />
<br />
Grabbing a blue Nett Ball from his belt, &quot;It's time for you to stretch your wings, Ledah...&quot; Pepper Jack grinned as he removed the blue and white sphere containing his lonely Ledian, from his belt, releasing the little bug with a brief flash of light. Fluttering violently upon her release, Ledah was clearly distressed by her neglect, but now he thought would be the right time as he pondered over where the two would go to first. Tossing the various areas of the castle around in his head, he finally decided on starting exactly where they were now, the grounds.<br />
<br />
The spots on his discolored Ledian were glowing a faint white, the moon having somewhat of an affect on her. <i>I've never really seen what happens to her species when the come in contact with direct moonlight.. I wonder what might happen</i>, he wondered. Turning his attention back to the pathway of gargoyles, &quot;Looks like we'll be needing some assistance from the native pokemon around here., Be cautious though Ledders, they might not be to pleased with us invading their space..&quot;, he motioned her to follow.<br />
<br />
She hovered for a moment before dashing off ahead of him, her energy seemingly rejuvenated by the atmosphere. <i>Whatever tales of sadness this place holds, Ledah certainly does feel at home here,</i> getting lost in his thoughts again as he trudged along behind her.<br />

&quot;Hmmmm. Got this to say first though, miss. I can't ever say I've ever heard or encountered anything quite like what you said. Of course, they say Riviera's got plenty secrets locked deep within the land, but I suppose there's always a first time for everything.&quot; Ladling himself a good portion of the plant stew, Duessel sits on his own seat opposite yours. &quot;Beg pardon for my expression of surprise, though; I'd've thought your asking priority would be to get out of here soon as possible. No one in their right mind would look at staying here for the long term as an option -- no offence intended, of course, my dear.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you're looking for survival tips though, miss -- can I call you that? The Dark Mistake's a bit of a mouthful, <i>chomp smack chomp</i> -- I'm afraid I can't give you a set recommendation for cuisine. Forests are chock full of unique species, and some have the most annoying habits of mimicking each other for camouflage or growing random poisons. There are, however --&quot; At this, Duessel turns about, picking up a tattered tome from the shadowed floor before standing up to hand it to you, &quot;Some tips I picked up from unfortunate individuals. It doesn't pay to be unprepared, although there are often enough scenarios that you can't prepare for.&quot;<br />
<br />
Placing your emptied bowl down on the ground you accept the book, in actuality little more than ancient bits of paper put together in a folder. One particularly creased piece of paper, captioned <b>Edible Fungi</b>, stands out to you, but browsing over its contents you find only a list of bewildering instructions:<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center"><i>The ones that are shrivelled are lethal unless they glow in the dark, in which case they might be safe.<br />
The red ones are lethal unless they are shrivelled, in which case they might be safe.<br />
The brown ones are safe unless they are spotted, in which case they might be lethal.<br />
The black ones are lethal unless they have smooth caps, in which case they might be safe.<br />
If you're not sure, and it is spotted, then you can be sure it's safe.</i>&#8203;</div><br />
&quot;Of course, there's no better teacher than experience like my elders used to say, although naturally not all lessons are pleasant... speaking of elders, you wouldn't happen to know what year it is, would you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Recalling what you heard from others, you report the figure to Duessel, at which the older man performs an amusing (if also somewhat alarming) spittake, spraying chewed mushroom and herbs across the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Has it been so long?&quot; he asks wearily, running a hand through his hair, &quot;Forty-five years, now, I've been in this mystical forest, and yet I've not aged a single day.&quot; As he suddenly looks most sorrowful, you can't help but feel a pang of empathy at Duessel's expression. &quot;It's one of the effects of this place, they told me. They'd warned me not to venture into Wiese Forest or I'd never return. 'Course, having trekked through Mireno and Tethys and lived to tell the tale, I had to blaze my trail here, didn't I? Thought I'd prove them all wrong. I thought perhaps I was living a dream, but now it seems the curse of this wretched wood claimed more victims to keep me eternally accompanied.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unconsciously you bite your lip as Duessel massages his forehead, lost within his own thoughts. If what he says is true -- and, in fact, you've no reason to doubt him given his frankness and hospitality -- you could be stuck in here for far long than you've bargained for...</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: chartreuse"><i>This isn't good...</i> The girl considered the news. On the one hand, the girl was going to be here for quite some time. On the other hand, she had quite some time to find herself, or, if such was not possible, the way out. But then, she considered the two. They were stuck in the same situation as she, caught in a forest that would take the lives of the unaware. She knew she could help them, but she also knew that they could help her. &quot;Mr. Duessel? I was planning to go on an expedition through this forest's ruins once Torchlight and Volante woke up. Perhaps you and Cormag could tag along? I know you could help me out to live through this trip, and I might be able to help you get out. What do you say?&quot;</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: lemonchiffon"><div style="text-align: center"><b><u>Elendia</u></b>&#8203;</div><br />
<b><u>Crystal Caverns</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Handymankg2</u></b><br />
With little choice left to you for transport and the other choice a no-go as a result of your limited options, you find yourself headed for the Crystal Caverns once more. It doesn't take you long before the subterranean labyrinth's entrance comes into view, as well as Triz who appears to have been waiting for you.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had a hunch you'd come, so I decided to wait out here a bit longer before rejoining the others. You'll need to be quick; I don't want the others knowing,&quot; he mutters, beckoning at you to follow him as he darts down the stairway. As Bellatrix buzzes behind you, the sounds of your footsteps ring through the caves as you try keeping up with the teenager, barely spotting him round a corner you hadn't noticed earlier when you went near the cavern stream. With each stride into the new route you find less of the crystals' calming glints; most of them apparently removed from mining processes, leaving only blank rock. The only light ahead you can see is a bizarre diagram on the stone floor, illuminating Triz's silhouette from below as he waves at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a Teleport Circle,&quot; explains Triz as you near. &quot;To put it simply, it's an area in space and time where the remnants of a Pokémon's Teleport attack have been isolated and focused, granting a psychic gateway between dimensions to allow anyone to travel between places instantaneously. The problem is, using the Teleport Circle creates a noticeable disturbance where both gateways are -- meaning, you'll risk alerting the Pokémon on Rosalina Island to your presence; some species are particularly sensitive to the presence of others and may attack. Usually Miss Adryd would have carried pacifiers for the expedition, except... well, I think you get the idea. I'm afraid there's little else I can tell you... just remember, Rick, be careful out there above all else. Now all you need to do is focus on the thought of reaching your destination. Good luck!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding as you step inside the runic pattern, you close your eyes with the image of an island shrouded darkness and mystery filling your mind. Even with your eyelids closed you can feel light rising from the ground around you, giving your body the strange sensation of being lighter than air...</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkslateblue"><div style="text-align: center"><b><u>Lacrima Castle</u></b>&#8203;</div><br />
<b><u>Wilheim Path</u></b><br />
<br />
The advent of a warm breeze, filled with the strong scent of salt, greets your nose as you suddenly feel the weight return to your body. Opening your eyes, you find that your surroundings have changed quite dramatically; while there isn't much in the way of light the ground below you is grassy instead of bare, and every now and then the sounds of local Pokémon chittering can be heard. Buzzing, Bellatrix points you at the sea where you can just about make out the mainland of Riviera in the distance, obscured by distant mist... or is it a miasma unique to Rosalina, almost sealing off the island from the world? Certainly, you don't remember journeying this late into the night; it was still light when you left Elendia, and yet the full moon shines above you casting light off the melancholy road ahead.<br />
<br />
&quot;SKREEEE!&quot;<br />
<br />
As you journey up the cliffside road from the circle, however, it becomes clear that Triz wasn't joking about the inhabitant Pokémon as a screeching Tangela suddenly lunges at you from the shrubbery; its vines swinging and pulsing about in a most alarming manner...</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: darkslateblue"><div style="text-align: center"><b><u>Lacrima Castle</u></b>&#8203;</div><br />
<b><u>Moonlit Garden</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Thunder Punch</u></b><br />
Moving across the bridge guarded by beasts of stone, you soon find that your Ledian is much the one leading the way instead, scattering glittering dust from her beating wings as she flies about, energised by the moonlight beaming down on the two of you. Stepping onto a tiled path, you round a junction with Ledah barely in sights; her powder trail the only distinct hint of her magical midnight flight. With the garden's flora surrounding you along with the faint, yet pleasant scents of their nocturnal blossoms, you feel your muscles relax and your mind mellow -- not in a sad way, but as though you've been cut off from the rest of the world entirely in this realm of night. If anything, Ledah certainly doesn't seem to mind; indeed, as you note, she seems very much at home in a world coded to her unique colour scheme.<br />
<br />
Finally catching up with Ledah in a collection of garden shrubbery, spinneys and trees, you watch quietly as she flits about in wonderment as though searching for something, when a piercing sound tears through the night air and sends jolts down your nerves and bones. The powerful dissonance does not escape Ledah's notice either; as two of her hands shield the sides of her head in irritation you sense the sounds of sharp swooping above you. Peering upwards you find a large shadow hovering towards you with outstretched wings, moonlight glinting off four fangs lining a mouth wide open in murderous glee.<br />
<br />
&quot;GOLBAT!&quot; shrieks the shadow, folding its wings around its sides for a dive, plummeting metre by metre with a distinctly hungry look in its eyes...</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: chartreuse"><div style="text-align: center"><b><u>Nelde Ruins</u></b>&#8203;</div><br />
<b><u>Wiese Forest</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Excessive Spare Time</u></b><br />
&quot;You, Miss? Help me?&quot; Furtively the man brings his fingers thoughtfully to his bearded chin, and almost instantly you feel despair creep into your mind. Your experiences with other humans, as your memory proves, have never been particularly happy; would your offer of involvement result in similar tragedy?<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to admit, I can't say I'm too fond of the idea. Not that I don't like you, y'know; it's just... well, I mean no offence, Miss, but I don't see us as a particularly strong team. Even Cormag and I have had rough scrapes every now and then; nearly lost a finger or limb to rampaging vines and bushes,&quot; explains Duessel. &quot;What I mean is, Miss, I'm worried I can't guarantee your safety. Much as your Pokémon should have an advantage -- that is, assuming elemental affinities haven't changed in the forty-five years I've been gone -- the environment isn't what anyone would call easy meat.&quot; Casting a look at your sleeping comrades you briefly recall the last few moments of the fight you had when you entered the forest, nodding softly at Duessel's remark.<br />
<br />
&quot;I appreciate your kind feedback, Miss, really. Maybe it's the lack of human interaction; if not for Cormag's company I might've forgotten how to talk.&quot; Mulling it over as he finishes off the remainder of his stew, Duessel eventually stands up. &quot;Well, in any case, you shouldn't be up any longer. You'll only exhaust yourself if you don't allow enough time for a recovery; you could collapse just as easily if your body hasn't strengthened itself back after weakening by poison. You can rest on the moss, it's soft like cotton -- besides, going by what you told me, you slept like a log buried in ruins, so this should be alright, no? Ha ha, just my little joke, Miss. Goodnight.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Duessel retreats to his own corner for the night, you ease yourself aside feeling renewed lethargy slink in. In all honesty, you find that uncertainty is the dominant mood you're experiencing; a thought that lingers as eventually, you fall asleep on your side.<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center">***&#8203;</div><br />
&quot;Ah, you're finally awake.&quot; Greeted by the gentle, sweet smell of poached fruit, you rise from your curled position on the floor as Duessel notes this. Around the fire, the three Pokémon happily greet you respectively before continuing their meals of exotic-looking pods and berries, laid out on broad leaves. &quot;Cormag and I usually head out early for gathering breakfast to avoid most of the Pokémon -- they don't usually come out in the wee hours of the morning until just before dawn, although it can be quite murderous to see then.<br />
<br />
&quot;Once we're done here, though, we'll see if we can't make any headway. You did offer, you know,&quot; he says with a wink, handing you another bowl of sweetly steaming stew with some more tattered paper on the side. Casually you take a glance at the doorway, and much to your astonishment the morning forest is in a rich spectrum of deep reds and browns.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, surprised me too when I started camping -- well, living -- out here. The colour seems to change every few days, and I'm not entirely sure why. The only thing I can glean is that it might have something to do with that paper I passed you -- I scrawled instructions left behind some sign I passed by, years ago wandering in the forest, but I gave up when... was it months? Years? Hmmmm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Picking up the paper along with a spoon of pink and red pulp, you look over the new instructions which seem no less bizarre than the others Duessel handed you the day before:<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center"><b>Blastoise: White Snow<br />
Ho-oh: Bright Sun<br />
Flygon: Blooming Flowers<br />
Purugly: Vivid Leaves<br />
The forest shall shift as the seasons change.<br />
Time passes in cycles.<br />
Direction is overseen by the Four Symbols.</b>&#8203;</div><br />
It's certainly quite worthy of stumping Duessel for so long, but do you think you've a chance at solving this conundrum?</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: aqua"><div style="text-align: center"><b><u>Tetyth City</u></b>&#8203;</div><br />
<b><u>Tetyth Lake</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Cod of War</u></b><br />
Spurred by a series of mental images that left a tidal wave's worth of questions in your mind, you decide on the location for your next adventure, accompanied by your trusted Lunatone and Swampert as you blaze a trail (or might that be a misnomer, considering the damp conditions?) through the waters of Tetyth Lake. A majestic waterbody in itself, reflecting the bright clear sky above you, Tetyth Lake almost seems like any other great lake if not for the living legend at its very epicentre. Prompted by Meteos, the three of your forge forward through the lake; you and Lunatone both certain that the answer -- if one indeed does exist, hopefully -- lies in the fabled ruins half sunken in Tetyth's depths, as the third member of your group forges valiantly on leaving frothing ripples in his wake.<br />
<br />
Ten minutes into the journey, however, you notice Wraith starting to struggle somewhat visibly, and looking up you spot Meteos orbiting about with apparent confusion set in his deep red gaze. '<i>There's something not quite right, Jamie,</i>' informs the psychic rock, frowning as he hovers next to your head, '<i>Wraith's been going around and around in circles, and he doesn't seem to be struggling eith -- <b>look out!</b></i>'<br />
<br />
Alerted by Meteos' sudden warning, Wraith barely avoids a large, snaking tendril that comes slashing out of the water, and feeling the water abruptly churn you realise what your Lunatone has been observing: without any of you noticing the water you've been caught in a sudden current, spiralling in a movement you recognise to be the <b>Whirlpool</b> attack in action. Now certain that the tables have taken a turn for the worse, Wraith begins swimming against the current earnestly to secure your safety, but the vortex is clearly within its later stages and between pushing against the current and dodging a storm of tentacles, you find Wraith being slowly but surely pulled towards the whirlpool's eye.<br />
<br />
'<i>It's coming.</i>'<br />
<br />
Feeling the blood drain out of your face at Meteos starkly whispered message, you see a domed head rise from the waters as stormclouds start gathering in the skies above you; a pair of crystals bearing the ruby shade of blood reflecting random flashes of lightning while two beady, inscrutable eyes glare at all three of you. A screech announces the Tentacruel's murderous intent, and with yet another tentacle poised to strike it almost seems to beckon you under its steady gaze...</span></span></div>

You'll only exhaust yourself if you don't allow enough time for a recovery; you could collapse just as easily if your body hasn't strengthened itself back after weakening by poison. You can rest on the moss, it's soft like cotton -- besides, going by what you told me, you slept like a log buried in ruins, so this should be alright, no? Ha ha, just my little joke, Miss. Goodnight.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Duessel retreats to his own corner for the night, you ease yourself aside feeling renewed lethargy slink in. In all honesty, you find that uncertainty is the dominant mood you're experiencing; a thought that lingers as eventually, you fall asleep on your side.<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center">***&#8203;</div><br />
&quot;Ah, you're finally awake.&quot; Greeted by the gentle, sweet smell of poached fruit, you rise from your curled position on the floor as Duessel notes this. Around the fire, the three Pokémon happily greet you respectively before continuing their meals of exotic-looking pods and berries, laid out on broad leaves. &quot;Cormag and I usually head out early for gathering breakfast to avoid most of the Pokémon -- they don't usually come out in the wee hours of the morning until just before dawn, although it can be quite murderous to see then.<br />
<br />
&quot;Once we're done here, though, we'll see if we can't make any headway. You did offer, you know,&quot; he says with a wink, handing you another bowl of sweetly steaming stew with some more tattered paper on the side. Casually you take a glance at the doorway, and much to your astonishment the morning forest is in a rich spectrum of deep reds and browns.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, surprised me too when I started camping -- well, living -- out here. The colour seems to change every few days, and I'm not entirely sure why. The only thing I can glean is that it might have something to do with that paper I passed you -- I scrawled instructions left behind some sign I passed by, years ago wandering in the forest, but I gave up when... was it months? Years? Hmmmm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Picking up the paper along with a spoon of pink and red pulp, you look over the new instructions which seem no less bizarre than the others Duessel handed you the day before:<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center"><b>Blastoise: White Snow<br />
Ho-oh: Bright Sun<br />
Flygon: Blooming Flowers<br />
Purugly: Vivid Leaves<br />
The forest shall shift as the seasons change.<br />
Time passes in cycles.<br />
Direction is overseen by the Four Symbols.</b>&#8203;</div><br />
It's certainly quite worthy of stumping Duessel for so long, but do you think you've a chance at solving this conundrum?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: chartreuse"><i>Direction is overseen by the Four Symbols... Time passes in cycles...</i> The girl considered what this meant. The weather patterns on the paper were clearly those associated with the seasons. <i>The forest shall shift as the seasons change.</i> She looked at the Pokémon names listed here. <i>Blastoise for White Snow, this means winter, Ho-oh for bright sun, summer, Flygon for flowers, spring, Purugly, vivid leaves...</i> She looked up once more towards the autumn leaves. <i>Direction is overseen by the Four Symbols...</i> The girl realized that these pokémon were involved in some way. Perhaps the pokémon would lead them out? But then, she considered the line 'The forest shall shift as seasons change.' Then she realized something. &quot;Mr. Duessel, I think I have an answer. It says that the forest changes shape as it changes season. Currently it is autumn, and the leaves are vivid. It says right here: 'Purugly: vivid leaves.' This seems to suggest that the forest is currently taking the shape of a Purugly. What do you think?&quot; she replied.</span></span></div>

<b><u>Tetyth Lake</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Cod of War</u></b><br />
Spurred by a series of mental images that left a tidal wave's worth of questions in your mind, you decide on the location for your next adventure, accompanied by your trusted Lunatone and Swampert as you blaze a trail (or might that be a misnomer, considering the damp conditions?) through the waters of Tetyth Lake. A majestic waterbody in itself, reflecting the bright clear sky above you, Tetyth Lake almost seems like any other great lake if not for the living legend at its very epicentre. Prompted by Meteos, the three of your forge forward through the lake; you and Lunatone both certain that the answer -- if one indeed does exist, hopefully -- lies in the fabled ruins half sunken in Tetyth's depths, as the third member of your group forges valiantly on leaving frothing ripples in his wake.<br />
<br />
Ten minutes into the journey, however, you notice Wraith starting to struggle somewhat visibly, and looking up you spot Meteos orbiting about with apparent confusion set in his deep red gaze. '<i>There's something not quite right, Jamie,</i>' informs the psychic rock, frowning as he hovers next to your head, '<i>Wraith's been going around and around in circles, and he doesn't seem to be struggling eith -- <b>look out!</b></i>'<br />
<br />
Alerted by Meteos' sudden warning, Wraith barely avoids a large, snaking tendril that comes slashing out of the water, and feeling the water abruptly churn you realise what your Lunatone has been observing: without any of you noticing the water you've been caught in a sudden current, spiralling in a movement you recognise to be the <b>Whirlpool</b> attack in action. Now certain that the tables have taken a turn for the worse, Wraith begins swimming against the current earnestly to secure your safety, but the vortex is clearly within its later stages and between pushing against the current and dodging a storm of tentacles, you find Wraith being slowly but surely pulled towards the whirlpool's eye.<br />
<br />
'<i>It's coming.</i>'<br />
<br />
Feeling the blood drain out of your face at Meteos starkly whispered message, you see a domed head rise from the waters as stormclouds start gathering in the skies above you; a pair of crystals bearing the ruby shade of blood reflecting random flashes of lightning while two beady, inscrutable eyes glare at all three of you. A screech announces the Tentacruel's murderous intent, and with yet another tentacle poised to strike it almost seems to beckon you under its steady gaze...</span></span>

<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: aqua">The steady course through the lake seemed a relaxing journey for the three as Wraith leisurely seemed to enjoy the warm waters, the sky above reflecting off the lake surface as a polished mirror showing signs of untold beauty. After ten minutes or so, Jamie almost seemed to forget the very idea of searching for Tetyth if it meant that he would stay in this relaxing position, the sun above keeping him warm, when the sudden realisation that Wraith seemed to be struggling brought concern to him. The voice of Meteos giving him information only helped to solidify the fact that something was wrong and as the psychic moon gave a call of alarm, the Swampert made a sudden evasive maneouveur that had him clinging to the fish tightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the...&quot; Jamie began before noticing the tentacle swarm suddenly appearing as the dread that he was caught in a whirlpool unnerved him. As the skies seemed to shroud over with stormclouds, the trainer became much more wary, especially as Meteos gravely whispered but two words into the boy's mind.<br />
<br />
'<i>It's coming.</i>'<br />
<br />
Franticaly looking around, Jamie saw It, the large bulbous head and crimson lumps of the Tentacruel as it raised another tentacle poised, murderous intent in the eyes as Wraith was slowly pulled to the eye of the whirlpool. In spite of the grave danger, Jamie was already considering the situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wraith! Stay steady there,&quot; he called to the Swampert, the beast struggling to escape the whirlpool. &quot;Stick with the current and use the momentum in bulldozing out of here with a <b>waterfall</b>, then show that Tentacruel a lesson by hitting with a <b>thunder wave</b>. Your ground typing should aid resistance to the move, but nevertheless focus on escaping. Meteos, break the foe's concentration with some <b>confusion</b> before getting back and delivering a <b>tri attack</b> to buy us some time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Feeling the pull of the pool, Jamie questioned why the jellyfish would become violent, perhaps he had trespassed on its hunting grounds, or something else...</span></span></div>

&quot;The shape of Purugly... That would be the obvious answer, yes. Though I've never actually figured out what it meant,&quot; frowns Duessel, picking up the paper from you. &quot;All I know is that every now and then the forest itself would seem to change in random fashion out of these four colours. Nothing like any seasonal pattern I'd ever seen before, but I never imagined that... hm.&quot; As he seems to mull things over, a few minutes pass before he eventually relents, handing the paper back to you but on the other side. <b><i>Summer, Winter, Spring, Fall</i></b>, you read.<br />
<br />
&quot;Those were... well, I suppose it wouldn't be far-fetched to call them directions,&quot; he explains. &quot;It was -- how long was it again? -- when I tried following the instructions of the paper in your hands right now. The first time I tried setting out the flowers were blooming in the trees, and... I do remember travelling away from the sun that morning. That was when I found a sign in the middle of nowhere, and copied down the four words you see at the back. I figured then to travel in the same direction, but I walked for what must have been miles before eventually passing out. When I woke up I found myself just outside the doorway to the humble abode we're in right now.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was... a week, was it?... before I regained enough strength and confidence to try again. That day the sun was really bright for some reason, and given the previous experience I tried heading southwards instead. Who should be waiting for me but my friend the signboard,&quot; Duessel muses. &quot;Although that time, when I continued in the same direction, I ended up in a forest with blooming flowers again, and... well, I think you know the rest. The very last time I remember setting off on a day much like my second tryout, but by that time I remember being really, really annoyed, and after I saw the sign staring us squarely in the face I think I must have had it. I began stomping my way back to base the way I came from, but after an hour or so of walking the leaves had all turned orange!&quot; Pressing his fingers to his forehead, Duessel appears to rub his brow vigorously, almost as if trying to exorcise the memory from his brain. &quot;That's about all I can say. Each time I met that sign and went on my way I kept walking until I passed out and ended up back here. If what you say is the key there should be a pattern... but for the life of me I can't figure out what that pattern is.&quot;<br />
<br />
What do you think?</span><br />

Having a threatening situation already on your hands, you try figuring out the best way of ensuring everyone's safety and halting the Tentacruel's luncheon plans; first calling to Wraith in order to escape the whirlpool's grasp. Tensing his muscles, Wraith tries bursting through with the force of a <b>Waterfall</b>, timing himself just right as he releases the energy in accordance to a tangential coordinate in the water, succeeding in pushing against the swirling rings and travelling further from the pull of the currents, although the technique doesn't appear enough to breach the vortex's full range. Crackling sounds are heard as both your Pokémon focus their respective energies, but as Wraith starts rippling with Electric power you find that while your Mud Fish isn't affected by the voltage you can't claim similar immunity, and while you feel pins and needles explode all about your body Wraith notices this phenomenon, ceasing the process in alarm while Meteos releases his <b>Confusion</b>.<br />
<br />
As the psychic blast leaves the moonshaped meteorite, it doesn't take long for you to note with dismay that while elementally advantageous, the distance you have since put between your group and Tentacruel has rendered the attack into a state of dissipation, and by the time it reaches its target you barely the technique glint against Tentacruel's central ruby. Tentacruel seems to notice the attack, though, and without warning you see a wave explode from where Tentacruel is, spreading its azure power all round until it hits you like a heavy smack to the face. Reeling from the <b>Water Pulse</b>, Wraith shudders as he fights the secondary effect of confusion, sinking back deeper into the whirlpool, while Meteos tries to keep up in a barely alive state after being struck by the super-effective move. Nevertheless as everyone draws closer he valiantly launches his <b>Tri Attack</b>, sending a triple beam of elements spinning towards the Jellyfish, managing to score several strikes along the beast's watery hide but otherwise not seeming to have much in other effects at all. If anything the Tentacruel almost seems bemused at Meteos' attempts, and all of a sudden a tentacle spikes up from the water, lashing at Meteos like a whip of lightning, and with that single smack you see the stars in your Lunatone's eyes as the difference in experience and prior aquatic attack proves too much for Meteos to bear. As you retreat Meteos with a timely activation of his PokéBall, froth begins to form near where Tentacruel's jaws might've been; the partial Poison-type now staring you down far too closely for your liking...</span></span></div>

Located on Rosalina Island, the northeasternmost island in Riviera territory, Lacrima Castle is also popularly known as &quot;the castle bathed in moonlight&quot;. Until some decades ago, a race of people known as Arcs lived within the castle grounds, but little has been heard from them ever since and the Arcs are believed to have simply died out. Swarmed by a variety of Pokémon, Rosalina Island is a considerably feral location in Riviera, and with the Arcs' apparent disappearance it has been overcast by a peculiar shroud that appears to cloud the island in night's darkness. Adventurers to Lacrima Castle find that it is always night there, though the silvery moon shines bright upon the seemingly ominous, yet melancholy structure. The only methods of getting to Lacrima Castle would be via the help of a Surfing or Flying Pokémon, although it is rumoured another method of transport exists somewhere...<br />
<br />
<b>Wilheim Path</b><br />
A coastal road that goes about a cliff, leading to where Lacrima Castle stands. Due to its position near the water, the weather is often warm, and migratory birds can be seen enjoying the breeze. Some of the grasses and herbs found here are known to have various healing properties.</span></span>

Lastly, thanks for being my updator ... hopefully there's still room.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: DarkSlateBlue"><span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua'">Rayne pulled off the sweater he was wearing, all the while huffing in exhaustion. The shirt he was wearing underneath was beginning to form a sweaty patch on the back; something that hardly ever happened to Rayne in days past. Fatigued beyond measure he slammed his back against the cliff wall, which was not as cool as he was hoping it would be, and let gravity pull him down. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is hopeless ...&quot; He muttered between breaths, something he was a little short on at the moment. From farther up the cliff he could here his partner running around, fresh as a pickle. She was only all too excited to be back on the road. Then again so was Rayne, but unlike his Ninetales, he was in terrible shape. <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;... Are you coming? Hurry ...&gt;</i> Asked Drought, telepathically. While not training or adventuring in almost two years may have slowed down his team's progress, it certainly did not bother Drought. His Ninetales had used the break to get better control of her psychic powers. It has gotten to the point where she could manipulate several objects using telekinesis, while carrying on a conversation telepathically, all the while playfully fighting with Obsidian. Certainly impressive. Especially considering how truely pathetic she was when she first discovered this gift as a Vulpix. <i>&lt;... I said hurry! ...&gt;</i> She yelled into his head, much louder, giving him a splitting headache. <br />
<br />
&quot;Stop yelling in my head! You always give me these damn headaches. How about next time we take an extended break, oh I don't know, you practice controlling your temper!&quot; Rayne replied, vocally. A slight scuttling sound to his right caught his attention. It was Drought, or rather, it was a moderately large stone Drought lifted from the gravel that lined the path. The stone rose slowly, very controlled, and then shot like a bullet ... right into Rayne's forehead.<br />
<br />
<i>&lt;... How does your head feel now? ...&gt;</i> Rayne screamed in pain. She laughed. Oh how sinister that laugh was. Buckled over, rubbing his forehead in an attempt to alleviate the pressure, he could hear more scuttling, this time it sounded like claws clinking and digging into rock. He rolled over in time to see Drought sliding down the almost sheer cliff face. She must have gotten really far ahead on the path while her trainer took a breather. As graceful as ever, Drought leaped off the cliff face, landing perfectly in front of Rayne. <i>&lt;... Let's go, let's go, let's go ...&gt;</i> She said more calmly. Clearly she was really anxious to be on the road again, adventuring like in the past. He could tell because her usual sneer (which was rather scary), was replaced with genuinely excited smile and her nine tails were all wagging in unison (as opposed to seperately beating like whips, like when she was battling).<br />
<br />
&quot;Take is easy a bit. I don't know if you've noticed, but I'm out of shape. We haven't travelled in two years. And why the hell did I pick this god forsaken castle to go to? This cliff is like running a marathon. And why the hell is it so warm and humid? This sucks ...&quot; Rayne vented. At least he had caught his breath. Sighing he pulled himself up with the help of the cliff wall, which was not as cool as he was hoping it would be, again. &quot;Andromeda needs to evolve already and fly me places. I think I'm too heavy for Plague to carry.&quot; Drought laughed, sending chills up Rayne's back, which to his surprise felt rather refreshing. <br />
<br />
The next leg of the climb went by a lot smoother. Drought stuck by his side, instead of running ahead. Rayne was back, he was once again travelling, and it felt great. It had been way too long. It had been years since he stopped adventuring. At first his teammates were all for the decision (except Tallon, she was always opposed to anything her trainer suggested, or so she tried to act), but soon he could feel the restlessness of some of his teammates. Minerva, Cascade, Obsidian, Seroh, Mesmenir, Tallon, Plague and Drought; the more extraverted of the group, the ones who had seen adventure the most. They all wanted to be back out there. Others like Saleh and Zodiac were loving just getting to sleep all day, and of course Apollo didn't mind secluding himself from everyone. The two youngest of his companions, Hephaestus and Andromeda, simply never got to experience the thrill and so they didn't mind spending time with the grownup members of the team. But it was long enough, if not for himself, he would adventure once more for his pokemon. <br />
<br />
And now here he was ... almost at the top of the path ... almost about to begin another chapter with his trusty companions. He patted Drought's pitch black mane, of course he didn't have to say anything, she already knew what he wanted to know (she always reads his mind). Without so much as a hesitation she projected an image into Rayne's head, it was the the view of Lacrima Castle, as seen from the top of this cliff path. When travelling with Drought he always utilised her abilities, psychic projections were just one of those things. Knowing what awaits you at the end of a path Rayne felt was rather important. What he could see amazed him. The castle was breathtaking. Sure it was eerie, but more intruiging if anything. He swivvled his head to get a better view ... and that's when he noticed the menacing forest on the edge of the castle. He quickly did a double take of the castle, but it was as if the forest was calling his name. He could not see much past the first row of trees, but he knew right there ... he was bound for <b>Rosalina Forest</b> ...</span></span></div>

<b><u>Moonlit Garden</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Thunder Punch</u></b><br />
Moving across the bridge guarded by beasts of stone, you soon find that your Ledian is much the one leading the way instead, scattering glittering dust from her beating wings as she flies about, energised by the moonlight beaming down on the two of you. Stepping onto a tiled path, you round a junction with Ledah barely in sights; her powder trail the only distinct hint of her magical midnight flight. With the garden's flora surrounding you along with the faint, yet pleasant scents of their nocturnal blossoms, you feel your muscles relax and your mind mellow -- not in a sad way, but as though you've been cut off from the rest of the world entirely in this realm of night. If anything, Ledah certainly doesn't seem to mind; indeed, as you note, she seems very much at home in a world coded to her unique colour scheme.<br />
<br />
Finally catching up with Ledah in a collection of garden shrubbery, spinneys and trees, you watch quietly as she flits about in wonderment as though searching for something, when a piercing sound tears through the night air and sends jolts down your nerves and bones. The powerful dissonance does not escape Ledah's notice either; as two of her hands shield the sides of her head in irritation you sense the sounds of sharp swooping above you. Peering upwards you find a large shadow hovering towards you with outstretched wings, moonlight glinting off four fangs lining a mouth wide open in murderous glee.<br />
<br />
&quot;GOLBAT!&quot; shrieks the shadow, folding its wings around its sides for a dive, plummeting metre by metre with a distinctly hungry look in its eyes...</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkslateblue">&quot;This place is better than drugs,&quot; pepper thought to himself as trailed in intoxicated state behind his Ledian. As he walked along, it became increasingly difficult for him to define reality and fantasy, while on the path. The tiled path looked as if it were severely damaged, complete with huge cracks and chunks of the road totally removed from their original places. To Pepper's relief, he saw Ledah's mysterious bug dust in the distance, and knew he was close to the Garden.<br />
<br />
&quot;This.. must..&quot; he studdered, barely keeping consiousness. Stopping dead in his tracks, a brief flash before his eyes and he found himself in a graveyard. The lightning light up the black skys as the rain beat down on his face, wandering aimlessly through the grounds. Fascinated Pepper edged closer, his curiosity screaming at him to explore this new event and he held his hand out to the lightning swishing himself through the blip of a past event. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know this place,&quot; he spoke aloud, before being interrupted by an ear splitting cry, from out of the shadows a figure flew viciously through the night. &quot;GOLBAT!&quot; shrieks the shadow, folding its wings around its sides for a dive, plummeting metre by metre with a distinctly hungry look in its eyes...<br />
<br />
&quot;Thats a real nice Golbat..&quot; he said smiling before a few more questions suddenly popped into his head. Without thinking, he dove to the right, taking quite the spill on the ground. Ledah was looking frantic, as reality finally hit him. This golbat was out for blood, and who better than a helpless trainer and his bug. Pepper scrambled around looking for his Bulbasaur's pokeball, but must have accidentally left him in the Daycare. Who knew that his adventure would end with him being bat food and Ledah finding her true home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ledian!&quot; cried his partner, before charging up what looked to be an <b>EXTREME SPEED</b>. This was certainly a change in her attitude, and a more battle hungry side he hadn't experinced with her before. Deciding it better to assist than play victim, he shouted out some attacks, &quot;Combo your attack with a <b>THUNDER PUNCH</b>, then use the <b>POWER</b> of the <b>COSMIC</b> energy around you for that added support.&quot; <br />

Having a threatening situation already on your hands, you try figuring out the best way of ensuring everyone's safety and halting the Tentacruel's luncheon plans; first calling to Wraith in order to escape the whirlpool's grasp. Tensing his muscles, Wraith tries bursting through with the force of a <b>Waterfall</b>, timing himself just right as he releases the energy in accordance to a tangential coordinate in the water, succeeding in pushing against the swirling rings and travelling further from the pull of the currents, although the technique doesn't appear enough to breach the vortex's full range. Crackling sounds are heard as both your Pokémon focus their respective energies, but as Wraith starts rippling with Electric power you find that while your Mud Fish isn't affected by the voltage you can't claim similar immunity, and while you feel pins and needles explode all about your body Wraith notices this phenomenon, ceasing the process in alarm while Meteos releases his <b>Confusion</b>.<br />
<br />
As the psychic blast leaves the moonshaped meteorite, it doesn't take long for you to note with dismay that while elementally advantageous, the distance you have since put between your group and Tentacruel has rendered the attack into a state of dissipation, and by the time it reaches its target you barely the technique glint against Tentacruel's central ruby. Tentacruel seems to notice the attack, though, and without warning you see a wave explode from where Tentacruel is, spreading its azure power all round until it hits you like a heavy smack to the face. Reeling from the <b>Water Pulse</b>, Wraith shudders as he fights the secondary effect of confusion, sinking back deeper into the whirlpool, while Meteos tries to keep up in a barely alive state after being struck by the super-effective move. Nevertheless as everyone draws closer he valiantly launches his <b>Tri Attack</b>, sending a triple beam of elements spinning towards the Jellyfish, managing to score several strikes along the beast's watery hide but otherwise not seeming to have much in other effects at all. If anything the Tentacruel almost seems bemused at Meteos' attempts, and all of a sudden a tentacle spikes up from the water, lashing at Meteos like a whip of lightning, and with that single smack you see the stars in your Lunatone's eyes as the difference in experience and prior aquatic attack proves too much for Meteos to bear. As you retreat Meteos with a timely activation of his PokéBall, froth begins to form near where Tentacruel's jaws might've been; the partial Poison-type now staring you down far too closely for your liking...</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: aqua">With his own safety jeopardised, Jamie was perhaps a little irritated that Wraith's waterfall assault had fared rather poorly, giving them only some gain, while the Confusion of Meteos served to only distract the Tentacruel as it unleashed a suddenly powerful Water Pulse, Meteos wavering in place at the might while Wraith struggled with some confusion from the move, the trainer himself disoriented from the sudden wallop. As Meteos launched his own Tri Attack, the foe seemed only amused at the power before the tentacle struck the rock down, the swift action of the Moon Ball's recall system the only grace for the Lunatone as things took a turn for the worse.<br />
<br />
'<i>Damn, there has to be a way round this whirlpool...we couldn't cut through it, so we'll have to try and destroy it. But how do you destroy spiralling water...</i>' Jamie thought as the distance between frothing maw and delirious Swampert became rather frighteningly uncomfortable, before an idea hit his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wraith, snap out of that stupor! If this Tentacruel wants a meal, then make sure it has plenty of water to wash it down with. Smash him with a wave from <b>Surf</b>, hopefully breaking this damn whirlpool, then while he's stunned <b>shoot</b> him a lovely chunk of <b>mud</b> pie, before helping him swallow it with a nice <b>mega punch</b> and get us out of here. The less I look at its jaws, the happier I am...&quot;<br />
<br />
Glancing back at the titanic jellyfish, Jamie started to question if the feral beast was like Meteos, a guardian of something, or really was just feral, ferocious and freakishly large and hungry.</span></span></div>

&quot;The shape of Purugly... That would be the obvious answer, yes. Though I've never actually figured out what it meant,&quot; frowns Duessel, picking up the paper from you. &quot;All I know is that every now and then the forest itself would seem to change in random fashion out of these four colours. Nothing like any seasonal pattern I'd ever seen before, but I never imagined that... hm.&quot; As he seems to mull things over, a few minutes pass before he eventually relents, handing the paper back to you but on the other side. <b><i>Summer, Winter, Spring, Fall</i></b>, you read.<br />
<br />
&quot;Those were... well, I suppose it wouldn't be far-fetched to call them directions,&quot; he explains. &quot;It was -- how long was it again? -- when I tried following the instructions of the paper in your hands right now. The first time I tried setting out the flowers were blooming in the trees, and... I do remember travelling away from the sun that morning. That was when I found a sign in the middle of nowhere, and copied down the four words you see at the back. I figured then to travel in the same direction, but I walked for what must have been miles before eventually passing out. When I woke up I found myself just outside the doorway to the humble abode we're in right now.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was... a week, was it?... before I regained enough strength and confidence to try again. That day the sun was really bright for some reason, and given the previous experience I tried heading southwards instead. Who should be waiting for me but my friend the signboard,&quot; Duessel muses. &quot;Although that time, when I continued in the same direction, I ended up in a forest with blooming flowers again, and... well, I think you know the rest. The very last time I remember setting off on a day much like my second tryout, but by that time I remember being really, really annoyed, and after I saw the sign staring us squarely in the face I think I must have had it. I began stomping my way back to base the way I came from, but after an hour or so of walking the leaves had all turned orange!&quot; Pressing his fingers to his forehead, Duessel appears to rub his brow vigorously, almost as if trying to exorcise the memory from his brain. &quot;That's about all I can say. Each time I met that sign and went on my way I kept walking until I passed out and ended up back here. If what you say is the key there should be a pattern... but for the life of me I can't figure out what that pattern is.&quot;<br />
<br />
What do you think?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: chartreuse">The girl picked up a stick and began drawing diagrams in the dirt. First, she drew a summary of the directions Duessel had traveled. SPRING+WEST(away from sun, morning)=SUMMER SUMMER+SOUTH=SPRING SUMMER+NORTH(south, then returned)=FALL. The girl considered what this meant. She then drew a diagram modeled after the traditional compass. SUMMER was at the center. She drew the word FALL over it, and drew SPRING twice, once to the right, once underneath. Before she could even draw WINTER, she knew something was up. She realized that this did not explain why spring came twice. She then looked back at the roads Duessel had traveled. She noticed that when he went north, time advanced from spring to summer, one whole season. She scrawled +1 next to SUMMER+NORTH=AUTUMN. SUMMER+SOUTH=SPRING. Which meant that time went back one season when he went the other way. She scrawled -1 in the dirt next to that. SPRING+WEST=SUMMER. He traveled one season forward when he traveled to the west. +1. She turned the paper over. &quot;Time passes in cycles... that's it! Hey, Mr. Duessel! I think I've got it!&quot; She scrawled the phrase YOU ARE HERE in the dirt. &quot;This would be the season we're currently in. She drew N+1 above it. &quot;This would be the next season, to the north.&quot; She drew S-1 below it. &quot;This would be the previous season, to the south.&quot; She drew W+1 to the right. &quot;The west also took you one season forward, so, logic would dictate...&quot; she drew E-1 to the left. &quot;...That going east would take us one season back.

<b><u>Moonlit Garden</u></b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Thunder Punch</u></b><br />
Disjointed events and conclusions half-formed in your mind, your immediate priority is the unwelcome newcomer in this confusing equation which Ledah is quick to acknowledge. Relying on unique intel your Ledian rises into an <b>Extremespeed</b>, slamming into the myotis of mostly mouth head-on. Not having expected its prey to fight back the Golbat is stunned momentarily, save for a few coughs as it recovers from having had its open gob rammed into, before screaming a shriek of indignance at you. The breezes around you seem to rise upwards as Golbat lifts its wings, but not for long when the Bat Pokémon swings them back down. Harshly hardened pockets of <b>Air Cut</b> crescents all around you, prompting you to instinctively raise your hands for protection as the Flying-type move slashes into the dirt around, drawing dust as Ledah winces from the wind slicing past her own skin.<br />
<br />
As soon as the wind dies down, however, your twilight-shaded bug is back into action; her four fists fizzling with electricity as the Golbat stares wide-eyed as much as its beady oculous organs can allow. With two knuckle sandwiches per wing Ledah's <b>Thunderpunch</b> hits strong and true, knocking the Golbat askew as its wings lock up from the immediate discharge of power, causing it to crash land onto the grass while Ledah proudly taps into her star-studded side. More glittering dust emanates from her five spots, surrounding her in rings of <b>Cosmic Power</b> as she gracefully hovers next to you, both of you watching as Golbat struggles to stand on its short spindly legs. For a while it doesn't seem as though Golbat is reacting at all aside from struggling, but as its eyes finally meet your gaze you feel a strange sensation of being constricted even though no neural signals have crossed your nerve endings. A check of your PokéDex confirms the phenomenon as <b>Mean Look</b>, and indeed it seems this Golbat isn't keen on letting you go anytime soon, taking to the air once more with fangs glistening from poison...<br />

<b><u>Dark Fire</u></b><br />
Two years down a road of inactivity in your roles as a Trainer have certainly taken a bit of a toll on you; both your physical capabilities and the insatiable thirst for adventure of your Pokémon. Nevertheless, the time given to them to develop their abilities further -- particularly, the innate prowess of your mystical vulpine -- is by no means a bad thing, and after consulting Drought's second sense of sight you feel that the island's forest is the better choice of two locations.<br />
<br />
Struggling a little with the rough terrain of bumps and hillocks, you nevertheless soon make it from the natural walkway along the coast into the outskirts of the forest; its foliage forbidding and fortressesque even as you draw near, so thick and dark you can see very few of what landscape might lie within the intertwining trunks and indecipherable branches. Almost before you call for it Drought flashes you another of her knowing, sardonic sneers as she raises her titular tails, lighting the shaded tips with just enough ethereal flame to see several metres ahead. A sort of prod goes through your head as your Ninetales gives you a mental poke to your brain, causing you to take a slightly tumbling step back. Rubbing your forehead you grimace as she cackles another laugh, bright and teasing, before you follow her into the maze of trees.<br />
<br />
It turns out that the decision for an alternative light source proves a timely one, for even as you know the moon shines overhead the swarming vegetation of gnarled, twisted trees prevent any of its light from shining through. Some weighted with despairingly burdensome leaves while others stripped bizarrely bare, they form a frame above you that gives a strange feeling of meandering through caverns instead of woods -- albeit really, really windy caverns at that. Every now and then a breeze zips past your ear before screaming behind you; their speed and intensity almost bearing little difference from actual shrieks of terror, moans of torturous experience...<br />
<br />
&lt;...Something's coming.&gt;<br />
<br />
The remark from Drought causes you to stop in your tracks, but even as your head feels another dull throb at the psychic intrusion what halts you isn't so much the mentality, but the apprehensive, tense tone behind Drought's message. As she extends some of her tails ahead, lighting up the area in front of you, you see what it is that has Drought concerned. The figure of a blonde woman -- her hair dishevelled, her skin bruised and dirtied, and what clothes she has in rags and tatters -- approaches in your direction from behind the trees, and even with her at least fifteen metres away you hear her voice; pained and unsteady with a sobbing twitch as she... Steps? Lurches? In fact, it's almost though she doesn't notice you as she moves forward aimlessly, all the while repeating herself in the same trembling tone...<br />

&quot;That certainly sounds likely,&quot; nods Duessel as the two of you look over your figures in the dirt. &quot;I think you're further along the track than I ever tried, although... if all it took were two variations, why would there be a need to indicate four directions?&quot; Some scratching of heads ensues for a while with you taking in this information, until Duessel pipes up again. &quot;You know, now that I think of it, in all the instances Cormag and I looked for food, there were only those three times that we encountered the signboard when we made an attempt to escape, even though we must have trekked far enough in this forest... maybe that's what the instructions mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
Beckoning your view, Duessel points to the lines in the paper's clues. &quot;Four symbols oversee direction... if what you're saying is right, it could mean that a certain seasonal phenomenon indicates the direction to travel to the signboard. Time passes in cycles... certainly, when I travelled in different directions, we experienced different seasons. Maybe the seasons indicate the exact path we need to take in order to escape, and the paths vary depend on what season it already is.&quot;<br />
<br />
It sounds like you're all getting closer to a resolution as more of the pieces fall in place from the putting together of heads. If you can take what has been hypothesised to be true, all that might be left is to theorise a navigated way out...</span><br />

Left with your Swampert as your only viable option for defence, you rally Wraith in your attempt to turn the tables around against your aquatic adversary. Pulling up the waters around him, it doesn't take long for Wraith to summon a respectably-crested wave of <b>Surf</b>, drawing a look of surprise even from Tentacruel as the momentum from the whirlpool and other currents rise to a peak. You feel your organs plummet with the rest of your body as you cling to Wraith for dear life, falling like a giant hailstone as Wraith bulldozes his attack straight into the enemy jellyfish. Water churns above you before rushing in to fill the spatial depression, submerging the three of you as the froth bubbles in a most turbulent manner above you. Clinging to Wraith you hold desperately to your breath, heaving a large gasp as Wraith breaks the water surface, and spotting Tentacruel rise as well he wastes no time in hocking a large <b>Mud Shot</b> at Tentacruel. The projectile splatters against the jewelled forehead, but even as the silt drips down Tentacruel's face you find that it's barely even stunned or stifled; certainly, it must be the <b>Clear Body</b> ability in action even though the Poison typing must have taken some rather strong damage.<br />
<br />
Giving off a snort of annoyance, Wraith starts treading towards the other offending Water-type; his fist starting to glow in power when all of a sudden you feel a lashing, followed by a constriction at your back, pinning you forcefully against Wraith's vertebrae. A yelp from Wraith followed by a sense of displacement, a view of the sky and choking sensation informs you that Tentacruel has now got you under clear <b>Wrap</b>s. Roaring, Wraith swings his arm, striking a <b>Mega Punch</b> against a tentacle which withdraws from the attack, only to be replaced by others, surrounding you in mid-air like a twisted inquisition. Tentacruel's certainly experienced some hurt this time, but things are really not looking too good for you...</span></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: DarkSlateBlue"><span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua'">After finally making it to his destination, Rayne was greeted with the same astounding view Drought had presented to him only minutes earlier. Yet again, the clarity with which she was able to project this exact image astounded him. It certainly felt like he had been here before. He looked up at the castle, mesmerized by the way the light from the moon bounced off its walls. This sight did not betray the brief description he read about it upon arriving to Riviera; it was most definitely a “castle bathed in moonlight”. Even in the darkness Rayne could spy little details about the castle; places where time had caught up to the formidable structure. Vines grew uncontrolled in some spots; chunks of brick missing from some towers, revealing the inner works; areas which were reclaimed by pokemon. Against the silvery moon he could make out large numbers of what he presumed were Zubat and Golbat, going about their never ending nocturnal activities. As alluring as the sight was, Rayne’s attention was slowly diverted down the walls of the castle, and onto the forest on its outskirts. <br />
<br />
As he got ever closer, Rayne’s anticipation grew ever larger. If the castle, with all its mystique and eeriness, could attract Rayne (in his mind he made a mental note to return and explore it at a later date), then the forest was quite literally begging him to enter. Standing at the edge (surprisingly the forest seemed to have an edge, like a well groomed hedge, no random trees poking out across the line), Rayne could not help but notice a peculiar draft flowing out of the woods; constant, but varying in speed at times. Varying to the point where it sounded like voices ... like screams and moans. For sure it had to be an odd acoustic effect created by the wind running into the densely populated forest, and not people wailing in agony. Most worrying, or perhaps most inviting, was the fact that even from several meters, Rayne could not see anything past the first couple rows of trees. These trees were so overgrown, so intertwined, so dense, that light could not penetrate farther than several rows. <br />
<br />
“Wonder if they let up at all. This seems impenetrable.” Rayne mumbled under his breath. <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;... Can’t help you there. Never been inside. ...&gt;</i> Came the response from the fire fox. <br />
<br />
“Well, hopefully they thin out a bit, or clear all together in some spots.” Drought took this as a cue and lit up her tails almost instantly, before Rayne could even lift his foot off the ground. A sharp pain in his forehead alerted him that Drought had indeed been reading his mind again, knowing full well that her trainer was going to begin his march into the gloom. Drought cackled yet again, enjoying the situation. Grumbling, and rubbing his forehead, Rayne and Drought finally stepped into the tangled mess of Rosalina Forest. <br />
<br />
What awaited him across that well defined border was something he had never before seen. The gnarly mess of trees was almost too much. With every step Rayne met resistance from twisted roots, fallen logs, puddles and mud that would suck his foot in. Not to mention the fact that he often had to turn sideways and squeeze laterally between trees to continue his march. Everywhere he walked he was constantly prodded by low hanging trees, entangled in vines, tripped by hidden roots. It was a nightmare. Eventually Drought figured out the best way to spread her tails to ensure her trainer had optimal visibility, and finally the two of them began making some measurable progress. <br />
<br />
More accustomed to his environment, Rayne could afford the odd glance at his peripheral. Now he could make out all the little obstacles that harshed him along the way. Some trees it seemed were completely bare, while others had odd growing leaves, vines and twigs pointing in every which direction. The combination of all these aspects, in tandem with that curious wind, created the illusion of faces and arms, pulling and screaming for him. Upon closer inspection however, what first seemed like a set of eyes following his stride, suddenly looked more like burrows in which pokemon could live. If only he could SEE a pokemon to prove his conjecture. <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;... This is just like home ... ...&gt;</i> Whispered Drought, barely audible to Rayne. <br />
<br />
“What?” He responded. Something about the tone in which she said that made Rayne uneasy. It was nostalgic sounding, but Rayne knew for a fact that Drought was hatched to a trainer, whereupon she was swiftly traded to him. Her home was with Rayne, and they never ever lived anywhere remotely similar to this place. His thoughts trailed off, thinking about how this would be a rather neat place to live. Maybe he could find lodging in the castle, and get some ...<br />
<br />
<i>&lt;... Something’s coming ...&gt;</i> Drought’s thought cut his “daydream” off. But this time he could tell it was Drought, and she noticed something. Her apprehensive tone and stance whipped Rayne into a more alert state almost instantly. With her tails pointing forward, Rayne could easily make out what it was that had his Ninetails so alarmed. A woman! Hair a mess, bruised and cut, pale and dirty. And as she walked, or hobbled, or lurched ... whatever it was that she was doing, Rayne got the feeling this woman had no idea he was here. All the while she kept repeating the same word over and over: destroy. An image of a zombie movie him and the gang watched flashed through his head. Drought was communicating with him. <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;... You think she’s a zombie? Maybe, actually. I don’t know though. This is strange ...&gt;</i> Rayne replied, tapping into that mental link, not wanting to alert the woman by making sounds. He of course also got to practice these past couple of years, and his psychic abilities had also improved considerably (only when communicating with Drought though). Where previously it would take all his concentration, now it came second nature, and with only a slight head rush as a result. <i>&lt;... Don’t move. Keep communicating telepathically. ...&gt;</i><br />
<br />
<i>&lt;... Sure. What should I do? ...&gt;</i> Drought responded. <br />
<br />
<i>&lt;... I don’t know. It seems as if she has no idea we’re here, but she’s got something on her mind. She wants to destroy something. I think we better not move. If she passes us we’ll follow her to wherever she’s headed. If she wants to talk we’ll talk. If she attacks, we’re attacking back. Start off passively. If she attacks, put her to sleep with <span style="color: Plum"><b>Hypnosis</b></span>. Follow it up with <span style="color: Black"><b>Taunt</b></span>, on the off chance it’s a pokemon controlling her, that will get them out of hiding ...&gt;</i> Rayne had no idea how this was going to turn out. He was just hoping his instructions covered his bases. But judging by how odd this place was, who knows if they would ...</span></span></div>

<b><u>Dark Fire</u></b><br />
With the new presence unleashing a storm's worth of questions, you find yourself troubled above all else by the strange woman. Was this mysterious lady friend or foe, alive or dead -- and was she a prelude to what you might have to face in this strange location? Hoping to seek answers you mentally relay a general contigency plan to Drought, steely standing on the spot you're on and waiting for the stranger to make her move. As it is, she seems to head right for you; Drought tensing her muscles and curling her lip in preparation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh...&quot; A few steps away from you, the woman falls to her knees, making a grasping motion at which you can't help but jump. As she seems to sob against your calves you look uneasily to Drought, who can only mirror your bewilderment. &lt;<i>She's not attacking,</i>&gt; reasons your Ninetales, though she has a certain tone of surprise at that. Bending down you support the woman by her arms, gently leaning her shaking frame against a tree, both you and Drought looking into her eyes glinting with tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pleas... des... oy...&quot; she whispers, &quot;Seek... hou... ddle... orest...&quot; Clutching her wrist, you're alarmed to feel her pulse suddenly dwindle to a complete stop; noting her expression you see that she's completely unmoving, with her eyes glassy as the night sky and her skin greying. &lt;<i>She's gone,</i>&gt; Drought informs you grimly. &lt;<i>I could sense her spirit was already fading, fragmenting. Almost like it was glued on to this body like strings to a puppet, and flimsily at that. She was barely holding on as it was.</i>&gt;<br />
<br />
Wiping the sweat off your clammy forehead, you heave a deep sigh. Experiencing anguished death is generally never a pleasant thing to be a part of, but what are you to make of the woman's final message and Drought's observations?</span></span></div>
