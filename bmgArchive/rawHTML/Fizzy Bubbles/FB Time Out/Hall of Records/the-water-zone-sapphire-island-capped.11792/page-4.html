<b>Skrusti:</b> Cid listens to your orders and nods, whilst looking at all the clones. The look on his face could only be described as portraying bliss. 7 beautiful Pikachus? Damn, what fun he could have .. Snapping out of it, Cid begins to move with speed, and collides with 4 clones before he smacks into the real Pikachu who is knocked back, and then smacked by Cid’s powered up Mega Punch. She lands on her back and slowly gets up, panting heavily. Cid then wiggles his little fingers and a small Substitute appears in front of him, subsequently depleting a good chunk of his health. <br />
<br />
Pikachu eyes the Substitute, and is completely fooled by it. She jolts forward, her tail glowing an intense silver as she leaps up and smashes her Iron coated Tail onto the Substitute which absorbs the damage but doesn’t yet disappear. She then frowns and stays still, trying to regain some energy, panting. Cid is doing okay, but that Substitute took a good chunk of health off him, energy is otherwise fine, at an average level. Pikachu is resting. What will you do?<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: limegreen">Jeff groans as he spies the look on Cid's face before he attacks. The look can only be described as pure bliss. But, the Shiny Minun manages to snap out of it long enough to begin speeding through the clones produced by the 'Chu, destroying four of them before he hits the real one.<br />
<br />
The Pikachu lets out a screech as Cid slams a powered-up fist into her face, sending her flying. She lands on her back, and scrambles up panting, staring at Cid. Cid waggles his paws as Pikachu stares, and soon the real Cid disappears, replaced by a life-like plushie. Pikachu is fooled by this, and leaps high into the air, spinning around as its tail glows a cool silver colour, obviously an <b>IRON TAIL</b> attack.<br />
<br />
The <b>SUBSTITUTE</b> takes the damage, and thankfully doesn't fall. Meanwhile, Pikachu pants harder, staring at the plushie, but doesn't do more than that. Jeff lets a small grin cover his face as he looks about for Cid. The Shiny Minun is sitting on a stump nearby, the Plushie having distracted Pikachu so Cid could get sit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cid, well done bud! Now, let's end this. She looks tired, but I imagine she's still not going down without a fight. Let out a bright <b>FLASH</b>, and follow it up with a 1-2 combo of <b>ICE</b> and <b>MEGA PUNCH</b>! You can do it!&quot; Jeff encouraged his small electric rodent.</span><br />

<div class="bbWrapper">Thanks so much for letting me post here, Becki ^^, and thank you Stu for taking me on ;D. Anyways, MY INTRO POST!<br />
<br />
<span style="color: DarkRed">With strides that left deep imprints in the golden sands of the Sapphire Island Beach, Oscar confidently and jovially departed his raft ride and commenced in making his way on his next adventure. <br />
<br />
It felt like more of a vacation than what was soon to be a vigorous adventure, and Oscar simply couldn’t help but appreciate the beating summer sun and refreshing feeling the area gave him, creating a sort of fantasy within his mind, as if this was his final retreat and he’d forever remain in this spot on the island – a possible yet unlikely situation. Scanning the beach with bright, wide eyes, Oscar took in a deep breath of preparation. As much as he would have loved to have stayed here, adventuring always came on top as the stronger passion, and he couldn’t allow this brief moment of relaxation spoil what could be an unforgettable adventure, as well as a useful opportunity to train a few of his Pokemon companions. <br />
<br />
So, still eyeing his surroundings, Oscar pulled out his map and pondered over which Pokemon he’d venture with. Seeing as both Thrall and Shizari were both still within the Daycare, Oscar’s hand hovered over Split’s Pokeball. He could have sent out Novim, but he was just plain creepy, and he hadn’t spoken to Split in quite a while.<br />
<br />
So, with a flash of light that barely opposed the light of the sun, Oscar released his Cacnea and began unfolding his map.<br />
<br />
“Oh so you are alive! More importantly, I’m surprised I’m still alive, what with the way you’ve been neglecting me! I have a right mind to flee from your possession you know, it’s been months, possibly years since you last paid me any attention! What ever happened to your insatiable love for Cacnea’s, eh? What ever happened to that?” Oscar drowned out the cactus’s whining with a rustle of the map before him as he rapidly scanned its surface. <br />
<br />
He wanted to go somewhere different, somewhere that kind of stood out from the rest of the island. And seeing as the lonesome Mountain, Ruby Mountain, was the only Mountain present on the whole island, Oscar’s interest was immediately piqued and his mind made up. <br />
<br />
“Oh, and that stupid new one, the dog that’s never seen you since you received it – she’s been whining to me you know, whining about her lack of exercise – I get the brunt of it all! You’re a bad trainer, Oscar, a bad traine-”<br />
<br />
“Ruby Mountain!” Oscar interrupted abruptly, pointing in the direction of the Mountain as he walked, following his finger. Unperturbed by the interruption and indeed the sudden movement in Oscar’s legs, Split trailed behind, punching his club-like hand with his other as he proved his point.</span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: LimeGreen">P-Arts: Feeling quite nervous after your steel behemoth’s demonstration of ferocious power, you issue another set of attacks, and Necross listens solemnly, envisioning how the attacks will be performed in his head; a strategy to ensure maximum accuracy. Lifting his huge tail into the air, Nidoqueen prepares herself, expecting to be slammed by it, but is surprised as the tail is sent hurling into the ground, shaking the entire Emerald Forest and sending some large rocks from the earth beneath you. Nidoqueen braces herself and then clenches her fists, as Necross smashes his tail against the rocks sending them right towards her. Nidoqueen then opens her mouth and blasts the rocks with a coating of Icy Wind, then she spins around and smacks them with her tail, sending the Icy Rocks right back at Necross. Using his initiative, Necross hurls his huge form into the air and then smashes into the ground, leaving a huge crater where he entered. The Icy Rocks land in the hole, not touching Necross as his huge form tears through the earth.<br />
<br />
Nidoqueen closes her eyes and tries to sense where Necross is currently at but fails as the behemoth bursts from the earth, sending chunks of debris all over. You dart about the area, dodging the debris as it crashes into the ground. Necross smashes into Nidoqueen and sends her flying, she shuts her eyes tight as she regains her composure in the air and lands on her feet, panting heavily. She then charges her right fist with Fire energy and rushes towards Necross, who is feeling quite drained of energy after his assault and smashes the fist into his torso. Letting out an eardrum splitting roar of pain, Necross smashes Nidoqueen away with a flick of his tail and inspects the burn Nidoqueen just inflicted .. Seems it could get worse. Nidoqueen is panting heavily now and Necross has been burned. What will you do?<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: LimeGreen">Eyes widened, James took a step back; he had been expecting destruction when he sent out his steelix - that came with the whole giant steel snake package - but nothing like this. The forest was getting ripped apart! He made a mental note to only send Necross out in extremely wide spaces from now on; for all he knew, a park ranger was speeding towards them to find out what the fuck was going on. The trainer groaned at that thought and started rubbing his syneses. That would be all he needed...<br />
<br />
Shaking his head, he looked up to see Necross staring down the nidoqueen, with a large burn on his tail - that could be a problem... he made a second mental note to but the TM Facade some time. He could certainly use it now... but then again, he had a TM that could be of use... grinning, James pulled the disk out of his bag, along with his Pokedex, and flicked onto his steelix's entry. Ignoring the data on his ground type, he pulled the TM out of its packaging and inserted the disk into the side of his 'Dex. He waited for a couple of seconds before words began to flash onto the screen: &quot;<b>Shadow Ball Recognition Confirmed</b>.&quot;<br />
<br />
His steelix turned to him, eyes calm, and nodded to confirm that he had indeed felt the new power being bestowed upon him - he then lowered his head once again, so it was down to James' level. &quot;How should I proceed?&quot;<br />
<br />
James sighed at the business like town, but replied, &quot;Yeah, yeah... let's try something different. When the nidoqueen comes towards you, lash out with a Flail attack, then knock it into the air with your tail as hard as you can.&quot; A confident expression came onto the trainer's face, &quot;After that... finish it with a full power <b>Shadow Ball</b>!&quot;</span></div>

<b>Joshua:</b> As you issue your commands, Hayley summons up the energy to last through these vital, possibly last attacks. Salamence watches Hayley carefully, as he opens his mouth to summon another Dragonbreath. As he releases it, the flames engulf Hayley, but she disappears. As the flames diminish, Salamence grins triumphantly, thinking that he had grounded your Desert Dragon. Suddenly, Narius shouts “SALAMENCE! Watch out!” But its too late as Hayley has slammed into Salamence and now has her teeth on his throat. As she glares at Narius, rage fills her and she bites down hard and Salamence can barely cry out in pain as blood begins to gush from Salamence’s throat. Narius gasps as Hayley tosses Salamence aside and the majestic dragon meets the ground, completely KO’ed. <span style="color: red">**Levelup for Hayley**</span><br />
<br />
Narius frowns and quietly states, “Salamence, return ..” The huge dragon disappears into the safety of the poke ball. Narius then looks at you, “You may have beaten Salamence but now a greater power awaits you..” Narius takes a Fire Ball from his belt and begins to laugh lowly as he throws it in front of him and the beast within is revealed. “SEE WHY THESE LOWLY CREATURES RESPECT ME!” He shouts as the beast takes form, brown fur covers it, with a long white mane lines it’s back, adorned with spikes on each side. On the beast’s face is something which resembles a mask, and its dark eyes stare right through you. What stands before you, is the legendary dog Entei. Cleary stunned, you gasp and take a step back before Narius smirks, “I take it you’ve never seen one before, yes.. It took me a while to obtain this creature’s respect” With that, he rolls up his sleeve, revealing his arm which has a chunk taken out of it. “This was my price for earning the beast’s respect.. So Joshua, choose your pokemon and lets finish this quickly eh?” What will you do? <span style="color: Red">**NOTE: I’m aware your Growlithe is of a low level, and if you want to remain true to Nariu’s element vs. element rule then I will allow you access to all of Growlithe’s level up moves, and she can still use any EM/TM/HM moves she knows. She may also evolve for this battle if you wish. All of these effects will vanish after the battle finishes**</span></span></span>

OOC: Thank you for the chance to use Tessie Becki. I hope you don't mind me taking a little creative license with Tessie's appearance.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: Lime">Joshua smiles as his victorious dragon flies over to his, and he wraps his arms around Hayley in a fond embrace. The emerald dragon smiles, and collapses to the ground, exhausted. Joshua strokes her neck, and recalls her to the safety of her Pokeball.<br />
<br />
Joshua turns back to Narius, who turns and glares Joshua down. “You may have beaten Salamence but now a greater power awaits you..” A shudder runs down Joshua's spine as Narius hurls a crimson Fire Ball into the air, and he bellows. “SEE WHY THESE LOWLY CREATURES RESPECT ME!”<br />
<br />
As the legendary beast of the volcano emerges onto the field, glaring Joshua down, a spiral of crimson light encircles Joshua, and a bright light radiates from a sphere on Joshua's belt. A Fire Ball rises from his waist, and explodes, a red river of light flooding out onto the field.<br />
<br />
Tessie, the lovable Growlithe, emerges onto the field, and growls down at Entei. A white aura shines around her canine form, and she begins to twist and contort, until the light fades. A larger, majestic beast now stands in front of Joshua, glaring down Entei. Tessie the Arcanine, strengthened by Entei's presence, readies herself for battle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Narius, I must ask. How did you come across such a powerful and majestic beast such as Entei?&quot; he calls across to Narius. Tessie glares at him, and Joshua begins to think.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tessie, strike Entei with Extremespeed, and then strike the beast with a powerful combination of Take Down and Flame Wheel! If it tries to attack, use Agility to dodge!&quot;</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px">All right, everyone except for Silver Wind has PMed me, so here are the second bunch of updates!<br />
<br />
<span style="color: LimeGreen"><b>~*Emerald Jungle*~</b> (<b>LimeGreen</b>, please!)<br />
<br />
<b>Alilatias:</b><br />
Hearing your orders, your electrifying green dog gives a warning growl to the Aipom, who, despite the small red fluid staining its fur, was starting to wag its tail in a taunting way. Starting to carry out your orders, your Electrike’s eyes started to gleam with a golden glint, staring down at the Aipom with a lot of hatred in his eyes. The Aipom somewhat cowarded back, taking the effect of the Leer attack made by your Electrike. Smirking at his successful attempt to intimidate the purple-and-yellow monkey, Hikari starts to be surrounded with sparks, charging to release its Shock Wave. However, the precious time it took to charge up the Shock Wave seemed to give Aipom a chance to suddenly charge at Hikari in an angle, striking his side with Ghost-Type damage. At once, the Astonish took its toll of flinching your Electrike. The sparks that were once flying all around Hikari’s body had now lost its static, vanishing in the ground almost instantly. <br />
<br />
Aipom starts to giggle at the damage it had caused to Hikari; however, it hadn’t noticed that it had paused just behind your Electric-Type dog, and your Electrike takes the opportunity to bite its jaw down hard on the tail flickering behind the monkey. At once feeling the pain, the Aipom shrieks as the Dark-Type pained flowed around its body. Glaring at Hikari, the tips of its tail starts to tickle the your Electrike’s forehead, and feeling the Tickle taking its effect, Hikari releases its jaws to laugh at the funny feeling it received. Now free from the Electrike’s grasp, Aipom jumps up to a nearby tree, pausing so that it can gain some more energy as its tail was starting to be stained with blood.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote>OOC: Sorry for the really short reply last time. Also switching Pokemon because of Daycare issues.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: LimeGreen">&quot;Hikari!&quot; Soruta shouted. She was immensely worried about her little electric dog that was taking a beating in this battle. Sure, Hikari might still be snickering due to the effects of the Tickle attack used by Aipom eariler, but still...<br />
<br />
At this point, she was actually contemplating returning Hikari to his Pokeball for the time being, and fighting the rest of the battle with Faltzer who was already out of his Pokeball. Like always, Faltzer was circling the area in the blue skies above. Soruta slowly pulled out a Thunder Ball from under her coat...<br />
<br />
She shouted, &quot;Hikari! You've done a good job! Rest for now!&quot; as Hikari was then instantly sent back into the depths of his Pokeball. Soruta then put away the Pokeball under her coat and looked up at Faltzer. <i>&quot;Faltzer... It's up to you now,&quot;</i> she thought.<br />
<br />
It took Faltzer a while to notice that Hikari had been returned to his Pokeball, but he still didn't stop circling the area. This puzzled Soruta until she noticed that Faltzer might be simply waiting for commands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, Faltzer! Let's finish this battle as soon as possible! Use <b>Double Team</b> to create copies of yourself, and swoop down with a <b>Wing Attack</b>! I have a feeling that Aipom might have some type of strategy against flying types like you, so use the speed of your <b>Quick Attack</b> to avoid any counterattacks by the little purple monkey!&quot;</span></span></div>

DM &amp; FF: As Aexlus releases Osiris, the poisonous moth floats above the ocean, quite intimidated by the sight, having never battled in such a place before. Issuing Osiris his attacks, you wait for Feera to give Nookie his attack orders and the two flying types approach Feraligatr who looks up at them as they both begin to emit Hypnosis attacks into his eyes. Feraligatr lashes out but then stops, as the Hypnosis attacks begins to make him feel weary. Feraligatr begins to sway from side to side, hardly able to keep his eyes open. Osiris then takes a position in the center of the two water behemoths and Nookie steers clear of the Poison Powder which is now falling over Feraligatr and Blastoise like a blanket. The two pokemon fire Water Guns at the blanket but its too late as the lethal powder is breathed in by the two and they begin to cough and splutter. Feraligatr, completely enraged by this, glares at Osiris and charges his claws with Dragon energy, sending them hurling towards him, but Osiris swoops down towards Blastoise just in time and avoids the attack. Nookie joins Osiris as he glows green, draining the energy from the Giant Turtle. Blastoise glares at the two flying types and open his turrets, revealing the cannons which are now glowing an intense orange, hes charging a Hyper Beam! Nookie is engulfed by a red aura as he flies into the air initiating his Sky Attack. As Blastoise fires off the deadly beam, Nookie crashes into the back of Blastoises head, causing him pain and knocking the Hyper Beam slightly off course. The attack hits Osiris who is badly damaged. Blastoise pants heavily, feeling the need to recharge.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Salamence had been swooping through the air, performing a Dragon Dance which sharpened his attack and speed. Feraligatr turned to Salamence and looked up wearily, but still has the passion to battle shining in his eyes. As Feraligatr tries to shake the drowsiness off, Salamence releases a barrage of greenish blue flames which engulf Feraligatr and wake him up a little bit, as well as causing medium damage. As Salamence charges a Tri Attack, Feraligatr grins and looks to Feera and Free and then fires an Ice Beam right towards them! Blastoise is currently recharging his energy. What will you two do next?

Pondering the situation while watching the battle unfold I see that Osiris did manage to poison them even though he took a good hit for it. Salamence was also successful in its attack. But now Feraligatr was trying to gain the upper hand while Blastoise recovered. I turned to FF and nodded to initiate our plan. <br />
<br />
&quot;FF you know what to do! Osiris Disable Feraligatr after seeing it fire off that Ice Beam! Salamence fire that Tri Attack at Feraligatr in the meantime! Then Osiris fly over to Feraligatr from behind and Giga Drain it! Salamence then take your attention away from the croc and hit Blastoise with a Dragon Breath!&quot;<br />
<br />
I hoped FF knew the plan that we had discussed in hushed voices before that bloody Ice Beam was fired. These water giants were testing out our mettle and weren't going down with a fight. Niether would we, as my poisonous moth and majestic dragon began to fly towards their destinations undaunted from the battle so far.

</blockquote>Feera reacted quickly with the Ice Beam heading his way, he knew very well it could be lethal if it hit him.<br />
&quot;Free, Quick Attack out of the way! Then combine a Dragonbreath with Salamence's Tri Attack!&quot; He shouted and braced himself, either for the impact of the beam or the acceleration that would occure.<br />
And then you, Nookie, Peck Feraligatr's face so that you get his attention and Venomoth can sneak up behind! Then hit Blastoise with a Fly from above!&quot;</div>

<span style="color: SeaGreen"><b>Latias10:</b> Illum nods, “Alright then sweetie.. Then we shall wait for those higher up” He then stayed completely still, and began to stare at you. The light on his head flashing on and off. Seems that’s his way to pass the time, but you feel very uncomfortable with this and it makes you feel even more nervous than you would normally be. You tentatively look at the Watund temple to avoid Illum’s icy stare and you notice 3 huge stone statues on the roof; One of a Swampert, One of a Rhydon and One of a Quagsire. There is only one entrance and it towers high and wide, able to fit most gigantic pokemon with ease.<br />
<br />
After 20 minutes of waiting. Illum continues to stare but is then cut off and he blinks furiously. “aAaaah! Yes yes! OK!” He speaks to himself and then moves over to you. “They want to see you Catherine.. They’re impressed” Illum then moved even closer to you, his cold breath causing your cheek to turn red. “You DO have Water or Ground type right? Take one in with you, they’ll like that ..” Illum then floats over to the huge door and fires a Thunderbolt into a slot which causes it to rumble and open. From where you’re standing you can’t see in the door. “Go on then love” Illum shouts and you approach the doorway slowly. As you walk through it, the ground turns sandy and you sink a little. Ahead of you is a wall, and there are no other doors. On the wall, there is a small statue of a Sandshrew with a stone slab attached to it which reads: <br />
<br />
“I am of water, I am of ground.<br />
But in both I can usually be found.<br />
On my body I have a poisonous film<br />
This membrane will give you a shooting feeling”<br />
<br />
There is a chisel and a hammer next to the slab. Seems it wants the answer. What will you do?</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: seagreen">When Illum aksed if she had a ground or water pokemon Catherine noded. Catherine took out a pokeball and pressed the button on it. There was a flash of light before Catherine's Crawdaunt Shimmer was standing beside her. Shimmer looked around to see if there was any battle and was a bit dissapointed to see none, so she just followed her trainer. When Catherine saw the writing on the statue she piked up the chisel and thought of what to write. Her mind went blank so she took out her pokedex and searched through the water ground pokemon. When she found out the anwser she wondered why she had not got it before. She then used the chisel to insribe the word &quot;Wooper&quot; onto the statue.</span></div>

Arnoldii starts using Absorb on Krabby, who runs around manically trying to lose Arnoldii’s gaze, failing the Krabby fires a powerful stream of bubbles directly at his eyes, blinding him temporarily and causing damage. Arnoldii stares Absorb after regaining its sight again; the Krabby onto its game already hides in the sand, completely negating the Absorb attack, after seconds and seconds of waiting the Krabby remerges from the sand and laughs. It then charges at Arnoldii it’s non-jewel holding claw glowing and stiffening, looks like it’s about to use Crabhammer attack on you, Arnoldii barely dodges as the Krabby’s claw lands in the ground, however it jumps out and it’s claw glows again, looks like it’s about to use Crabhammer again.<br />
<br />
What will you do now?

OOC: Please accept my deepest apologies for not replying sooner. My old computer died on me, but now that I have my new computer, I'm back to my normally active state.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: Yellow">&quot;Tch...&quot; Jon muttered to himself. &quot;This isn't working out... I'll need to change tactics...&quot; he finished, thinking for a moment. &quot;Hey! I got it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arnoldii, use a <b>Razor Leaf</b> attack! Then follow up with another <b>Absorb</b> as soon as you possibly can! Try to get it before it can recover from the Razor Leaf.&quot; Jon ordered. &quot;Finish by using <b>Razor Leaf</b> on it one more time!&quot; he finished.<br />
<br />
Jon was busy marveling over the glimmering object held in the foe's pincer. &quot;I'm too curious now to back down... I must have it!&quot; he yelled, pulling a jeweler's loupe to his eye, in hopes of examining the object, even if it lay quite a distance away. Unfortunately, a small clot of sand was whipped up with just enough force to get in the way of his vision. Jon, the ever-impatient soul, immediately gave up, returning the loupe to its place in the blink of an eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we'll just save the observations until after the battle's close.&quot; Jon decided to himself. &quot;Arnoldii should be able to fend off this meddling crustacean, now that I've remembered that it can use Razor Leaf.&quot; Jon spoke a little sheepishly. &quot;In any case, its a change of tactic that couldn't have come at a better time...&quot; Jon agreed nodding, putting on a front to the onlookers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm...&quot; Jon thought to himself inwardly. &quot;Even if it is a change of tactic, I'm still entirely limited to Absorb and Razor Leaf... Arnoldii hasn't learned any other attacks... So, if I'm to try to win, I might have to interfere...&quot; Jon drifted off in thought.</span></div>

Gaurdian lets out a bellow, swiftly followed by a cascade of flames, which produce just enough heat to melt what little ice is left on Gaurdian. The Drailisk stomps in the water, and a large pillar of water arrises from the river, stopping the <b>FLAMETHROWER</b> in its tracks. Through it then bursts the twin-headed behemoth, who sprays Gaurdian with bluish-green flames, another <b>DRAGONBREATH</b>.<br />
<br />
Responding to this, Gaurdian reverses the river's flow as a giant wave forms and slams into Drailisk, sending it skidding back a few feet. It hisses, but isn't out yet. Glaring at Gaurdian, Drailisk begins to glow, a bright white light masking it from your view...<br />
<br />
With a powerful roar, the light fades, and a creature with three-heads has replaced Drailisk, a more powerful creature it is now.<br />

&quot;Bloody hell...&quot; Tom muttered in amazement as Drailisk soon formed another head, then an ear-splitting roar burst out as the light faded. Guardian glared regardless, undeterred, though perhaps shocked slightly.<br />
<br />
The creature's heads flailed about, looming over Tom as a huge shadow was cast over him. He was stood with two huge creatures before him, almost like a clash of the titans, two great beasts in combat.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Guardian</i>, be careful! Boil up the water by using <b>Flamethrower</b> on it, then blast the creature with <b>Body Slam</b>, <b>Dragon Rage</b>, then a <b>Surf</b> to get it to fall into the boiling river!&quot;</span></div>

Sakura lets out a slight screech, and begins to spit blob after blob of ACID at the dog Pokemon. Before the harmful substance can touch Arkound's skin, its eyes flash white, and twin beams of light-blue light burst forth, freezing the acid in its tracks before hitting Sakura, who twists and writhes as the HIDDEN POWER strikes it. When Arkound lets off its assault, Sakura is nursing a frozen bottom end. Rini, in response to this, shows anger for her teammates injury and spits a glob of TOXIC substances at Arkound, which splats into the dog's face and mouth. With a cough, Arkound spits it out, and glares at Rini.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Trogly hops up and down, and then breaths in deeply, before spitting a stream of MUDDY WATER from its mouth, which smacks into Rini and pushes her back. Rini belches, and a thick GAS made of POISON escapes from her mouth, floating all over the area. Arkound crouches low, and opens its mouth wide, a freezing cold BEAM of ICE bursting forth and striking Rini's bouncy body, making her cry out in pain as her side is partially frozen over.<br />
<br />
As Trogly begins to glow, Sakura has had enough and opens her maw wide, a thick flurry of leaves flowing from it. They slam into the tadpole, interrupting its concentration completely, effectively stopping the SECRET POWER. Sakura screeches, and then begins to absorb what little sunlight she can, growing a bit bigger because of it. Rini just has a confused look on her face, and she just sits there, watching the battle...<br />
<br />
Next orders?

</blockquote>Kaya frowned a little, Rini had taken some damage that round. Trogly didn't seem to be causing too much grief, it was Arkound who was the big threat. Rini looks to Kaya and tilts her head, &quot;Swaaa?&quot; she said lowly as Kaya grinned. &quot;Rini, fire some widespread <b>Sludge Bombs</b>, make them extra poisonous. Make sure they hit both targets.&quot; She then looked to Sakura, &quot;Sakura, use <b>Stockpile</b>, leech as much as you can off Arkound and then move onto Trogly if you need to. When you've satisfyed your appetite, I want you to <b>Spit-Up</b> on whoever you wish. Rini! You need to watch Sakura's back. So give them a loud <b>Yawn</b> and then follow up with <b>Tri-Attack </b> if you feel threatened. Sakura, if you need to defend yourself, use <b>Magical Leaf</b> again to knock our foes back!&quot; Kaya took a deep breath and with her renewed confidence, called out, &quot;Lets see what you can do girls!&quot; to her pokemon and grinned as the battle continued.</span></div>

With Cryseye understanding your attack orders, she gives you a thumbs up, a huge grin forming on her face filled with sharp, silver teeth. Zubat circles her in the air and then dives down for a Bite attack, her fangs on full view. Cryseye charges her fist with electric energy and leaps to the side, dodging the attack and then leaps into the air and slams the electrically charged fist down on Zubat’s head, knocking her to the ground. As Cryseye moves to use Fury Swipes, she is stopped in her tracks by the Supersonic waves moving towards her, which collide with her and cause her great discomfort as she stumbles about holding her ears, feeling well and truly confused. <br />
<br />
Zubat then uses this precious time to get back into the air, and whips up a Gust which picks Cryseye up and sends her flying, causing her to hit the cave wall, dislodging some rocks in the process. Zubat then moves in quickly, and splatters some Toxic globs at Cryseye which sink into her skin. Cryseye is feeling confused, but this could wear off at any time, poison damage will come into effect soon. Zubat has taken a good hit, but her energy is quite high still. What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DarkRed"><i>Okay, so maybe this battle won't go as well as I thought...</i>Andrea frowned slightly, seeing her Sableye both confused and taking in the ominous effects of the Poison-Type attack, Toxic. Still, Cryseye did managed to get contact with the flying Zubat with her Thunder Punch, dealing moderate damage since the Electric-Type attack was super effective against her opponent. <i>Still, let's just hope that Cryseye doesn't get any excruciating pain that might cause her to be at a disadvantage...</i><br />
<br />
She was greatly tempted to take out one of her Antidotes to heal Cryseye from the poison, but she resisted digging her hand into the bag, deciding that she'll only use it if Cryseye's conditions get worse than what she was currently facing now. Sighing, Andrea glanced at her ghost, hoping that her feminine goblin would hear her next commands and understand them completely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cryseye!&quot; Andrea said. &quot;If you can hear me well, then send a <b>Fire Punch</b> at the Zubat's direction, then see if you can flinch the Poison-Type with a <b>Astonish</b>, followed by a <b>Fury Swipes</b> again!&quot;</span></span></div>

Your little Trapinch buddy looks up at you, and then at the other Trapinch. With a grunt, Validus stands still while you climb onto his head, and begins to prepare to toss you up. Krabu manages to get a clawful of skin and shirt, helping drag you backwards so you can get out of the hole. Wincing, you sigh in relief as the orange-red crab lets you go, and scuttles forward to stare at his master.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, down in the hole, Validus and Trapinch are having a staring contest, both sets of beady black eyes staring into each other. Neither move, and neither blink. You watch them for awhile, before Trapinch bows its huge head to Validus, and backs away into the sand, disappearing from sight. Validus looks up at you, and then also disappears into the sand, but thankfully reappears next to you seconds later as it digs through the sand.<br />
<br />
You suddenly find yourself sitting on the side of the hole still holding the native woman, Krabu staring at her unconcious form with Validus at your side. What will you do?<br />

Unfortunatly, the Shellder is not ready to give up. It leaps from the water, blasting all three of you with an <b>ICE BEAM</b>, giving poor Tangle a headache and freezing Mary to the sand around her. Giggling, the small bivalve then begins to zoom around in circles, quite pleased with its actions. It hops up from the water a couple more times, spitting a mass of water at you each time.<br />
<br />
Angry, Tangle wobbles, but looks back to you for guidance, wondering if it should once again attack the Shellder before you continue to search the beach, or whether to just run for it.<br />
<br />

Waves of ocean water break gently on the shore, and a light wind picks up, cooling you down. A flock of Wingull flies overhead, searching for any food scraps they can get their hands on. Er...beaks. Wings? Whatever. Krabby scuttle along the shore, being harassed by said Wingull. Suddenly, a group of Krabby skedaddly in front of you, barring your way. You notice yourself to be boxed in by the little buggers. There's at least 50 of them!<br />
<br />
They begin to advance slowly, pincers clicking, as they let out their odd cry. &quot;Cookie...COOKIE!&quot; Before they reach you, however, an opening appears straight down the middle of them, right in front of you, and a rather large Kinglar stalks forward, massive pincer clacking loudly. A crown made of seaweed and kelp adorns its head, and it glares at you. &quot;COOOOOOOKIE!&quot; It bellows, before slamming its claw into the sand, obviously demanding why you dare tread on its domain.<br />

Fredrick grins, and nods. &quot;All right then. I know your Sneasel can be very quiet, but I must warn you. When I say so, be quiet. Try not to make any sounds. These Beedrill are picky as to who enters their land, and to piss them off would be...quite bad, on our part.&quot; Fredrick warns, before turning and beginning to walk off. He stops for a few seconds to converse with a gaurd, who hands Fredrick some sort of ball, and a clipboard, as well as a backpack. With a curt nod, he continues on, and you follow him into the forest.<br />
<br />
Buzzing and creaking greet your ears, obvious signs of life in the lush aboreal verdance. Small insects flit about, mosquitos pestering you endlessly. Getting annoyed at them, you about order Sneasel to do something about it, knowing its attacks could annihalate them, when Fredrick crouches down beside a tree, motioning you to do the same.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright...&quot; He whispers. &quot;We're getting close. Be sure not to make any noises, and to follow my orders exactly. If we do this right, we'll get out of this alive.&quot; A little stunned by the words &quot;get out of this alive,&quot; you stare at Fredrick as he pulls the pack off his back. With a small grunt, he lifts a machine out of it, and begins to fiddle with it. &quot;This machine gives off the same pheromones as the rest of the Beedrill hoarde here. It should allow us to get very, very close to the creatures without disturbing them.&quot; He explains.<br />
<br />
Quite suddenly, a the buzzing sound filled the air, more than normal, and a group of Beedrill appeared. Immediatly, they stopped flying, and turned to stare straight at you. Fredrick turns white, and gives you the universal &quot;oh shit&quot; look. &quot;It's...it's not working...&quot; He stammers out. Immediatly, the group clang their spears together, and begin charging down, the three of them headed straight for you.<br />

Lucius lets out a small cackle as he opens his mouth and somehow spits a white-hot ball of fire towards Pinsir, who holds out one claw, as if to say &quot;stop!&quot; to the attack. Seconds before it hits, the <b>WILL-O-WISP</b> bursts apart and dissipates. With a barking laugh, the Pinsir launches itself through the air, and seconds before it hits Lucius, Pinsir disappears with a sharp crack, and a faint smell of brimstone lingers in the area. A split-second after disappearing, Pinsir reappears above Lucius hanging from a branch by its feet, and it slams its fist into Lucius, sending him spinning away.<br />
<br />
WIth an angry cry, Lucius rights hisself before shooting twin black thunderbolts at the bug, striking it in the chest. Without missing a beat, the Pinsir drops to the ground quicker than your eye can follow, and without warning, it leaps at Lucius, plunging a claw deep into his body. Crying out in pain, Lucius's form constricts and writhes until the rest of Pinsir passes through. When he hits the ground, Pinsir slowly stands up, clutching something to him tightly. He extends the claws that hit Lucius first, and a grin forms on its bug-features. A cloth flutters about in a light wind - Lucius's Spell Tag!<br />
<br />
&quot;A lovely little trinket, I have stolen for myself. This thing should bring me lots of wealth!&quot; The Pinsir cackles again. &quot;And by wealth, I mean power! For you see, I am a special, very special, Shaman of my people...&quot; Lucius's Spell Tag, now in the Pinsir's claws, begins to glow, as does Pinsir. Lucius lets out a small gasp as a purple line of energy flows from him to the Spell Tag, and from the Spell Tag to Pinsir. After quite a few seconds, Lucius slumps down a little bit, and Pinsir tosses the Spell Tag aside, flexing. &quot;Ghost Pokemon are quite fun...&quot; It rasps, before throwing both of its arms in front of it. In between its two hands, a small black and purple ball of energy begins to form, purple lightning arcing through it...and Lucius looks kind of weary!<br />

Rini takes a deep breath before glowing purple, and soon she spits out five rather large balls of purple sludge. They drift slowly forward, before Trogly and Arkound take potshots at them before the <b>SLUDGE BOMBS</b> can reach their targets with a combined <b>ICY WIND</b>. The now frozen balls thud into the soft loam, leaving some obstacles in the way of the battle. Sakura hops past the now Iced Bombs, and gets hit with an <b>ICE BEAM</b> straight in the stomach, blowing her backwards.<br />
<br />
Trogly performs a leap over the balls and lands next to Rini, unfortunatly with its back turned to Sakura, who bounds forward eagerly, clamping down onto the frog and beginning to <b>STOCKPILE</b> some energy. Rini lets out a rather loud <b>YAWN</b>, small pink bubbles floating from her towards Trogly, popping on impact. Trogly too lets out a yawn, and begins to move drowsily towards Rini with Sakura still attached. Hearing something, Sakura detaches herself from Trogly and turns to find Arkound standing on top of one of the frozen balls. Sakura and Arkound react at the same time, Arkound firing another twin-beam of energy from its eyes, this time purple in colour, and Sakura spits out a bright white beam, evidently having decided to <b>SPIT UP</b> the energy she stockpiled. With a bang, the two attacks collide, sending the combatants flying in every direction.<br />
<br />
Sakura slides down a tree trunk, while Rini picks herself out of a patch of clovers, both looking worse for the wear. The combined <b>HIDDEN POWER</b> and <b>SPIT UP</b> had caused the frozen <b>SLUDGE BOMBS</b> to explode! Arkound is laying on its side about twenty feet away from Trogly, who is amazingly still sleeping. The young man who trained the two looks worried, but awaits his Pokemon to show signs of movement before ordering attacks.<br />

Gaurdian lets out a mighty roar of challenge as the new creature whose three heads respond in king. Gaurdian once more stokes some inner workings of himself and produces a blast of flames, which strike the river which, sorry to say, flowing towards the Gyarados. The flames do nothing to the water but evaporate some of it, and the new creature responds with an attack of its own.<br />
<br />
Gaurdian begins to move forward, but a cascade of water rises in front of the serpent. Bemused, Gyarados begins to head backwards but again is stopped by a powerful spout of water. The water twists and surrounds Gaurdian, forming a large <b>BUBBLE PRISON</b> around it. Gaurdian's roars can be heard from inside, but struggle as he does, he can't pull off any attacks.<br />
<br />
What will you do?<br />
<br />
<b>Raichu-Chan</b><br />
<br />
Walking along the path, you can see the area was aptly named. A short trot though some trees, and Diamond Falls explodes into view, light glinting off the falling water, prisms on the other side of it shooting multi-coloured light in every direction. The sight is breath-taking, and you stop to watch it, content. A light mist sprays on your from the churning water, and your Pikachu walks over to the water's edge, taking a peek in. With a squeak, he tumbles backwards as pillar of water rises in front of his face.<br />
<br />
A white horn rises after the water, followed by a pinkish-white and orange-red body. The fish waves its tail elegantly, before sending another spray of water into the air. Eclair walks back over, poking the water a couple times before putting his face up close to it. The Goldeen looks back at him from underwater, and begins to mimic his actions, moving to the side when he does, and etc. The two continue the game as you finally are able to tear your eyes from the water.<br />
<br />
The only Pokemon around seems to be the Goldeen, and you can spy two paths leading away from the waterfall.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></div>

Walking along the path, you can see the area was aptly named. A short trot though some trees, and Diamond Falls explodes into view, light glinting off the falling water, prisms on the other side of it shooting multi-coloured light in every direction. The sight is breath-taking, and you stop to watch it, content. A light mist sprays on your from the churning water, and your Pikachu walks over to the water's edge, taking a peek in. With a squeak, he tumbles backwards as pillar of water rises in front of his face.<br />
<br />
A white horn rises after the water, followed by a pinkish-white and orange-red body. The fish waves its tail elegantly, before sending another spray of water into the air. Eclair walks back over, poking the water a couple times before putting his face up close to it. The Goldeen looks back at him from underwater, and begins to mimic his actions, moving to the side when he does, and etc. The two continue the game as you finally are able to tear your eyes from the water.<br />
<br />
The only Pokemon around seems to be the Goldeen, and you can spy two paths leading away from the waterfall.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span>

<span style="color: lightblue">(( My Pikachu is a girl btw ^^; Sorry. I just had to point that out))<br />
<br />
The young trainer watched as her Pikachu and the wild Goldeen mimicked each other's actions. She giggled a little at their antics, thinking how cute it was. Suddenly she noticed 2 paths leading out from the water fall area. She eyed the two paths as she decided which one to take. One lead into what appeared to be a forest like area. The path was overrun with tangled vines and the forest was very dense with trees and other vegetation. It seemed almost impossible to nagivate through those woods. She turned her head to the other path. This one was behind the waterfall and appeared to be a cave. It looked more easily accesible than the other path and had 3 stones leading up to the cave's path. This made it seem much easier to get to the hidden cave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eclair-chan, let's go. I want to explore in that cave up there.&quot; She called to the yellow rodent, her ears twitching as she heard her trainer's friendly voice.<br />
<br />
The Pikachu looked back to Aiseki (my trainer name btw), then to the Goldeen. She told the fish good bye in Pokemon language and hurried over to her trainer. Together, the human and Pokemon scaled the large boulders and made it up to the path leading to the cave.</span></div>

<span style="color: Yellow"><b>~*Southern Beach*~</b> (<b>Yellow</b>, please!)<br />
<br />
<b>Archaic: <span style="color: Red">REPOST</span></b><br />
Murmuring about how unpleasant the beach was, you started your way down the southern part of the beach. The sand under your feet was burning hot and so rough, it felt as if you were walking on millions of tiny bits of coal. The sun felt unbearably hot against your bare skin, and the water did not help much either. Despite that it might feel cool in the water, you would go on, complaining about how salty the water would be…anyway, you continued on your complaining on the negative of beaches when an unexpected scream rang through the island, and you stopped in your tracks, curiosity starting to poke your mind. Eventually, you shrug it off, but as you started yet again, you heard it again, and this time, it sounded closer than it was before…<br />
<br />
After a little more walking, you saw and realize what was causing the screaming; up ahead, in the water, you could see a young orange-hair woman in a bright blue bikini, screaming for help as two Tentacruels were grabbing her with their tentacles. The woman was desperate to get to shore, but she was a good fifty feet away from the beach. The lady wrestled with the many tentacles surrounding her body, but it was no use, and you could tell that she was tiring. In fact, one point, she nearly drowned, but it was only one tentacle grabbing her arm that kept her above the surface.<br />
<br />
The woman did spot you, but her cry to ask you to help was silenced as one of the Tentacruels covered her mouth, and starting to sink down in the water! Will you help the woman, or ignore her and continue to investigate the beach?</span>

</blockquote>Apologies for how long this has taken. Things have been quite chaotic here for a while now.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: Yellow">Mamoru sighs, closing his eyes, then throws off his cloak and dives into the water. So much for being an evil bastard, even he can't ignore a helpless girl in distress. Especially when she's barely clothed, and being attacked by tentacle monsters.<br />
<br />
How to deal with the blasted things is the question though. Almost all of his Pokémon are land based. Desperate times call for desperate measures...<br />
<br />
&quot;Shinjuu, help that woman! Slash those tentacles!&quot; Mamoru cries as he turns his head to the side, his lungs starting to burn now from having failed to take breaths after his strokes so as to yell that out, while his arm grabs the Pokéball on its backstroke and flings it roughly and wildly into the air. :rs043: materializes in a flash of bright red light, still well away from the woman, and starts racing towards her. This will be a test of speed for the Ninjask now, with the woman steadily being pulled under by her captors.</span></div>

<b>Dark Magic and ForeverFlygon:</b> As the Ice Beam rips through the sky, Free shoots out of the way just in time and charges a Dragonbreath, which then merges with Salamence’s Tri-Attack, causing the three elements to approach Feraligatr, with a beautiful stream of green flame surrounding it. It smashes into Feraligatr and knocks the giant crocodile over, it lands in the water and creates a huge splash, soaking all of you. When the water clears, Feraligatr is either fast asleep or KO’ed, its hard to tell. But the two of you decide to focus on Blastoise, to try to end this battle now. Osiris swoops in behind Blastoise as it pants, trying to regain some energy. Salamence, decides not to attack as he is feeling quite drained of energy and Nookie swoops in and Pecks Blastoise on the end of his nose, infuriating the Shellfish Pokemon who opens his mouth and Bites down on the shiningOwl pokemon, the sheer pressure causing him to faint. Feera manages to return the Owl before he hit the treacherous waters and congratulates Nookie on a hard effort. Meanwhile, Osiris glows green and begins to sap energy from Blastoise. Osiris’ position from behind puts him at an advantage as Blastoise’s stubby arms can’t reach enough to hit the moth. After draining the shellfish’s strength, Blastoise sways from side to side and then extends his cannons to full length and releases a Blizzard into the sky, dealing high damage to all pokemon, and sends chills down both your spines. Osiris is frozen solid now, and drops to the ocean, bobbing on the waves. Salamence and Free are cold, and have icicles hanging from their bodies, their speed will likely be affected. Their energy is running quite low. Feraligatr is still motionless and Blastoise is running low on energy but is average on health. What will you both do?</span><br />

<b>Politically Incorrect:</b> “Clever choice Stephen” Glacia said cooly as she eyed Houndour. Jynx winked at Houndour and then wiggled her hips a little. Houndour steps back, a bit freaked out. Glacia then laughs quietly and then stops as Houndour begins to respond to your attack orders. Her eyes glow an intense red as Jynx freezes on the spot, intimidated by the Doomdog. Opening her mouth, Houndour then charges some fire energy and then sends a double barrage of Embers, which pelt Jynx head on, causing a good deal of damage. The Leer wearing off, Jynx’s expression changes to that of a pissed-off mother and she clenches her fists and leaps backwards onto the lake, her psychic powers keeping her stood on the surface. “Now Jynx.. Psychic attack, you know what to do!” Glacia commands. <br />
<br />
Moving her hands about, Jynx uses Psychic to manipulate the water into a dragon shape and sends it flying towards Houndour, who tries her best to dodge but is hit by the majority of it and is sent flying across the ground. Getting up with a little whimper, Houndour stand before Jynx who makes her way back onto the bank. “Lovely Kiss then Powder Snow!” Glacia states as Jynx winks and then pouts her lips, sending some small hearts towards Houndour and then prepares to use Powder Snow. What will you do?<br />
<br />
<b>Faiyaa:</b> Psyduck smiles dopily as you administer the Potion, and looks up at Scurvy and tilts his head as he opens a psychic link with your mind. “My name? Well some have called me Psyduck, others call me Kratos.. Call me what you will. As for a tour, of course. It’d be my pleasure to show you my home.” Kratos then began to waddle across the bank and you follow him, and he points out the major points of interest, such as where he bathes, the stone shaped like a Lotad and the last one is the statue of Milotic, who the pokemon of Lapis Lake ‘worship’ according to Kratos. As you approach the block on which it is meant to stand and in its place .. Is a toilet roll and some sticks. Krato’s bill drops to the ground as he begins to run about in a panic. “Itsgoneitsgoneitsgone!” he screams in your mind and you hold your ears as his panicstricken tone echos in your head. Approaching the block, theres a note, you pick it up and read it out loud.<br />
<br />
“Ta muchly for the Milotic Statue. Gonna sell it for some Moolah. Too bad <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite7" alt=":p" title="Stick Out Tongue    :p" data-shortname=":p" />”<br />
<br />
In the distance you see a hooded figure dragging a rather large black bag. What will you do?<br />
<br />
<b>Joe:</b> Ditto struggled to get itself back onto its feet, and so could not dodge Shiftry’s Quick Attack, which smacked the blob of transforming gloop into the Lake. With a big splash, the Ditto began to sink, already KO’ed *Level up for Shiftry*. Ludicolo stopped as his partner disappeared under the lakes waters and with a loud, “LUDI COLO!” he ran as fast as he could into the lake and submerged. Joy sighed in relief and turned to you, “We must be careful, lord only knows whats going on under those waters” Ivy pants heavily, due to all she energy she used and Joy smiles to her companion, “You’re very tired. Take a rest” Nodding, Ivy is withdrawn into her Pokeball. Nurse Joy then walks to the bank and peers into the water, and in the center of the lake, bubbles begin to form. Her phone then rings and she answers it, “Oh no! An emergency.. I’ll be right there” Turning to you, she says, “Ok Joe I have an emergency to tend to, please hold the fort here. You’ll be fine..” Running to her jeep, she hops in it and drives off at high speed. You sigh and look at Shiftry who simply shrugs at you as you sit and wait for her to return. Out of the corner of your eye you notice a plant sprouting through the surface of the lake, it has a small flower on the top and what looks like a berry is inside the bloom. What will you do?</span><br />

<b>P/Arts:</b> Nidoqueen stomped her feet against the ground as Necross nodded at your attacks and moved back to full height. Letting out a roar, he lashed out his tail and knocked the Poison type into the air, knocking the wind out of her. As she flies through the air, Necross turns his head to the sky and opens his mouth wide. Threads of dark energy poured into his mouth forming an orb which grew and grew with energy the more Necross focused on charging it. The finished attack was bigger than Necross’ head and then he turned his head back down and shot the orb right at Nidoqueen. The Shadow Ball collided with her stomach and dealt huge damage. She landed on the ground, creating a crater, KO’ed. *Level-up for Necross* With a roar of triumph, Necross smirks as you look about. The area in which you are standing is completely demolished. And through the clear patch you can see another trainer, with a shining Minun standing over a KO’ed Pikachu. What will you do?<br />
<br />
<b>Skrusti:</b> Cid nods and his ears and tail glow an intense white before a bright Flash of light fills this area of the Emerald Forest. You uncover your eyes to see Pikachu on the ground, holding her eyes in pain, shrieking “CHUU!” She then begins to crackle with immense electric energy, and it is launched in all directions; a Thunder attack. Cid is caught by a stray bolt and is launched into a bush. Pikachu uses this time to try to recover her eyesight, but can only see blurs now. Cid emerges from the bush, with some leaves and twigs stuck to him. He then holds his fists in the air, one filling with Ice energy and the other filling with normal energy. He then rushes towards Pikachu and leaps into the air above her and does a diving like motion, with both fists forward. He slams into her, and the two energies combine and shards of ice and bolts of energy fly everywhere. A cloud of dust forms as Cid jumps back in front of you, panting heavily. The cloud of dust diminishes and Pikachu is laid there KO’ed. ** Level-up for Cid ** What will you do?<br />
<br />
<b>Dark Scizor:</b> Enma looked to you and listened intently, and then closed his eyes to think, whilst tapping his foot. Opening them once more, he looked to the Izumi, who glowed blue at his presence and he nodded. Fixing his eyes on you, he begins to speak, “That Mankey used to live alongside myself and my tribe of Fighting pokemon deep in this forest. She was born with the ability to sense a regal Fighting pokemon. A peculiar ability, I know. But she used to be part of the process of selecting those who would eventually lead our tribe.” You nod and Enma’s brow then furrows and he gasps, “no.. we’re under attack I must go..” He then faded out of sight and where he was stood, are the words, “Enma! The Psychic types are attacking you have to come back!” Izumi then awoke and turned to Alice, who had also come round. Izumi then turned to the forest and began to glow again. What will you decide to do?<br />
<br />
<b>Joshua:</b> As Tessie grew in size, she became a majestic Arcanine, evening the odds against the legendary Entei. Narius looks to you and grins, “How did I meet Entei, you ask?” He then begins to laugh, “I pursued him for years, and developed a machine which would capture him without fail. I then tamed the beast for years, trying to gain at least a shred of it’s respect. And what did I get? Nothing but a chunk of flesh bitten from my arm.” Narius then took a deep breath and stated, “But then I implanted an obedience chip which allows me complete control over it. Let me show you..” Narius then shouted to Entei, “Bite attack!” Entei began to sprint towards Tessie, who disappeared in a magnificent display of speed, appearing behind the volcano pokemon, and smashing into him, knocking it down. Tessie is then engulfed with flames as she does a Flame Wheel and Take Down combination attack and sprints towards Entei, who leaps above her and drops down and Stomps on her head, totally taking her by surprise, knocking her to the ground. Entei then lands gracefully on the ground opposite her and its eyes glow a red, the Leer intimidating Tessie, who whimpers gently. Narius laughs out loud and then calls out his next attacks, “Entei, summon a Sunny Day and then use Hidden Power, followed by a nice Fire Spin. Lets trap that Arcanine and restrict her abilities..” What will you do?</span><br />

<span style="color: SeaGreen"><u>Jade Swamp: (Please reply in <b>SeaGreen</b>)</u><br />
<br />
<b>Latias10:</b> As you chisel ‘Wooper’ into the statue, the door began to shake and it opened slowly .. revealing the dark room beyond. Shimmer follows you as you walk in and look about, seems theres noone here. Until a bone smacked Shimmer across the head, and sent her tumbling to the ground. She gets up and looks about, clamping her claws together. You look for the origin also and it seems your questions are answered as a Marowak lands on the ground in front of you. It lifts it’s hand in the air and catches its bone as it flies towards him. The room then lights up and you find yourself in a sort of colleseum with people and pokemon cheering you on and some people cheering Marowak. At the top of the room there is a Quagsire, it looks at you cooly and then says, “Prove your strength Catherine! Please this eager crowd..” Without a second thought, Marowak speeds towards Shimmer to hit her with a Bone Club. You jump back to safety to avoid being hit. What will you do?</span><br />

<span style="color: DarkRed"><u>Ruby Mountain: (Please reply in <b>DarkRed</b>)</u><br />
<br />
<b>Sasuke-san:</b> Deciding to go to Ruby Mountain, you set off in the direction of the looming destination. As you approach the foot of the mountain, a thick mist covers the area and you struggle to see what’s happening, only being able to see about 4 foot in front of you. Regardless, you continue on and you begin to climb the mountain, the slope isn’t yet too steep. After about 20 minutes of climbing, the mist thickens and you suddenly bounce off something and land on your backside. A dark shadow becomes visible in the mist and you decide to see what it is. Placing your hand on the shadow, its smooth, hard and round. Getting a bit closer, you place your ear against the surface and you hear movements coming from inside whatever it is. Ino squeaks quietly, her delicate ears being able to pick up on the sounds. She looks at you worriedly and then waits to see what you’ll do. The mist is very thick and seems to be coming from somewhere higher than the object you’ve come across. What will you do<br />

<b>Lonely Wanderer:</b> Cryseye shook her head as you gave out your attacks, trying to make sense of them. Suddenly, her fist ignites with fire energy and she rushes towards Zubat and uppercuts her with a nice Fire Punch, causing the bat to screech in pain, her wing badly burnt. Cryseye then gets a tad confused .. “Astonish swipes?” She thinks to herself but settles for a Nightshade, which smacks into Zubat, causing moderate damage. Zubat then rushes in for a quick bite attack and causes Cryseye some bad pain, but this pain also helps her to feel less confused. Cryseye then flinches as the Poison takes its toll, depleting some health. What will you do? </span></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DarkRed">Andrea was able to breathe again after Cryseye had understood some of her commands; although she didn't carry out the orders of Astonish and Fury Swipes, she replaced it with a nice Night Shade that had decreased Zubat's health by a considerable amount. However, Andrea couldn't help but gritting her teeth as Cryseye took the pain from the poison earlier, so she knew that she should finish the battle soon enough, or else...<br />
<br />
&quot;Cryseye, launch an <b>Ice Punch</b> on the Zubat to deal good damage!&quot; Andrea commanded her Sableye. &quot;Afterwards, use another <b>Night Shade</b> to see if we can finish off the Zubat. If it doesn't faint by then, finish it off with a <b>Fury Swipes</b>!&quot;</span><br />

<b>To my group:</b> I apologize for not putting up updates; to tell you the truth, I only just finished one update, and concerning school IRL, it might be a while before I post them up. However, I will try to get them up ASAP, and if my week can finish off with some good moods, I might post them this weekend, but otherwise next week.</span></div>

<b>Stacey</b><br />
<br />
Lucius lets out a small cackle as he opens his mouth and somehow spits a white-hot ball of fire towards Pinsir, who holds out one claw, as if to say &quot;stop!&quot; to the attack. Seconds before it hits, the <b>WILL-O-WISP</b> bursts apart and dissipates. With a barking laugh, the Pinsir launches itself through the air, and seconds before it hits Lucius, Pinsir disappears with a sharp crack, and a faint smell of brimstone lingers in the area. A split-second after disappearing, Pinsir reappears above Lucius hanging from a branch by its feet, and it slams its fist into Lucius, sending him spinning away.<br />
<br />
WIth an angry cry, Lucius rights hisself before shooting twin black thunderbolts at the bug, striking it in the chest. Without missing a beat, the Pinsir drops to the ground quicker than your eye can follow, and without warning, it leaps at Lucius, plunging a claw deep into his body. Crying out in pain, Lucius's form constricts and writhes until the rest of Pinsir passes through. When he hits the ground, Pinsir slowly stands up, clutching something to him tightly. He extends the claws that hit Lucius first, and a grin forms on its bug-features. A cloth flutters about in a light wind - Lucius's Spell Tag!<br />
<br />
&quot;A lovely little trinket, I have stolen for myself. This thing should bring me lots of wealth!&quot; The Pinsir cackles again. &quot;And by wealth, I mean power! For you see, I am a special, very special, Shaman of my people...&quot; Lucius's Spell Tag, now in the Pinsir's claws, begins to glow, as does Pinsir. Lucius lets out a small gasp as a purple line of energy flows from him to the Spell Tag, and from the Spell Tag to Pinsir. After quite a few seconds, Lucius slumps down a little bit, and Pinsir tosses the Spell Tag aside, flexing. &quot;Ghost Pokemon are quite fun...&quot; It rasps, before throwing both of its arms in front of it. In between its two hands, a small black and purple ball of energy begins to form, purple lightning arcing through it...and Lucius looks kind of weary!<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: royalblue">There was a moment of peace, everything seemed to become still and silent as if the forest gave heed to the upcoming battle. It only lasted a moment before the natural noises returned along with a happy cackle from Lucius. He fires out his Will-o-Wisp, the purple flames speeding towards the Pinsir who meerly held out his hand. Momented before the attack would strike the flames disappeared, the attack nullified. Stacey and Lucius looked shocked, and saw the Pinsir suddenly move into action, speeding towards them before disappearing with a loud crack. The two were left confused more than anything before the bug reappeared above them and slammed a fist into the Shuppet sending him spiraling to the ground. Stacey leapt to the side to avoid being struck, almost smacking into a tree in the process. <br />
<br />
Lucius cried out angrily at having being taken by surprise and retaliated with a Nightshade that arced out and struck the Pinsir in its chest with a crack, like the sound of a whip striking flesh. The Pinsir unfazed by the attack bent down to the ground before lunging at Lucius. It passed right through his body and came to a stop the other side holding on to a piece of fabric that fluttered in the wind. Lucius growled menacingly, he was the one who stole from others not the other way around. <br />
<br />
&quot;A lovely little trinket, I have stolen for myself. This thing should bring me lots of wealth!&quot; The Pinsir cackles again. &quot;And by wealth, I mean power! For you see, I am a special, very special, Shaman of my people...&quot; the Pinsir intoned before the Spell Tag began to glow. Lucius gave a gasp and bent over in pain as a purple aura surrounded him, a line of the energy arcing out and connecting to the spell tag and finally to Pinsir. Stacey yelled at him to stop, not bearing to see her pokemon in such pain. After what seemed like forever the energy dissipated and Lucius slumped to the ground breathing heavily. The Pinsir tossed the Spell Tag to the ground and Stacey growled at the bug, infuriated by the act. <br />
<br />
Ghost Pokemon are quite fun...&quot; The Pinsir rasped before holding its arms in front of it, a small ball of purple energy formed at the tips and grew steadily in size, gold energy joining in the swirling vortex. Stacey looked to Lucius who despite his condition was glaring at the Pinsir with such hate. His eyes leapt across to his discarded Spell Tag, something very precious to him, it had been treated with such disrespect. He floated upwards and Stacey looked to him with worry evident in her dark blue eyes. His eyes flashed a deep red as if he had summoned a great amount of energy in his rage. Stacey backed off, wary of her pokemon in his rage. Lucius 's body shook and he gave a loud screech before his form was consumed with light. The bright white light reached out to the darkest corners of the forest, illuminating them. The Shuppet's body grew in size, arms and leg forming. When the light disappeared, Lucius's had grown in size, his body now a more bluish grey than purple. He turned to Stacey looking pretty shocked before cackling loudly, in a voice that was deeper than before. Her Shuppet had evolved right in the heat of battle. Her Banette now seemed extremely happy with this occurance and had forgotten about his opponant. Stacey happily embraced her pokemon before looking over to see the Pinisr with a large Shadowball in front of it. Lucius cast an eye to him and glared once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;We've been given a second chance Lucius, lets not waste it.&quot; Lucius acting more seriously than he ever had nodded his head and faced his opponant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait for the Pinsir to release the Shadowball, wait until it is close to you then dodge and strike with <b>Faint Attack</b>, we don't want to give it time to redirect its attack. Then whilst you're so close to it <b>Screech</b> loudly to cause it some pain and finally release a fast <b>Hidden Power</b>, rip it to shreds.&quot; Stacey said with Malice. Lucius's gaze hardened as he concentrated on the task ahead</span></div>
