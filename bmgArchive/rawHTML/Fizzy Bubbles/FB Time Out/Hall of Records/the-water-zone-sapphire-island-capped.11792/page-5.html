</u><b>Joshua:</b> As Tessie grew in size, she became a majestic Arcanine, evening the odds against the legendary Entei. Narius looks to you and grins, “How did I meet Entei, you ask?” He then begins to laugh, “I pursued him for years, and developed a machine which would capture him without fail. I then tamed the beast for years, trying to gain at least a shred of it’s respect. And what did I get? Nothing but a chunk of flesh bitten from my arm.” Narius then took a deep breath and stated, “But then I implanted an obedience chip which allows me complete control over it. Let me show you..” Narius then shouted to Entei, “Bite attack!” Entei began to sprint towards Tessie, who disappeared in a magnificent display of speed, appearing behind the volcano pokemon, and smashing into him, knocking it down. Tessie is then engulfed with flames as she does a Flame Wheel and Take Down combination attack and sprints towards Entei, who leaps above her and drops down and Stomps on her head, totally taking her by surprise, knocking her to the ground. Entei then lands gracefully on the ground opposite her and its eyes glow a red, the Leer intimidating Tessie, who whimpers gently. Narius laughs out loud and then calls out his next attacks, “Entei, summon a Sunny Day and then use Hidden Power, followed by a nice Fire Spin. Lets trap that Arcanine and restrict her abilities..” What will you do?</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: Lime">Joshua didn't even bother to hide the disgust he was feeling. &quot;You enslaved Entei with machines! You vile creature! All Pokemon should be given the chance to have their trainer's earn their respect and power, not enslaved to some chip in their brain! You will see, how a bonded Pokemon fights, as compared to your brainwashed slave Narius!&quot;<br />
<br />
Joshua turns to Tessie, who is panting heavily from the Stomp attack from Entei. &quot;Tessie, I have faith in you. I know you have the power to defeat Entei, and when you do, Narius will fall. Now, Dragonbreath while Entei is summoning a Sunny Day. Dodge the Hidden Power as best you can, then use Extremespeed to dodge the Fire Spin and strike Entei. Wrap this round up with a Body Slam!&quot;</span></div>

Well some have called me Psyduck, others call me Kratos.. Call me what you will. As for a tour, of course. It’d be my pleasure to show you my home.” Kratos then began to waddle across the bank and you follow him, and he points out the major points of interest, such as where he bathes, the stone shaped like a Lotad and the last one is the statue of Milotic, who the pokemon of Lapis Lake ‘worship’ according to Kratos. As you approach the block on which it is meant to stand and in its place .. Is a toilet roll and some sticks. Krato’s bill drops to the ground as he begins to run about in a panic. “Itsgoneitsgoneitsgone!” he screams in your mind and you hold your ears as his panicstricken tone echos in your head.

Stop!&quot; he called out, as they ran after him. &quot;Scurvy, you might not have been in that many battles, but I need your help, okay?&quot; His aipom nodded and Gary continued. &quot;Alright, run up to them and use Beat Up, so the shadows of your team mates block them in a circle!&quot; Scurvy chanted, &quot;ARRR!&quot; and jumped off of Gary's shoulder, running ahead.</span></div>

<b>Joe:</b> Ditto struggled to get itself back onto its feet, and so could not dodge Shiftry’s Quick Attack, which smacked the blob of transforming gloop into the Lake. With a big splash, the Ditto began to sink, already KO’ed *Level up for Shiftry*. Ludicolo stopped as his partner disappeared under the lakes waters and with a loud, “LUDI COLO!” he ran as fast as he could into the lake and submerged. Joy sighed in relief and turned to you, “We must be careful, lord only knows whats going on under those waters” Ivy pants heavily, due to all she energy she used and Joy smiles to her companion, “You’re very tired. Take a rest” Nodding, Ivy is withdrawn into her Pokeball. Nurse Joy then walks to the bank and peers into the water, and in the center of the lake, bubbles begin to form. Her phone then rings and she answers it, “Oh no! An emergency.. I’ll be right there” Turning to you, she says, “Ok Joe I have an emergency to tend to, please hold the fort here. You’ll be fine..” Running to her jeep, she hops in it and drives off at high speed. You sigh and look at Shiftry who simply shrugs at you as you sit and wait for her to return. Out of the corner of your eye you notice a plant sprouting through the surface of the lake, it has a small flower on the top and what looks like a berry is inside the bloom. What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: cyan"><span style="font-size: 9px">As Nurse Joy drove off to tend to the emergency, Joe turned to Shiftry and watched him shrug, before sitting. As he waited, Joe looked over to the lake and saw the strangest thing.....well, after what he'd already seen lately, it wasn't exactly the <i>strangest</i> thing. He looked at Shiftry, and nodded over to the little flower, and Shiftry suddenly stood up, and walked over to the edge of the lake. <br />
&quot;Well, you're not going in their to get it, you'll probably end up drowning or something,&quot; said Joe, as he took out a Pokeball. He threw it to the ground, and Zora popped out, Joe's Marshtomp. &quot;Marshtomp, we need to get over to that berry flower thing. I don't know why we need to, but something's telling me it could be important to progressing.&quot; Shiftry and Marshtomp stared at him, blankly, before both of them slapped his face. &quot;Ouch. Meanie Bears,&quot; he said, before pointing at the flower, and waiting for Marshtomp to go investigate.</span></span></div>

<b>Politically Incorrect:</b> “Clever choice Stephen” Glacia said cooly as she eyed Houndour. Jynx winked at Houndour and then wiggled her hips a little. Houndour steps back, a bit freaked out. Glacia then laughs quietly and then stops as Houndour begins to respond to your attack orders. Her eyes glow an intense red as Jynx freezes on the spot, intimidated by the Doomdog. Opening her mouth, Houndour then charges some fire energy and then sends a double barrage of Embers, which pelt Jynx head on, causing a good deal of damage. The Leer wearing off, Jynx’s expression changes to that of a pissed-off mother and she clenches her fists and leaps backwards onto the lake, her psychic powers keeping her stood on the surface. “Now Jynx.. Psychic attack, you know what to do!” Glacia commands. <br />
<br />
Moving her hands about, Jynx uses Psychic to manipulate the water into a dragon shape and sends it flying towards Houndour, who tries her best to dodge but is hit by the majority of it and is sent flying across the ground. Getting up with a little whimper, Houndour stand before Jynx who makes her way back onto the bank. “Lovely Kiss then Powder Snow!” Glacia states as Jynx winks and then pouts her lips, sending some small hearts towards Houndour and then prepares to use Powder Snow. What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: Cyan">Stephen smiles, almost halfheartedly, at the results of the first round. &quot;Great job, Houndour!&quot; he exclaims, and rightly so, as Houndour completed her first round attacks flawlessly, only being taken advantage of by the opponent's psychic skills, as well as a apparent distinct level advantage. However, Stephen still has confidence in the small dog, knowing that she'll be able to pull off a victory in her first battle.<br />
<br />
However, as Stephen quickly runs ideas through his head as to how to counter his opponent's plans for attack, he realizes that he doesn't have much of a variety of choices. However, he shakes his head, and looks upwards at the clouds, hoping that his strategy would work for this round, at the very least.<br />
<br />
&quot;Houndour, quickly, use a Howl to boost your attacking power, and hopefully that'll give you enough of a boosted state of mind in order to overcome the Lovely Kiss attack! And then, when it uses a Powder Snow, quickly heat it up with an Ember to avoid its damage! Follow up with another Ember for good measure, and hopefully for some damage as well!&quot;</span></div>

Opening them once more, he looked to the Izumi, who glowed blue at his presence and he nodded. Fixing his eyes on you, he begins to speak, “That Mankey used to live alongside myself and my tribe of Fighting pokemon deep in this forest. She was born with the ability to sense a regal Fighting pokemon. A peculiar ability, I know. But she used to be part of the process of selecting those who would eventually lead our tribe.” You nod and Enma’s brow then furrows and he gasps, “no.. we’re under attack I must go..” He then faded out of sight and where he was stood, are the words, “Enma!

</blockquote><span style="color: LimeGreen">Saturn wasn´t surprised by the answer of the fighting Pokémon. After watching too much TV in the past, he realized that those things were common. The only thing that he didn´t expected was the attack of the psychic Pokémon. Pokémon of those types were natural enemies. Fighting types used the power of the fist while psychic types used the power of the brain. He knew that his duty was to stop the war. He thought that if there was a king in the fighting tribe, there should be one in the psychic tribe too. Perhaps if he defeated that leader, the war could stop. Saturn headed to the battle. It was time to make his way to the psychic leader, if there was one. He knew that if he was wrong, he was going to make the things worse but it was a risk that he decided to take.</span></div>

Your little Trapinch buddy looks up at you, and then at the other Trapinch. With a grunt, Validus stands still while you climb onto his head, and begins to prepare to toss you up. Krabu manages to get a clawful of skin and shirt, helping drag you backwards so you can get out of the hole. Wincing, you sigh in relief as the orange-red crab lets you go, and scuttles forward to stare at his master.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, down in the hole, Validus and Trapinch are having a staring contest, both sets of beady black eyes staring into each other. Neither move, and neither blink. You watch them for awhile, before Trapinch bows its huge head to Validus, and backs away into the sand, disappearing from sight. Validus looks up at you, and then also disappears into the sand, but thankfully reappears next to you seconds later as it digs through the sand.<br />
<br />
You suddenly find yourself sitting on the side of the hole still holding the native woman, Krabu staring at her unconcious form with Validus at your side. What will you do?</span>

&quot;Great job Validus I knew I could count on you. I don't really understand what you did, but you sure had that other Trapinch digging. Now... once again this woman is unconscious. Boy... she really needs to learn how to watch out and be more attentive to her environment. You would think she would know that since she's a native...&quot; Thed slowly creeped away from Krabu who was starting to foam at the mouth again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sheesh... it's the truth Krabu and you know it. Well there's really nothing I can do because she doesn't trust me to begin with. Oh well Validus let's just take a rest here and wait for her to wake up.&quot; &quot;Traaaa...&quot; Validus happily said as he climbed atop the now laying down Thed and made himself comfortable.</span></div>

Arnoldii jumps into action, staring at the Krabby fiercely, he then begins to shake and wave his leaves forward in a firm motion, this action sends a quick fury of green straight at the charging crab Pokemon. The Krabby falls over backwards, its legs spread out in several directions, the Pokemon winces in pain slightly as Arnoldii then focuses really hard on him, making the Krabby twitch as Arnoldii Absorbs some of his opponent’s health. Krabby slowly gets up, his little legs shaking slightly as he then gives Arnoldii a powerful intimidating stare, looks like Leer attack. Krabby then giggles as it dances around strangely in a circle, raising its attack greatly as it continues up the funky dance of swords, or well Swords Dance. Krabby then sharpens his claw while stretching it out toward Arnoldii, he then begins to flick sand in every direction, looks like Mud Slap. However Arnoldii being a grass type is hardly affected by the attack.<br />

Alexis smiles taking the form off you and then walking into the centre of the stage, you notice they have finally finished setting up. Three stands are situated at the far right of the stage as three people sit down in each one, people begin to sit in the audience area, and joining them you sit on the hard dusty ground awaiting the start of the contest. All kinds of people have joined you in the audience, native villagers, tourists and travellers, some holding their Pokeballs tightly obviously entering and feeling nervous about it. Alexis coughs through the microphone making everyone’s heads turn in her direction, she smiles blissfully as she waves her hands as a signal for the contest is about to start. “Now first things first, welcome everyone to the Sapphire Village Pokemon Contest,” She shouts as loud as possible as people start cheering and whistling in the crowd’s eagerly. She then points at the three judges and holds her microphone tightly in hand. “Now for our judges, our first judge is none other than the Devon Settlements very own Nurse Joy; number two is Ichigo Summers Devon’s top linguist and our third is a village named Zam-Zil-Zoo-Zug who can speak English the best of anyone here!” As she says it she points to each judge in turn, she then walks to the back centre of the stage next to the judges ready to start the appeal rounds.<br />
<br />
“Our first coordinator is the very leader of the Sapphire Village Tribe, known as ‘The Blade’, and he shall be using his Sneasel! The stage is yours, now its time to wow us!” Alexis walks off back to the back of the stage next to the judges as a tall clearly in great shape but not overly muscular in looks anyway walks onto the stage, he has fine green eyes, tanned skin, sandals on his feet and a cloth type piece covering his low body. He holds up a Pokeball and smiles. “Sneasel, show your stuff!” he shouts his voice deep, well he is a pretty matured adult, he tosses the red and white sphere into the air, then lid flips open and a white light hits the ground taking form of a Sneasel. It has two long claw hands, two black piercing eyes and a dark grey type of skin, you notice its standing on one foot as it spins and then jumps into the air. <br />
<br />
“Wow what an entrance!” Alexis exclaims as Sneasel during its jump freezes the stage with a blue and white wind, Icy Wind attack obviously.<br />
<br />
“Icy Wind, then Swift, and finish with Calm Mind then Slash!” Blade commands as Sneasel compiles as it fires an array of small shiny stars at the icy, making it chip off and fly into the air. After all the ice is in the air it begins to focus, calming all its muscles and targeting its mind to one purpose only, it’s next attack. Sneasel jumps and Slashes every last bit of ice into tiny little pieces, each one falling to the ground slowly and majestically creating a strange silvering, icy blue kind of light effect around the stage. Alexis claps as all three judges hold up a board with a score out of ten on it, Joy’s says “9.1”, Ichigo’s says “9.0” and Zam’s says “8.9”. <br />
<br />
“Leaving him with a grand total of twenty seven!” she shouts as Blade bows and leaves the stage return Sneasel after muttering a thank you to his loyal Pokemon friend. After seeing some more appeals, none as beautiful or as point scoring than Blade’s you finally find it’s your turn to compete. “Now it’s time for a rookie coordinator Haku, and his Corsola to wow us with their skills, to finish of the appeal round!” She says happily as you walk onto the stage, the whole crowd staring at you, their eyes watching your every move, Alexis nods at you and sticks a thumb up as a sign of good luck, she opens her mouth wide ready to shout through the microphone, as she does you look over into the audience and see Blade looking on eagerly wondering if you can beat his score. Alexis finally speaks through it and you hear each of her words very clearly as the audience’s gaze falls back on you again.<br />
<br />
“Now, Haku the stage is yours!”<br />
<br />
What will you do now?<br />

Ready to take on the full experience of the Sapphire Village tribe you and Retsu walk as fast as possible down the path so you can get there faster. You both look in awe as you arrive to the village to see shanty type houses and such in every direction, worth happy smiling villagers walking around holding various Pokemon; most of the people look in very good shape and others in tune with their Pokemon. As for clothes the men wear something around their lower halves appearing to be made of cloth, the girls wear a long sort of dress to cover their bodies. “Traveller!” a voice cries out making you turn around swiftly, you notice an old sort of man running toward you; he has grey hair but has fading green eyes as well as him being shorter than you. In his right hand he is holding a walking stick and in his left hand he is holding a strange coloured Pokeball, the top is gold and the bottom is silver with a strange pattern of symbols on it, kind of like hieroglyphs but not. The old man smiles at you and nods approvingly before putting his Pokeball under the strange cloth cloak he is wearing. “Perfect, young lady may I please ask you of a favour?” he asks in a sort of strange accent, he clearly on just learnt English lately.<br />
<br />
“Oh I am sorry, I’m one of the three village elders, they call me Jeremiah, I don’t know why though. Well anyway I’m in the need of some assistance. You see many years ago the Pokégods reigned down from the heavens and fought a terrible war against an ancient evil, and when they won these ‘Pokegods’ locked themselves away as well as the evil. But my problem is…” he explains his voice trailing off; he coughs then looks back at you and smiles. “Oh where was I? Yes well at the Temple Grounds and well I need a pure hearted foreigner to break the seal of the Pokegod Regirock, please will you help me?” he asks his eyes full of hope and faith. He then looks at Retsu and pats him on the head gently and nods again one last time before looking back at you and smiling.<br />
<br />
“So will you help me?”<br />
<br />
What will you do now?</span><br />

Sleepy creates a ghostly purple aura around himself, one long streak of the strange light moves swiftly and directly at the Aipom. The light hits the Aipom’s chest making its eyes open straight away, of course causing damage, however waking it up. The Aipom jumps at you, his tail glowing and becoming solid in form, Sleep’s fist turns yellow and electrical pulses thrive over it, he punches the air as Aipom’s tail come into contact with the charged up fist causing a micro explosion, however forceful enough to send Aipom and Sleepy flying into trees. The Aipom gets back up, looking madder than ever as it charges at Sleepy who is still recovering from the tree smashing, Aipom stops right in front of the lying down Sleepy and giggles. Aipom suddenly begins scratching like mad across Sleepy’s face, Sleepy jumps up into and air and then begins scratching Aipom back. Both Pokemon fight scratching each other violently until the Aipom jumps back, however still ready for a fight.<br />

Drift gets struck by the confuse wave, you firmly holding your yellow flute to cure it if worse comes to worse, Sonia stares at your flute and then reaches into her pocket bringing out a much smaller flute than yours, but its colour is a strange sky blue colour while yours is yellow, of course. Drift then fires a large amount of stars into the air before it, then sending out a cold blast of air freezing each one and propelling them toward Tentacool, causing a lot of damage. You cheer at the fact your combination move was a success; however Sonia then begins to play her flute. A strange beautiful melody plays, making Drift yawn and start spinning around, the same as Tentacool. “Ha, you’re a fool. This is a Daze Flute, its beautiful music can send any Pokemon into a confused daze, so now its time to finish you off!” She shouts as she then starts shouting at Tentacool who suddenly snaps out of it and looks eager to battle. “Get it now, Poison Sting!”<br />

You and Sonso sink further into the red water, no noise since all the Pokemon have been taken out due to Joy. You look around, nothing but an endless supply of the tainted water everywhere, of course and Sonso who seems happy in his current surroundings. Sonso then begins to splash as you spin in his direction noticing a small Marill swimming away from you swiftly. The small blue spherical Pokemon with the zigzagy tail with a red sphere on the end swims away in fright, obviously in search of protection from the other Marill, you and Sonso swim after it, each second it getting a little further away but you getting a little be further toward it, the Marill then stops and screams “MARILL!” at the top of its lungs, another Marill appears in front of it from the bottom of the river. This one is clearly an older sibling or something since its much bigger than the other one. The big Marill taps the smaller one away slightly so its out of the battle zone, then it fires a long stream of see through bubbles directly at you, each one hitting you in the chest, hard. You stagger back slightly and Sonso nods before swimming in front of you. Looks like a Pokemon battle, awesomeness. The younger Marill then nods at the older one, the older one just turns around and starts talking in Marill speak, unable to hear exactly what its saying you just float their. The Marill then turns back around and looks ready for some battle action.<br />

Phoenix looks at your newly evolved Lanturn in awe, cursing under his breath at the sight of it. You smile as Lanturn jumps out of the water and into the air staring at Cloyster who is smiling evilly at her in return. She then creates an intolerable high pitched sound, Cloyster spins around on the spot in confusion making Phoenix clench his fists and grit his teeth before stomping on the swampy ground and beginning to sink slightly. Poliwag sniffs as a tear runs down its eye, Phoenix picks it up and hugs hit tightly. “Don’t worry we’ll save it, and Cloyster will show this fool!” he yells as the top of his lungs as Poliwag nods and jumps along way onto the ground in front of you, Poliwag then jumps and begins Double Slapping you in the face making you fall backwards and onto the ground. Lanturn then jumps out of the water again and fires a second sphere of electricity. “Cloyster Water Gun now!” he orders as Cloyster fires a large amount of water streams at the sphere, both attacks clash and cause a small explosion knocking both Pokemon back. Poliwag lands on the ground in front of you as the small clouds of dust or something to that effect fade leaving both Lanturn and Cloyster floating completely still in the swamp., Poliwag smiles and then fires a water gun at your face, suddenly you see the water being deflected in all directions by another water gun. You stand up and see Mudkip limping toward both you and Poliwag, Mudkip charges in for a Tackle, both Pokemon fall into the swamp, you run toward the water and see Mudkip and Poliwag sinking swiftly while fighting intensely.<br />
<br />
“Cloyster keep that Lanturn busy with Ice Beam again! I’ll go save Poliwag and Mudkip we have the sapphire but we can’t leave either of them!” he commands as he jumps into the water, you see his figure sinking deeper and deeper into the water until he is no longer in vision. Cloyster snaps out of it and sends an ice cold blast straight at Lanturn, causing quite a bit of damage, but she’s still in this fight. Cloyster then hides back in its shell with Withdraw. Lanturn smiles at you sweetly, with Mudkip, Poliwag and Phoenix gone and Cloyster stopping you from diving down there.<br />

<br />
<b>Tale</b>:&#8203;</div><br />
Ignoring your Cacnea ‘Split’ you begin to walk to Ruby Mountain, quite far away but shouldn’t be too long of a walk really. Time passes pretty fast, you continuing walking with Split trailing behind, after a few more feet you and Split look up, a tall mountain over shadows your head at the top you can snow, rocks and thick black and grey clouds, all up the mountain are jagged rocks, but very thin and dangerous paths swerve there way up the mountain. You notice at first the path is clear and goes up slowly, but about half way up the mountain the path vanishes and then you have to climb for a while then a path reappears nearer the top, as you stand staring in awe Split runs ahead of you and starts walking the path up, you then snap out of it and run after him. Suddenly Split stops as do you, you both look down and notice how high up you are now, of course not yet half way up the mountain you’re still pretty high up. You pivot round and notice a small cave entrance near by, looking back down the mountain you can see the path, the rock, the rainbow water which flows from the top of the mountain and some of the other locations in the Water Zone. A chilling wind blows, making you shiver for a second, the clouds seem to start becoming grey and dark as if a storm is coming. You and Split run into the cave as quick as possible seeking shelter and freedom from the changing weather. Looking around the cave you notice strange red rocks and mud sprawled about in every direction, well not so much mud but red rocks though. The cave walls are also a mix of brown and red rocks, you walk over to the centre and notice a strange nose shaped object sticking out from behind a rock. The nose twitches as a strange Pokemon walks in front of you, you look at it, it has two rock solid feet, two black piercing eyes and a huge red rock nose, it appears to be a Nosepass, but however it looks slightly smaller than that of an ordinary Nosepass.<br />
<br />
“NO! Nosepass come back!” a male voice booms from behind you, you look around and see a man running toward you wearing a long white lab coat. He dives down and grabs the Nosepass, upon hitting the ground he slides a few feet still holding the Nosepass above the ground so it doesn’t get hurt. He stands up; you look at his face noticing his fine blue eyes, ragged brown hair and patches of brown dirt over his face and body (of course he’s wearing things under the lab coat, before you get suspicious <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite7" alt=":p" title="Stick Out Tongue    :p" data-shortname=":p" /> Don't shoot *shot*). He smiles at you wiping some of the dirt away from his face; he holds the Nosepass in one hand and shakes your hand firmly. “Hi, I’m Zane; I’m a Devon Settlement professor. I use Nosepass to check our equipment is running and pointing the right directions as well as checking the Nosepass themselves are right. Plus Nosepass are like one of the most interesting Pokemon in existence, so mysterious and cool, I mean two can’t even look at each other without repelling one another,” he says while chuckling slightly. He places the baby Nosepass on the ground, who begins to sway from side to side until he ends up pointing to the way you just came, Zane frowns and sighs as he picks it up again.<br />
<br />
“This Nosepass is wrong, its newly born they usually have the best directional sense so they are more on key but this one points completely opposite to the others,” he explains as he hugs the Nosepass softly. He clicks his fingers.<br />
<br />
“I got an idea, why don’t you battle this Nosepass, get its senses sharpened, I’ll control it and you can battle it that might sort this little guy out.”<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: cyan">The tainted water seemed to kill every pokemon trapped there, it wasn't a good view, everything seemed to be calm but, in fact, that strange feeling turned into a distress when Felix thought about all the pokemons that lived here and who had lost their homes.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's the matter here&quot; thought Felix looking at the desolated environment. Suddenly he was attacked by a big Marril. &quot;I'm just trying to help you, this water is tainted and can cause you health troubles if you stay here&quot; he shouted to the Marrils but they didn't seem to stop their fighting idea. &quot;I got to make this quickly, I don't want any of them or Sonso to be hurt due to this red water but I have no choice&quot;. Felix looke at Sonso like asking for forgiving, he anyway knew that this was going to be a hard and a painful battle.<br />
<br />
Felix's chest was hurting more now as Sonso came to him and tried to hug Felix. &quot;OK my little friend, I want you to use a Yawn on the big Marril to try to sleep him. If you succes I'll pick up the Marrils and we go out, otherwise, use Curse to make you tougher and more resistant to its attacks and strike him with a Tackle&quot;. Sonso nodded and just stood there, with a expressionless face, waiting for the Marril to make de first move.</span></div>

Arnoldii jumps into action, staring at the Krabby fiercely, he then begins to shake and wave his leaves forward in a firm motion, this action sends a quick fury of green straight at the charging crab Pokemon. The Krabby falls over backwards, its legs spread out in several directions, the Pokemon winces in pain slightly as Arnoldii then focuses really hard on him, making the Krabby twitch as Arnoldii Absorbs some of his opponent’s health. Krabby slowly gets up, his little legs shaking slightly as he then gives Arnoldii a powerful intimidating stare, looks like Leer attack. Krabby then giggles as it dances around strangely in a circle, raising its attack greatly as it continues up the funky dance of swords, or well Swords Dance. Krabby then sharpens his claw while stretching it out toward Arnoldii, he then begins to flick sand in every direction, looks like Mud Slap. However Arnoldii being a grass type is hardly affected by the attack.<br />

<span style="color: Yellow">&quot;Now's the turning point!&quot; Jon thought to himself. &quot;I just thought of a new way for Arnoldii to pull this battle off! Listen up, Arnoldii!&quot; Jon cheered. The timid plant paid close attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Start by using your <b>Sweet Scent</b> to distract Krabby!&quot; Jon spoke. &quot;Then, hit it with one <b>Razor Leaf</b> followed by another <b>Razor Leaf</b>!&quot; Jon ordered. &quot;Now that I've remembered another way for Arnoldii to &quot;attack&quot;, I have a lot more options to choose between!&quot; Jon thought to himself. &quot;That should make things a lot easier.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will obtain that stone!&quot; Jon yelled to himself firmly, posing. &quot;Analysis is the only future for you, mysterious object!&quot; he yelled, as he pulled out his jewler's loupe once again. Arnoldii was a little embarassed to be seen with his overzealous trainer, but tried to push it to the back of his mind.</span></span></div>

</blockquote><b><u>OOC</u></b> - I'm here, big brotha! 8D<br />
<br />
<span style="color: Yellow">&quot;Sapphire Island... It's beautiful, isn't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
The speaker was an adolescent girl who stood on the dock, shading her eyes against the bright sun beating down overhead. Privately she was glad that she had consented to exchange her normal attire for much lighter clothing: denim shorts and jacket over her swimsuit, and sandals. It was far too warm here on the coast to be wearing thick garments. At her side stood a peculiar-looking creature; it was blue and white all over, with jutting horns and spikes, resembling very much a piece of coral. A glistening dewdrop ornament hung from the stubby projection that rose over its eyes, which were but dark oblong jewels, shining in the sun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Corsola!&quot; he agreed, surveying the scene with much approval. Peering down the length of the landing, his trainer spied the long stretch of sand that was known as the <b>Southern Beach</b>. Smiling, she walked along the planks towards the beach, her sandals clacking most satisfyingly against the wood. Her Corsola bounced enthusiastically after her, anticipating some fun where they were heading. As they stepped onto the beach, she stopped to admire the white dunes, extending out from this point in all directions. The smoothness made her want to remove her sandals and run barefoot the length of the beach, just to feel the soft grains run between her toes. (Her innate shyness kept her from attempting such an audacious action, however.) The mild, frothing waves rolled effortlessly over the fine sand, retreating swiftly and leaving dark, sodden patches in their wake. The ocean was calm and blue, mirroring the sky up above, in which several Wingull were circling around, searching the water for glimpses of fish they could manage to snag for their lunch. Jess inhaled deeply, breathing in the salty smell, which filled her body with a pleasant tingling sensation, titillating her entire being.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think, Haruki-chan? Should we go swimming first? Or relax on the beach? I think the others would like to enjoy the sun for a bit as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Corsola seemed eager to jump into waters right away, but was content for the moment to stay close to the shore. He nodded, and then immediately dashed for the water, leaping high and landing with a *SPLASH!* into the ocean. His shining blue form vanished for a moment, leaving but a ring of circles where he had entered the water, and then resurfaced a moment later, a much further distance away from the shore. He yelled in delight, and began swimming in a line back to where his trainer stood, safe upon the sands. She smiled and knelt to give him a pat on the head, then sent him off again to enjoy his play. Standing up again, she watched as he played and splashed about, hugging herself tightly. In truth, she was a little scared to join him. Coming all the way out here, to a public beach, she'd been a little apprehensive about it. All these people... She sighed and shook her head. As long as she could avoid them, she figured she'd be fine.<br />
<br />
Pulling out five Pokéballs, she gave them all a toss into the air, watching them revolve and sparkle as the rays of the sun struck the metallic surface. There was a burst of light, as simultaneously five Pokémon were released: a Delibird, a Wynaut, a Rhyhorn, a Gulpin, and a Zigzagoon. Each expressed their joy to be let out in their own way. Well, most of them, anyway. Custard, the Delibird, immediately squawked in surprise and discomfort, hopping about madly in an attempt to escape the heat of the warm sand. The girl hadn't anticipated this, and stood there feeling foolish, wondering what to do. She didn't want her Delibird missing out on any of the fun. Desparing, she cast about for a solution. Noticeing that the boat she had arrived in was still docked close by, she ran back down to it, leaving behind her group of baffled Pokémon and her poor hot-footed penguin.<br />
<br />
She returned a minute later carrying a large plastic box, which she set down and opened, urging her Delibird to climb inside. He did so, and soon relaxed, cooing as he made himself comfortable inside the ice chest. She smiled, relieved to have that problem taken care of. With the aid of her Rhyhorn, the chest was dragged (because its occupant refused to get out) to a safe spot in the shade, where the girl promptly flopped down onto the sand. She waved her Pokémon off, having decided to simply rest there as she watched her friends play. Her Wynaut and Rhyhorn gazed at her dubiously, knowing their trainer and her habit of avoiding making herself known best. She attempted a reassuring smile at them, and reluctantly they moved off to join the Gulpin and Zigzagoon, who were already out having fun.<br />
<br />
The Wynaut removed his hot scarf, donning a pair of cool shades instead, and gave the cloth a toss back to his trainer, who smiled and caught it, tucking it safely away. He then toddled off to visit other vacationers, anxious to impress some girls with his CHARM. The Rhyhorn whomped closer to the water, in order to keep watch over his charges, and settled himself into the warm sand, which he enjoyed immensely. The Gulpin also traveled around the beach, seeking the friendly person who would share their ice cream cone with him, while the Zigzagoon trotted over to the sea and jumped in, paddling after his blue companion. Jessica smiled to see her friends all having fun, and reclined against the ice chest, content to stay hidden out of sight, and merely watch.</span></span></div>

(Nice name btw, better since I won’t have my word putting I’ve made a typo on Jerichi, since I haven’t added Pokemon names to my word dictionary <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite7" alt=":p" title="Stick Out Tongue    :p" data-shortname=":p" /> Also since it sounds nice XP)<br />

Drift gets struck by the confuse wave, you firmly holding your yellow flute to cure it if worse comes to worse, Sonia stares at your flute and then reaches into her pocket bringing out a much smaller flute than yours, but its colour is a strange sky blue colour while yours is yellow, of course. Drift then fires a large amount of stars into the air before it, then sending out a cold blast of air freezing each one and propelling them toward Tentacool, causing a lot of damage. You cheer at the fact your combination move was a success; however Sonia then begins to play her flute. A strange beautiful melody plays, making Drift yawn and start spinning around, the same as Tentacool. “Ha, you’re a fool. This is a Daze Flute, its beautiful music can send any Pokemon into a confused daze, so now its time to finish you off!” She shouts as she then starts shouting at Tentacool who suddenly snaps out of it and looks eager to battle. “Get it now, Poison Sting!”<br />
<br />
What will you do now?</span><br />

<i>Great,</i> Tetsu thought. <i>A flute that confuses my Pokemon...</i> &quot;Ok, Drift. Listen up.&quot; Tetsu started. He stared at the flute. &quot;I'm gonna try and get you out of the confusion long enough for you to attack. If you can slip out of it long enough, summon some <b>Swift</b> stars, then ram into it with a <b>Pursuit</b>, taking the stars with you.&quot; Tetsu glared at the Daze Flute. &quot;And if you can't do the Pursuit, just fire the stars and try and <b>Sing</b> it to sleep.&quot; Tetsu then put the flute to his lips, ready to play...</span></div>

Sleepy creates a ghostly purple aura around himself, one long streak of the strange light moves swiftly and directly at the Aipom. The light hits the Aipom’s chest making its eyes open straight away, of course causing damage, however waking it up. The Aipom jumps at you, his tail glowing and becoming solid in form, Sleep’s fist turns yellow and electrical pulses thrive over it, he punches the air as Aipom’s tail come into contact with the charged up fist causing a micro explosion, however forceful enough to send Aipom and Sleepy flying into trees. The Aipom gets back up, looking madder than ever as it charges at Sleepy who is still recovering from the tree smashing, Aipom stops right in front of the lying down Sleepy and giggles. Aipom suddenly begins scratching like mad across Sleepy’s face, Sleepy jumps up into and air and then begins scratching Aipom back. Both Pokemon fight scratching each other violently until the Aipom jumps back, however still ready for a fight.<br />

OOC: My Slakoth is now at lv.18, and he evolved into a Vigoroth (duh). However, seeing that the updater is the one who takes care of the evolution talk, i will reply with a Slakoth, and if it isn't much of a problem, could you evolve him right in the beginning of your next update? ^^<br />

<span style="color: Lime">Johnny was very interested in this battle. Both fighters were Jungle Pokemon, and they were both battling in their natural habitat. Plus, they both seemed equally strong, but there could only be one winner...and that will be Sleepy!<br />

She gets up and looks about, clamping her claws together. You look for the origin also and it seems your questions are answered as a Marowak lands on the ground in front of you. It lifts it’s hand in the air and catches its bone as it flies towards him. The room then lights up and you find yourself in a sort of colleseum with people and pokemon cheering you on and some people cheering Marowak. At the top of the room there is a Quagsire, it looks at you cooly and then says, “Prove your strength Catherine! Please this eager crowd..” Without a second thought, Marowak speeds towards Shimmer to hit her with a Bone Club. You jump back to safety to avoid being hit. What will you do?</span>

Catherine had not been exepting that and it seemed Shimmer was not either. In full rage Shimmer got to her feet while clamping her claws together. She then looked around for the attacker for she could strangle it for attacking her. Catherine then noticed the Marowak and then the room lit up. Catherine stared at the people all around and then noticed the Quaqsire. It spoke and before Catherine could think she saw the Marowak charging towards them.

&quot;Shimmer slow down the Marowak with a Bubble Beam. If any bones come your way spin it off with a Swords Dance and power your self up in the procese. If Marowak gets near enough to hit then wack it with a Crabhammer,&quot; Catherine told her crab pokemon.<br />

Shimmer noded as she opened her claws for her first attack. She was hoping that the Marowak would get near enough so she could wack it with all her might and get revenge.</span></div>

Rini takes a deep breath before glowing purple, and soon she spits out five rather large balls of purple sludge. They drift slowly forward, before Trogly and Arkound take potshots at them before the SLUDGE BOMBS can reach their targets with a combined ICY WIND. The now frozen balls thud into the soft loam, leaving some obstacles in the way of the battle. Sakura hops past the now Iced Bombs, and gets hit with an ICE BEAM straight in the stomach, blowing her backwards.<br />
<br />
Trogly performs a leap over the balls and lands next to Rini, unfortunatly with its back turned to Sakura, who bounds forward eagerly, clamping down onto the frog and beginning to STOCKPILE some energy. Rini lets out a rather loud YAWN, small pink bubbles floating from her towards Trogly, popping on impact. Trogly too lets out a yawn, and begins to move drowsily towards Rini with Sakura still attached. Hearing something, Sakura detaches herself from Trogly and turns to find Arkound standing on top of one of the frozen balls. Sakura and Arkound react at the same time, Arkound firing another twin-beam of energy from its eyes, this time purple in colour, and Sakura spits out a bright white beam, evidently having decided to SPIT UP the energy she stockpiled. With a bang, the two attacks collide, sending the combatants flying in every direction.<br />
<br />
Sakura slides down a tree trunk, while Rini picks herself out of a patch of clovers, both looking worse for the wear. The combined HIDDEN POWER and SPIT UP had caused the frozen SLUDGE BOMBS to explode! Arkound is laying on its side about twenty feet away from Trogly, who is amazingly still sleeping. The young man who trained the two looks worried, but awaits his Pokemon to show signs of movement before ordering attacks.<br />
<br />
Your orders?

</blockquote>Kaya flinched as the Bombs exploded and all the pokemon were sent flying in all directions. Sakura smacked a tree and slid down it and Rini was sent hurtling into a patch of clovers, both of them looking badly damaged. However, Arkound and Trogly were too looking the same and Hanson was looking just as worried as her. Trogly was fast asleep despite there being an explosion. Weighing up the situation, Kaya decided on the plan of action.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Rini..Wobble over to Trogly, hold it's mouth open and send a <b>Poison Gas</b> and some <b>Sludge</b> down his throat, that should make it feel a bit uncomfortable.&quot; Rini nodded and Kaya then turned to Sakura, &quot;Ok Sakura, you can do it, I have faith in you.&quot; Sakura screeched quietly, feeling a bit down as a result of being pummeled a bit. &quot;Your first battle is going so well, don't worry. I want you to focus on Arkound. I know it's got ice attacks, but I want you to <b>Wrap</b> it and then release a <b>Sleep Powder</b>. If it resists, fire an <b>Acid</b>&quot; Sakura screeched and prepared for the battle to continue. Kaya did too, hoping they could pull through.</span></div>

<b>Quilava Plush</b>:&#8203;</div><br />
(Note: Before you ask yeah I used legendaries as Pokegods. I Hope that is ok with you and stuff.)<br />
<br />
Ready to take on the full experience of the Sapphire Village tribe you and Retsu walk as fast as possible down the path so you can get there faster. You both look in awe as you arrive to the village to see shanty type houses and such in every direction, worth happy smiling villagers walking around holding various Pokemon; most of the people look in very good shape and others in tune with their Pokemon. As for clothes the men wear something around their lower halves appearing to be made of cloth, the girls wear a long sort of dress to cover their bodies. “Traveller!” a voice cries out making you turn around swiftly, you notice an old sort of man running toward you; he has grey hair but has fading green eyes as well as him being shorter than you. In his right hand he is holding a walking stick and in his left hand he is holding a strange coloured Pokeball, the top is gold and the bottom is silver with a strange pattern of symbols on it, kind of like hieroglyphs but not. The old man smiles at you and nods approvingly before putting his Pokeball under the strange cloth cloak he is wearing. “Perfect, young lady may I please ask you of a favour?” he asks in a sort of strange accent, he clearly on just learnt English lately.<br />
<br />
“Oh I am sorry, I’m one of the three village elders, they call me Jeremiah, I don’t know why though. Well anyway I’m in the need of some assistance. You see many years ago the Pokégods reigned down from the heavens and fought a terrible war against an ancient evil, and when they won these ‘Pokegods’ locked themselves away as well as the evil. But my problem is…” he explains his voice trailing off; he coughs then looks back at you and smiles. “Oh where was I? Yes well at the Temple Grounds and well I need a pure hearted foreigner to break the seal of the Pokegod Regirock, please will you help me?” he asks his eyes full of hope and faith. He then looks at Retsu and pats him on the head gently and nods again one last time before looking back at you and smiling.<br />
<br />
“So will you help me?”<br />
<br />
What will you do now?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px">((OOC: A-OK with me.))</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: RoyalBlue">Awestruck by the surroundings, Rivka wanders through and explores the village thoroughly. &quot;A nice place they have 'ere, eh, Retsu?&quot; She looks downwards to her Nuzleaf, who studies a tall totem pole off to the side. This place definitely lives up to Rivka's expectations, allowing her to get that first-hand view she always wanted... this will definitely help her in her future research.<br />
<br />
&quot;Foreigner!&quot; Stunned by the outcry from behind her, she turns around and notices the old man rushing towards her direction. After a brief look at her surroundings she points to herself and was confirmed to be the one being summoned. She loosens her posture with a small sigh of relief, then smiles as the elder introduces himself and continues talking. Curiousity seizing her, she listens closely, and upon the elder's finish, her eyes light up.<br />
<br />
<i>Ooh, bring it on, </i>Rivka grins at the plan. She didn't consider herself pure of heart... perhaps her modesty kicking in? Well, whatever, she just really wants to do this. &quot;How 'bout it, Retsu?&quot; She calls down to her Nuzleaf, who in turn pauses and then soon nods in agreement. &quot;We'll be glad to help you,&quot; she replies. &quot;My name's Rivka and this here is Retsu. What do we have to do?&quot;</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: darkred">Sasuke stood at the foot of the Ruby Mountain and looked up at the awesome sight. The slope started off gradually, but the further up he looked he could see that the mountain face grew ever steeper, and the mist which surrounded the area grew even thicker. He pulled the strap of his bag back onto his shoulder and began the long traipse uphill. Ino bounced happily from one shoulder to the other, gawping at the splendid view of the Sapphire Islands provided from up on the mountain, until the fog became so thick so as to obscure her vision. She began to sob lightly and hung dejectedly to the back of Sasuke’s neck, as he trudged ever onwards through the mist. <br />
<br />
About twenty minutes had passed before he stopped walking, and began to think they would be better off going back down. He could barely see a few metres in front of him and did not want to be stuck up on the mountain ‘til nightfall. <i>’’If it doesn’t begin to clear in five minutes we’ll turn back,’’</i> he promised Ino, who was by now thoroughly fed up. But as he turned around and set off again he bumped face first into something and stumbled backwards, landing heavily on his bum. Ino bounced off his neck and began to hurtle downhill, but luckily hit a small boulder which stopped her descent. She looked stunned at first but then her eyes began to well with tears and she started to murmur quietly. The noise grew into a fully blown uproar as Ino cried at the top of her voice, which echoed off the mountainside and all around the island, causing Pidgey to flock from their trees. Sasuke stood up and desperately scrambled for the empty pokeball at his belt, but in his haste dropped it to the floor, where it began to bounce down the mountain. He gasped and leapt on top of it, grazing himself badly as he did so, but took the pokeball from underneath him and aimed it at Ino, drawing her inside with a flash of bright red. <br />
<br />
He sighed and lay still on the floor, until he remembered why he had fallen over in the first place. Slowly he turned onto his back, until he was looking up at a looming black shadow, which towered over him through the mist. He stood up cautiously and edged closer, then tentatively reached out a hand to touch whatever it was. It felt hard, yet smooth, and had a curved surface. He followed it around in a complete circle until he stood back where he had started from, then placed both hands on it and pressed his head on to it’s side. He could hear faint and indistinct noises coming from inside, but he could not work out precisely what they were. Unable to find out any more, he decided to continue up the mountain. <br />
<br />
It was noticeably lonelier without any company, so he instinctively reached for Luster’s pokeball. He stopped his hand, and for a change, decided to release his recently caught Totodile. She appeared beside him, her bulky physique visible through the haze, and began to look around. <i>’’Dile!’’</i> she shouted angrily and began to point furiously when she spotted Sasuke, then turned away from him. <i>’’Follow me, Tsunade,’’</i> he ordered, and began to climb upwards. After about ten metres he stopped and looked back, and could just make out her faint figure, stood stubbornly in the same place. He had expected a little respect, having defeated and caught her fair and square, but if she really didn’t want to be his pokemon then he wouldn’t force her, so began to move on again. After a while he heard stones scattering down the slope behind him, and span around rapidly to see Tsunade lying flat on her face. <i>’’TODILE!’’</i> she shouted at him as she jumped up onto her feet with surprise and embarrassment, and picked up a rock, sending it whistling just past Sasuke’s head. He laughed and kept going, with Tsunade reluctantly following just a few metres behind him.</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px">More updates for you. Enjoy.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: LimeGreen"><u>Emerald Forest: (please reply in <b>LimeGreen</b>).</u><br />
<br />
<b>Joshua:</b> Narius looks at you curiously and then laughs again, “I wanted power so I used any means to get it. Admit it Joshua, you’re jealous no? Having such a creature under my control makes me next door to unbeatable!” Entei roars and a bright light emerges from its back, clearing the clouds and beginning to summon a Sunny Day. Tessie takes no time in firing off a barrage of silky green flames, her Dragonbreath engulfing the legendary for good damage. As the flames subside, Entei’s eyes glow white and circles of brown energy emerge, which hit the ground, causing it to shake. Tessie tries to keep her footing but falls to the ground, the Hidden Power of Ground shaking her up for some decent damage. <br />
<br />
As Entei fires the Fire Spin, Tessie disappears into thin air. While Narius and Entei believe shes trapped, you know otherwise as she appears above Entei and Body Slams it for good damage, knocking it flat onto its stomach and knocking the wind out of it. Tessie elegantly lands on the ground, panting slightly. Entei struggles to get up and Narius frowns. “Entei, use Flamethrower, then use Sacred Fire and finish up with Earthquake!” Entei roars before shaking itself, trying to regain its composure. You wonder how Entei learnt a Ho-ohs attack, but dismiss it for now. What will you do?<br />
<br />
<b>Dark Scizor:</b> Deciding to aid the Fighting types, you turn to Alice who calls to Izumi and says, “Okay Izumi, lead us there.. We need to help them!” Izumi nodded and bounces off into the woods and you both follow her through the thickest part of the jungle you’ve ever seen. After a good solid hour of walking, you begin to tire and sit down on a rock. Alice is really tired and she shakes her head. “You guys go ahead, I need time to rest.” You agree and carry on, and you can see fires up ahead behind tall walls of tree trunks. From those fires you notice rainbow coloured rays. Realizing that you’ve stumbled upon the Fighting colony, you step back and then turn to Izumi.<br />
<br />
Izumi looks up to you and glows blue, nodding. You realise that rushing in there could be a mistake and perhaps some strategy is needed to avoid the most bloodshed. What will you decide?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: DarkRed"><u>Ruby Mountain: (please reply in <b>DarkRed</b>)</u><br />
<br />
<b>Sasuke-san:</b> Releasing Tsunade and deciding to carry on past the object you had stumbled upon, you continue on the ascent of the mountain. As you climb, the mist gets thicker and then suddenly it begins to rise into the sky, it stops about 100 feet above you as it begins to Hail. These hailstones are pretty big, and they strike yourself and Tsunade, who begins to shoot Water Guns at them to deflect them away from her. Coincidentally, she sends one in your direction, which cracks you round the head, knocking you out cold…<br />
<br />
When you open your eyes, Tsunade is there looking quite ashamed of herself. Groggily, you sit up and look up the mountain and see a huge egg. It’s blue and is adorned with purple diamonds all the way round. You immediately think it’s the object you found before.. But how did it get up here? You then notice a Sneasel on top of it, smashing it’s claws into the top of the egg trying to break into it. Your knowledge of Sneasel tells you that they steal eggs to eat the contents. Tsunade then calls out loudly to the Sneasel, who looks at you right in the eye as it stands up straight, raising it’s claws above it’s head, and sharply calls “SNEA!” before it’s claws begin to elongate, as if ready for a battle. The top of the egg is cracked, and will cave in if Sneasel continues. How will you react?<br />
<br />
<b>Lonely Wanderer:</b> Cryseye turns to you, and with a seemingly clear head, gives you a thumbs up indicating she understands.

<br />
<b>Faiyaa:</b> Running after the thief, you call out “STOP!” but he continues to run. You then turn to Scurvy and give him a command. He nods, calling “Arr!” as he ran up to the thief, who was slowing down from the tire of the chase. A black aura covers Scurvy as he calls out, and 9 shadows emerge from his small body. Silhouettes of a Typholsion, Cacturne, Queendra, Ampharos, Squirtle, Houndoom, Stantler, Ninjask and Mantine surround the man, who stops, absolutely petrified. Scurvy then completes the circle and shouts “Arr arr!” in triumph. <br />
<br />
When you and Kratos show up, the man is curled up in a ball in the centre of the shadows, sobbing wildly. The bag he was carrying was ripped in the chase and a stone Milotic’s tail is visible. Kratos gasps as the man stutters, “Wh..wh..w..what do you w.w.w.w.want from me?!” What will you do?<br />
<br />
<b>Joe:</b> Releasing Zora to investigate, he looks at you wearily before wading into the water, and slowly makes his way across to the flower. He treads water and peers at it, before noticing 2 berries nestled tightly in it. He turns to look at you and waves his arms to notify you that its something important and he then descends into the water to dislodge the flower. However, a shock awaits him as Ludicolo is stood on the water bed, and the flower has grown out of his back. However, he has not noticed Marshtomp as hes fawning over Ditto who is knocked out cold. Marshtomp resurfaces and swims back to the bank.<br />
<br />
Hopping out of the lake, he approaches you and in a well tried session of charades, and hand gestures you try to figure out what hes seen. What will you do?<br />
<br />
<b>Politically Incorrect:</b> As the heart shaped mass of energy came floating over to Houndour, she sits down and Howls loudly, as a red aura covers her body, raising her attack power and strengthened her mind. The Lovely Kiss struck Houndour on the head, but she manages to keep her mind calm and overcame the effects. Jynx pouted as Houndour stood back on all fours, rolling her shoulders and clawing the ground ready to continue. Jynx, getting more annoyed, blows a Powder Snow out of her mouth, but tinges it with a Water Pulse. As Houndour fires a barrage of Ember, the Water Pulse cancels it out and the combined attack hits Houndour on the leg, partially freezing it over.<br />
<br />
You gasp, and Glacia reads your confusion. “Surprised? My Jynx’s Ice can penetrate even the hottest of creatures..” she then smiled as Jynx began to dance when Houndour fired yet another barrage of Ember. Her unusual dance moves allowed her to dodge most of the attacks, but a stray flame sets her hair alight! Jynx cries out and then dives into the lake in distress before emerging to the surface, glaring at Houndour. Glacia then commands, “Jynx! Mean Look to intimidate that dog. Then fire a Blizzard and finish with Hidden Power!” Jynx nodded as she glared at Houndour, ready to scare her. What will you do?<br />

<br />
<b>Latias10:</b> The crowd cries out your name as you command Shimmer, who clamps her claws and then fires a Bubblebeam right at the oncoming Marowak. It strikes the Ground type in the torso and pushes it back until Marowak begins to spin his bone and places it in front of the attack, effectively cancelling it out. With a grin, Marowak swings his arm back and Shimmer responds by spinning wildly, raising her attack power by a Sword’s Dance. She stops, and her claws are looking sharper as a result but seems confused by the fact Marowak seemingly hadn’t thrown his bone. He moves forwards and Shimmer’s claw glows a bright icy blue as she swings for the pokemon, but is cracked on the back of the head by the bone.<br />
<br />
Shaking herself, Shimmer gets back on her feet and gets even angrier as Marowak catches the bone and smirks, “Marroo..” it murmurs as Shimmer then clamps her claws in response, as if telling the Marowak not to underestimate her. Quagsire claps it’s flappers together and calls, “Wonderful, this will be good!” The crowd cheers for Marowak now, and you feel the need to prove yourself. Marowak then spins about wildly, performing a Sword’s Dance. What will you do?</span></span></div>

<b>Lonely Wanderer:</b> Cryseye turns to you, and with a seemingly clear head, gives you a thumbs up indicating she understands. Clenching her fist tight, it begins to fill with ice energy as she sprints about the cave, avoiding Zubat’s Bite attacks. Picking the perfect time to strike, she launches the fist when Zubat has her back turned and it collides, freezing Zubat’s back, causing it to screech in pain. Cryseye then concentrates as her eyes glow black and she fires a bolt of Nightshade which strikes Zubat again, causing reasonable damage. Zubat falls to the ground, before raising its head and it ‘looks’ in your direction, before pointing at Cryseye with it’s wing before fainting. ** Level-up for Cryseye ** You turn to Cryseye to congratulate her, but shes out cold on the ground, with green toxins spewing from her mouth, seems she had held back the pain she had felt due to the poison.<br />
<br />
The tunnel is completely deserted and the Flash then diminishes, just moments after Cryseye’s collapse. What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: DarkRed"><span style="font-size: 9px"><i>Snap!</i> Andrea cursed her head as the light faded away; despite her witnessing a victory in Cryseye's favor in the battle, she should've known that the Toxic's effects would eventually bring her down. And now, the Flash had faded, leaving Andrea in complete darkness. Andrea sighed, but she knew that two other Pokémon in her team also had the capability that her feminine Sableye obtained. Tossing out a red-and-white orb, the cave was illuminated from the burst of light that appeared for two seconds, but shortly after, the cave became dark again, but not before Andrea felt a slight breeze softly brushing against her hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beau?&quot; A small, fairy-like voice spoke inside the blackness. Andrea grinned, glad that Karasa, her Beautifly, was out of her Pokéball and flying inside the cave. Noticing the darkness inside the cave, Andrea didn't need to command her Beautifly to do a Flash attack, for the black-and-yellow butterfly's wings were soon shrouded in a brillant light, letting Andrea see inside the cave. She soon found Cryseye and the Zubat fainted on the ground, and she whispered an apology and an encouragement to her Sableye before recalling her back in her Pokéball. Andrea turned, ready to leave the cave, but she couldn't help to look over her shoulder at the knocked out Zubat on the ground. Andrea began to wonder if she could capture the Poison/Flying-Type that was at her mercy now, and she turned to look at her Beautifly, whom was awaiting her trainer at the mouth of the cave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shall I catch this Pokémon?&quot; She asked the question to Karasa. Karasa twirled in the air, apparently agreeing with Andrea that she could capture the Zubat if she wanted to. Sighing, Andrea unclipped a red-and-white sphere, not containing any Pokémon within its bounds, and tossed it at the fainted Zubat, hoping that she could catch her first capture. <br />
<br />
<i>Once I do so, I'll leave the cave and go somewhere else...</i>She thought, slowly watching the ball dropping towards her fainted opponent.</span></span></div>
