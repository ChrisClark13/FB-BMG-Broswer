Phoenix looks at your newly evolved Lanturn in awe, cursing under his breath at the sight of it. You smile as Lanturn jumps out of the water and into the air staring at Cloyster who is smiling evilly at her in return. She then creates an intolerable high pitched sound, Cloyster spins around on the spot in confusion making Phoenix clench his fists and grit his teeth before stomping on the swampy ground and beginning to sink slightly. Poliwag sniffs as a tear runs down its eye, Phoenix picks it up and hugs hit tightly. “Don’t worry we’ll save it, and Cloyster will show this fool!” he yells as the top of his lungs as Poliwag nods and jumps along way onto the ground in front of you, Poliwag then jumps and begins Double Slapping you in the face making you fall backwards and onto the ground. Lanturn then jumps out of the water again and fires a second sphere of electricity. “Cloyster Water Gun now!” he orders as Cloyster fires a large amount of water streams at the sphere, both attacks clash and cause a small explosion knocking both Pokemon back. Poliwag lands on the ground in front of you as the small clouds of dust or something to that effect fade leaving both Lanturn and Cloyster floating completely still in the swamp., Poliwag smiles and then fires a water gun at your face, suddenly you see the water being deflected in all directions by another water gun. You stand up and see Mudkip limping toward both you and Poliwag, Mudkip charges in for a Tackle, both Pokemon fall into the swamp, you run toward the water and see Mudkip and Poliwag sinking swiftly while fighting intensely.<br />
<br />
“Cloyster keep that Lanturn busy with Ice Beam again! I’ll go save Poliwag and Mudkip we have the sapphire but we can’t leave either of them!” he commands as he jumps into the water, you see his figure sinking deeper and deeper into the water until he is no longer in vision. Cloyster snaps out of it and sends an ice cold blast straight at Lanturn, causing quite a bit of damage, but she’s still in this fight. Cloyster then hides back in its shell with Withdraw. Lanturn smiles at you sweetly, with Mudkip, Poliwag and Phoenix gone and Cloyster stopping you from diving down there.<br />
<br />
What will you do now?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: seagreen"><span style="font-size: 9px">John looked down into the water as Pheonix, Poliwag and Mudkip took off, and he knew he'd have to get this Cloyster out of the way soon. He thought about how he could beat it, until eventually, it came to him.<br />
&quot;Lanturn, let's kill this thing! Not literally of course, that'd be cruel...okay, let's maim this thing!&quot; shouted John, and Lanturn waited for orders. &quot;Start by using a Spark to do some damage, and follow up with a Supersonic to try and confuse it. After that, finish off with another Spark,&quot; explained John, and Lanturn prepared to attack.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: LimeGreen"><b>P/Arts:</b> Nidoqueen stomped her feet against the ground as Necross nodded at your attacks and moved back to full height. Letting out a roar, he lashed out his tail and knocked the Poison type into the air, knocking the wind out of her. As she flies through the air, Necross turns his head to the sky and opens his mouth wide. Threads of dark energy poured into his mouth forming an orb which grew and grew with energy the more Necross focused on charging it. The finished attack was bigger than Necross’ head and then he turned his head back down and shot the orb right at Nidoqueen. The Shadow Ball collided with her stomach and dealt huge damage. She landed on the ground, creating a crater, KO’ed. *Level-up for Necross* With a roar of triumph, Necross smirks as you look about. The area in which you are standing is completely demolished. And through the clear patch you can see another trainer, with a shining Minun standing over a KO’ed Pikachu. What will you do?</span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: LimeGreen">At the defeat of the Nidoqueen, James grinned readily, already whirling Necross's pokeball in his hand. &quot;Great job,&quot; he called to the steelix, &quot;now that that's over, I quite honestly can't wait to get out of this place... it gives me the creeps. And I've heard good things about the Temple Grounds... I think.&quot; At Necross' stern look, James squirmed uncomfortably. &quot;W-what?&quot;<br />
<br />
The steelix moved its head in the direction of the nidoqueen, &quot;She should be healed. We did provoke the fight.&quot;<br />
<br />
James shook his head after a moment of thought, &quot;Nidoqueen's are particularly violent over offspring... if we healed her, she'd just attack us again.&quot; The boy slumped his shoulders guiltily before raising Necross's pokeball and sighing. &quot;Return, okay?&quot; And in a flash of red light, the steelix had dissapeared from the broken down landscape. Looking regretfully towards the nidoqueen, James spotted something he had not been expecting: another trainer, holding a pokeball over a beaten looking pikachu. Sweatdropping at the fact that another battle could be taking place around the area - he'd fucked the place up pretty bad, after all - he waved to the guy frantically.<br />
<br />
Running over, he called, &quot;You alright?&quot; <br />
<br />
The guy looked confused, and shrugged. &quot;Why wouldn't I be? The name's Jeff.&quot; Holding out his hand, James stared at it warily for a couple of seconds before shaking it quickly, and giving Jeff a look. 'Why wouldn't he be'? The boy had to be nuts, there must of been falling trees everywhere... <br />
<br />
&quot;No reason,&quot; snorted James, spinning a pokeball in his hands idly, tempted to ask for a battle. He then shook the feeling off, reminding himself that this guy had just had problems with a <i>pikachu</i>, so it would hardly be a fair match. The fact that James had also had problems with an electric rodent in the Haunted Mansion was inconsequential. His was mother fuckin' crazy. The shadow that was too large for his body flickered slightly at anyone even thinking that situation, causing the gengar's trainer to cringe. That was definately a humiliating experience for Kage, although he had won by miles in the end.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway...&quot; murmered James, tossing the pokeball he has holding from hand-to-hand, &quot;Me and my pokemon are heading to the Diamond Falls, so... if you wanna follow, it'd be nice to have some company.&quot; The brown haired boy threw the 'ball into the air, which burst into red light, releasing a powerful, elegant skarmory.<br />
<br />
&quot;Caw!&quot; screeched the bird, &quot;Withdraw me, I wish to rest!&quot; The bird then rethought its commands, &quot;Water! I need water!&quot;<br />
<br />
Groaning at the embarassing display, James said quickly, &quot;Amudon, we're heading to Diamond Falls, and I'd really appreciate a lift... er, please?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Diamond Falls?&quot; mused the skarmory, while Jeff snickered off to the side, &quot;Very well - it is a place beffiting of my beauty. Get on, and do not ruffle my feathers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what about me?&quot; protested Jeff indignantly, glaring, &quot;There's not room for both of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Er... sorry, didn't quite think that one through.&quot; However, Amudon had already taken off, &quot;Shit! You're gonna have to hurry, Amudon's a quick flier... see ya later, hopefully!&quot;</span></div>

<b>Skrusti:</b> Cid nods and his ears and tail glow an intense white before a bright Flash of light fills this area of the Emerald Forest. You uncover your eyes to see Pikachu on the ground, holding her eyes in pain, shrieking “CHUU!” She then begins to crackle with immense electric energy, and it is launched in all directions; a Thunder attack. Cid is caught by a stray bolt and is launched into a bush. Pikachu uses this time to try to recover her eyesight, but can only see blurs now. Cid emerges from the bush, with some leaves and twigs stuck to him. He then holds his fists in the air, one filling with Ice energy and the other filling with normal energy. He then rushes towards Pikachu and leaps into the air above her and does a diving like motion, with both fists forward. He slams into her, and the two energies combine and shards of ice and bolts of energy fly everywhere. A cloud of dust forms as Cid jumps back in front of you, panting heavily. The cloud of dust diminishes and Pikachu is laid there KO’ed. ** Level-up for Cid ** What will you do?</span></span>

At the defeat of the Nidoqueen, James grinned readily, already whirling Necross's pokeball in his hand. &quot;Great job,&quot; he called to the steelix, &quot;now that that's over, I quite honestly can't wait to get out of this place... it gives me the creeps. And I've heard good things about the Temple Grounds... I think.&quot; At Necross' stern look, James squirmed uncomfortably. &quot;W-what?&quot;<br />
<br />
The steelix moved its head in the direction of the nidoqueen, &quot;She should be healed. We did provoke the fight.&quot;<br />
<br />
James shook his head after a moment of thought, &quot;Nidoqueen's are particularly violent over offspring... if we healed her, she'd just attack us again.&quot; The boy slumped his shoulders guiltily before raising Necross's pokeball and sighing. &quot;Return, okay?&quot; And in a flash of red light, the steelix had dissapeared from the broken down landscape. Looking regretfully towards the nidoqueen, James spotted something he had not been expecting: another trainer, holding a pokeball over a beaten looking pikachu. Sweatdropping at the fact that another battle could be taking place around the area - he'd fucked the place up pretty bad, after all - he waved to the guy frantically.<br />
<br />
Running over, he called, &quot;You alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
The guy looked confused, and shrugged. &quot;Why wouldn't I be? The name's Jeff.&quot; Holding out his hand, James stared at it warily for a couple of seconds before shaking it quickly, and giving Jeff a look. 'Why wouldn't he be'? The boy had to be nuts, there must of been falling trees everywhere...<br />
<br />
&quot;No reason,&quot; snorted James, spinning a pokeball in his hands idly, tempted to ask for a battle. He then shook the feeling off, reminding himself that this guy had just had problems with a pikachu, so it would hardly be a fair match. The fact that James had also had problems with an electric rodent in the Haunted Mansion was inconsequential. His was mother fuckin' crazy. The shadow that was too large for his body flickered slightly at anyone even thinking that situation, causing the gengar's trainer to cringe. That was definately a humiliating experience for Kage, although he had won by miles in the end.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway...&quot; murmered James, tossing the pokeball he has holding from hand-to-hand, &quot;Me and my pokemon are heading to the Diamond Falls, so... if you wanna follow, it'd be nice to have some company.&quot; The brown haired boy threw the 'ball into the air, which burst into red light, releasing a powerful, elegant skarmory.<br />
<br />
&quot;Caw!&quot; screeched the bird, &quot;Withdraw me, I wish to rest!&quot; The bird then rethought its commands, &quot;Water! I need water!&quot;<br />
<br />
Groaning at the embarassing display, James said quickly, &quot;Amudon, we're heading to Diamond Falls, and I'd really appreciate a lift... er, please?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Diamond Falls?&quot; mused the skarmory, while Jeff snickered off to the side, &quot;Very well - it is a place beffiting of my beauty. Get on, and do not ruffle my feathers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what about me?&quot; protested Jeff indignantly, glaring, &quot;There's not room for both of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Er... sorry, didn't quite think that one through.&quot; However, Amudon had already taken off, &quot;Shit! You're gonna have to hurry, Amudon's a quick flier... see ya later, hopefully!&quot;

</blockquote><span style="color: limegreen">Jeff closes his eyes and shoves his hand over his face as Cid's tail and ears begin to glow. The <b>FLASH</b> of bright light that emanated from the Shiny Minun filtered even through Jeff's defence, causing his eyes to water. When he can finally see clear enough, he notices the Pikachu lying on the ground screaming. Suddenly, sparks crackle to life around the rodent. Before he can utter a cry of warning, Jeff has to dive out of the way as the Pikachu releases a vicious <b>THUNDER</b> attack. With a squeak, Cid flies backwards into the bushes, and the 'Chu takes this time to blink and rub her eyes furiously, hoping to recover eyesight.<br />
<br />
Fortunatly, she was still partly blind, giving Cid ample time to react. He pulls himself from the bushes, leaves and twigs sticking to his body. Shaking himself vigorlously, he holds fists up in a &quot;bring it&quot; pose, before running and leaping into the air, energy forming on both fists. He hits the Pikachu with a crack, sending energy and dust everywhere. When it clears, Cid is standing, panting, over a fainted Pikachu.<br />
<br />
Proud of his accomplishment, Jeff picks Cid's ball from his belt, and with a soft &quot;Return,&quot; calls the Shiny Minun back to its home. With a sigh, Jeff looks down at the Pikachu. If he didn't already have a Raichu, he'd capture this one. Suddenly, the Thunder Ball on his belt began to shake violently. He knew what was going on, and he wanted out. Placing one hand on the ball, he stood there, wondering what to do, until a voice reached his ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;You alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
A young man with brown hair, of an average height, and with brown eyes was running towards him. Jeff wondered who the hell he was, sizing him up. &quot;Why wouldn't I be? The name's Jeff.&quot; Jeff, trying to be polite, stuck out his hand, offering to shake the stranger's. The boy waited a couple seconds, and then warily shook his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;No reason.&quot; He answered, snorting a bit. &quot;Anyway..&quot; He then muttered. &quot;Me and my pokemon are heading to the Diamond Falls, so... if you wanna follow, it'd be nice to have some company.&quot; Tossing the ball he was holding into the air, Jeff watched as the other trainer released a Skarmory. The Skarmory started squawking at him, and he answered back with &quot;Amudon, we're heading to Diamond Falls, and I'd really appreciate a lift... er, please?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff let out a small snicker. Whatever the Skarmory was, it was proud if it would rarely let humans onto it. The Skarmory squawked again, and then Jeff realized something. &quot;Er...what about me? There's only room for one person on your Skarmory.&quot; By this time, the Skarmory had taken off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Er... sorry, didn't quite think that one through...Shit! You're gonna have to hurry, Amudon's a quick flier... see ya later, hopefully!&quot; And they were soon out of sight. Sighing, Jeff shook his head. Something was drawing him to this trainer, but he didn't know what. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then.&quot; He said to himself. &quot;Looks like I'm in for a walk.&quot; With a flick of his wrist, he grabbed the Were ball on his belt and released his Espeon for company. &quot;Come on Aslan. We're heading for Diamond Falls, we're going to meet someone.&quot;</span></div>

<b>Joshua:</b> Narius looks at you curiously and then laughs again, “I wanted power so I used any means to get it. Admit it Joshua, you’re jealous no? Having such a creature under my control makes me next door to unbeatable!” Entei roars and a bright light emerges from its back, clearing the clouds and beginning to summon a Sunny Day. Tessie takes no time in firing off a barrage of silky green flames, her Dragonbreath engulfing the legendary for good damage. As the flames subside, Entei’s eyes glow white and circles of brown energy emerge, which hit the ground, causing it to shake. Tessie tries to keep her footing but falls to the ground, the Hidden Power of Ground shaking her up for some decent damage. <br />
<br />
As Entei fires the Fire Spin, Tessie disappears into thin air. While Narius and Entei believe shes trapped, you know otherwise as she appears above Entei and Body Slams it for good damage, knocking it flat onto its stomach and knocking the wind out of it. Tessie elegantly lands on the ground, panting slightly. Entei struggles to get up and Narius frowns. “Entei, use Flamethrower, then use Sacred Fire and finish up with Earthquake!” Entei roars before shaking itself, trying to regain its composure. You wonder how Entei learnt a Ho-ohs attack, but dismiss it for now. What will you do?</span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: Lime">Joshua's mind races with fact and thought, an anarchist's highway as he plans for this round. A thought that races round his mind over and over again is Narius' call for Sacred Fire, an attack learned only by the guardian Mother Ho-Oh. A thought dawns on Joshua, and he calls out to Tessie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tessie, use Extremespeed to dodge Flamethrower and strike Entei, then take the Sacred Fire! If it really is Ho-Oh's attack, then the holy flames should help us rather than hurt you, since it's us with the noble aim! Then finish Entei with Thrash!&quot;<br />
<br />
Joshua crosses his fingers, wishing his theory had more basis in fact than a vague thought his mind had presented him. He could only hope for Tessie's safety, before a thought ran once more through his mind.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;For Ho-Oh, and for Entei!&quot;</i> he cried, no clear reason as to why, but a battle cry to cheer Tessie on.</span></div>

You lay in silence, wondering how long a native can stay unconcious, when suddenly you fall asleep. You wake up in darkness - The native and her Pokemon are gone. Waves gently lap at your feet, and you realize the tide has come in. Yawning and stretching, you look around, and find yourself...somewhere else. You have no clue where you are, as the place looks totally different than the beach you fell asleep on. Trees are just yards away from you, the 'ocean' is a lake, and Water Pokemon can be seen on the opposite shore, but you can't tell what they're doing.<br />
<br />
A loud roar disturbs the night air, sending shivers down your spine. Standing up, you look around, holding Validius in your arms. The ground begins to shake, sending ripples across the lake. The trees creak behind you, leaves rustling as they sway. A few cherry blossoms float by your cheek, caressing, and the float over onto the lake, before falling gently. All in all, the area seems peaceful, despite the roar you heard earlier.<br />
<br />
What will you do?<br />
<br />

Unfortunatly, the Shellder is not ready to give up. It leaps from the water, blasting all three of you with an <b>ICE BEAM</b>, giving poor Tangle a headache and freezing Mary to the sand around her. Giggling, the small bivalve then begins to zoom around in circles, quite pleased with its actions. It hops up from the water a couple more times, spitting a mass of water at you each time.<br />
<br />
Angry, Tangle wobbles, but looks back to you for guidance, wondering if it should once again attack the Shellder before you continue to search the beach, or whether to just run for it.<br />
<br />
??? What will you do ???<br />

Waves of ocean water break gently on the shore, and a light wind picks up, cooling you down. A flock of Wingull flies overhead, searching for any food scraps they can get their hands on. Er...beaks. Wings? Whatever. Krabby scuttle along the shore, being harassed by said Wingull. Suddenly, a group of Krabby skedaddly in front of you, barring your way. You notice yourself to be boxed in by the little buggers. There's at least 50 of them!<br />
<br />
They begin to advance slowly, pincers clicking, as they let out their odd cry. &quot;Cookie...COOKIE!&quot; Before they reach you, however, an opening appears straight down the middle of them, right in front of you, and a rather large Kinglar stalks forward, massive pincer clacking loudly. A crown made of seaweed and kelp adorns its head, and it glares at you. &quot;COOOOOOOKIE!&quot; It bellows, before slamming its claw into the sand, obviously demanding why you dare tread on its domain.<br />
<br />
What will you do?<br />
<br />

<br />
Welcome sis *squish*<br />
<br />
The sun continued to beat down on the little group, as they all continued their exploits. Gmpy managed to find someone who was all too willing to share their picnic with him, especially when he started eating without being invited. The people let him be, and went to eat in a resturant, not the least bit disturbed by their meal being devoured by a walking stomach. Rocky settled into the sand further, the warm rays of light making him drowsy, yet he still kept a watchful eye over the two swimming in the water. A group of beachgoers intercepted Bobble halfway down the beach, and they had all picked him up, hugging him tightly, one of the group deeming him &quot;The cutest thing she's ever seen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a dark cloud floats over the sun, and a light wind begins to blow, sending sand everywhere. Shielding your eyes, you look out into the now dark landscape, calling for your Pokemon. Quickly, Rocky appears with Haruki and Kief in his wake, he had called them from the water safely. Bobble stumbles back, waving his ear-arms rapidly, and finally Gumpy gets back, moving slowly across the sand, slightly bigger than before.<br />
<br />
The wind continues to howl, still blowing sand everywhere. Waves crash upon the shore, evidence to a mighty storm that is probably on its way. Not knowing what to do, you stand there anxiously, as your Pokemon crowd close to you, shivering. Suddenly, a voice yells out over the wind, and you turn your head rapidly, looking for the owner. A young man is running towards you, waving his arms rapidly. &quot;It's not safe here miss! You need to get off the beach!&quot; He reaches you, panting. &quot;A strong storm is coming in, according to both the weather service and what's happening here. The beach is being evacuated, and people are being moved to the Devon Settlement. It's located about a mile inland, and you can't miss it. Only real buildings on the island. Now, if you'll excuse me, there's probably others out here.&quot; And he coveres his eyes again, running off.<br />
<br />
Before you can decide what to do, a loud crash and a groan catch your attention. You whip around to face the shoreline, and see a Pokemon far larger than any other laying there. The Wailord lets out another groan, and you hear scraping as it moves further up the sand towards you. &quot;Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaail...&quot; It wheezes, apparently trying to get your attention. The enormous Pokemon then starts to move back towards the water, before disappearing as a flash of lightning blinds everyone for a few seconds.<br />
<br />
Your eyes clear quickly, and you can see the Wailord a fair ways out, watching you, undisturbed by the storm and for good reason. You can't help but notice it has what seems to be a pleading glint in its eye, like it wants you to follow it, or swim out to it, or something. Nobody else is on the beach, and the wind and rain are steadily getting worse, Rocky letting out impatient grunts as the water hits his body.<br />
<br />
You now have two choices...Swim out to the Wailord and see what it wants, or find shelter from the storm at Devon Corp. What will you do?</span><br />

Tropious nods, letting out a soft grunt as it twists itself around. Tropious flaps its broad wings, and small circular leaves fly from it, instantly severing the rope from the raft. Dusclops glares at the large grass-type before a zigzag bolt of ghost energy blasts from his eyes, striking the dino on the chest and sending it reeling. It regains its composure, and begins to glow a faint white. Suddenly, a large wave forms behind the craft, before slamming down and knocking you into the sea.<br />
<br />
Way to go, you managed to knock yourself into the water and piss off a Dusclops, who looks ready to murder Tropius. Zora R Prophetic my arse. Zora R Wet and Tropius R about ready to get beat by a Dusclops. What will you do now?</span><br />

Fredrick grins, and nods. &quot;All right then. I know your Sneasel can be very quiet, but I must warn you. When I say so, be quiet. Try not to make any sounds. These Beedrill are picky as to who enters their land, and to piss them off would be...quite bad, on our part.&quot; Fredrick warns, before turning and beginning to walk off. He stops for a few seconds to converse with a gaurd, who hands Fredrick some sort of ball, and a clipboard, as well as a backpack. With a curt nod, he continues on, and you follow him into the forest.<br />
<br />
Buzzing and creaking greet your ears, obvious signs of life in the lush aboreal verdance. Small insects flit about, mosquitos pestering you endlessly. Getting annoyed at them, you about order Sneasel to do something about it, knowing its attacks could annihalate them, when Fredrick crouches down beside a tree, motioning you to do the same.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright...&quot; He whispers. &quot;We're getting close. Be sure not to make any noises, and to follow my orders exactly. If we do this right, we'll get out of this alive.&quot; A little stunned by the words &quot;get out of this alive,&quot; you stare at Fredrick as he pulls the pack off his back. With a small grunt, he lifts a machine out of it, and begins to fiddle with it. &quot;This machine gives off the same pheromones as the rest of the Beedrill hoarde here. It should allow us to get very, very close to the creatures without disturbing them.&quot; He explains.<br />
<br />
Quite suddenly, a the buzzing sound filled the air, more than normal, and a group of Beedrill appeared. Immediatly, they stopped flying, and turned to stare straight at you. Fredrick turns white, and gives you the universal &quot;oh shit&quot; look. &quot;It's...it's not working...&quot; He stammers out. Immediatly, the group clang their spears together, and begin charging down, the three of them headed straight for you.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span><br />

Pinsir's eyes widened as Lucius evolved, almost to the point of fear. &quot;We were not expecting this!&quot; It said, before throwing the <b>SHADOWBALL</b> roughly at Lucius. Grinning, the newly formed Banette didn't give the ball any time to move and disappeared almost immediatly, leaving the attack to fly off into the trees. He reappeared seconds later behind the gaping Pinsir, who was hit and send to the ground, coughing. &quot;I won't be defeated!&quot; It gasps, standing up. &quot;Especially not by an overgrown doll!&quot;<br />
<br />
He waves his hands, and then thrusts them roughly towards Lucius, and a spiral of yellow energy appears. It arcs and crackles as it hits Lucius, sending him sideways into a tree. &quot;I'm not a shaman for nothing, ghosty!&quot; Lucius gets up and lets a <b>SCREECH</b> loose, sending his hate and malice through it. Wincing, Pinsir shakes his head before sending another burst of <b>THUNDER</b> towards Lucius. He gets his again, and this time it takes him a bit longer to get up. His eyes begin to glow a deep red, and twin lances of Fire Energy burst forth, stabbing into Pinsir's stomach and causing a smell of burnt Exoskeleton to waft into the air.<br />
<br />
Wincing and panting, Pinsir growls and stands up, clacking his pincirs menacingly. Energy starts to flow off them, and with a grunt, he thrusts them straight into Lucius's stomach, a mighty <b>MEGAHORN</b>! Thankfully, Lucius is able to dodge this and Pinsir falls forward onto some moss, gasping for breath.<br />
<br />
Pinsir seems to be getting tired, but he's shown that he's not your average Pokemon...what now?</span><br />

Your Pokemon begin to move, but Hanson holds up a hand. &quot;Hold on...&quot; He looks around, and then looks to the sky. A flock of birds erupt into the air as clouds billow to life overhead, black and menacing, and a wind begins to howl in the distance. &quot;Aw...SHIT!&quot; Hanson yells out. &quot;Listen, we'll have to finish our battle another time, but there's no doubt you would've won. Right now, however, I have to GO!&quot; He quickly returns his two Pokemon, and takes off through the forest. Intrigued, you return Rini and Sakura and follow him.<br />
<br />
Rain begins to fall, light at first, but then it begins to fall faster. Heavy drops pound down like hailstones, thankfully the trees provide cover and you rarely get hit. You see Hanson up ahead near some sort of flourescent light, scrambling around in the dirt. Must be what he was researching. Glancing up, he nods. &quot;Figures you would follow. You see, I was here watching berry growth, trying to find out the best conditions in which to grow them, but a storm like this would ruin everything. But it's odd..storms like these don't just pop up, there's a warning.&quot;<br />
<br />
He looks back down and begins scrabbling in the dirt, pulling up small seeds and placing them in a metal suitcase. &quot;There, all done!&quot; He says, latching the case tightly. &quot;Listen, I'm staying in a cave nearby, and it'd be the best place to get out of the storm. If you want, I'll take you there, otherwise the only other places on the island are the Devon Settlement and Sapphire Village.&quot;<br />
<br />
Will you go with him, or try and make it to the village/settlment?</span><br />

Gaurdian lets out a mighty roar of challenge as the new creature whose three heads respond in king. Gaurdian once more stokes some inner workings of himself and produces a blast of flames, which strike the river which, sorry to say, flowing towards the Gyarados. The flames do nothing to the water but evaporate some of it, and the new creature responds with an attack of its own.<br />
<br />
Gaurdian begins to move forward, but a cascade of water rises in front of the serpent. Bemused, Gyarados begins to head backwards but again is stopped by a powerful spout of water. The water twists and surrounds Gaurdian, forming a large <b>BUBBLE PRISON</b> around it. Gaurdian's roars can be heard from inside, but struggle as he does, he can't pull off any attacks.<br />
<br />
What will you do?<br />

Walking along the path, you can see the area was aptly named. A short trot though some trees, and Diamond Falls explodes into view, light glinting off the falling water, prisms on the other side of it shooting multi-coloured light in every direction. The sight is breath-taking, and you stop to watch it, content. A light mist sprays on your from the churning water, and your Pikachu walks over to the water's edge, taking a peek in. With a squeak, he tumbles backwards as pillar of water rises in front of his face.<br />
<br />
A white horn rises after the water, followed by a pinkish-white and orange-red body. The fish waves its tail elegantly, before sending another spray of water into the air. Eclair walks back over, poking the water a couple times before putting his face up close to it. The Goldeen looks back at him from underwater, and begins to mimic his actions, moving to the side when he does, and etc. The two continue the game as you finally are able to tear your eyes from the water.<br />
<br />
The only Pokemon around seems to be the Goldeen, and you can spy two paths leading away from the waterfall.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></div>

<b>Little Sis</b><br />
<br />
Welcome sis *squish*<br />
<br />
The sun continued to beat down on the little group, as they all continued their exploits. Gmpy managed to find someone who was all too willing to share their picnic with him, especially when he started eating without being invited. The people let him be, and went to eat in a resturant, not the least bit disturbed by their meal being devoured by a walking stomach. Rocky settled into the sand further, the warm rays of light making him drowsy, yet he still kept a watchful eye over the two swimming in the water. A group of beachgoers intercepted Bobble halfway down the beach, and they had all picked him up, hugging him tightly, one of the group deeming him &quot;The cutest thing she's ever seen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a dark cloud floats over the sun, and a light wind begins to blow, sending sand everywhere. Shielding your eyes, you look out into the now dark landscape, calling for your Pokemon. Quickly, Rocky appears with Haruki and Kief in his wake, he had called them from the water safely. Bobble stumbles back, waving his ear-arms rapidly, and finally Gumpy gets back, moving slowly across the sand, slightly bigger than before.<br />
<br />
The wind continues to howl, still blowing sand everywhere. Waves crash upon the shore, evidence to a mighty storm that is probably on its way. Not knowing what to do, you stand there anxiously, as your Pokemon crowd close to you, shivering. Suddenly, a voice yells out over the wind, and you turn your head rapidly, looking for the owner. A young man is running towards you, waving his arms rapidly. &quot;It's not safe here miss! You need to get off the beach!&quot; He reaches you, panting. &quot;A strong storm is coming in, according to both the weather service and what's happening here. The beach is being evacuated, and people are being moved to the Devon Settlement. It's located about a mile inland, and you can't miss it. Only real buildings on the island. Now, if you'll excuse me, there's probably others out here.&quot; And he coveres his eyes again, running off.<br />
<br />
Before you can decide what to do, a loud crash and a groan catch your attention. You whip around to face the shoreline, and see a Pokemon far larger than any other laying there. The Wailord lets out another groan, and you hear scraping as it moves further up the sand towards you. &quot;Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaail...&quot; It wheezes, apparently trying to get your attention. The enormous Pokemon then starts to move back towards the water, before disappearing as a flash of lightning blinds everyone for a few seconds.<br />
<br />
Your eyes clear quickly, and you can see the Wailord a fair ways out, watching you, undisturbed by the storm and for good reason. You can't help but notice it has what seems to be a pleading glint in its eye, like it wants you to follow it, or swim out to it, or something. Nobody else is on the beach, and the wind and rain are steadily getting worse, Rocky letting out impatient grunts as the water hits his body.<br />
<br />
You now have two choices...Swim out to the Wailord and see what it wants, or find shelter from the storm at Devon Corp. What will you do?</span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: Yellow">Time passed pleasurably for them, as all occupied themselves with their preference of activities. However, the joyful people gathered on the beach gradually grew intensely aware of an iminent danger. A gloomy clouded mass passed before the bright sun, darkening the waters. A bitter breeze rolled across the beach, picking up waves and grains of sand with it. The girl grew chilled and tugged the thin jacket closer to her body. Her discomfort however, grew not only from the iciness, but was also drawn from a sense that something was quite wrong in the air. Even her Delibird, who didn't much mind the chill, squawked and ruffled his feathers uneasily, alarmed at the sudden drop in temperature.<br />
<br />
Without delay, the wind picked up fiercely, diminishing dunes and scattering sand all around. Raising her hand to shade her eyes, she peered out onto what was now cold, gray scenery. She raised her voice over the wailing wind, crying out to het Pokémon spread across the beach. Within seconds, her Rhyhorn dutifully reported at his trainer's side, leading his two somewhat shaken charges. With a bit of difficulty, the girl crossed to him, towing her Delibird, and planted herself against the side of her rocky beast, sheltered by his mass against the wind. Scanning the scene, she spotted her Wynaut and Gulpin trekking determinedly across the sands. Bobble, having lost his fans and his shades, sprinted back towards his trainer as fast as his little feet would carry him. Gumpy, the slowest among them, struggled to heft his newly accumulated weight as he edged closer to the group. Jess ushered them both in to the protective circle, and glanced about fearfully, wondering what to do next.<br />
<br />
Above the howl of the wind and the roar of the surf, she heard a hollering voice calling out to her, and turned her head accordingly. A young man was approaching her swiftly, flailing his arms and gesturing wildly in order to make his point and presence known. &quot;It's not safe here, miss! You need to get off the beach!&quot; Upon drawing near, he paused, holding his knees and panting. &quot;A strong storm is coming in, according to both the weather service and what's happening here. The beach is being evacuated, and people are being moved to the Devon Settlement.&quot; He vaguely indicated the route. &quot;It's located about a mile inland, and you can't miss it. Only real buildings on the island. Now, if you'll excuse me, there are probably others out here.&quot; With that, he threw his arm over his eyes and took off, racing to alert other stragglers of the dire situation they were in.<br />
<br />
Before she could make a move in the direction given, however, there was a thunderous crash, followed by a deep groaning. Wondering if it was possibly a ship, she turned towards the shoreline, and saw a creature so huge and mighty that it quite took her breath away. The Wailord moaned pitifully and there was a terrible grating noise as it dragged itself further up the shore. A low moan escaped from it, filling with awe and fear as it rumbled throughout her entire being. It gasped and coughed, fixing its immense eye upon her, as if audaciously attempting to attract her notice. The girl drew in a breath, taking a step back from the whale, whose size was too impressive and daunting for her to take so near to her. It studied her for a moment, before gradually easing its way back into the water. A burst of threatening white lightning exploded at the moment, lighting the sky with an impression of danger and urgency.<br />
<br />
Once her eyes were free of most of the remaining colored spots, Jessica observed the Wailord still remaining a fair distance from the shore. The roar of the rising waves was deafening as they pounded persistently against the shore, but the great blue whale seemed not to notice. It kept on with keeping a close watch on the small group. She wasn't certain, but she thought there was a sort of desperation in its eye, as if it wanted for her to follow it, but that was absurd... She and her friends were all alone on the beach. Rain was beating heavily down upon the troops, she hadn't noticed it before. Her whole thought was captivated by the amazing creature that had lain at her feet, as if begging her for her help.<br />
<br />
Rocky grunted beside her, beginning to feel the dampening effects of the rain on both his body and spirit. Jess snapped immediately out of her reverie, placing her hand on the Rhyhorn's horn with a sincere apology. He growled softly, but affectionately. Looking around at her soaked and miserable Pokémon, she mumbled more apologies, recalling all of them except for Haruki into their Pokéballs. The small coral Pokémon seemed entirely unbothered by the precipitation, and merely watched his trainer with curious, shining eyes. Casting a glance towards the Wailord, she saw it was still waiting quite patiently for her, watching her intently. She frowned slightly, realizing what she was about to do might seem foolish in another's eyes. Then again... She looked back over her shoulder, towards inland. She shook her head. There would be too many people there anyway. She'd rather be here, alone, with a fantastic Pokémon as her company instead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haruki,&quot; she whispered, just loud enough to be heard over the wind, &quot;Help me swim over to Wailord so I can see what it wants. Use <b>SURF</b>, I'll hold onto you. Let's hurry now.&quot;</span></span></div>

We need to help them!” Izumi nodded and bounces off into the woods and you both follow her through the thickest part of the jungle you’ve ever seen. After a good solid hour of walking, you begin to tire and sit down on a rock. Alice is really tired and she shakes her head. “You guys go ahead, I need time to rest.” You agree and carry on, and you can see fires up ahead behind tall walls of tree trunks. From those fires you notice rainbow coloured rays. Realizing that you’ve stumbled upon the Fighting colony, you step back and then turn to Izumi.<br />
<br />
Izumi looks up to you and glows blue, nodding. You realise that rushing in there could be a mistake and perhaps some strategy is needed to avoid the most bloodshed. What will you decide?</span></span>

<span style="color: SeaGreen"><b>Latias10:</b> The crowd cries out your name as you command Shimmer, who clamps her claws and then fires a Bubblebeam right at the oncoming Marowak. It strikes the Ground type in the torso and pushes it back until Marowak begins to spin his bone and places it in front of the attack, effectively cancelling it out. With a grin, Marowak swings his arm back and Shimmer responds by spinning wildly, raising her attack power by a Sword’s Dance. She stops, and her claws are looking sharper as a result but seems confused by the fact Marowak seemingly hadn’t thrown his bone. He moves forwards and Shimmer’s claw glows a bright icy blue as she swings for the pokemon, but is cracked on the back of the head by the bone.<br />
<br />
Shaking herself, Shimmer gets back on her feet and gets even angrier as Marowak catches the bone and smirks, “Marroo..” it murmurs as Shimmer then clamps her claws in response, as if telling the Marowak not to underestimate her. Quagsire claps it’s flappers together and calls, “Wonderful, this will be good!” The crowd cheers for Marowak now, and you feel the need to prove yourself. Marowak then spins about wildly, performing a Sword’s Dance. What will you do?</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: SeaGreen">Catherine watched as her pokemon clamped her claws together in anger. She let out her sigh knowing that it would be best if Shimer just calmed down. Shimmer got angery to easily. Cahterine knew that she was going to think up a plan before Shimmer decided to take action her self. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shimmer I want you to charge at the Marowak with a Double-Edge and them whack it with a Crabhamer. If it sends any bones your block with Protect,&quot; Catherine told her angry pokemon. &quot;And calm down,&quot; she added in.<br />
<br />
Shimmer snorted but was pleased to be charging. She then started to run straight at her opponent as she started her Double-Edge attack.</span></div>

<br />
<b>Joe:</b> Releasing Zora to investigate, he looks at you wearily before wading into the water, and slowly makes his way across to the flower. He treads water and peers at it, before noticing 2 berries nestled tightly in it. He turns to look at you and waves his arms to notify you that its something important and he then descends into the water to dislodge the flower. However, a shock awaits him as Ludicolo is stood on the water bed, and the flower has grown out of his back. However, he has not noticed Marshtomp as hes fawning over Ditto who is knocked out cold. Marshtomp resurfaces and swims back to the bank.<br />
<br />
Hopping out of the lake, he approaches you and in a well tried session of charades, and hand gestures you try to figure out what hes seen. What will you do?</span></span>

Oh no, we have to save him!&quot; shouted Joe, but when he saw Marshtomp's face, he knew it was something much more serious. Without really thinking, Joe made his way to the waters edge, and took of his shoes. He made sure that all his Pokeballs were secure on is belt, and that none of the items on him could escape, before dipping his foot in the water. He didn't know what to expect from the temperature, so instead of testing it throughly, Joe dived right in, and began to swim over to Marshtomp, getting ready to see what Marshtomp wanted him to.</span></span></div>

<b>Theddo</b><br />
You lay in silence, wondering how long a native can stay unconcious, when suddenly you fall asleep. You wake up in darkness - The native and her Pokemon are gone. Waves gently lap at your feet, and you realize the tide has come in. Yawning and stretching, you look around, and find yourself...somewhere else. You have no clue where you are, as the place looks totally different than the beach you fell asleep on. Trees are just yards away from you, the 'ocean' is a lake, and Water Pokemon can be seen on the opposite shore, but you can't tell what they're doing.<br />
<br />
A loud roar disturbs the night air, sending shivers down your spine. Standing up, you look around, holding Validius in your arms. The ground begins to shake, sending ripples across the lake. The trees creak behind you, leaves rustling as they sway. A few cherry blossoms float by your cheek, caressing, and the float over onto the lake, before falling gently. All in all, the area seems peaceful, despite the roar you heard earlier.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span>

As he waited for the native woman to awake Thed inadvertently fell asleep. It seemed like only minutes passed as Thed felt the water at his feet. Not wanting to get caught by the rising tide Thed woke up. But, he wasn't at the beach anymore apparent by the beautiful scenery. Thed looked at Validus who yawned. &quot;Well guess I ain't gonna get any explanations from you... Now am I?&quot; He looked around for the native and Krabu, but both were gone like the beach.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a roar came out from nowhere which surprised both Thed and Validus. It souned big.... &quot;Wonder what that was...?&quot; Thed then saw he was at a lake and across the lake were water pokemon doing who knows what... &quot;Well since there doesn't seem to be anything close to us.... let's go to the other side of the lake to find out what those water pokemon are doing.&quot; With that Thed picked up Validus in his arms and started walking around the lake.</span></div>

(For the sake of my saneness you have been given a special errrrr brain implant that lets you understand their language as if it were English <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite7" alt=":p" title="Stick Out Tongue    :p" data-shortname=":p" />)<br />
<br />
Alexis smiles taking the form off you and then walking into the centre of the stage, you notice they have finally finished setting up. Three stands are situated at the far right of the stage as three people sit down in each one, people begin to sit in the audience area, and joining them you sit on the hard dusty ground awaiting the start of the contest. All kinds of people have joined you in the audience, native villagers, tourists and travellers, some holding their Pokeballs tightly obviously entering and feeling nervous about it. Alexis coughs through the microphone making everyone’s heads turn in her direction, she smiles blissfully as she waves her hands as a signal for the contest is about to start. “Now first things first, welcome everyone to the Sapphire Village Pokemon Contest,” She shouts as loud as possible as people start cheering and whistling in the crowd’s eagerly. She then points at the three judges and holds her microphone tightly in hand. “Now for our judges, our first judge is none other than the Devon Settlements very own Nurse Joy; number two is Ichigo Summers Devon’s top linguist and our third is a village named Zam-Zil-Zoo-Zug who can speak English the best of anyone here!” As she says it she points to each judge in turn, she then walks to the back centre of the stage next to the judges ready to start the appeal rounds.<br />
<br />
“Our first coordinator is the very leader of the Sapphire Village Tribe, known as ‘The Blade’, and he shall be using his Sneasel! The stage is yours, now its time to wow us!” Alexis walks off back to the back of the stage next to the judges as a tall clearly in great shape but not overly muscular in looks anyway walks onto the stage, he has fine green eyes, tanned skin, sandals on his feet and a cloth type piece covering his low body. He holds up a Pokeball and smiles. “Sneasel, show your stuff!” he shouts his voice deep, well he is a pretty matured adult, he tosses the red and white sphere into the air, then lid flips open and a white light hits the ground taking form of a Sneasel. It has two long claw hands, two black piercing eyes and a dark grey type of skin, you notice its standing on one foot as it spins and then jumps into the air. <br />
<br />
“Wow what an entrance!” Alexis exclaims as Sneasel during its jump freezes the stage with a blue and white wind, Icy Wind attack obviously.<br />
<br />
“Icy Wind, then Swift, and finish with Calm Mind then Slash!” Blade commands as Sneasel compiles as it fires an array of small shiny stars at the icy, making it chip off and fly into the air. After all the ice is in the air it begins to focus, calming all its muscles and targeting its mind to one purpose only, it’s next attack. Sneasel jumps and Slashes every last bit of ice into tiny little pieces, each one falling to the ground slowly and majestically creating a strange silvering, icy blue kind of light effect around the stage. Alexis claps as all three judges hold up a board with a score out of ten on it, Joy’s says “9.1”, Ichigo’s says “9.0” and Zam’s says “8.9”. <br />
<br />
“Leaving him with a grand total of twenty seven!” she shouts as Blade bows and leaves the stage return Sneasel after muttering a thank you to his loyal Pokemon friend. After seeing some more appeals, none as beautiful or as point scoring than Blade’s you finally find it’s your turn to compete. “Now it’s time for a rookie coordinator Haku, and his Corsola to wow us with their skills, to finish of the appeal round!” She says happily as you walk onto the stage, the whole crowd staring at you, their eyes watching your every move, Alexis nods at you and sticks a thumb up as a sign of good luck, she opens her mouth wide ready to shout through the microphone, as she does you look over into the audience and see Blade looking on eagerly wondering if you can beat his score. Alexis finally speaks through it and you hear each of her words very clearly as the audience’s gaze falls back on you again.<br />
<br />
“Now, Haku the stage is yours!”<br />
<br />
What will you do now?</span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: RoyalBlue">Still shocked with total awe with Blade's first performance, Haku quickly took notice that he was surely going to be a tough rival. Although he was from the village, he had a pretty good style and technique. Listening to an encouraging Alexis, Haku gave Blade a last 'now watch THIS' look' and winked at Alexis. Hasting off onto the stage, Haku quickly withdraws one of his pokeballs and helds it up high above his eyes. He stared at it for a second and then quickly shot out, &quot;Sefi, it is time to take the stage!&quot; Just as he finished saying the last phrase, his arm had already pulled back and released the ball into the air. The words had been drilled into Haku so many times that he ddin't even need to think, they would just come out at the perfect time, but Haku knew that a small suspense could be used to his advantage. A few seconds after spinning through the stage, the pokeball quickly burst open, and the red beams quickly rained down into the ground, revealing the shadow and form of a Corsola. Just as he made his entrance, Sefi took only a small glimpse at the crowd. He knew that although it was his purpose to awe them, he couldn't fall to his nerves, and must remain calm and focused throughout the whole appeal. Of course, his sharpness wasn't going to reflect any change in his appearance. His smile was larger and wider (although not ovely exaggerated), and his eyes sparkled with bliss and enthusiasm. Out of the corners of his eyes, he looked at his trainer and gave him a small nod, and then awaited for his cue. Now knowing that Sefi was prepared, Haku quickly emptied all thoughts in his mind, and quickly turned into &quot;contest mode.&quot; Every time in a contest, just as he was ready to announce the attacks, there was a change in the tone of his voice, which signaled confidence and readiness. &quot;Okay Sefi, it is your turn to shine on this show, and end the beginning of this round. Firstly, use a washed-down mist attack to set up the mood, and might I add a beautiful mystic scenery. Then, spray off as manny bubles as you can with your bubble attack, and then quickly use Confuse Ray. Remember that the light ray would act like a spotlight that shifted into every possible way so that all of the bubbles would eventually get hit by the light (just not at the same time). Then, quickly finish it off by sending out your most brightest Hidden Power attack. &quot; </span></div>

Walking along the path, you can see the area was aptly named. A short trot though some trees, and Diamond Falls explodes into view, light glinting off the falling water, prisms on the other side of it shooting multi-coloured light in every direction. The sight is breath-taking, and you stop to watch it, content. A light mist sprays on your from the churning water, and your Pikachu walks over to the water's edge, taking a peek in. With a squeak, he tumbles backwards as pillar of water rises in front of his face.<br />
<br />
A white horn rises after the water, followed by a pinkish-white and orange-red body. The fish waves its tail elegantly, before sending another spray of water into the air. Eclair walks back over, poking the water a couple times before putting his face up close to it. The Goldeen looks back at him from underwater, and begins to mimic his actions, moving to the side when he does, and etc. The two continue the game as you finally are able to tear your eyes from the water.<br />
<br />
The only Pokemon around seems to be the Goldeen, and you can spy two paths leading away from the waterfall.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span>&#8203;</div>

<span style="color: lightblue">Aiseki gazed into the waterfall, watching the mist as it floated in the air above the water. After a few moments of staring peacefully into the haze, she tore her eyes from it, as she was about to doze off. She looked back to the two Pokemon as they played together. Her Pikachu and the wild Goldeen were still enthralled in their little game of mimicry. Suddenly the young trainer noticed the two paths leading away from the waterfall. Curious as she was, Aiseki went over to inspect them. Her Pikachu, now finished playing with the Goldeen, had seen her trainer walk over to the paths near the waterfall, and followed her. After inspecting the paths and checking them out, Aiseki finally decided to take the path that she was closest to. She had a feeling that somehow, she might find something more interesting than a Goldeen there. </span>&#8203;</div></div>

<br />
Gaurdian lets out a mighty roar of challenge as the new creature whose three heads respond in king. Gaurdian once more stokes some inner workings of himself and produces a blast of flames, which strike the river which, sorry to say, flowing towards the Gyarados. The flames do nothing to the water but evaporate some of it, and the new creature responds with an attack of its own.<br />
<br />
Gaurdian begins to move forward, but a cascade of water rises in front of the serpent. Bemused, Gyarados begins to head backwards but again is stopped by a powerful spout of water. The water twists and surrounds Gaurdian, forming a large <b>BUBBLE PRISON</b> around it. Gaurdian's roars can be heard from inside, but struggle as he does, he can't pull off any attacks.<br />
<br />
What will you do?<br />
<br />
</span>

<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: LightBlue">Sorry about the late reply. BMGf swallowed up my first reply so this may seem a tad rushed. &gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Panic soon rushed through Tom as he saw Guardian been imprisoned by the creature all too easily, and he could hear the roars of Gyarados emanating from the contents of the bubble. He could think of a way to escape, but even if his initial idea worked, it would leave Guardian vulnerable for a split-second. He racked his mind for a way to distract the creature while Gyarados escaped and prepared his attacks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Delibird, I choose you!&quot; Tom yelled nervously as his voice wavered, but he was hopeful the plan would work. In an array of bright sparkles, a purple Delibird hopped over to Tom and smiled up at him. &quot;You ready, Deli? I want you to throw a Present at the beast. If it heals instead of hurts, keep throwing until you deal damage. Hopefully this will remove the beasts attention from Guardian which will allow him to escape and finish up this battle,&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom tried to get as close to the water sphere as possible to deliver orders to Guardian without the beast knowing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guardian, we need to finish this NOW. Use Thrash to try and struggle out of the sphere, and if it works, then Body Slam the creature from behind, then blast it with Dragon Rage. If the first thrash doesn't work, keep trying until you do escape then use the moves I've already said!&quot;<br />
<br />
A muffled roar could barely be heard as Guardian continued to struggle against the prison. &quot;Let's just hope he heard me..&quot;</span></div>

<span style="color: Cyan"><u>Lapis Lake: (Please reply in <b>Cyan</b>)</u><br />
<br />
<b>Faiyaa:</b> The man looked up at you and then at each shadow, seemingly thinking to himself. Whilst keeping a terrified expression, he whimpered, “Please no .. don’t hurt me! I’ll return it..” Reaching down, seemingly to the bag, but then grasped a Dive Ball which he threw into the air, releasing a Starmie. Before you can react it fires a Water Gun from each spike on it’s star shaped body which eliminate the shadows. Starmie then begun to spin and launched towards you, smacking you right in the midriff, knocking you onto your back. Scurvy flew backwards and landed into the lake as the man then laughed and called out to you, “Pathetic! You fall for such an old trick! Now I’ll make sure you’ll never both Team Cyan again!” At his call, Starmie glows purple and makes you float in the air, placing you onto your feet. “ONE ON ONE NOW!” The man roars, as he picks the bag up and throws it into Lapis Lake, as a Swampert surfaces and catches it then submerges into the Lake. What will you do?<br />
<br />
<b>Politically Incorrect:</b> As Jynx narrows her eyes, they glow a deep purple, Houndour swings her head back and Howls loudly, trying to keep her focus away from the terrifying look that Jynx was giving her. Realising that her look wasn’t working, Jynx opens her small mouth quite wide as particles of Ice energy surround her. Just before she releases it, Houndour glows brown as the ground shakes slightly, huge rocks emerging and shielding Houndour at the front. When the Blizzard is released, it collides with the rocks at the front, which freezes over, making Houndour feel a bit cold. The Blizzard ceases and the rocks are completely covered with ice. Houndour then quickly spits an Ember out at her lower leg, which efficiently melts the Ice. Stretching her legs out in front of her she then darts out and fires an Ember at Jynx, which strikes her and causes some good damage. As Houndour moves to go back behind her rock, Jynx fires spheres of Fighting energy which collide with the rocks as Houndour gets behind them. The icy rocks shatter, and Houndour is thrown back as debris pelts her all over her body causing light, but continuous damage. Glacia then raises an eyebrow, “Well well, seems you’re better than I anticipated.. Such a hot trainer, you are.” She then runs a hand through her blonde hair as she gives out her next orders, “Jynx, now Houndour is out in the open, Water Pulse! Then follow up with a Powder Snow/Ice Beam combination attack!” What will you do?<br />
<br />
<b>Joe:</b> As you swim to the middle of the lake, next to Marshtomp, he points down and you look. Ludicolo is sat on the bed of the lake, stroking Ditto, with a long vine emerging from his back. The flower is right in front of you and you look and there are 2 berrys - you identify them as a Sitrus Berry and theres one which you can’t recognise. Its green with a yellow stripe - sort of like a Ludicolo. Suddenly, you see Ditto pointing at you with a small blob like hand, weakly calling out “diiiittt…” Ludicolo then turns and glares right at you, its bill open wide, and you could swear you saw teeth! Suddenly, Ludicolo picks up Ditto and swallows it in one gulp. The small transforming pokemon then emerged through Ludicolo’s belly. Ludicolo then glows white as it transforms into a Marshtomp and begins to swim rapidly towards you. The vine has detached from it’s back. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: LightBlue"><u>Diamond Waterfall: (Please reply in <b>LightBlue</b>)</u><br />

<b>P/Arts &amp; Skrusti:</b> <span style="color: Red"><i>NOTE:</i> As this double adventure begins, I want to let you both know my rules. Work together and reply at the same time. If only one of you updates, then I won't update you. Just want to clarify this.</span><br />

As Amudon and James flew off at speed towards the Diamond Falls, Jeff and Aslan decide to walk, having no quicker means of getting there. After only 5 minutes of flying, Amudon and James touch down at the Diamond Waterfall. Jumping off Amudon’s body, taking care not to ruffle his feathers. As James looks about the area, the waterfall is flowing heavily, splashing water all over the place. Looking up to the waterfall’s source, he squints as the sun shines in his eyes. Suddenly, a Milotic bursts out of nowhere, moving at speed towards James, and Wraps him tightly, hissing in his ear and then quickly moves with him towards the pool where the waterfall falls into. Amudon turns to look and squawks as James tries to hold his breath as he is pulled into the water with Milotic. Jeff then arrives with Aslan, and is met by Amudon, who is slightly panicked. Amudon motions to the pool, where air bubbles are rising to the surface. Jeff tilts his head in confusion, unsure of what to think, but when he realises that James isn’t there, he becomes slightly suspicious. James is underwater, and is wrapped ever so slightly around the legs to keep him from swimming to the surface as Milotic pulls him further down, he can hold his breath for about 2 minutes. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: LimeGreen"><u>Emerald Forest: (Please reply in <b>LimeGreen</b>)</u><br />
<br />
<b>Dark Scizor:</b> Izumi looks up at you, her blind eyes glowing blue as she nods, ready to take you to him. Hopping in front of you, she leads the way through a side-gate made of logs. You look about, the area is covered in flames, and rainbow-coloured beams are flying everywhere. You see many battles, including ones between Machamps and Alakazams, Hypnos and Hariyamas and theres an Espeon battling Enma! You rush with Izumi to Enma, who is surrounded by a purple aura cringing in pain .. “Human .. Please help..” he pleads as the Espeon narrows her eyes and strengthens her Psychic attack, causing the Fighting King to pass out. She smirks then proclaims through a Psychic link “WE HAVE TRIUMPHED! There is noone left to fight..” But she then looks at you, “Who are you?..” she questions. Izumi bounces up and down, in an annoyed manner. What will you do?<br />
<br />
<b>Joshua:</b> As Entei spews out a barrage of flames, Tessie disappears into thin air as she dodges them completely, appearing a good distance away from where Entei had aimed its Flamethrower. Suddenly, as the time came for Entei to use Sacred Fire, its eyes glew black as dark clouds covered this area of Emerald Forest. Opening it’s mouth, flames began to emerge in the shape of a bird. However, these flames are tinged with darkness and the flames turn from a majestic orange, red and yellow to a black, blue and grey. Narius laughs loudly and proclaims, “Noble cause? Don’t make me laugh! These flames are of darkness and hate, not good and light!” With that, Entei released the dark bird of flame, which soared towards Tessie, who whimpers, sensing the immense darkness of the attack, but as she was told to take it, she stands courageously, her head lowered. The flame bird crashes into her and sends her flying, scorched by the dark flames. She lands in a heap, as the clouds clear. Struggling to stand, she howls, trying to regain her confidence. Narius grins as Entei, although drained of energy, moves to cause an Earthquake. However, Tessie moves quicker, Thrashing the beast so it falls to the ground, panting. Tessie is higher on energy than health. Entei is higher on health and is low on energy. Seems this could end soon. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: DarkRed"><u>Ruby Mountain: (Please reply in <b>DarkRed</b>)</u><br />
<br />
<b>Lonely Wanderer:</b> Releasing Karasa, the tunnel now filled with light, you look upon your defeated opponent and decided to try to capture it. Throwing the poke ball, it bumps the Zubat on the back and sucks it inside. The ball lands on the ground and wobbles to and fro a few times, before it clicks shut, signalling a capture. **Congratulations, you captured a Level 6 Female Zubat!** Deciding to move on, you exit the cave that Cryseye had lead you into and you’re about ¼ the way up Ruby Mountain. Turning to move up the mountain, Karasa flits happily in the air next to you. As you walk up, you can’t help but take the opportunity to look down on the scenery. You can see all of Sapphire Island, the sparkling waters, the Wingull and Pelipper flying through the air over the Ocean waters. You gasp in awe as you stop to look. Suddenly, an Ultra Ball rolls past you, down the mountain path you’re following. Blinking, you then look up to see a woman rushing down shouting “STOP THAT ULTRA BALL!!!!” What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: SeaGreen"><u>Jade Swamp: (Please reply in <b>SeaGreen</b>)</u><br />
<br />
<b>Latias10:</b> Shimmer clamps her claws as she rushes towards Marowak, engulfed in a white aura. She smashes right into him, knocking him onto the ground, but giving herself quite a bit of recoil damage. Trying to shake the damage off, she glares at Marowak as her right claw glows with Water energy. Swinging it around, she approaches Marowak who has just barely got up and swings to hit him with her Crabhammer, but it is met with Marowak’s Bone Club. The result is a struggle between the two pokemon, trying to break the opposing pokemon’s attack. Marowak then grins as his eyes glow blue, Leering Shimmer, she looks right into his eyes and stumbles backwards, stunned and frightened. This allows Marowak’s Bone Club to strike her and she stumbles backwards. Marowak then throws the bone but Shimmer raises her claws and Protects herself, rendering the attack useless, and uses the time to try and calm down a bit. The crowd was really excited when the two pokemon were trying to outbest each other but they’re a bit bored now with the defense tactics. Quagsire doesn’t look too pleased either. What will you do?</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px">Okay, I owe all a thousand apologizes for delaying the updates, but I finally got them up!<br />
<br />
<span style="color: LimeGreen"><b>~*Emerald Forest*~ </b>(LimeGreen, please!)<br />
<br />
<b>Torkoal Stu:</b> Beaming at you, Maria stated, “Okay then! Now, we’ll need to past through some thick vegetation on our way to the spot where Nidorans roam so follow me and don’t get lost!”<br />
<br />
She then started to skip further into the jungle, and you hastily follow behind her. What she said about the plants becoming thicker was right; soon, you couldn’t see about anything that stood about a foot in front of you. Frequently you have to brush plants off your face as they lightly whipped around your head, your irritation mounting at a swift pace. About three times or so you thought you’d lost Maria after howling out her name, but you were able to get back together soon afterwards. Still, you keep thinking on how she could have the talent of passing through such dense forest in this jungle…<br />
<br />
After what seemed to be an eternity of maneuvering around in the dense world that you were in, you and Maria soon came into a clearing where the vegetation wasn’t as thick and you could see through the jungle more clearly now. In front of you two, about 30 feet or so, sat a small blue beast with miniature horns covering the complete body, nibbling on fallen berries that were scattered all over the jungle ground. Maria excitedly whispers in your ear, “That’s it! A Female Nidoran! What a coincidence! I didn’t think that we would run into one instantly…”<br />
<br />
Currently, you and Maria are hiding behind two thick bushes, and the Nidoran appears to be completely heedless about what is happening around her environment, so now appears to be the greatest chance for a surprise assault on the Poison-Type.<br />
<br />
What will you do?<br />
<br />
<b>Alilatias: </b>Deciding that it was best for Hikari to step back and let Faltzer finish the job, your electric dog disappeared back into the orb in your hand. Your Swellow up in the air continued to circle around you, and deciding that it was best to give the instructions out now, you explain to Faltzer on what he needed to do to defeat the Aipom. Nodding his red, white, and blue head, your speedy bird took off, awaiting the Aipom to come off from the tree.<br />
<br />
Becoming aware of your choice to change your partner, the Aipom merely leaps from the tree as Faltzer’s form is suddenly surrounded by mere copies of himself, making it more complicated to distinguish from the real Swellow. However, you soon come to grasp that this Aipom was smarter than you had underestimated; standing on his tail to keep it balanced, the creature swung around once, sending razor-sharp stars all over the place. Since Swift doesn’t easily missed, a group of the pointed objects struck Faltzer right across the chest, making him shriek in pain as his other forms vanished. Lines of scarlet fluid started to form where the stars hit, and this seemed to be the boost of energy that suddenly turned the tide of battle.<br />
<br />
With his eyes blazing utter hatred for attacking him, Faltzer spreads out his large wings. With blinding speed, he soared in the air, striking the Aipom hard on the front body with Flying-Type damage, the Wing Attack causing a critical hit on Aipom’s weak point. Staggering backwards, Aipom is practically vulnerable at this point, giving room for the Quick Attack that Faltzer carried out, his health decreasing at a dramatic rate. However, you can tell that the Aipom isn’t entirely done yet, but within two rounds if all else should go good, the Aipom should faint.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: MediumTurquoise">~*Turquoise River*~(MediumTurquiose, please!)<br />
<br />
<b><b>Eon:</b> <span style="color: Red">REPOST</span></b><br />
Deciding that you wanted to adventure elsewhere, you began your trek down the beautiful, fast-flowing river that was given the name Turquoise River. And as you arrived in the spot, you could see why; the crystallized water that sparkles within the rays of the sunlight was the exact shade of the marvelous shade of turquoise. Sighing, seeing that you small trip was only a few minutes long, you began to follow the current of the river, keeping your eyes—and ears—out for any excitement that may be within your surroundings.<br />
<br />
Soon enough, you heard footsteps slowly following your form, and you turned around, spotting a rather young boy following you. His sandy-brown hair was all over the place on his head, partly covering his aquamarine eyes, and his freckles on his cheeks were clearly visible. He wore a plain white T-Shirt that was complimented by a pair of navy-blue shorts and brown sandals. Nothing much of an impressionist by looks, the boy, intimidated from you, spoke to you.<br />
<br />
“Hello, I’m Jonathan,” The boy informed you. “I-I was wondering if you wanted to battle my only Pokémon…”<br />
<br />
As soon as his words finished slipping from his mouth, a splash was heard from the side of the boy, and a blue creature sprouted from the water, revealing to be sort of a bird-like fish. It had a duck-like beak for its mouth, but its both its claws as its hands and feet were webbed, and a ruby jewel was implanted on the forehead of the Golduck, and it jumped out of the river, landing on the ground with perfect balance. So maybe the boy’s Water-Type Pokémon wasn’t as bad as his looks…<br />
<br />
How will you respond?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: Sienna"><b>~*Temple Grounds*~</b> (Sienna, please!)<br />
<br />
<b>Ushi No Tane: <span style="color: Red">REPOST</span></b><br />
Extremely pleased with the efforts your dog of darkness had carried out, you light-heartedly took the path leading to the left of the grounds, and flicking his tail behind you, your Mightyena followed your form as you began to hum a random tune that randomly appeared in your mind…or whatever.<br />
<br />
However, despite that, you observed the pathway that you had took, looking at the various inscriptions inscribed with the walls that surrounded your pathways. Some were complicated pictures of Pokémon, some you’ve recognized and others you have never seen in your lifetime…other times, they were words that you were unable to distinguish, presuming that it was written long ago in an unknown language. And on the occasion, you’ll pass by a statue of a Pokémon representing a god…you’ve seen, so far, a bird-like creature that was somewhat a phoenix though it wasn’t a Ho-oh, a dragon with the features of a breath-taking beautiful mermaid, and a centaur with the top-half of the body looking more like a ugly woman…<br />
<br />
You were getting a closer look on a picture of a group of Fire-Types on the wall when you’ve heard it; footsteps, faintly heard at first, echoed within the temple, before it rapidly became louder…realizing that they were heading straight towards you, you and your Mightyena broke in a run, but it wasn’t long before a stern, terrifying voice boomed “HALT!” right behind you.<br />
<br />
Daring to turn, you could see a native with a huge muscular build pointing a spear straight at your neck. He definitely looked like some guard who knew how to act with invaders…he sent you an inhuman look that sent a shiver down your spine, and your Mightyena growled at the stranger, obviously warning the man not to attack.<br />
<br />
Being oblivious to your dog, the native spoke, “No human shall enter the temple! If you want to get out alive, you must battle me! Come forth Mostiyc!”<br />
<br />
Behind him you could make out a weird horse approaching the man. For a moment, you could’ve sworn that it was a fiery, white mane Rapidash, but its features were…well, different. What should’ve been its flaming hair were instead crystallized icicles, and its fur was the color of clear aquamarines and sapphires. The hooves that it walked on were actually made out of real crystals, and when it neighed, it sounded as if it was underwater instead. The man laughs at your confused look, while Roch still growled, despite that he himself was confused by this “Mostiyc”.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: Yellow"><b>~*Southern Beach*~ </b>(Yellow, please!)<br />
<br />
<b>Archaic:</b> Emerging from the flying red-and-white orb, your Ninjask buzzes out from the white glow, clearly hearing your instructions to help the poor girl that was starting to drown. Shinjuu wastes no time as he moved in blinding speed, and within a brief period of time, he was closing in on the two Tentacruels, getting every chance of swiping his prickly claws on the airborne tentacles to let go of the young lady. Eventually, Shinjuu has caused enough damage for the Tentacruels to lose grip of the woman, and her head materialized into the surface, but being weaken from her harassment caused by her two captors, her form soon sinks into the water. Luckily, you submerge into the cold water, and spotting the woman almost straight away, you grab her around the waist and haul her up into fresh air. As you, accompanied by the female, struggle to shore, you soon heard a lot of coughing, signaling that at least she was still conscious.<br />
<br />
After what seemed to be perpetuity, you finally reached the shore, with each single muscle in your body (excluding your heart, of course, since it’s a muscle) burning from soreness and exhaustion. The woman, somewhat gaining a little strength back, glances back at you with her pea green-eyes and said in a dreary, but thankful, voice, “Thanks sir…I though I’d never get out here alive. What is your na—“<br />
<br />
But before she could ask your name, a look of terror spread across her face rapidly, and she ducks her head into the ground. Looking back at your shoulder, you burrow your head on the sand, barely avoiding a barrage of needles surrounded by a toxic aura that pierce through the air the exact spot where your head was just a second early.<br />
<br />
Daring to look back, you saw that the two Tentacruels that you’ve just fed off were noticeably ticked that you took away their prisoner, and Shinjuu just zooms in front of you, showing minor wounds that were caused from your two opponents. Now you realized that the only way to get out of the beach safely was to defeat the two Tentacruels, since they showed no signs of allowing you and the woman escape.<br />
<br />
How will you respond?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: DarkRed"><b>~*Ruby Mountain*~ </b>(DarkRed, please!)<br />
<br />
<b>~*Centin*~:</b> Wanork chortled at you last comment, remarking, “Almost all of us who dwell within the mountain had learned how to speak the tongue of men. Some exceptions might be the cave inhabitants and the Pokémon who have low expectation. But anyway, I am wandering off with this topic; I shall take you to my band of companions who have agreed and sworn that we shall have no big conflict with the creatures who live here. If you may…”<br />
<br />
With a hand, he indicated through a pile of bushes, and understanding this rather quickly, you followed the Machoke. With Radii gripping your leg again, you and Wanork began to track through the wilderness, always being wary of any savages that might attack you on your way to his camp. Keeping his voice low, Wanork mentioned, “I heard from the conversation with your Octillery that you wanted to go to Crystal Peak; I’ll make you a deal. If we are successful in stopping the great strife from harming this mountain, then I can give you an easy hike up to that place, since I’ve hiked up and down this mountain for nearly all my life as a daily workout.”<br />
<br />
Wanork did not noticed how you responded with this comment, since he glanced up ahead, and shortly after you can see why; a few forms were sitting around a group of logs, clearly in a meeting talking in a deep conversation. Within this band you could see two Golbats flying above your and Wanork’s head, a Hariyama with both its hands sitting on its hip, a Graveler with all four hands resting on the its log, and a Geodude that, after you swiftly examined it, looked more like as if it was a bronze Geodude than the typical grey one. Looking around, you were slightly disappointed that they were the only members of the clan Wanork made, but you decided that it was better than nothing.<br />
<br />
Clearing his throat, Wanork soon grabbed attention, and all the Pokémon paused to look at you and the Machoke, which make you a little nervous as of what the reply will be from them. Wanork then spoke, “I am back, my friends, with another member of the band. This human here has agreed to help us with stopping the tragedy that we have predicted. I know that he carries with him strong enough Pokémon to aid us, so don’t hold suspicion against him. He will surely be a helping hand with the Machops and the Geodudes”<br />
<br />
All the Pokémon nodded, showing that they have accepted you, and then Wanork turned his head to look at you. “Now, before we actually begin, I need you to ask three questions,” he said. “First of all, please tell us your name. Second, reveal to us the Pokémon that you’ll want to use in the battle (BTW, your maximum is three). And finally, if you saw any Machop or Geodude on the way here that seemed to be suspicious, please speak up. And if you have questions that you want us to answer, be free to say so. Afterwards, I will tell you some information about what we will all be facing.”<br />
<br />

<b>Faiyaa:</b> The man looked up at you and then at each shadow, seemingly thinking to himself. Whilst keeping a terrified expression, he whimpered, “Please no .. don’t hurt me! I’ll return it..” Reaching down, seemingly to the bag, but then grasped a Dive Ball which he threw into the air, releasing a Starmie. Before you can react it fires a Water Gun from each spike on it’s star shaped body which eliminate the shadows. Starmie then begun to spin and launched towards you, smacking you right in the midriff, knocking you onto your back. Scurvy flew backwards and landed into the lake as the man then laughed and called out to you, “Pathetic! You fall for such an old trick! Now I’ll make sure you’ll never both Team Cyan again!” At his call, Starmie glows purple and makes you float in the air, placing you onto your feet. “ONE ON ONE NOW!” The man roars, as he picks the bag up and throws it into Lapis Lake, as a Swampert surfaces and catches it then submerges into the Lake. What will you do?</span></span>

Screaming bursts of profanity at the man, he then pulled out another two pokeballs. &quot;You'll pay for this dearly!&quot; he shouted, &quot;Go, Thorn and Aero!&quot; He then chucked the two pokeballs, and in two bursts of light, a Cacturne appeared in front of the Starmie, glaring at his opponent, though glad to finally be able to be destructive without reprocussions. Then in the water, a Mantine appeared, and Gary shouted out, &quot;It'll br hard overseeing both battles at once, but I'll try my hardest! Aero, keep trying to swim around the Swampert in circles with a Whirlpool, and if that doesn't work, trap it with a Twister! Thorn, run up to Starmie and give it a swift Thunderpunch! Then trap it with a Leech Seed!&quot; Still enraged, Gary then turned to the man. &quot;Who are you, and what is Team Cyan? And what do you want with the stone?&quot;</span></div>

Pinsir's eyes widened as Lucius evolved, almost to the point of fear. &quot;We were not expecting this!&quot; It said, before throwing the <b>SHADOWBALL</b> roughly at Lucius. Grinning, the newly formed Banette didn't give the ball any time to move and disappeared almost immediatly, leaving the attack to fly off into the trees. He reappeared seconds later behind the gaping Pinsir, who was hit and send to the ground, coughing. &quot;I won't be defeated!&quot; It gasps, standing up. &quot;Especially not by an overgrown doll!&quot;<br />
<br />
He waves his hands, and then thrusts them roughly towards Lucius, and a spiral of yellow energy appears. It arcs and crackles as it hits Lucius, sending him sideways into a tree. &quot;I'm not a shaman for nothing, ghosty!&quot; Lucius gets up and lets a <b>SCREECH</b> loose, sending his hate and malice through it. Wincing, Pinsir shakes his head before sending another burst of <b>THUNDER</b> towards Lucius. He gets his again, and this time it takes him a bit longer to get up. His eyes begin to glow a deep red, and twin lances of Fire Energy burst forth, stabbing into Pinsir's stomach and causing a smell of burnt Exoskeleton to waft into the air.<br />
<br />
Wincing and panting, Pinsir growls and stands up, clacking his pincirs menacingly. Energy starts to flow off them, and with a grunt, he thrusts them straight into Lucius's stomach, a mighty <b>MEGAHORN</b>! Thankfully, Lucius is able to dodge this and Pinsir falls forward onto some moss, gasping for breath.<br />
<br />
Pinsir seems to be getting tired, but he's shown that he's not your average Pokemon...what now?</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: royalblue">Stacey inwardly grinned at the shocked expression on the Pinsir's face. It was obviously not expecting Lucius's evolution and the now Banette floated above thr ground, vibrating with new found strength and energy. The Pinsir seemed to frown before throwing the Shadowball. Lucius glowed a dark black before dissappearing with a loud crack, like gunfire; the sound residing again as he reappeared behind the bug slamming into its back with enough force to topple a tree. The bug hit the ground hard and gasped from the unexpected blow. It rasped in anger and gathered a deep yellow energy inbetween its claws. The electric energy arced out and struck Lucius hard in his chest pushing him back, a black charred mark left in its wake. <br />
<br />
Lucius snarled, his yellow eyes glowing with hate before Screeching loudly in anger. Pinsir winces again, charging yet more Thunder energy between its claws, letting it loose to strike the Banette in its chest once more; leaving yet another black charred patch of ethereal skin. Luicus winced and held a hand to his chest, closing his eyes to the pain. He forced it to the back of his mind and let his rage and malice come forth, focusing it into his next attack. Twin beams of red fire energy charged forth striking the Pinisr hard, burning through its tough exosketelon. The Pinisr snapped its pinser's together in irritation, energy forming between them charging towards Lucius. The Banette floated sharply upwards leaving the bug to trip and fall to the ground with a sickening thud.<br />
<br />
This Pinsir was not an ordinary pokemon, it possessed skill far beyond that of a wild pokemon, this Stacey knew for certain. It was proving a challenging foe ... what could be more exciting. Stacey smirked, she didn't want to fight some weakling that could be taken out with so much as a look. This was testing both her pokemon's and her own will, strength and endurance. Lucius was looking a little worse for wear but a wicked grin was plastered on his face, his eyes shining with excitement and power. They both were enjoying this much to the chagrin of the shaman bug. Now, to finish the job.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lucius, attack fast and attack hard. <b>Water Pulse</b> now whilst its down then follow up with <b>Icy Wind</b> to cause some real pain. Finish with <b>Nightshade</b>.&quot; Lucius cackled loudly rubbing his hands together with glee before charging the water energy between said hands.</span></div>

Striving for the prize of that strange lovely stone you command Arnoldii to start off this round with a Sweet Sent attack. A bright pink coloured powder floats through the air making the Krabby sway and spin on its feet, the Krabby collapses and looks all dazed for a second as Arnoldii jumps towards the crab Pokemon and sends a load of sharp green leaves in its direction. The Krabby stands up and each leave smashes the front of his body and pushes him back down into the sand, his claw falls open and the red fire coloured stone rolls out into the sand. Arnoldii then fires another Razor Leaf attack making sure the Krabby is actually knocked out, it appears to be from the grass type onslaught you gave it. *Level up for Arnoldii* You and Arnoldii walk towards the stone, examining the Krabby on your way to it. The Krabby gives you a sour look and scuttles away into the sand leaving just you, Arnoldii and the stone.<br />
<br />
What will you do now?</span><br />

<b>HakuBlue</b>:&#8203;</div><br />
The audiences stare up at you in wonder as you command your orders for Sefi. Sefi focus’ as hard as possible and opens his mouth releasing a slow moving mist around the stage, the judges look at you and wonder where Sefi will go from here. He then sends as many bubbles as possible in every direction, the bubbles float away slowly from Sefi however he then knows what to do and fires a confuse ray directly at the centre of the bubbles and mist. A bright spot light type beam emerges from the mist and shines on Sefi and through each bubble which diffract the light in more directions creating a bright dazzling show of lights, mist and bubbles. Each bubbles pops (not at the same time) creating a strange noise across the stage, however the little drops of water from the bubbles land on the ground around Sefi as the light mist vanishes. Sefi then wraps things up by sending bright white spheres in each direction making the appeal even more bright and dazzling than before. “Absolutely stunning, Haku a rookie coordinator seems to of stole the audience with his bright appeal, everyone give a round of applauds to our young coordinator Haku!” Alexis exclaims as the audience bursts in claps and whistles and shouts of encouragement. You blush as Sefi looks as happy as ever, you look out into the audience and see Blade who nods approvingly at you.<br />
<br />
“Now onto the scores,” Alexis’ voice trails off as she turns to the three judges who each hold up a board with a number out of ten on it, Joy’s says “9.0”, Ichigo’s says “8.7” and Zam’s says “8.9”.<br />
<br />
“And that folks gives Haku a score of twenty six point six, giving Haku second place!” Alexis shouts as the judges all smile and nod at your wonderful and popular appeal. “Now the four finalists going onto the next round are, Blade, Haku, Rayne and Kristian, looks like only one non-villager made it into the finals this time. But keep watching the second round begins soon.” After a few minutes of talking Alexis walks back onto the stage and the three other finalists join you up on the stage. Blade whispers in your ear quietly “Nice appeal, but if we battle I play to win,” he finishes with a smile as he walks to his spot on the stage as the current leader in scores. “First battle Blade against Kristian, go!” She shouted as Blade sends out a Star-shaped Pokemon, it has a jewel in the centre which glows as it lands on the stage with a blissful tone in its voice, you recognise the Pokemon as Starmie as Kristian throws his Pokeball and a Jumpluff appears in front of him. The battle begins, Starmie dodges all the grass attacks Jumpluff sends, making Jumpluff’s point bar lower since its attack wasn’t graceful and missed its target, Starmie then uses Rapid Spin and smashes into Jumpluff taking off more points, the timer runs out and Jumpluff falls to the ground pointless and energy-less. Blade then returns Starmie and walks away smiling at his victory and Alexis then calls you and Rayne back onto the stage for your battle.<br />
<br />
Haku: {=========}<br />
Rayne: {=========}<br />
<br />
5:00<br />
<br />
You look up at your bar, full points of course, as you then look across the other side of the stage and notice a girl with violet hair and violet eyes to match, she must be Rayne, she has the classic Sapphire Village wear but she can’t be older than say nine, but she must have contest skill. She throws a Pokeball and a Snorunt appears giggling and laughing happily with its trainer. “Let’s battle, as soon as you send out your Pokemon the timer will start,”<br />
<br />
What will you do now?<br />
<br />
(Note you can lose points for attacks missing, attacks not being graceful or coordinated, attacks looking ugly and if you get hit. But if you sue a combo your opponents points can go down if it hits/works)<br />

Jeremiah smiles and nods as he takes your hand and begins to drag you a few feet forward before he lets go and just stares into space and begins to talk simply and clearly. “You may not considered yourself the requirements of the person I’m looking for, but you’ll fit the bill,” he jokes as he reaches into his pocket and brings out a pocket watch of sorts. Its shiny silver with a little twisty top to change the time on it, on the cover is a symbol of what appears to be a Regirock. He pushes a button on the front which flips it open revealing a normal analogue clock with a seconds and minutes hand as well as the numbers written around the side in roman numerals. He places it in your hands and smiles happily. “This is a pocket watch, when ever your in trouble press the top bit, don’t worry its not magic or anything,” he winks. *Obtained Regirock Pocket Watch*. Jeremiah walks away a few steps and looks back and waves his arm. “Come on then!” he says rather rudely but in a friendly way. “We’re off the to the Temple Grounds, any questions before we go?”<br />

(You can you know just say he evolved and RP with a Vigoroth, but I’ll evolve it in your update then. Just to be fun ;D)<br />
<br />
Sleepy looks up to you, his body begins to glow, he becomes taller, his arms change into two long furry claws with sharp ends, however his eyes become angry with rage as he looks at you. You can sense that Vigoroth is a furious and pretty deadly Pokemon. Vigoroth’s claw begins to pulse with electrical energy as he swipes at Aipom causing thunder damage and knocking the poor monkey back into the nearest tree. Aipom screams at the top of its lungs “AIPOM!!!!!” its mouth wide open and its sharp teeth showing as Aipom uses its tail to point threateningly at Sleepy (or whatever his new name is). The Aipom then charges at Vigoroth glowing orange with rage, Aipom smashes into Vigoroth and causes serious damage to both Pokemon, it appears it used Double-edge. Aipom lands on the ground slightly tired, however he notices Vigoroth getting ready for its Scratch onslaught and jumps back to its feet. Vigoroth then runs at Aipom and scratches again and again, Aipom avoiding a few though, both Pokemon stare at each other sinisterly as you watch on at your new more powerful Pokemon. <br />

You command Drift’s new attacks as Sonia just stares and begins to play on her flute; however this time a dissonant tune, the water in the river becomes violent, as it sends six large streams of water up into the air. You are completely surrounded by water, finding it harder and harder to breathe each second you feel yourself fading away as your eyes close and Drift vanishes from your sight. <br />
<br />
You open your eyes slowly, your arms are spread out to both sides of you, as well as your legs, you look around and notice two Aqua guards blocking the nearest door out of this room. The room is dark mostly, two windows are placed high up on the left and right side walls, you can’t seem to move any muscle in your body however you are chained (vertically) to what appears to be a large slab of concrete. The door whooshes open and two people walk in, one a woman with bright blue hair and a leader Aqua uniform on and the other a bloke with an aqua suit on. The both laugh as the guy brings out a jar, containing within it a strange purple sphere and three tentacles sticking out of it. “Thank Sonia for capturing you,” he says sarcastically as he begins to unscrew the lid. “This is a Tentacool parasite we created loaded with some very reactive chemicals, we need someone to test this out on, of course a Tentacool will be growing inside of you but we need to see what the chemicals effects are on humans,” the woman explains as the man pulls out the sphere of Tentacool-ness and places it on your stomach. It sits there for a second and then begins to dig its way into your body. It finally vanishes, the skin it tore while digging seems to heal its self up almost instantly. You begin to squirm and wriggle about as you can feel it move through your body until it suddenly stops. You take a deep breath as your vision begins to go blurry.<br />
<br />
“Note, it has taken effect, now lets go and leave this mutating child here,” the guy says snobbishly as everyone leaves and the chains snap off leaving you lying on the table. Two small tentacles burst their way through your stomach and begin to wriggle, each second they get slightly longer as the Tentacool gets bigger and bigger, its actually living off you now. You look over at the door and you can barely make out the arrow signs on it, “Left: Bosses Headquarters, Right: Laboratory” you read not knowing which way to go right now. But the Tentacool is growing and feeding, if you don’t fix it soon it could burst out of you and well that wouldn’t be good.<br />

You and Sonso float readily in the water, the old tougher Marill staring you down. Sonso fires loads of pretty pink bubbles at the Marill, each one popping and making it slightly drowsy, the younger Marill floats above it and tackles it straight in the head, snapping the older one out of it, making the effects of Yawn vanish. You look at Sonso who nods taking your second order into account. Sonso begins to concentrate, his muscles hardening and strengthening with each second, however at the same time giving up some of his speed to do so. The Marill watches on as Sonso does this attack, Sonso then swims directly at Marill who then swims directly at him in turn. The two hit each other on a head on collision, sending them both flying backwards, dealing damage to both. The younger Marill lightly headbutts the older one making it stop floating any further in the wrong direction. You swim up a few feet, catching your stronger Sonso in your arms and holding him tightly. You then let Sonso go as he swims slowly in front of you, clearly this battle isn’t over and won’t be easy for Sonso. The younger Marill seems to be helping the old one with each step<br />

You and Lanturn nod in unison ready to get this Cloyster out of the way and get on with the other tasks at hand, mainly Phoenix, Mudkip and the strange sapphire in question. Lanturn jumps into the air in a familiar fashion and fires a sphere of electricity at Cloyster, the electricity pulses through the Cloyster causing good electrical damage. Cloyster on the other hand just sits still completely. Both Pokemon sit staring at each other for a few seconds as Lanturn seizes this is the opportune time to strike with Supersonic. A high pitched irritating sound emerges from Lanturn, sound waves hit Cloyster having small effect due to its shell but still confusing nonetheless, Cloyster begins to look dizzy and confused after this point, however he manages to fire a Spike Cannon before the confusion takes full effect. Dozens of small pointed spikes fly at Lanturn, each one hitting for some damage, Cloyster laughs at its success and the fact he managed to keep you busy even this long. Lanturn starts to get mad she jumps into the air again and fires another small sphere of electricity, this one doing more damage than the last one. Cloyster starts to get mad and then dives down further into the water until you can no longer see it. You both wait for a few seconds, suddenly Lanturn flies up into the air as Cloyster pushes it up through the water, it appears it used a sneak dive attack. Lanturn lands back in the water, right next to Cloyster, the two Pokemon stare angrily at each other.<br />

You and Bulbasaur wander into the destination of the Jade Swamp, stagnant jade coloured waters surround the area as well as there being a few sinkholes plotted in various areas. You notice small bits of normal land covered with hardly any water or mud, a few bits none, you and your Pokemon pal hop over to a safe area of the land. You turn around and notice a few feet away a girl sitting on some clean ground eating a sandwich with a strange substance between the bread. You look at her as she takes another bite and rather loudly saying “hmmmm my favourite” after each small bite. She quickly acknowledges you, scanning you from top to bottom she stands up cautiously and smiles. She has purple hair and two side pigtails with little bows tying them up, bright green coloured eyes and is wearing a violet dress, it is clear she can’t be older than twelve. “Hello...sir...” she quickly adds nervously taking another bite of her delicious snack. “My name is April,” she said waving her hand slightly as she finishes her sandwich. “Are you here looking for the Jade Dragon like me?” she asks excitedly as she gets out a green notebook and a blue pen and begins to scribble on a page she swiftly opened to the notebook to.<br />
<br />
She slams the book quickly and goes back to smiling sweetly, she then looks down at Bulbasaur, she begins to pet its head softly and giggling slightly at your Pokemon’s cuteness, starting to get slightly tedious of your silence April then stands up again, looking up to you of course, and sighs. “So are you?” She asks one last time.<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: Yellow">As the Krabby scuttled away, Jon's mind wandered as he stared at the stone. In a state almost resembling sleep, transfixed, Jon recalled Arnoldii without emotion as he stared at the gem in the sand. He slowly pulled out hius hand to pick it up, and began to examine the stone, as he held it up to the sun.<br />
<br />
Half of Jon was waiting for something to happen next, like a magical happening ina game, where obtaining the stone would trigger an event, but the other half of him knew this couldn't be so. He looked intently at the beauty of the red stone. Jon always had an eye for beautiful things, and he had half a mind to keep the stone, or better yet, have it made into a pokeball, he thought King would enjoy the red stone pokeball home. Of course, such rare appraisals were rare in both cost and appearance, so the thought quickly left his mind. He just stood there, eyes focused, alone on the beach.</span></div>
