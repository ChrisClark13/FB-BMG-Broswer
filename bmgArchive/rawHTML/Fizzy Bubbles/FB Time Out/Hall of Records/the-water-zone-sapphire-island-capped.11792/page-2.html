<span style="font-size: 9px">Sorry about the delay here, finishing updates wasn't exactly the first thing in my mind at the point. But I got them done here. &gt;&gt;;<br />
<br />
Eon and Silver Wind, you both still need to send an answer to me. The rest of you got updates. Enjoy them, though they aren't my best...*fl33s*<br />
<br />
<span style="color: DarkRed"><b>~*Ruby Mountain*~</b> (<b>DarkRed</b>, please!)<br />
<br />
<b>~*Centin*~: </b><br />
You watched as you see your Natu take a peck on one of the signs. According to the sign, you were able to see that Lapis Lake was closer to Ruby Mountain than Emerald Village, so you and your little birdie make your way to the lake, hoping to reach Ruby Mountain so you could enter Crystal Peak.<br />
<br />
After a bit of a walk, you could see a sapphire-blue lake that was visible in your view, and you realized that this was Lapis Lake. You could see all the sorts of Water-Type Pokémon, like Lotad, Corphish, Horsea, and even some Surskits who skated across the water like sliding on stern ice. Though you wanted to say back to admire the view of the Pokémon in the lake, you mind sent a signal that you wanted to go to Crystal Peak inside. So, sighing as your looks gave a “Good-Bye” to the lake, you continue along, hoping that you’ll reach Ruby Mountain and Crystal Peak.<br />
<br />
Eventually, you did find yourself walking on a rocky pathway that sliced through Ruby Mountain, and realizing that the ground was sparkling with scarlet glitters, you somehow are in awe of the ground that you were standing nearby. You bended down, grabbing a fistful of soil, and it felt like you were carrying a pile of rubies within your own hands. Letting the soil slipping from your fingers, you were about to continue when you heard footsteps slowly approaching to your spot from up ahead! It’s unknown if this is a person that is friendly or not, but you might want to find a hiding spot! <br />
<br />
Looking around in your environment, you managed to spot a big boulder, big enough to hide you size, and you duck behind the rock, just avoiding the sight of the approaching stranger…popping you head ever so slightly to see where the noise was coming from, you realize with a jolt that it was not a person; it was, in fact, a Machop! It was carrying an item hidden underneath a small white cloth, and it was mumbling to itself, and you were able to distinguish the words “Rock…strife…stupid Geodudes…” before the Machop was slowly disappearing from your view. Shall you follow the strange Machop, or should you continue to Crystal Peak?</span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: darkred">&quot;Rock...strife...stupid geodudes...&quot; that machop slowly dissappears from his view. Centin however still hid behind the rock as he did not wish to take any chances, although theoritically his natu could take a machop down, he doesn't want any longer delays towards the Crystal Peak. He also wanted to avoid any unneccessary battles. Still, after hearing about stupid geodudes, he returned his natu into its pokeball. &quot;Axtan, return,&quot; and in goes his natu into its pokeball.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go, radii,&quot; and out comes his octillery. &quot;Heh, octillery. It's been a long time since you battled something, and since then you were a remoraid. Now, you are full-fledged octillery, you got that?&quot; Radii clinged onto Centin's right leg. This probably means that he sensed some footsteps via vibrations through the ground with his tentacles. &quot;Radii, we will hike up to the Crystal Peak. Stay close to me, we do not want to run into any machops nor geodudes. Geodudes may be easy for you, but machops, no. We have to push onwards,&quot; said Centin and both of them continued to the Crystal, ignoring both the machops and the said geodudes, if any cross their paths. However, should they be attacked by wild pokemon, Centin will not hestitate to battle.</span></div>

Krabby stops concentrating, staring at the woman. Glaring at you, the woman puts her hands on her hips, and attempts to communicate once more. &quot;No...Want...Treasure?&quot; She manages to say, before pointing at Krabby, and then Magneto. Your brain struggles to get her meaning, but too late. Angrily, she stomps forward, gives you another hard slap, and begins to walk off with Krabby. &quot;Krabu, et toi...Moron.&quot; You hear her mutter.<br />
<br />
Before she can get thirty feet away from you, however, she disappears from sight, and you can see Krabby scuttling back towards you. Hurriedly, it pinches your leg, and amazingly begins to drag you along with it. You find yourself looking into a rather large pitfall, and water is beginning to collect at the bottom. Lying in the water, the woman's once more unconcious form lays. If you don't hurry, she'll drown...and there's no knowing what made the hole in the first place...<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span>

Getting slapped twice in one adventure was bad... but by the same girl was even worse. Thed had enough of this and was going to jump into the water, but the girl was faster and walked off. Thed had to watch the beauty walk away because even though she slapped him nothing could've made him happier than staring at the bulbuous rear end of the native. Oh and she knew he was looking at her, she knew it, which made Thed even happier.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the girl disappears into the sand Thed thinking she just went over a sandy hill begins to unfold his surfboard out when suddenly the same Krabby starts bothering Thed. &quot;What do you want? Hey that hurts!&quot; Thed was dragged by the Krabby only to see that the girl was in some sort of sandy pit; the pit started to fill with water. Seeing no other way to save her Thed took off his shirt, dumping it next to the Krabby, and foolhardily jumped into the pit. Lifting the girl up once more Thed thought to himself, <i>She better not be setting me up or slap me again...</i> &quot;Wake up! C'mon this isn't the time to sleep! Hey Krabu you mind helping us out a bit here instead of just watching?&quot;</span></div>

I don't expect long replies for a battle ;D<br />
<br />
The Drailisk roars in defiance at Gaurdian, who roars equally as loud back. With a sound like an explosion, Drailisk dashes forward, entering the water with Gaurdian, who immediatly begins to THRASH about in an attempt to hit the creature. Gaurdian manages to slam its tail into one of the creatures heads, but the other one hits Gaurdian with a blast of bluish-green flames, an obvious DRAGONBREATH attack.<br />
<br />
Angry now, more angry than before, really, Gaurdian summons up the RAGE of DRAGONs, and a large Twister forms inbetween the two water titans. With a loud screech, the twin-headed monster bursts through the cyclone, and immediatly shoots twin BEAMs of ICE at Gaurdian, hitting him in his stomach, and freezing it over lightly. Roaring in agony, the sea serpent blasts forward through the water, BITING down painfully into the Drailisk's left neck. The other head responds in kind, managing to get past Gaurdian's scales and into its flesh. With a cry, Gaurdian releases the left head, as the right one reappears, something blue and red held tightly in its teeth...<br />
<br />
What will you do?

</blockquote>&quot;Guardian, this Drailisk seems of a similar ability of yourself, so we're going to have to use tactics to defeat it!&quot; Tom yelled as Guardian moved back towards Tom, shaking off the damage it had suffered. Guardian roared valiantly as it scowled at the multiple-headed creature, who's main offensive tool seemed to be it's heads. &quot;Guardian, Flamethrower Drailisk immediately! Hopefully the heat of the flame should melt the ice on you. After that, use Surf to further damage the beast, then while it is recovering from that, bite into it's neck(s) again!</span></div>

Smiling, the man replied &quot;The name is Hanson. As for my Pokemon...I daresay you've seen anything of the sort around here. I've yet to see any Pokemon from my home region of Lehm here...&quot; He then trailed off, plucking two Pokeballs from his belt. &quot;Ah, I believe I shall use these two. <a href="http://www.hwachong.edu.sg/~y05hci263/trogly.gif" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hwachong.edu.sg%2F%7Ey05hci263%2Ftrogly.gif&amp;hash=a1d4c8e45cf7095fd0bd9035efc9d556" rel="nofollow noopener">Trogly</a> and <a href="http://www.hwachong.edu.sg/~y05hci263/arkoud_full.gif" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hwachong.edu.sg%2F%7Ey05hci263%2Farkoud_full.gif&amp;hash=7b1b666175bb3bbc69569e841e4f063a" rel="nofollow noopener">Arkound</a>!&quot; The two Pokemon appear, Trogly hopping once or twice on the soft forest floor, and Arkound scratching at the ground, looking around at all the vegetation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, as to your inquiry, I had always planned to show you what I am researching. Most all trainers are inquisitive, and I rightfully assumed you were no different. Now, let us begin. Best of luck to you Kaya!&quot; Hanson says, stepping back away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arkound, let's start off with a nice <b>HIDDEN POWER</b>, and then <b>ICE BEAM</b>. Pick your own targets. You two have done this often enough, so you shouldn't squabble. Trogly, begin with a <b>MUDDY WATER</b>, and then <b>SECRET POWER</b>!&quot;<br />
<br />
Your orders?</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: LimeGreen">Kaya blinked, &quot;The Lehm region ..?&quot; she whispered as Hanson wished her luck and began to order his pokemons attacks. As he did so, Kaya eyed the two pokemon in shock, having never seen them before. Shaking her head, and trying to focus her concentration, she nodded to Rini and Sakura who waited for their attacks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Sakura, fire a rapid <b>Acid</b> at Arkound as fast as you can. Aim for the face. Follow up with <b>Magical Leaf</b> aimed at Trogly. Then <b>Growth</b>&quot; Sakura screeched a little then readyed her lethal Acid attack. Kaya then turned to her Poison Bag pokemon, &quot;Okay Rini. Use <b>Toxic</b> on Arkound, then release a <b>Poison Gas</b> into the air. Finish off with <b>Amnesia</b>&quot; Kaya then quickly remembered something, &quot;Rini, Sakura .. remember to work together and help protect each other!&quot; Rini smiled dopily and then looked to Sakura, nodding gently, to which Sakura blushed and resumed readying herself to fight. Kaya smiled and proclaimed, &quot;Lets do this Hanson!&quot;</span></div>

<article class="message-body js-selectToQuote">
<div class="bbWrapper">Well hello there people of the Water Zone, I Torky Stu have risen to the rank of updater at this very zone. My group includes those of the following:<br />
<br />
HakuBlue<br />
JAF<br />
Wayne<br />
Bloody Banette<br />
Jerichi<br />
John's Knight<br />
Jon Jen<br />
<br />
I am currently waiting for zone starting posts from Haku and Wayne, please post as soon as possible or I’ll sadly have to post my first set without you. D:<br />
<br />
Now I have some carefully thought out rules, read and learn my updatees and follow them like the word of law, since they are the law now :3 <br />
<br />
1) Update Speed - I'll try to update weekly or fortnightly, however please be aware that I have school and I’m in Year ten so this year and next I’ll be loaded with Coursework and exams, yayyayayayay fun! Right? In other words please stick by me and don't go all wining if I don't post updates every week or fortnight.<br />
<br />
2) Replying Style - I have a few points I need to make on this, firstly if you reply is really long could you please split it into paragraphs if you don't already do that? It's really hard to update a big chunk of text, remember only if it's really long. Also follow the replying rules and try to write at least three lines, if possible. Also quote my replies and post in your correct colour.<br />
<br />
3) Replying Speed - I'm not forcing you to reply as quickly as possible, but try to reply regularly but I will do reposts if you miss an update so it will be easier to find your last update.<br />
<br />
4) Battles - While in a battle use a minimum of two attacks and a maximum of three, or battles will last forever. Also keep battles fair, if they have one Pokemon, use one if not I’ll do what most updaters do and put one (or however many Pokemon needed to make the battle fair) of your Pokemon in a situation so they can't continue.<br />
<br />
5) Items Use - Any healing items can be used yes, but not loads all the time or that’s cheating and cheapens the adventure, one or two is fine with me though. Also if you are given any one of kind items by me then they only have importance in this adventure.<br />
<br />
6) Have Fun - Doesn't that (*Thwaps wrong word*) speak for itself?<br />
<br />
7) Fizzy Bubbles Information - Keep a link in your sig to your regi post and please keep it up to date with all levels and attacks.<br />
<br />
I'll post updates soon, I just wanted to tell you guys your in my group and well explain my rules. <br />
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: LimeGreen">Emerald Jungle: Please reply in <b>LimeGreen</b><br />
<br />
<b>Joshua:</b> (Thanks Joshua ^^ I'm enjoying updating this battle) As Salamence’s lethal Hyper Beam is let loose, Hayley glows black and then disappears just in time as the Hyper Beam zooms past her blurred figure. Salamence roars in rage, looking about for Hayley, but its too late as she slams into his side, knocking the wind out of the majestic pokemon. Charging an Ice Punch, she slams it into his jaw, and knocks Salamence away from her. As Salamence turns back, his Scary Face consisting of a dislocated jaw and intimidating eyes causing Hayley to gasp and back off slightly, not being able to charge her Dragonbreath. Narius smirks as Salamence glows white and then launches himself into Hayley, dealing some harsh damage with a Double-Edge. Salamence flinches with recoil damage however and is left wide open for Hayley’s now charged Dragonbreath which is flying towards him.<br />
<br />
Narius watches in horror as Salamence is engulfed by the blue-green flames, dealing heavy damage. Both Hayley and Salamence are panting heavily and are running low on energy and health. The next round could be the last for either combatant. Narius bites down on his bottom lip as he glares at you and sharply states, “We won’t lose!” What will you do?<br />
<br />
<b>Dark Scizor:</b> Releasing Ledian, Arbok eyes you curiously, and then rears up yet again, remaining headstrong in his challenge for a battle. The markings on Arboks belly begin to glow as a holographic image of it appears, the Glare attack stunning Ledian just as it begins to charge a Psybeam. Arbok then lurches forwards and Bites down hard on Ledian, who cries in pain but then releases the Psybeam, knocking the Cobra pokemon backwards. Ledian then moves in for a Tackle but Arbok manages to swat it off course with a Slam. Ledian lands on the ground and gets up quickly, its fist glowing white. Suddenly, Alice shouts out, “IZUMI!” as the blind Mankey runs off through some shrubbery, unaware that Alice and yourself weren’t following. Arbok, distracted turns to look at Alice, bearing his fangs, but is pelted by a Comet Punch and is sent hurling onto the ground, stunned.<br />
Alice runs off, and you begin to follow her with Ledian until a swipe of Arbok’s tail knocks you off your feet. Landing on your back with a thud, which knocks the breath out of you. Arbok stares right at you, hissing wildly. Ledian suddenly knocks into it for a Tackle, keeping it away from you. Getting up, you try to escape, but the pack of Ekans are blocking all exits. Alice is beyond the bushes, but you can still hear her. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: Cyan">Lapis Lake: Please reply in <b>Cyan</b><br />
<br />
<b>Joe:</b> As Shifditto launched itself towards Shiftry, it raised its arm high in the air as it readied itself to whack Shiftry on the head. Instead, Shifditto only whacked the air, as Shiftry darted out of the way with his awesome speed and had manoeuvred himself around to the back of Shifditto. Shifditto looks around confused as Shiftry smashes into its back with a lethal Mega Kick. You hear a sickening crack as the Mega Kick snaps off some of Shifditto’s wooden body, which lands on the ground and turns to pink goo and then wriggles back to Shifditto, reattaching itself. Shifditto turns and uses Bullet Seed right in Shiftry’s eyes. Shiftry stumbles backwards and cries out in pain and fires a Leech Seed at random which lands on Shifditto’s nose and begins to sprout. Shifditto then leaps back and glares at Shiftry, charging a Shadow Ball inbetween his leaves.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Ivy opens her mouth and sends a barrage of seeds which collides with Ludicolos and they cancel each other out. As Ludicolo dances towards her for a Focus Punch, Ivy closes her eyes and concentrates for a second and sends 3 huge Sludge Bombs at Ludicolo. All 3 collide and seep into his skin, causing super effective Poison damage and Ludicolo glows purple for a second .. Seems hes poisoned.<br /> 
<br />
Ludicolo then looks at Shifditto, who abandons its Shadow Ball and they nod at each other as they try to ambush Ivy. Shifditto launches itself in to the air and drops down, landing in front of Ivy, and he glows Purple, lifting Ivy off the ground with its Extrasensory, causing Ivy extreme pain. She drops to the ground, seemingly lifeless until she glows a brilliant white! Her form triples in size as a huge flower blossoms from her back, the petals on full view to the sky above. Joy squeals in delight, “Ivy, you evolved!” Ivy looked back to Joy and nodded solemnly, and used a Vine Whip, sending Shifditto flying into Ludicolo, the two landing in a heap in front of the both of you. Both of them struggle up and are glaring right at you, waiting for you to make the first move. What will you do?<br />
<br />
<b>Politically Incorrect:</b> It’s a beautiful sunny day, the sun is shining and the air is fresh. Dratini is happily slithering along and you follow her casually, and you begin to see Lapis Lake through some bushes. Going through them, theres a woman standing at the bank, with a Glalie and a Walrein in the lake, firing Ice Beams, which are creating huge columns of ice that are about 12 foot high. You walk closer and you suddenly realise who the woman is; she has curly blonde hair, and wear a long purple dress with a waist clincher. She turns around and her icy blue eyes stare right at you and then drop down to Dratini, and a faint smile comes over her face.<br />
<br />
“Oh a Dratini, such a rare Pokemon. You don’t see them around Hoenn, where I’m from, such a hot land..” You blink as Dratini sits still and eyes the woman who then blinks, apparently snapping out of her daydream. “Oh I’m sorry, my name is Glacia, you may of heard of me, I’m a member of the Hoenn Elite 4. And you are?” Glalie and Walrein turn and come over to you, Glalie floats around Dratini, who is quite scared. And Walrein sits next to his trainer as she strokes his snowwhite mane. Glacia looks at you, waiting for your response. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: SeaGreen">Jade Swamp: Please reply in <b>SeaGreen</b><br />
<br />
<b>Sasuke-san:</b> Taking note of your orders, Enma eyes the rocks on the ground and tries to figure out a way to turn them into a barrage of rocks. Suddenly, an idea graces him and he leaps into the air and lands hard on the ground which coincidentally launches some of the rocks into the air from the force. He then begins to kick and punch the rocks lightly, but with enough force to send them hurtling towards Kabutops to hit him with force. Doing so successfully, his kicks and punches send the rocks in groups which smack Kabutops right on the top of his head, each one causing moderate damage as when the barrage subsides, you can see a crack in Kabutops’ armor. Enma lands on the ground and pants slightly, his wound bleeding ever so slightly more. Remembering to use Rock Tomb, he begins to hurl rocks around Kabutops, but they just sink into the thick swamp waters and only cause minor damage as they do so.<br />
<br />
Enma then dives off the bank, and his right fist glows with energy as he cracks Kabutops on the head with a severe Karate Chop which causes extreme pain for Kabutops who Screeches at Enma and then launches the Fighting type off his head with a swipe of his scythe. Enma lands with a thud on the bank, but its not as bad as it seems. The crack on Kabutops’ head is now large and there is now soft tissue visible. Kabutops is clearly in pain, holding his head and Screeching at the top of his lungs. Kabutops begins to thrash about, wildly sending Slashes around which barely miss you. How will you react?</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: DarkRed">Ruby Mountain: Please reply in <b>DarkRed</b><br />
<br />
<b>Lonely Wanderer:</b> After issuing your attacks, Cryseye’s eye glow a bright white before the tunnel floods with light, allowing you to see. With Zubat now visible, it makes the battle a tad easier for both of you. Zubat panicks slightly as the veil of darkness is lifted and launches herself towards Cryseye, fangs beared ready for a Bite attack. Cryseye calmly hops into the air, dodging the prospective attack and powers her fist with Ice energy and smacks it into Zubat’s wing, sending the bat flying towards the ground with a damaged wing. Cryseye then sends a black thunderbolt shaped beam of energy towards Zubat, but the bat hears it coming and manages to get airborne, only taking a small part of the attack.<br />
<br />
Zubat then opens her mouth and begins to emit Supersonic rays towards Cryseye. Holding her head in pain and feeling slightly confused, Cryseye stumbles about as Zubat flies forward and latches her teeth into Cryseye’s head, draining her with a Leech Life, stealing some precious health and energy. What will you do?</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DeepSkyBlue">Hey all. Well here's my first set of updates, I know Haku and Wayne I said i'd wait but when you guys post i'll do a single update for you both as soon as possible, alright? Well sorry they are a tad on the shortish side but they will be until I get into your adventures and then they become longer, well enough talking onto updates.<br />
<br />
Also one last thing, some of you will have adventures that will take you to another area to do something like a task or to meet someone (ect) the update when you arive there will be in the colour for that area and under that heading, to avoid later questions on that.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: Yellow"><div style="text-align: center">~Southern Beach~ (Colour - Yellow)<br />
<br />
<b>Jon Jen</b>:&#8203;</div>You and your timid Oddish, named Arnoldii, look around the vast beach carefully, spotting the golden coloured sand, the bright sunlight shinning in your eyes and the view of the beautiful and tranquil sparkle of the ocean. You walk a few steps, each one creating a sand dent replica of the shape and size of your foot; however the imprints fade away seconds later due to the lightness of your steps. You look back at Arnoldii who is trying to keep up with you by running; suddenly a shiny red claw bursts from the golden sand and smashes into the small leaf creature, making it fall and land on the ground in front of you. You run to his aid and then stare at the pincer claw, it begins to move and twitch as you see a few legs, followed by two eyes, another pincer and more legs and you instantly know this Pokemon is a Krabby.<br />
<br />
The crab Pokemon giggles superciliously, it swiftly darts at you raising one claw and firing a few blue spheres at you. Each one makes an instant and powerful impact, looks like that was Krabby’s Bubble attack. A split second later you notice in Krabby’s other claw a strange fire red coloured gem; it could be a ruby perhaps or some kind of special item, who’s to know for sure? The Krabby then scuttles away from you both at a rough distance so it is in a good place for battle.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: Lime"><div style="text-align: center">~Emerald Jungle~ (Colour - LimeGreen)<br />
<br />
<b>John's Knight</b>:&#8203;</div>With Sleepy by your side you head to the Emerald Jungle happily awaiting an awesome adventure and lots of interesting Pokemon to see. Upon arriving many tens of minutes later you look around the thickly leaved trees with various fruits growing out of them as well as the strange coloured plants sprouting fro the ground. You look up into a tree, with weird shaped and coloured tail winds its way around the branch and snaps a bit of fruit off, the tail then goes back into the tree and then comes out once again to do the same. The tail itself is purple with a strange hand shape at the end, suddenly a small purple Pokemon lunges out of the tree and lands in front of you with a piece of fruit in its hands. You acknowledge the Pokemon’s creepy smile and staring eyes catch you off guard as it runs for sleepy and begins to tickle him. The <a href="http://www.dpent.ca/Images/aipomban.jpg" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpent.ca%2FImages%2Faipomban.jpg&amp;hash=a4ab6b35355f79fe7cdefb14aac82e18" rel="nofollow noopener">Aipom</a> then looks up at you, smiling evilly; it suddenly climbs up your arm and begins to tickle you, making you shake to knock it off.<br />
<br />
The Aipom lands on the ground with a hard thud, it screams at you viciously. “AI POM AI AIPOM!” It then begins to dig in the soil, little piles build up either side of the small hole as you can see the Aipom moving slightly. The Aipom raises it’s head again, giving you an evil grin as it holds up a shiny green jewel, known as an emerald, however not just any emerald, the emeralds in the Emerald Jungle are said to have growth enhancing properties. The Aipom then squeezes the emerald, the Aipom then gets slightly bigger but looks a lot meaner and tougher, it laughs one last time before throwing the emerald into a near by patch of leaves (trees and wood to for that matter), the Aipom then climbs angrily to a branch of the nearest tree ready for the battle. You can see it quite clearly since it isn’t too high up, head on attacks will fail but attacks like Flamethrower and such will be quite useful.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: MediumTurquoise"><div style="text-align: center">~Turquoise River~ (Colour - MediumTurquoise)<br />
<br />
<b>Jerichi</b>:&#8203;</div>Arriving at the Turquoise River you can see your reflection in the crystal clear water, you see various fish and water type Pokemon swim and float along in the current, you suddenly feel a cold blast of water as you look around to see a Magikarp flailing and splashing away in and out of the water each second. The Magikarp is slightly larger than any normal one, due to the special waters said to flow through this rive, suddenly a Pokeball flies toward the Magikarp, upon contact the sphere flips open and engulfs the Magikarp in a beautiful white light. The Pokeball rocks once, then twice, then a third time before it suddenly clicks and a red light flashing in the centre. The ball suddenly vanishes as you pivot round on your foot and see a woman about your height holding a blue Pokedex and smiling. “One more ‘Karp, boss I haven’t yet found the Psyduck you wanted, but all these Magikarp will make perfect Gyarados,” she says to the Pokedex as a mumbled voice responds causing her to laugh as a reaction. She then notices you, you stare into her blank blue eyes, she then takes off her hat type thing causing long brown hair to fall down past her shoulders, you quickly notice she is wearing a Team Aqua uniform. <br />
<br />
“I see. You’ve been ease dropping have you? Well I Sonia of Team Aqua shall stop you right here! Come on out Tentacool!” Sonia shouts as she throws a red and white sphere high up into the air, the ball flips open, creating the form of a jellyfish in the water. Tentacool looks up at you from the water ready for a fight.<br />
<br />
What will you do now?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: cyan"><div style="text-align: center">~Lapis Lake~ (Colour - Cyan)<br />
<br />
<b>Bloody Banette</b>:&#8203;</div>You arrive at the wonderful Lapis Lake, with your Spheal by your side every step of the way. You examine the water in the lake, it looks a sort of dark purple colour instead of the excepted clear blue, suddenly a head emerges from the water, followed by a body with a blue mouse Pokemon held in her hands. You look at the person, noticing she is in fact a woman, after a closer look you realise its Nurse Joy holding a Marill. Nurse Joy spins once and then suddenly changes into her uniform (check anime for more details on her looks), she places the Marill on the ground and begins spraying it with a potion, however the spray coming out of the bottle is a slight dimmer colour than usual. “All better,” she says softly as the Marill opens its eyes slowly before taking one large breath. <br />
<br />
Nurse Joy then stands up and looks at you, her eyes fixed firmly on Spheal. “I’m sorry but could you help me?” Joy asks politely as she once again picks up the Marill. “My Chansey nurses saved the rest of the Pokemon in this river, however I stayed behind to save the three Marill, but I could only save this one, I need to take this one back to my Pokemon Centre in Devon Settlement. The river isn’t too deep but could you just dive in there and get the other two Marill for me then bring them to my centre?” she asks in a worried tone before shedding a few tears. <br />
<br />
“Please….?”<br />
<br />
What will you do now?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: SeaGreen"><div style="text-align: center">~Jade Swamp~ (Colour - Sea Green)<br />
<br />
<b>JAF</b>:&#8203;</div>You, Chinchou, Gyarados and your starter Pokemon Croconaw all begin to walk, or swim toward your desired destination the Jade Swamp. You notice Gyarados finding it harder to swim as the water turns murky and thick with a stagnant layer of a solid, liquid muddy mix on top. The ground becomes hard to walk on; you can clearly hear the squelching of the mud as your feet push down so you can take another step toward the centre of the swamp, which actually has liquid water. You finally reach the water with your Pokemon, the ground around you is less muddy than the other areas, but since it has water it doesn’t mean its fresh, it’s a jade colour, hence the name, with little air bubbles popping every few seconds. Suddenly a small blue head pops up through the mud, with a huge fin on its head, you realise it’s a Mudkip, a rare water type. <br />
<br />
“Poliwag get that sapphire. Tackle it now!” a voice bellows from behind you as you see a small blue sphere Pokemon smash into the Mudkip at full force making a sapphire shaped object fly out of it’s hand and onto the ground just behind you. The Mudkip and Poliwag land on the ground behind you next to Chinchou and Croconaw, while Gyarados stays in the water. You see a man, just taller than you walk slowly toward the sapphire; he bends down and plucks it up with his hand and then smiles. He then looks at you and snorts. “This is one of the five sapphires, your not getting your filthy hands on it kid!” he shouts as you notice his wild green eyes and untamed black hair stopping at his shoulders in length, he’s wearing clothes the normal kind of trainer would wear except there is something different about him.<br />
<br />
“Poliwag we got to get the next one, we’ll use Cloyster to handle this fool!” He shouts as a red and white sphere flies past you and flips quickly open sending a white light into the water. The light suddenly takes form as a strange Pokemon, with a purple coloured shell, huge spikes rising from it and two piercing eyes in between its shell where its head rests. <br />
<br />
What will you do now?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: deepskyblue">Enjoy ^^;<br />

He snached a small ball of his belt, and pitched it out towards the Tentacool. A small blue bird, with cottony clouds for wings and a small white beak, matrialized in front of Tetsu. &quot;Blue!&quot; it cooed when the light faded. &quot;Ok, Drift.

<span style="font-size: 9px">Heres another set of updates. PI, you're now in my group. Enjoy =) <br />

<span style="color: Cyan">Lapis Lake: Please reply in <b>Cyan</b><b>Politically Incorrect:</b> It’s a beautiful sunny day, the sun is shining and the air is fresh. Dratini is happily slithering along and you follow her casually, and you begin to see Lapis Lake through some bushes. Going through them, theres a woman standing at the bank, with a Glalie and a Walrein in the lake, firing Ice Beams, which are creating huge columns of ice that are about 12 foot high. You walk closer and you suddenly realise who the woman is; she has curly blonde hair, and wear a long purple dress with a waist clincher. She turns around and her icy blue eyes stare right at you and then drop down to Dratini, and a faint smile comes over her face.<br />
<br />
“Oh a Dratini, such a rare Pokemon. You don’t see them around Hoenn, where I’m from, such a hot land..” You blink as Dratini sits still and eyes the woman who then blinks, apparently snapping out of her daydream. “Oh I’m sorry, my name is Glacia, you may of heard of me, I’m a member of the Hoenn Elite 4. And you are?” Glalie and Walrein turn and come over to you, Glalie floats around Dratini, who is quite scared. And Walrein sits next to his trainer as she strokes his snowwhite mane. Glacia looks at you, waiting for your response. What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: Cyan">Brushing aside some bushes, Stephen and Dratini come to their destination, Lapis Lake. Taking in the sunny atmosphere, it doesn't take long for him to notice a woman standing on the bank, commanding a pair of Pokemon in the water-a Glalie and a Walrein. Stephen watches with interest as an erratic beam of ice energy flies from their mouth and creates a column of ice, one for each, reaching roughly twelve feet high into the air bobbing in the clear water. The woman notices Stephen, and his Dratini, and walks over to them. Knowing that he had seen her somewhere, Stephen listens intently as she speaks.<br />
<br />
“Oh a Dratini, such a rare Pokemon. You don’t see them around Hoenn, where I’m from, such a hot land..” she says in a daydream voice. Scanning his memories in an attempt to figure out who the mysterious woman was, Stephen realizes where he had saw her before-in a brief excursion of his to Mossdeep City, he had saw a poster outlining 5 trainers-one who specialized in dark types, another in ghosts, another in ice, one in dragons, and the final in steel type Pokemon-the Elite Four and the Champion. Even as he realizes who the woman was, he still politely listens. <br />
<br />
“Oh I’m sorry, my name is Glacia, you may of heard of me, I’m a member of the Hoenn Elite 4. And you are?” <br />
<br />
His suspicions confirmed, Stephen smiles. &quot;It's an honor to meet such an accomplished and skillful Pokemon trainer,&quot; he says, &quot;My name is Stephen. I grew up in New Bark Town, however, I never trained much in Johto. I really don't specialize in any type.&quot; he says, finishing off rather weakly.<br />
<br />
However, an idea pops into his head. Pulling out a pair of Pokeballs, Stephen asks Glacia, &quot;Would you like to battle? I'd like to test out my skills against the ice type.&quot;</span></div>

~Southern Beach~ (Colour - Yellow)<br />
<br />
Jon Jen:<br />
<br />
You and your timid Oddish, named Arnoldii, look around the vast beach carefully, spotting the golden coloured sand, the bright sunlight shinning in your eyes and the view of the beautiful and tranquil sparkle of the ocean. You walk a few steps, each one creating a sand dent replica of the shape and size of your foot; however the imprints fade away seconds later due to the lightness of your steps. You look back at Arnoldii who is trying to keep up with you by running; suddenly a shiny red claw bursts from the golden sand and smashes into the small leaf creature, making it fall and land on the ground in front of you. You run to his aid and then stare at the pincer claw, it begins to move and twitch as you see a few legs, followed by two eyes, another pincer and more legs and you instantly know this Pokemon is a Krabby.<br />
<br />
The crab Pokemon giggles superciliously, it swiftly darts at you raising one claw and firing a few blue spheres at you. Each one makes an instant and powerful impact, looks like that was Krabby’s Bubble attack. A split second later you notice in Krabby’s other claw a strange fire red coloured gem; it could be a ruby perhaps or some kind of special item, who’s to know for sure? The Krabby then scuttles away from you both at a rough distance so it is in a good place for battle.<br />
<br />
What will you do?

</blockquote><span style="color: Yellow">Jon was a bit surprised as the crustacean's claw suddenly attacked Arnoldii, who fell down. Jon did rush to its side, but no sooner had the red pokemon crabwalked away from the two. Jon leaned down to Arnoldii's side.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was mean of him, huh Arnoldii?&quot; Jon sighed, dusting the small blue plant off. Arnoldii nodded weakly. &quot;Well, see here, Krabby!&quot; Jon yelled to the Krabby. &quot;I don't take kindly to ruffians! Let's show him a thing or... whoa!&quot; Jon immediately stopped, as a bright sparkle of light caught the stone held in the Krabby's pincer. &quot;That is a beautiful stone!&quot; Jon marveled, as he plucked Arnoldii up from the sand and ran in just a bit closer, but not enough to startle the Krabby, to marvel at the gem. &quot;I simply must have it!&quot; Jon shouted. Arnoldii was embrassaed by his trainer, and hung his head. &quot;I mean, you've gotta have a chance for revenge too, don't you Arnoldii?&quot; Jon played off his selfish attempt at obtaining a jewel. Arnoldii wasn't fooled, and was already hesitant to fight in any case, he ran behind his trainer's legs.<br />
<br />
But Jon would have none of this. He bent down, and pushed Arnoldii back in front of him, intent on having the timid Oddish battle. &quot;Come on now, don't be shy!&quot; Jon assured it, as he gestured for it to confront the Krabby. Nervously, it did so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Arnoldii!&quot; Jon yelled. &quot;Begin with an <b>Absorb</b> attack! Then use <b>Absorb</b> twice more!&quot; Jon finished. Jon wasn't quite sure about his &quot;strategy&quot; though. &quot;The only attack Arnoldii can use is <b>Absorb</b>... Even if it is super effective, that doesn't leave me with a lot of options for battle...&quot; Jon thought to himself. &quot;I'll have to come up with another tactic.&quot;</span></div>

<span style="color: limegreen">Skrusti: Pikachu eyes Cid as he sidesteps towards her and smiles, as if to say, “Whoa there shock stuff, those electric sacs send jolts down my spine!” Pikachu blushes slightly, but your plan backfires as she begins to shake her backside, Attracting Cid who blushes in return and then coo’s softly at Pikachu. The two have managed to attract each other, however, Pikachu’s will to attack is slightly higher than Cids. Cid, with two pink love hearts in her eyes, begins to crackle with electricity as Pikachu does also, showing Cid just how good those electric sacs of hers were. They both shoot off the attacks and they collide in the middle of them, sending off tendrils of electricity in all directions. The rain continues to pour down as Pikachu launches a Thundershock which connects with Cid, leaving him a little surprised that his ‘love’ would shock him causing the Attract to wear off slightly. Running towards Pikachu with a glowing fist, he smacks it into her cheek and shes sent flying backwards into a tree. She struggles up as Cid feels his feelings for her reignite. Pikachu growls again and then uses Double Team, creating 5 Pikachu clones. What will you do?</span>

</blockquote>Sorry for not replying sooner...things happened :/<br />
<br />
<span style="color: limegreen">Jeff watches as the two electric types coo and flirt with each other. Groaning, he puts his face in his hands, until he hears a crackle of electricity. Peering through his fingers, he lets out a 'meep' as the two electric attacks collide, sending small tendrils of pain in every direction. Jeff falls to the ground as a particularily large one flies past his head, and he looks up just in time to see Cid running forward, energy gathered on his fist.<br />
<br />
Wincing slightly, Jeff watches as Cid slams his fist into the Pikachu, who slams into a tree. Getting up, the Pikachu lets out a growl and then splits into 6 copies. Damned <b>DOUBLE TEAM</b>. Thinking, Jeff then grinned. &quot;Cid, give it a love tap. <b>QUICK ATTACK</b> through those clones to find the right one, and then <b>MEGA PUNCH</b> her! Add in a <b>METRONOME</b> if you feel like being random!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff hoped the way he said his orders would allow Cid to attack.</span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px">Heres another set of updates. PI, you're now in my group. Enjoy =) <br />
<br />
<span style="color: LimeGreen">Emerald Jungle: Please reply in <b>LimeGreen</b><br />
<br />
<b>Joshua:</b> (Thanks Joshua ^^ I'm enjoying updating this battle) As Salamence’s lethal Hyper Beam is let loose, Hayley glows black and then disappears just in time as the Hyper Beam zooms past her blurred figure. Salamence roars in rage, looking about for Hayley, but its too late as she slams into his side, knocking the wind out of the majestic pokemon. Charging an Ice Punch, she slams it into his jaw, and knocks Salamence away from her. As Salamence turns back, his Scary Face consisting of a dislocated jaw and intimidating eyes causing Hayley to gasp and back off slightly, not being able to charge her Dragonbreath. Narius smirks as Salamence glows white and then launches himself into Hayley, dealing some harsh damage with a Double-Edge. Salamence flinches with recoil damage however and is left wide open for Hayley’s now charged Dragonbreath which is flying towards him.<br />
<br />
Narius watches in horror as Salamence is engulfed by the blue-green flames, dealing heavy damage. Both Hayley and Salamence are panting heavily and are running low on energy and health. The next round could be the last for either combatant. Narius bites down on his bottom lip as he glares at you and sharply states, “We won’t lose!” What will you do?</span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote>(OOC: I shall then endeavour to end this round with aplomb!)<br />
<br />
<span style="color: Lime">Joshua watches in awe at the power displayed by the dragons, the column of shimmering orange power blasting from the massive blue behemoth. Hayley's emerald form fades into the darkness, before slamming into Salamence's side.<br />
<br />
A shimmer of blue coats Hayley's hand, before slamming it into Salamence's jaw. It looks like it hurt, but Salamence uses this to his advantage with a Scary Face. Hayley flinches, and pays the price as Salamence slams into her with a Double-Edge.<br />
<br />
A glistening blaze of emerald and sapphire flames bursts from Hayley's mouth, striking the Salamence for some major damage. Joshua's attention, however, is snapped up by Narius, who cries out, &quot;We won't lose.&quot;<br />
<br />
A malicious smile dances across Joshua's face, and he calls up to Hayley. &quot;Hayley, finish this! Zip in with a Faint Attack, then sink your fangs into Salamence's throat with a Crunch attack! Then finish up by using your Strength to give Salamence by the throat, and hurl it to the ground!&quot;</span></div>

<b>Joe:</b> As Shifditto launched itself towards Shiftry, it raised its arm high in the air as it readied itself to whack Shiftry on the head. Instead, Shifditto only whacked the air, as Shiftry darted out of the way with his awesome speed and had manoeuvred himself around to the back of Shifditto. Shifditto looks around confused as Shiftry smashes into its back with a lethal Mega Kick. You hear a sickening crack as the Mega Kick snaps off some of Shifditto’s wooden body, which lands on the ground and turns to pink goo and then wriggles back to Shifditto, reattaching itself. Shifditto turns and uses Bullet Seed right in Shiftry’s eyes. Shiftry stumbles backwards and cries out in pain and fires a Leech Seed at random which lands on Shifditto’s nose and begins to sprout. Shifditto then leaps back and glares at Shiftry, charging a Shadow Ball inbetween his leaves.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Ivy opens her mouth and sends a barrage of seeds which collides with Ludicolos and they cancel each other out. As Ludicolo dances towards her for a Focus Punch, Ivy closes her eyes and concentrates for a second and sends 3 huge Sludge Bombs at Ludicolo. All 3 collide and seep into his skin, causing super effective Poison damage and Ludicolo glows purple for a second .. Seems hes poisoned.<br />
<br />
Ludicolo then looks at Shifditto, who abandons its Shadow Ball and they nod at each other as they try to ambush Ivy. Shifditto launches itself in to the air and drops down, landing in front of Ivy, and he glows Purple, lifting Ivy off the ground with its Extrasensory, causing Ivy extreme pain. She drops to the ground, seemingly lifeless until she glows a brilliant white! Her form triples in size as a huge flower blossoms from her back, the petals on full view to the sky above. Joy squeals in delight, “Ivy, you evolved!” Ivy looked back to Joy and nodded solemnly, and used a Vine Whip, sending Shifditto flying into Ludicolo, the two landing in a heap in front of the both of you. Both of them struggle up and are glaring right at you, waiting for you to make the first move. What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: cyan">Joe watched as Ivy took a beating, and then evolved out of nowhere, the evolution seemingly caused by pain. But that didn't matter now, all that mattered was that Shiftry needed to get back in the game. Venusaur was making him look bad! (xD) Joe quickly bound forwards, anime-style, and told Shiftry his commands.<br />
&quot;Shiftry, start off by using a Quick Attack to knock that Ludicolo away, to lighten the load off of Venusaur. Then, Pound it in the face, before finishing off with a quick Mega Kick to the back of Shifditto's head!&quot; he ordered, and Shiftry nodded, before jogging on the spot, getting ready to sprint off as fast as he can.</span></span></div>

The Shaman smiles once more. &quot;I am so happy that you are so eager to do this. The Temple Grounds are not far from here, though the path is dangerous. At least, it is now. A group of Bug Pokemon have taken over the path...hmm...as your first step towards training, I give you the duty of clearing these pests from the path, and enabling us to travel peacefully to and from the Temple. Come, I will set you on the right road.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man stands up shakily from his prone position, old age clearly inhibiting his movement. &quot;I'm afraid I don't have much time left...&quot; He mumbles, more to himself than anyone. He grabs a stick adorned with many different shamany things, like feathers, small skulls, and the like, and begins a slow limp outside. &quot;..BAH!&quot; He says before he gets halfway to the door. Mumbling to himself, the Shaman whacks the inside of the hut a few times, and a small child comes running in, breathless.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, Svorn, I am pleased you came so quickly. Please, be a kind little boy, and take this young lady to the Temple Path for me?&quot; He asks. The Boy, Svorn, nods, and grabs your hand, a smile plastered onto his face. &quot;Thisa way lady person!&quot; He giggles, and begins to tug you along. It isn't that long of a walk, and you arrive on the path in no time. &quot;May the Luckyness guide you...or somfin' lika that Lady Person!&quot; The boy giggles again, and takes off. The forest opens dark, foreboding, like a bad omen. Buzzes and snaps can be heard from not far up the path...<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span>

<span style="color: royalblue"> At Stacey's positive response the Shaman smiled.<br />

Come, I will set you on the right road.&quot; He says to her struggling to get up. Lucius and Stacey looked to one another, they didn't find the idea of fighting a hoard of bug pokemon frightening at all. They simply grinned to one another, planning delicous strategies or in Lucius's case, pranks in their minds.<br />
<br />
Turning back to the old Shaman, Stacey could see that he was struggling to walk and gave a large moan as he stopped haunched over his ornate staff. She ran up to him but he waved her off. He stood back up and using his stick proceded to smack the walls of the hut. Stacey didn't think that this was a good idea and saw the hut sway with the movement. <br />
<br />
A young boy suddenly runs in, panting hard. He stands up tall, trying to look impressive despite his small size.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, Svorn, I am pleased you came so quickly. Please, be a kind little boy, and take this young lady to the Temple Path for me?&quot; the Shaman says and the young boy, Svorn ran forward and grabbed Stacey's hand. He smiles a sloppy smile at her and spoke in broken English.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thisa way lady person!&quot; before starting out the door with Stacey nearly pulled off her feet. Lucius cackled at this and she shot him a glare. Stacey was impressed by the level of understanding the young boy had with the foreign language, which lead Lucius to mentally mock the language used. Stacey swore at him under her breath and continued out of the village.<br />
<br />
They soon arrive at the edge of the forest, the tall trees masking a hidden darkness that threatens to jump out at them. The young boy wished her luck and skipped off back the way they came. Stacey and Lucius both gave one last look back to the safety of the village before walking into the forest, Stacey singing softly under her breath in order to drone out the buzzing and snapping all around them.</span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: SeaGreen"><div style="text-align: center">~Jade Swamp~ (Colour - Sea Green)<br />
<br />
<b>JAF</b>:&#8203;</div>You, Chinchou, Gyarados and your starter Pokemon Croconaw all begin to walk, or swim toward your desired destination the Jade Swamp. You notice Gyarados finding it harder to swim as the water turns murky and thick with a stagnant layer of a solid, liquid muddy mix on top. The ground becomes hard to walk on; you can clearly hear the squelching of the mud as your feet push down so you can take another step toward the centre of the swamp, which actually has liquid water. You finally reach the water with your Pokemon, the ground around you is less muddy than the other areas, but since it has water it doesn’t mean its fresh, it’s a jade colour, hence the name, with little air bubbles popping every few seconds. Suddenly a small blue head pops up through the mud, with a huge fin on its head, you realise it’s a Mudkip, a rare water type. <br />
<br />
“Poliwag get that sapphire. Tackle it now!” a voice bellows from behind you as you see a small blue sphere Pokemon smash into the Mudkip at full force making a sapphire shaped object fly out of it’s hand and onto the ground just behind you. The Mudkip and Poliwag land on the ground behind you next to Chinchou and Croconaw, while Gyarados stays in the water. You see a man, just taller than you walk slowly toward the sapphire; he bends down and plucks it up with his hand and then smiles. He then looks at you and snorts. “This is one of the five sapphires, your not getting your filthy hands on it kid!” he shouts as you notice his wild green eyes and untamed black hair stopping at his shoulders in length, he’s wearing clothes the normal kind of trainer would wear except there is something different about him.<br />
<br />
“Poliwag we got to get the next one, we’ll use Cloyster to handle this fool!” He shouts as a red and white sphere flies past you and flips quickly open sending a white light into the water. The light suddenly takes form as a strange Pokemon, with a purple coloured shell, huge spikes rising from it and two piercing eyes in between its shell where its head rests. <br />
<br />
What will you do now?</span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: seagreen">John stared at the Cloyster that had been released, and then reached into his pocket, before taking out a Pokedex. He held it up towards Cloyster, and when the Pokedex had identified it, it started beeping and scanning it.<br />
<br />
<i>Cloyster ~ The Bivalve Pokemon.<br />
Cloyster swims in the sea by swallowing water, then jetting it out towards the rear. Cloyster shoots spikes from its shell using the same system. It's signature move is Spike Cannon.</i><br />
<br />
John took another quick look at Cloyster, before taking out a couple of his Pokeballs, and returning two of his Pokemon. When the light had faded, his only Pokemon left was Chinchou. Chinchou bounded around for a little bit, before walking up to John, and nodding, almost as if she knew she would be fighting the Cloyster. John smiled at her determination, and knelt down next to her. He then took one last look at Cloyster, before whispering Chinchou's orders to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, start by using a Thunderwave on it. Hopefully, it will be successful and paralyse it. Then follow up by using a Spark, that should do some good damage to it, with the type advantage and all. Finally, finish off this rounds attacks by slamming into it with a Flail. You got that?&quot; he asked, and Chinchou replied with a smile and a nod, before turning to face Cloyster. John smiled as well, but he quickly turned his attention to something else, just to the side of him.<br />
<br />
The Mudkip was lying there on the floor, and John couldn't help but wonder why. What are those sapphire things? Why did that Mudkip have one? And why does that guy want them so bad, that he's battling me to make sure? But for now, John would keep these questions to himself, and concentrate on the battle, for that was the most important thing going on right now, and he needed to give it all his attention, otherwise, Chinchou could lose.</span></span></div>

The markings on Arboks belly begin to glow as a holographic image of it appears, the Glare attack stunning Ledian just as it begins to charge a Psybeam. Arbok then lurches forwards and Bites down hard on Ledian, who cries in pain but then releases the Psybeam, knocking the Cobra pokemon backwards. Ledian then moves in for a Tackle but Arbok manages to swat it off course with a Slam. Ledian lands on the ground and gets up quickly, its fist glowing white. Suddenly, Alice shouts out, “IZUMI!” as the blind Mankey runs off through some shrubbery, unaware that Alice and yourself weren’t following. Arbok, distracted turns to look at Alice, bearing his fangs, but is pelted by a Comet Punch and is sent hurling onto the ground, stunned.<br />
Alice runs off, and you begin to follow her with Ledian until a swipe of Arbok’s tail knocks you off your feet. Landing on your back with a thud, which knocks the breath out of you. Arbok stares right at you, hissing wildly. Ledian suddenly knocks into it for a Tackle, keeping it away from you. Getting up, you try to escape, but the pack of Ekans are blocking all exits. Alice is beyond the bushes, but you can still hear her. What will you do?</span></span>

&quot;That Mankey is going to kill me!&quot;<br />

When he finally could get rid of the Arbok, the rest of the snakes woke up and were blocking the exits. There were too many of them to fight so he decided to use a trick to escape. He turned to his Pokémon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ledian, we can´t battle those snakes but we can distract them. Use Flash to blind them temporary, followed by a Supersonic to confuse them while they are blind.&quot;<br />
<br />
The five star Pokémon agreed with the plan. He turned to the group of snakes, ready to fool them. Saturn hoped for the best.</span></div>

<b>Bloody Banette</b>:<br />
You arrive at the wonderful Lapis Lake, with your Spheal by your side every step of the way. You examine the water in the lake, it looks a sort of dark purple colour instead of the excepted clear blue, suddenly a head emerges from the water, followed by a body with a blue mouse Pokemon held in her hands. You look at the person, noticing she is in fact a woman, after a closer look you realise its Nurse Joy holding a Marill. Nurse Joy spins once and then suddenly changes into her uniform (check anime for more details on her looks), she places the Marill on the ground and begins spraying it with a potion, however the spray coming out of the bottle is a slight dimmer colour than usual. “All better,” she says softly as the Marill opens its eyes slowly before taking one large breath. <br />
<br />
Nurse Joy then stands up and looks at you, her eyes fixed firmly on Spheal. “I’m sorry but could you help me?” Joy asks politely as she once again picks up the Marill. “My Chansey nurses saved the rest of the Pokemon in this river, however I stayed behind to save the three Marill, but I could only save this one, I need to take this one back to my Pokemon Centre in Devon Settlement. The river isn’t too deep but could you just dive in there and get the other two Marill for me then bring them to my centre?” she asks in a worried tone before shedding a few tears. <br />
<br />
“Please….?”<br />
<br />
What will you do now?</span><br />
</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: cyan">Felix looked at the river amazed. It wasn’t of the beautiful color the map sayed. The water was tainted now, or at least that’s what Felix thought when he saw the little Marril hurted. “What’s the matter with the pokemon here? What made the water to change the color?” asked Felix to himself. He wanted to ask Nurse Joy, but she was crying now and she probably won’t answer. “Joy is very affected with the problem with the water and the pokemon, I’m going to help her”. Felix looked at Joy who looked him back and smiling he nodded. “I’m going to help you Joy, but please don’t cry. Everything is going to be ok”. Joy seemed a bit quiet now showing a little smile in her face to Felix. “First I have to ask you something. What’s happening with the water? Who did this? I want to dive with my Slowpoke and my Spheal, am I able to do that?” asked Felix before looking at Veddartha who wanted to help.<br />
Veddartha have always been Felix’s bravest pokemon, it was sure he wanted to help here too. “Sphe phe spheal” smiled Veddartha looking at the Marril Joy’s jut saved. Felix stood quiet waiting for Joy’s answer.</span></div>

The lady smiles warmly. &quot;Great. Ah, your Sneasel is a fine specimen...&quot; She trails off, shaking her head. &quot;If I weren't so busy, I'd examine it more closely. Ah well. Fredrick!&quot; She calls out. A young man with flaming red hair walks forward, holding a notepad like it was his life.<br />
<br />
He looks to you, and then to the woman. &quot;Yes, Cynthia?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've found someone to escort you to where you need to go. I'm sure he'll keep you safe. Now, I must go. Be careful, please. I don't need you...&quot; Cynthia trails off, looking at you. &quot;Just be careful.&quot; She finishes, walking off.<br />
<br />
Fredrick, a frown on his face, turns to you. &quot;Sorry. She's a bit overprotective of me. Nice to meet you.&quot; He says, holding out a hand to shake. &quot;Unfortunatly, I have one of the roughest jobs out here. You see, a rather large swarm of Beedrill has set up a colony not far from here. I need to go see how far this colony stretches, and how many their are. The last couple of scientists who attempted this...well...never mind that.&quot; A smile appears over his frown.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, shall we begin?&quot;

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: Grey">Shaking Fredrick's hand, MG begins to ponder this assignment. Why in the world would measuring a colony of Beedrill be so difficult, as long as you had the right Pokemon with you. Glancing at Sneasel, MG is confident that he can take on most anything in their path, especially if he knows he's going to be protecting someone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, shall we begin?&quot; is the question MG is asked, and MG merely nods, not feeling too talkative, also thinking about the first lady, Cynthia, and her interest in Sneasel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Los geht's. &lt;Let's go.&gt;&quot; MG says briskly, a lot to think about on his mind as he and Sneasel set into a walking pace behind Frederick.</span></span></div>

<br />
<b>John's Knight</b>:&#8203;</div>With Sleepy by your side you head to the Emerald Jungle happily awaiting an awesome adventure and lots of interesting Pokemon to see. Upon arriving many tens of minutes later you look around the thickly leaved trees with various fruits growing out of them as well as the strange coloured plants sprouting fro the ground. You look up into a tree, with weird shaped and coloured tail winds its way around the branch and snaps a bit of fruit off, the tail then goes back into the tree and then comes out once again to do the same. The tail itself is purple with a strange hand shape at the end, suddenly a small purple Pokemon lunges out of the tree and lands in front of you with a piece of fruit in its hands. You acknowledge the Pokemon’s creepy smile and staring eyes catch you off guard as it runs for sleepy and begins to tickle him. The <a href="http://www.dpent.ca/Images/aipomban.jpg" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpent.ca%2FImages%2Faipomban.jpg&amp;hash=a4ab6b35355f79fe7cdefb14aac82e18" rel="nofollow noopener">Aipom</a> then looks up at you, smiling evilly; it suddenly climbs up your arm and begins to tickle you, making you shake to knock it off.<br />
<br />
The Aipom lands on the ground with a hard thud, it screams at you viciously. “AI POM AI AIPOM!” It then begins to dig in the soil, little piles build up either side of the small hole as you can see the Aipom moving slightly. The Aipom raises it’s head again, giving you an evil grin as it holds up a shiny green jewel, known as an emerald, however not just any emerald, the emeralds in the Emerald Jungle are said to have growth enhancing properties. The Aipom then squeezes the emerald, the Aipom then gets slightly bigger but looks a lot meaner and tougher, it laughs one last time before throwing the emerald into a near by patch of leaves (trees and wood to for that matter), the Aipom then climbs angrily to a branch of the nearest tree ready for the battle. You can see it quite clearly since it isn’t too high up, head on attacks will fail but attacks like Flamethrower and such will be quite useful.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: Limegreen">Johnny walked in the Emerald Jungle, admiring its beauty, when suddenly he found a strange Aipom. The monkey began digging the ground, until it found what it was looking for: an emerald. However, the Emeralds in Emerald Jungle weren't normal Emeralds! They were &quot;power&quot; emeralds, which when are squeezed give power to the one who squeezed it! And Aipom got slightly bigger, and it was no longer the previous Aipom...it seemed tougher, meaner, probably effects from the Emerald. The monkey climbed a tree, showing that it wanted to battle the trainer and Sleepy, the sleepy Slakoth.<br />
&quot;So...&quot;, Johnny said. &quot;You wanna battle, eh? Well, usually i'm a man of no favors, but seeing that is <i>you</i> that asks for one...i might open my hand for you! But i have to warn you...i won't be defeated!&quot;<br />
Johnny seemed pretty confident, an atittude that could make a trainer lose a battle, but that comment seemed to be just a sarcastic joke.<br />
&quot;Ok, Sleepy! It's your first battle, i hope you're happy! Still, that isn't an excuse if we lose. Let's make our best and win vitoriously!&quot;, the trainer said, excited. Sleepy smilied, not with so excitement, maybe he's still half-awaken, half-sleeping. &quot;Let's start things with a <b>Yawn</b>, so that the Aipom sleeps. Then, climb a tree as well! This is your natural habitat, so the &quot;arena&quot; gives you no disadvantage. Then, use <b>Cut</b>, followed by a <b>Thunderpunch</b>. Let the battle begin!&quot;.<br />
Sleepy nodded, and began concentrating his energy and mind, as the battle began...</span></div>

Arnoldii starts using Absorb on Krabby, who runs around manically trying to lose Arnoldii’s gaze, failing the Krabby fires a powerful stream of bubbles directly at his eyes, blinding him temporarily and causing damage. Arnoldii stares Absorb after regaining its sight again; the Krabby onto its game already hides in the sand, completely negating the Absorb attack, after seconds and seconds of waiting the Krabby remerges from the sand and laughs. It then charges at Arnoldii it’s non-jewel holding claw glowing and stiffening, looks like it’s about to use Crabhammer attack on you, Arnoldii barely dodges as the Krabby’s claw lands in the ground, however it jumps out and it’s claw glows again, looks like it’s about to use Crabhammer again.<br />

After a long walk to Sapphire Village you arrive their, clearly it’s not even midday yet but you notice lots of people running about in all direction, some of them regular villages other regular trainers, you notice a woman a few feet away wearing a frumpy red dress, with gorgeous brown hair and beautiful green eyes. She smiles at you and shakes your hand. “We’re setting up the last contest, Pokemon contests have been set up all round the Water Zone in the past few weeks to give trainers a chance for a ribbon so they can enter the one of a kind Water Zone event the Ribbon Festival!” She shouts excitedly while handing you a clipboard, you examine the form attached to it as she pulls you toward the centre of the village, passing many less developed houses, well no developed houses actually. You and the woman enter a cleared space, about the size of a regular Pokemon field, with some space in front of it for spectators.<br />
<br />
“I’m Alexis I’m the contest judge for this contest! Now you should enter, but most of the villagers are entering and they don’t speak English well, and since they grow up with Pokemon I’m assuming not many trainers will make it through the appeal round,” Alexis just smiles as you notice the regular stage set-up, the circle in the centre were the trainer stands, the three judge boxes where they judge the appeals and then you notice people starting to sit on the ground in front of the make shift stage ready to watch the contest.<br />
<br />
“So going to enter? Just fill out the form please.” You look at the forum and all the regular same old questions, but you notice a translation by the side.<br />
<br />

The Aipom looks down on you, still smiling and such. Sleep opens his mouth as wide as possible and yawns, several pink bubbles burst forth and float slowly up toward Aipom, after a second or two each bubble pops on contact and making Aipom seem dizzy and spin around slightly before letting out a snoring sound. Sleeps climbs up the tree slowly and then jumps onto the same branch as the snoozing Aipom, he then swipes with his arm across Aipom’s body making it fall off and smash into the ground. Sleep jumps from the tree and hits Aipom right in the chest with a Thunderpunch attack. The Aipom twitches slightly, from all the commotion it might wake up sooner than you think. <br />

You send out your Swablu, its soft and white cotton wings flapping swiftly as it smiles and gets ready to battle. Drift then exhales a purple mist, which spreads and settles around the place, making you and Sonia cough as Swablu and Tentacool find it increasing more difficult to see. “Poison Sting now Tentacool!” you hear Sonia command as loads of thin needle type objects fly at Drift, Drift then avoids each one by quickly flying around in a circle then smashing into Tentacool from behind in a Quick attack fashion. “Bubblebeam get it hard and good!” Sonia shouts angrily as you try to find your way through the mist. Tentacool jumps into the air and sends a long beam of blue spheres directly Drift, he avoids a few, however takes light damage from some of the bubbles. <br />
<br />
“Tentacool use a Confuse Ray attack!” Sonia shouts at the top of her lungs, Tentacool just nods sort of and then focuses on Drift. Sonia laughs cruelly ready for a showdown between the two Pokemon. <br />

Joy smiles and then reaches into her pocket of her uniform. She brings out a strange object, red with a nozzle at the front with holes. “This should allow you to breathe in that water plus talk if needed, but I still have no ideas about what happened here but after we help these Pokemon then we’ll be looking into it, and yes you should use at least one Pokemon to go in with you,” she says firmly as you put the strange object into your mouth ready for action. Joy whispers good luck into your ear and she runs off holding the Marill tightly in her arms waving to you as she leaves your vision now leaving only you, Veddartha and the river.<br />

Chinchou nods and jumps into battle, staring up at the Cloyster you know it won’t give up without a fight. A majestic blue light bursts forth from Chinchou, the light zooms through the air and straight at Cloyster. “Cloyster Withdraw!” The guy shouts as Cloyster lets out a low toned “Cloy…” before his rock hard shell closes fully around him, the blue light hits his shell, having very little effect, however just paralysing it. Chinchou then remembers your second order to use Spark attack; Cloyster opens his shell as Chinchou fires a sphere of electrical energy at him. The sphere hits Cloyster head on causing electric damage, the guy snorts and laughs at your Chinchou. “Ha, I Phoenix will not lose to the likes of you and your lame Pokemon!” he, well Phoenix, exclaims at the top of his lungs. He then points at Cloyster, his smile looking even more sinister than before.<br />
<br />
“Now use Ice Beam!” Cloyster nods as Chinchou jumps at him for a slam attack, Cloyster fires a beautiful white and blue beam at Chinchou, when making contact slamming Chinchou into the swampy ground before you, also creating some ice around it and freezing some of the ground as creating ice would do that. Phoenix just smiles and nods flicking his black hair to the side of his face, while Poliwag jumps up and down next to him you notice the Mudkip starting to rise to its feet. “Mud kip Mudkip!” it shouts angrily as it just collapses again in the same spot.<br />
