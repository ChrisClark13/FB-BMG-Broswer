<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: LightBlue">A newly discovered island east of Mossdeep City. Recently Devon Corp. has begun settlement and exploration of the island as well as starting good relations with the island natives.<br />
<br />
The island's name is derived from the astonishingly large amount of gems found all over, especially sapphires. Scientist believe the bulk of the gems were created when the island formed. As there is no volcanic or siesmic activity on the island, it is believed the island was formed when a meteor primarily composed of gems or the raw materials of gems crashed into the ocean. Upon it's speeding course through the Earth's atmosphere, the gems crystallized into the beautiful stones they are now. Islanders have ancient legends telling of the islands formation. They believe that their ancestors cast out the stones into the ocean as an offering to the gods, who then raised the island for them as their sancutary. Either way, the island's origins are still a mystery.<br />
<br />
Devon Corp. has invited hundreds of trainers from around the world to help with the settlement, exploration, and investigation of the island while still respecting the wishes of the islanders, which is simply- don't take any gems you find without seeking divine permission.<br />
<br />
You are one of the many trainers sent here by Devon. Upon arrival, you are given a GPS Satellite TPP (TPP for Tracker, Phone, and Pokedex). With this you can call for help or be saved if you are ever lost or in trouble on the island. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: lightblue"><b><u>Areas:</u></b></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: Yellow"><u><b>Southern Beach</b> (updated in <b>Yellow</b>):</u>Where the boat dropped everyone off. The beach stretches for as far as the eye can see and the waters are as clear as glass.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<u><span style="color: Aqua">Ocean Waters &amp; Reefs (updated in <b>Aqua</b>):</span></u><span style="color: Aqua"> Surf is necessary as the only boat are the ones bringing Trainers and Supplies and will not have time to transport people to where they want to go. Dive is necessary for exploring the reefs.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<u><span style="color: Gray">Devon Settlement (updated in <b>Grey</b>):</span></u><span style="color: Gray"> About 10 yards from the southern most beach of Sapphire Island. The settlement has the bare necessities for all the people. Mainly just tents all around, the site does have a make-shift Pokemon Center for the trainers to heal their Pokemon. Technicians are always working to keep the radio tower working and the power generators running. Pokemon walk on patrol in constant vigil of any possible wild Pokemon that may attack. Also, many scientists await here for a brave Pokemon trainer to help accompany and escort them through the island to fufill their thirst for knowledge. Here is a list of people in the Devon Corp. Settlement you may call:<br />
<br />
*Rex Adams: Head of the Settlement. He is a survivalist expert and a natural born leader. If you are in troubling situations, you can always call Rex for help. If you are ever hurt and unable to move, he can call for an expedition force to come retrieve you. But he is a busy man commanding the Devon Corp. Expedition, so only call him if it is of utmost importants.<br />
<br />
*Nurse Joy: Being a Pokemon Medical Specialist, she can always help you if your Pokemon may need help. She knows the local flora well enough to know what plants are poisonous and what are not. She also knows what plants may benefit your Pokemon. Unfortunately, she is also the only nurse here, so at times she may be swamped with work helping all the trainers Devon Corp. sent over. Occassionally she may ask you for help as well, such as finding special cures or healing herbs found on the island.<br />
<br />
*Professor Sylvia: Head of exploration trips. In order for scientists to begin research expeditions on the island, they must first see Sylvia for approval. She will provide you with necessary supplies needed. If you leave without permission, she will likely not help you should something go wrong.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<u><span style="color: RoyalBlue">Sapphire Village (updated in <b>RoyalBlue</b>):</span></u><span style="color: RoyalBlue"> One mile north of the settlement in the dense jungle lies the Sapphire Village. Devon Corp. quickly sent several linguists to learn their language so they can have good relations with them. After some time, the linguists learns much of their tongue, but to their surprise, some of the natives learned to speak English as well. As of now, Devon Corp. maintains a good relationship with the natives by respecting their customs and helping them whenever possible.<br />
<br />
*Ichigo Summers: Devon's top linguistic. Born half-Japanese and half-American, she became extremely interested in linguisitics and became dedicated to learning as much as possible. Because of her nature, she has learned a great deal of the native's language and is Devon's translator. She helps maintain the good relations between them and us. Sometimes she may ask for help on behalf of either Devon Corp. or the Village.<br />
<br />
*Zam-Zil-Zoo-Zug: A villager who has learned English over the coarse of time Devon Corp. had been on the island. He can help where Ms. Summers may fail, such as reading certain signs or knowing what certain momuments are. Unfortunately he is easily distracted and may forget to answer your questions let alone the ringing phone.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: LimeGreen"><u>Emerald Jungle (updated in <b>LimeGreen</b>):</u> A large jungle that spans over a large portion of the island. The settlement and village are found within the jungle. The villagers have one road that cuts through the jungle to there temple as well as key areas like the river and lake. The islanders warn people to stay on the road unless they have a brave soul or a broken mind. It is known for it's many dangers ranging from vicious Pokemon to poisonous plants as well as other mysteries that should be left undiscovered. The soil is said to have large deposits of emeralds, which seem to have mysterious growth enhancing powers, but as per islander's wishes, you are not to take them without special permission.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: MediumTurquoise"><u>Turquoise River (updated in <b>MediumTurquoise</b>):</u> A rapid flowing river that cuts through the middle of the Emerald Jungle. It's floor has large turquoise settlement that is said to keep the water fresh and pure, thus helping Pokemon grow strong. Even simple Magikarp are said to be larger and stronger here then anywhere else.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: Cyan"><u>Lapis Lake (Updated in <b>Cyan</b>):</u> The lake which feeds the Turquoise River and Jade Swamp. It itself is fed by the Diamond Waterfalls which spews from the Ruby Mountain. The lake itself is quite large and is the main watering hole for many of the islands wild Pokemon.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: LightBlue"><u>Diamond Falls (Updated in <b>LightBlue</b>):</u> A waterfall that sparkles like diamonds in the sun. The waters come out of the wall of the Ruby Mountain and feeds the island with fresh water. The water spews out with such force, no one has been able to investigate what the underground source is.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: SeaGreen"><u>Jade Swamp (Updated in <b>SeaGreen</b>):</u> A swamp that is on the opposite side of lake to the river. The water levels are high and many Pokemon roam the murky waters. Unlike the river, the swamp is considerably dangerous to walk in. Sinkholes cover the area and the Pokemon like to perform sneak attacks thanks to the filthy waters. The Jade Swamp gets it's name from the jade colors algae that floats atop the water.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: DarkRed"><u>Ruby Mountain (Updated in <b>DarkRed</b>):</u> The only mountain on Sapphire Island. As said before, it has no volcanic or seismic activity, but there are many tunnels made by the various Pokemon that live here. The ground sparkles with rubies, which is said to help make the soil so rich and the Pokemon so strong.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: Teal"><u>Crystal Peak (Updated in <b>Teal</b>):</u> The icy top of Ruby Mountain. High up where the atmosphere is thin and the air is cold, this area is heavily darkened by the haze and fog. Villagers only come here for trials of manhood as the Ice Pokemon here are very territorial and do not take visitors kindly. With the darkness and cold conditions, it makes it very difficult to travel.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: Sienna"><u>Temple Grounds (Updated in <b>Sienna</b>):</u> On the opposite side of the Ruby Mountain from the Village, the Temple stands there as a tribute to the gods who gave the island to the villagers. Every few years the villagers take a journey to the Temple for special prayer and for the Elders to ask for guidance. It was luckyDevon Corp.met the villagers before they went on the journey or they may not have had approved of interaction with Devon Corp. until their next trip to the Temple. But even though their gods have approved of good relations with Devon Corp. and the explorers, the Temple Grounds are too sacred for outsiders and guarded by many of the villagers strongest warriors. Perhaps during the next journey, the gods will allow Devon Corp. to visit the temple site.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: lightblue">You've just been dropped off on Sapphire Island Beach. This particular part of the island is warm and pleasant and the summer sun is shining in the sky. All your necessary belongings are in your backpack. The raft that brought you here is gone. Back to the main ship in the middle of the ocean. There's no turning back- a new world is ready to be explored by you. What will you do?</span><br />

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 9px">Sorry about the delay here, finishing updates wasn't exactly the first thing in my mind at the point. But I got them done here. &gt;&gt;;<br />
<br />
Eon and Silver Wind, you both still need to send an answer to me. The rest of you got updates. Enjoy them, though they aren't my best...*fl33s*<br />
<br />
<b><i><u><span style="color: Navy">UPDATES:</span></u></i></b><br />

<span style="color: Limegreen"><b>~*Emerald Jungle*~</b> (<b>LimeGreen</b>, please!)<br />
<br />
<b>Torkoal Stu: </b><br />
You decide to restart your adventure, and with that in mind, you make your way to the Emerald Jungle. You had speculated that it wasn’t so far away because the next thing you knew, you were walking among the natural skyscrapers that were the trees and you can see nothing but green plants all around you. Colorful flowers sprouted from nearby bushes, the noises of Pokémon chattering that you expect to hear in the green environment filled your ears constantly as you poked your head behind plants, searching for adventure. You occasionally see an Oddish scuttling by your feet or some Mankeys chatting noisily, swinging on strong vines that connected with the trees all around you. You haven’t realized how tired you were from walking non-stop until you paused to watch a Pikachu excitedly nibbling on a berry before it dashed off into a patch of bushes. Sweating somewhat from the warm conditions and the exercise, you managed to spot a large rock, and you rest on the rock, still scanning the natural surroundings.<br />
<br />
It hadn’t occurred to you at first, though, that there was a shadow had been following behind you all along, and you suddenly heard rustling of bushes facing your back. You whipped your head around, but you don’t see anything, and the bushes stop. You were curious by this mysterious movement, and you barely bend up to go investigate when a voice unexpectedly spoke behind you.<br />
<br />
“Hello there!” A feminine voice, young and a little enthusiastic, was heard behind your head. You turned to see a young lady, probably around your age or so, beaming up at the sight of you. Short black hair was visible under her red hat, and her eyes were as green as the plants around you two. Her clothing fitted for someone who was traveling through jungles and such, so you guessed that she was a ranger. “My name is Maria, and I’ve been wandering here for a few days now. I’ve been searching for a Pokémon here, but I don’t own any, so I need help from someone like you! I’m guessing you’re a trainer, since I see those Pokéballs that you’re currently carrying. Maybe you can help me! What’s your name?”<br />
<br />
She spoke rather fast in her language, but you were still able to have the message transmitted in your head. What’s your response to this young ranger?<br />
<br />
<b>Alilatias: </b><br />
You issued Hikari your commands as he dashed with lighting speed, the anger tampered with his running, making him go faster. He opened his mouth to release a weak, electric bolt, slicing through the air like a knife swiftly cutting through soft butter. However, Hikari’s timing was way off as the Thunder wave attempt combined with the speed of your green, electric dog threw it off balance. Not only that, but Hikari didn’t look up to realize he was about to slam into a tree until too late. Face first, your Electrike yelped in pain as the force of the body was pushed against the tree, and you gasped as you say a long, thin cut on Hikari’s forehead, starting to trickle blood down. The Aipom sees that this was when your Pokémon was vulnerable, and you can only watch as the Aipom charged at your doggie, scratching his side with its tail as it whizzed by your injured Electrike. Hikari whimpered in pain and even gave a loud bark, forgetting your command for Shock Wave. <br />
<br />
However, it could recall that you told him to use Swift, and he opened his mouth wide again, this time glowing white stars sailed through the air in amazing speed. As you thought, Aipom couldn’t ignore the attack; it cried out in shock as it felt the razor-sharp points of the starts cutting through its fur, letting a few drops of blood staining its purple and yellow fur. Though Aipom had gained some damage, it appeared that Hikari had less health than the monkey.<br />
<br />
What will you do? </span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: DarkRed"><b>~*Ruby Mountain*~</b> (<b>DarkRed</b>, please!)<br />
<br />
<b>~*Centin*~: </b><br />
You watched as you see your Natu take a peck on one of the signs. According to the sign, you were able to see that Lapis Lake was closer to Ruby Mountain than Emerald Village, so you and your little birdie make your way to the lake, hoping to reach Ruby Mountain so you could enter Crystal Peak.<br />
<br />
After a bit of a walk, you could see a sapphire-blue lake that was visible in your view, and you realized that this was Lapis Lake. You could see all the sorts of Water-Type Pokémon, like Lotad, Corphish, Horsea, and even some Surskits who skated across the water like sliding on stern ice. Though you wanted to say back to admire the view of the Pokémon in the lake, you mind sent a signal that you wanted to go to Crystal Peak inside. So, sighing as your looks gave a “Good-Bye” to the lake, you continue along, hoping that you’ll reach Ruby Mountain and Crystal Peak.<br />
<br />
Eventually, you did find yourself walking on a rocky pathway that sliced through Ruby Mountain, and realizing that the ground was sparkling with scarlet glitters, you somehow are in awe of the ground that you were standing nearby. You bended down, grabbing a fistful of soil, and it felt like you were carrying a pile of rubies within your own hands. Letting the soil slipping from your fingers, you were about to continue when you heard footsteps slowly approaching to your spot from up ahead! It’s unknown if this is a person that is friendly or not, but you might want to find a hiding spot! <br />
<br />
Looking around in your environment, you managed to spot a big boulder, big enough to hide you size, and you duck behind the rock, just avoiding the sight of the approaching stranger…popping you head ever so slightly to see where the noise was coming from, you realize with a jolt that it was not a person; it was, in fact, a Machop! It was carrying an item hidden underneath a small white cloth, and it was mumbling to itself, and you were able to distinguish the words “Rock…strife…stupid Geodudes…” before the Machop was slowly disappearing from your view. Shall you follow the strange Machop, or should you continue to Crystal Peak?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: Yellow"><b>~*Southern Beach*~ </b>(<b>Yellow</b>, please!)<br />
<br />
<b>Archaic: </b><br />
Murmuring about how unpleasant the beach was, you started your way down the southern part of the beach. The sand under your feet was burning hot and so rough, it felt as if you were walking on millions of tiny bits of coal. The sun felt unbearably hot against your bare skin, and the water did not help much either. Despite that it might feel cool in the water, you would go on, complaining about how salty the water would be…anyway, you continued on your complaining on the negative of beaches when an unexpected scream rang through the island, and you stopped in your tracks, curiosity starting to poke your mind. Eventually, you shrug it off, but as you started yet again, you heard it again, and this time, it sounded closer than it was before…<br />
<br />
After a little more walking, you saw and realize what was causing the screaming; up ahead, in the water, you could see a young orange-hair woman in a bright blue bikini, screaming for help as two Tentacruels were grabbing her with their tentacles. The woman was desperate to get to shore, but she was a good fifty feet away from the beach. The lady wrestled with the many tentacles surrounding her body, but it was no use, and you could tell that she was tiring. In fact, one point, she nearly drowned, but it was only one tentacle grabbing her arm that kept her above the surface.<br />
<br />
The woman did spot you, but her cry to ask you to help was silenced as one of the Tentacruels covered her mouth, and starting to sink down in the water! Will you help the woman, or ignore her and continue to investigate the beach?</span><br />
<br />
BTW, Shinjara, here's my intro post:<br />
<span style="color: DarkRed"><br />
Andrea did not know how on earth she suddenly found herself standing on a sandy beach, with her stuff inside her bag and her Pokéballs resting in her pocket. The last memory she could recall was that she was riding some raft towards a random island where she could explore, and the next thing she knew, she was right there. She let out a sigh, deciding it wasn’t so important as it seemed to be, and she began to mull over where she should start her adventure.<br />
<br />
As she was lost in thought, she did not realize that one of the red-and-white spheres let a jet of light escape from it grasp, momentarily fading to reveal a small, purple creature that stood on her two legs. Three precious stones were planted in her back, while a single ruby sparkled on her stomach, and two diamond-like crystals glittered in a deceiving, mischievous way. A thin, long grin had flashed on the bottom half of the head, and the Sableye suddenly broke into a run, heading towards a lonely mountain that appeared to be the only mountain of the island. It wasn’t until she heard the cry “Sableye!” that she snapped back into her physical consciousness to see her Sableye dashing off, leaving her behind.<br />
<br />
“Cryseye, where do you think you’re going?!” She exclaimed, calling her Sableye, but Cryseye either did not hear her or ignore her, for she was still running towards the Ruby Mountain. “Geez, what is it with you and your kind?!”<br />
<br />
Sighing, she began to give chase on her Pokémon, moving closer to <b>Ruby Mountain</b>.</span><br />

Breathing in the salty, sea air, he admires the natural beauty of the island, from the sparkling beaches, the clear water, jungles, lakes, rivers, and mountains. <br />
<br />
Pulling out a Pokeball, he throws it into the sparkling sand. The ball bounces off of the beach, before it opens, revealing a brilliant white. Taking shape, it forms Stephen's newest Pokemon as the light fades.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dra!&quot;<br />
<br />
The small dragon smiles at Stephen, being able to be out of its Pokeball for the first time in quite some time. Stephen bends down to the snakelike Pokemon, and asks, &quot;So, where should we go?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dratini looks at him for a moment, before slithering off confidently toward Lapis Lake. Not entirely sure Dratini knew what she was doing, Stephen simply shrugged and began walking after her...</span></div>

Hikari was whimpering at this point, but he still stood in his battle stance even though he was very injured. Faltzer cawed above the battle scene, ready to fight as well, but he knew that flying straight into the battle would be a <i>VERY</i> bad idea!<br />
<br />
As Hikari stared barking, Soruta issued her orders. The battle had only started, but what they can do in the beginning could determine the tide of this match.<br />

<br />
<b>Torkoal Stu: </b><br />
You decide to restart your adventure, and with that in mind, you make your way to the Emerald Jungle. You had speculated that it wasn’t so far away because the next thing you knew, you were walking among the natural skyscrapers that were the trees and you can see nothing but green plants all around you. Colorful flowers sprouted from nearby bushes, the noises of Pokémon chattering that you expect to hear in the green environment filled your ears constantly as you poked your head behind plants, searching for adventure. You occasionally see an Oddish scuttling by your feet or some Mankeys chatting noisily, swinging on strong vines that connected with the trees all around you. You haven’t realized how tired you were from walking non-stop until you paused to watch a Pikachu excitedly nibbling on a berry before it dashed off into a patch of bushes. Sweating somewhat from the warm conditions and the exercise, you managed to spot a large rock, and you rest on the rock, still scanning the natural surroundings.<br />
<br />
It hadn’t occurred to you at first, though, that there was a shadow had been following behind you all along, and you suddenly heard rustling of bushes facing your back. You whipped your head around, but you don’t see anything, and the bushes stop. You were curious by this mysterious movement, and you barely bend up to go investigate when a voice unexpectedly spoke behind you.<br />
<br />
“Hello there!” A feminine voice, young and a little enthusiastic, was heard behind your head. You turned to see a young lady, probably around your age or so, beaming up at the sight of you. Short black hair was visible under her red hat, and her eyes were as green as the plants around you two. Her clothing fitted for someone who was traveling through jungles and such, so you guessed that she was a ranger. “My name is Maria, and I’ve been wandering here for a few days now. I’ve been searching for a Pokémon here, but I don’t own any, so I need help from someone like you! I’m guessing you’re a trainer, since I see those Pokéballs that you’re currently carrying. Maybe you can help me! What’s your name?”<br />
<br />
She spoke rather fast in her language, but you were still able to have the message transmitted in your head. What’s your response to this young ranger?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: Lime">Stuart look at the girl, slowly thinking through her proposal as if it was a life or death situation, he then changed his serious looking face to a soft smile and then waved slightly, after a few seconds the thought of his appearance being dorky popped into mind as he quickly put down his hand and sighed. &quot;I'm um hmmm err Stu- erm umm Art...&quot; he stammered as he looks into Maria's eyes, not knowing weather to help her or just leave her in the Emerald Jungle. <br />
<br />
&quot;What kind of person comes to an island and doesn't bring along a Pokemon?&quot; Stuart asked himself as he pulled off one of the Pokeballs on his belt and pushed the white button in the centre making it enlarge to the size of his hand. Gripping the Pokeball firmly Stuart smiled as he tossed it into the air. &quot;Come on out Dizzy!&quot; He exclaimed as a beautiful white light burst out of the ball and took the shape of a bee type creature. The Pokemon was a Volbeat, named Dizzy by Stuart since its love of spinning controls him and makes him extremely Dizzy.<br />
<br />
Dizzy being Stuart's newest addiction hadn't had any battle experience before, like some of his other newer Pokemon such as Downy and Sonar. Stuart then looked up at Dizzy as he whirled round in a circle continually getting faster and faster each time he did so, Stuart reached out his arms and grabbed the Volbeat before it would collapse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dizzy stay on task, we have to help Maria catch a Pokemon,&quot; he whispered happily to Dizzy before letting him go and hover by his trainer’s side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vol beat vol volbeat!&quot; (Spin spin spin spin!)<br />
<br />
Stuart starting to get annoyed already by his spin-obsessed bee just shook off the comment and then turned to Maria.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what Pokemon you looking for Maria?&quot; He asked as Dizzy resisted the urge to spin like mad, Stuart just sighed and looked back at Maria and smiled softly once again waiting for her answer.</span></div>

<br />
<b>Joshua:</b> After issuing your attacks, Hayley nods as Salamence growls at her lowly, and then launches even further above the trees, taunting Hayley to follow. Hayley begins to summon her Strength as she moves higher in to the sky to meet the majestic dragon. Salamence remains still as she smashes into him, sending him hurtling backwards, but as she grabs to hurl him to the ground, Salamence blasts her with a Point Blank Flamethrower in the face. Hayley screams in pain as her face is engulfed by the flames. Narius grins and so does Salamence as Hayley tries to shake the flames off, and when she does, her face is covered by burns. Engulfed by anger, Hayley then blast Salamence with Dragonbreath, and he fires his own to counter it. When hes not looking, Hayley charges her right fist with Ice Energy and smashes it in to Salamence’s jaw, causing it to freeze over more. Narius flinches then says, “Well Joshua, you’re showing your worth. Salamence.. Dragon Dance! Then Hyper Beam!” Salamence dances around in the sky, raising his offensive and speed and then opens his mouth, charging a lethal Hyper Beam which he then sends towards Hayley at tremendous force. What will you do?<br />
<br />
<b>Skrusti:</b> Pikachu eyes Cid as he sidesteps towards her and smiles, as if to say, “Whoa there shock stuff, those electric sacs send jolts down my spine!” Pikachu blushes slightly, but your plan backfires as she begins to shake her backside, Attracting Cid who blushes in return and then coo’s softly at Pikachu. The two have managed to attract each other, however, Pikachu’s will to attack is slightly higher than Cids. Cid, with two pink love hearts in her eyes, begins to crackle with electricity as Pikachu does also, showing Cid just how good those electric sacs of hers were. They both shoot off the attacks and they collide in the middle of them, sending off tendrils of electricity in all directions. The rain continues to pour down as Pikachu launches a Thundershock which connects with Cid, leaving him a little surprised that his ‘love’ would shock him causing the Attract to wear off slightly. Running towards Pikachu with a glowing fist, he smacks it into her cheek and shes sent flying backwards into a tree. She struggles up as Cid feels his feelings for her reignite. Pikachu growls again and then uses Double Team, creating 5 Pikachu clones. What will you do?<br />
<br />
<b>Dark Scizor:</b> As you speak to her, Alice got extremely excited and then practically smothered you with a hug. “Oh thank you! I’m glad to have such a strong trainer which Enma has approved of travelling with me” You blush slightly as Alice kneels down to Izumi and says, “Okay Izumi, use your sense. Try to work out where Enma went..” The small Mankey closes her blank eyes and then her tail stretches out straight as a blue aura envelops her. You step back in awe as a bright blue beam of energy appears from her eyes and she begins to spin; mimicking a compass. After a few moments, Izumi stops, the beam from her eyes pointing deeper in the Emerald Forest. Izumi then passes out, landing with a small thud on the ground. Alice rushes to her side and picks up the small Pig Monkey. “You’ll be fine .. Take a rest for a while” As Alice returns her, you look deep into the forest and see only darkness. <br />
<br />
After a while, you both decide to move on in the direction which Izumi pointed to. After 5 minutes of walking, you enter a rundown part of the forest, overrun with Arbok and Ekans. In the distance, you swear you could see a Primeape running through the pack of snakes. As Alice shouts out, “LOOK! Enmas here!” An Arbok rears up and bears it’s chest pattern as a signal of attack! Alice screams as it lashes out at her. What will you do?<br />

<span style="color: DarkRed"><u>Ruby Mountain - Please reply in <b>DarkRed</b></u><br />
<br />
<b>Lonely Wanderer:</b> As you and Cryseye approach Ruby Mountain, you’re astounded by its sheer size, it’s height easily surpasses the clouds. The ground you walk on is covered in jewels, which Cryseye eyes in delight, licking her lips. As you continue on, you begin to climb the mountain through the paths which have been made by the natives which reside on the island. Coming across a small tunnel, you stop and Cryseye peers in curious. Suddenly, Cryseye takes off into the tunnel and you yet again find yourself following your Dark pokemon. As you get further into the tunnel, the light shining in diminishes and you find yourself in complete darkness. A loud cry of “Sablee! EYE!” directs you to Cryseye who is being attacked by some sort of pokemon. You hear a shrill Screech which causes you to hold your ears in pain. A quick cry of “Zuuuu!” suggests to you that it’s a Zubat. Cryseye seems to have gotten into a fight with it. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: Cyan"><u>Lapis Lake - Please reply in <b>Cyan</b></u><br />
<br />
<b>Joe:</b> As Nurse Joy watches you release Shiftry, she smiles, “Thankyou, we can now take efficient steps against those Lotad. We’re at an advantage, Grass types are the only types to resist these Lotad’s modified Leech Seeds.” Feeling relief flood all over your body knowing your pokemon won’t be harmed. Nurse Joy reaches into her apron pocket and takes out a Green poke ball embellished with a pink flower. “And of course .. 2 Grass types are better than one.” From within the Pokeball, an Ivysaur appeared on the ground before Joy and it let out a quiet “Ivvyy..” as it looked at Shiftry in apparent fear.<br />
<br />
“Aw Ivy, don’t worry, Shiftry is on our side” Ivy then looked at Shiftry again and blushed, seems the small dinosaur has a crush on Shiftry. Smiling to you, Nurse Joy then says, “Well, time to go. We’ll come back for Plusle when we’re done” Nodding, you follow her to her car and you both hop in. Joy then drives you to a secluded part of Sapphire Island, which is seemingly inhabited and surrounded by trees. The bank of this part of the lake is covered with ‘Lilypads’. Joy lets you out and you both walk quietly down to the bank and you see a small tail protruding from the water .. At the end of the tail is a red plus mark. Gasping, you realise that this is the Lotad which got Plusle’s power! Suddenly something grabs your attention.. “Ludicolo, ludicolo.. LUDI-DITTO!” Both you and Joy blink and turn to see a Ludicolo with a Ditto on it’s head. Ludicolo frowns at the sight of you, and then fires a Bullet Seed at Ivy. Ditto hops onto the ground and then transforms into a Shiftry and then rushes towards your own for a Pound! Joy orders Ivy to use her own Bullet Seed to counter then use a Sludge Bomb. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: SeaGreen"><u>Jade Swamp - Please reply in <b>SeaGreen</b></u><br />
<br />
<b>Latias10:</b> Illum nods, “Alright then sweetie.. Then we shall wait for those higher up” He then stayed completely still, and began to stare at you. The light on his head flashing on and off. Seems that’s his way to pass the time, but you feel very uncomfortable with this and it makes you feel even more nervous than you would normally be. You tentatively look at the Watund temple to avoid Illum’s icy stare and you notice 3 huge stone statues on the roof; One of a Swampert, One of a Rhydon and One of a Quagsire. There is only one entrance and it towers high and wide, able to fit most gigantic pokemon with ease.<br />
<br />
After 20 minutes of waiting. Illum continues to stare but is then cut off and he blinks furiously. “aAaaah! Yes yes! OK!” He speaks to himself and then moves over to you. “They want to see you Catherine.. They’re impressed” Illum then moved even closer to you, his cold breath causing your cheek to turn red. “You DO have Water or Ground type right? Take one in with you, they’ll like that ..” Illum then floats over to the huge door and fires a Thunderbolt into a slot which causes it to rumble and open. From where you’re standing you can’t see in the door. “Go on then love” Illum shouts and you approach the doorway slowly. As you walk through it, the ground turns sandy and you sink a little. Ahead of you is a wall, and there are no other doors. On the wall, there is a small statue of a Sandshrew with a stone slab attached to it which reads: <br />
<br />
“I am of water, I am of ground.<br />
But in both I can usually be found.<br />
On my body I have a poisonous film<br />
This membrane will give you a shooting feeling”<br />
<br />
There is a chisel and a hammer next to the slab. Seems it wants the answer. What will you do?<br />
<br />
<b>Sasuke-san:</b> As the shower of rocks approached Enma, he narrowed his eyes and began to pummel them with his clenched fists. Each rock split in half and fell to the ground, littering the ground around you. Kabutops roars in anger as he opens his mouth and sends a blue supersonic Water Pulse towards Enma, who responds by curling into a ball. From that he begins to spin rapidly, kicking up slime from the ground. As the Water Pulse almost hits him, he speeds off, tearing through the ground. To gain momentum and power, he runs round Kabutops in circles, who struggles to keep an eye on Enma who then goes in behind the Fossil Pokemon and smashes into it’s legs, sending it hurtling to the ground again with a sickening thud. Enma can’t stop however and he ends up rolling into the swamp. Stopping, he crinkles his nose in disgust and then quickly remembers his orders to go and use Seismic Toss. Trying to move as quick as he can, he runs out of the swamp. However, the slime hanging from him slows him down a tad. He approaches Kabutops and grabs his leg, spinning the beast around and around until Kabutops is well and truly dizzy. Enma, in a spectacular show of strength, hurls Kabutops into the Swamp as payback. Colliding with the water, Kabutops sinks and a huge wave is kicked up by his weight which soaks yourself, Enma and Ino, who shivers unhappily. <br />
<br />
A head then emerges from the Swamp. Kabutops glares at Enma and then raises his scythes out of the water, which begin to glow silver. In a personalised version of Slash, he sends two scythe shaped beams of energy towards Enma which collide and hit him in the chest, causing a long wound which slowly seeps blood. Enma begins to become enraged and stomps about as Kabutops remains in the water. What will you do?</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper">OOC: Thank you very much Shinjara, I really do appreciate your allowance of me. I won't let you down! <br />
<br />
<span style="color: Yellow">The smell of the fresh ocean hung in the air, as Jon Cloudsdale stepped into the Southrn Beach of Sapphire Island. Joining him today, was Arnoldii, Jon's newest companion, a timid little Oddish. Jon was grinning madly, overzealous as always, thrilled with his trip to Sapphire Island that was about to unfold before his eyes. Arnoldii was cautious, and somewhat afraid of everything, the island and its unknown grandeur, as well as Jon. Jon didn't realize this though, which really didn't do much but add to Arnoldii's plight.<br />
<br />
Jon crouched down to talk with Arnoldii. &quot;Hey Arnoldii! This is Sapphire Island!&quot; Jon cheered to his pokemon. &quot;I've heard so much about it! I can't wait to check things out! Doesn't that sound like fun?&quot; Jon asked energetically, trying to encourage his rather shy pokemon. Arnoldii weakly sighed, and nodded a little, but couldn't really hide it's anxiety, no matter how hard it was trying.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong?&quot; Jon asked. &quot;We haven't even gone anywhere yet? How can you be nervous already?&quot; he questioned, pressuring his pokemon. Arnoldii backed away slowly, completely terrified, and hoping to get back on the raft and leave this island as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, it had already departed, and Oddish was stranded with his madman of a trainer. Reluctantly, Oddish returned to Jon.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing, Arnoldii? Stop wasting time! Let's decide where we should go!&quot; Jon giggled, patting Arnoldii on the head. Arnoldii was rather relieved that he would at least have some say in where the two were going, and began to relax a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then! Let's think now.&quot; Jon began. &quot;If you ask me, I think the <span style="color: LimeGreen">Emerald Jungle</span> would be a good place to start! It's a really thick jungle, and I've heard that there are a lot of tough pokemon and mysterious things there!&quot; Jon shouted. Arnoldii was scared to death, and began breathing heavily. &quot;It'll be great! Plus I heard you can find a lot of poisonous plants there as well! I'd love to study them!&quot; Jon continued, completely enthralled with the idea. Despite actually being a poisonous plant though, Arnoldii was mortified. Arnoldii whined a little bit, and then tried to explain his position to Jon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Jon questioned. &quot;I guess you don't want to go to the Emerald Jungle then, huh...?&quot; Jon muttered in a sudden state of depression. &quot;Well that's okay...&quot; he sighed. Arnoldii was a bit sad that he had disappointed his trainer, but anything was better than that scary jungle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I guess that just means we need a new idea, huh?&quot; Jon spoke, snapping out of his dismal. &quot;Well, how about we just stay around here for a while? You don't mind the beach that much, do you?&quot; Jon asked sweetly, trying to comfort Arnoldii. Arnoldii looked around a bit hesitantly, but agreed that staying at the Southern Beach would be okay, and hopped around with a smile. Jon was happy too, and the two began to explore the <b>Southern Beach</b>, both wondering what adventures would await them.</span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: cyan"><b>Joe:</b> As Nurse Joy watches you release Shiftry, she smiles, “Thankyou, we can now take efficient steps against those Lotad. We’re at an advantage, Grass types are the only types to resist these Lotad’s modified Leech Seeds.” Feeling relief flood all over your body knowing your pokemon won’t be harmed. Nurse Joy reaches into her apron pocket and takes out a Green poke ball embellished with a pink flower. “And of course .. 2 Grass types are better than one.” From within the Pokeball, an Ivysaur appeared on the ground before Joy and it let out a quiet “Ivvyy..” as it looked at Shiftry in apparent fear.<br />
<br />
“Aw Ivy, don’t worry, Shiftry is on our side” Ivy then looked at Shiftry again and blushed, seems the small dinosaur has a crush on Shiftry. Smiling to you, Nurse Joy then says, “Well, time to go. We’ll come back for Plusle when we’re done” Nodding, you follow her to her car and you both hop in. Joy then drives you to a secluded part of Sapphire Island, which is seemingly inhabited and surrounded by trees. The bank of this part of the lake is covered with ‘Lilypads’. Joy lets you out and you both walk quietly down to the bank and you see a small tail protruding from the water .. At the end of the tail is a red plus mark. Gasping, you realise that this is the Lotad which got Plusle’s power! Suddenly something grabs your attention.. “Ludicolo, ludicolo.. LUDI-DITTO!” Both you and Joy blink and turn to see a Ludicolo with a Ditto on it’s head. Ludicolo frowns at the sight of you, and then fires a Bullet Seed at Ivy. Ditto hops onto the ground and then transforms into a Shiftry and then rushes towards your own for a Pound! Joy orders Ivy to use her own Bullet Seed to counter then use a Sludge Bomb. What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: cyan"><span style="font-size: 9px">&quot;Oh shi...&quot; said Joe, as he saw the Shifditto running towards his own Shiftry. He quickly thought of how he could counter it, as Nurse Joy ordered some attacks for her Ivysaur. He quickly listed all of Shiftry's attacks in his head, before coming to a conclusion about what he would order. <br />
&quot;Shiftry, as it comes towards you, use a Flash to blind it, and then get out of the way with Quick Attack! Then get behind it, and Mega Kick it in the back! Then finally, we'll see if we can use the Lotads strategy against it! Fire a Leech Seed at it!&quot; Shiftry nodded, and prepared to use his first attack, while Joe began to think. <i>'Techincally, it's still a Normal Type, so hopefully, Leech Seed will work.'</i> He took one last look at Shiftry, before he used his Flash attack.</span></span></div>

<span style="color: Seagreen">Enma squinted and began to duck and weave between rocks which were hurtling in his direction. Every so often a blurred fist shot out, smashing a rock which he had been unable to avoid to smithereens. Sasuke watched in amazement at his Primeape’s strength. These rocks would break a humans hand yet he was smashing them as if they were crackers. <i>’’That’s it Enma keep going’’</i> he shouted, waiting for the moment to give his next command. <i>’’Now, rollout!’’</i> he yelled at the top of his voice through the rain. Enma nodded and jumped up into the air, tucking his arms and legs into his body and doing a forward roll as he did so. He landed on the floor already spinning and rolled towards Kabutops who watched in shock. Enma circled round the shellfish pokemon, gaining speed bewilderingly, before finally circling round and crashing into Kabutops’ legs. For the second time in quick succession the pokemon landed with a sickening thud on his back, knocking the wind right out of him.<br />
<br />
Ino sqeaked and pointed at Enma. Sasuke hadn’t noticed that his Primeape’s momentum meant that he couldn’t stop and was hurtling towards the swamp. With a squelch he splashed into the muddy water, and roared in disgust at the top of his voice. <i>’’Quick Enma,’’</i> Sasuke shouted, <i>’’get back there and use seismic toss.’’</i> His Primeape nodded and put one arm on the bank and bounded out of the swamp, and began to charge full pelt towards the felled pokemon who was getting back to its feet. Just in time Enma grabbed Kabutops leg from underneath him and swept him to the floor again, then began to spin rapidly, flinging swamp mud in all directions. Sasuke grinned as he dodged a large lump of sludge, before Enma let go of Kabutops and tossed him into the swamp for retribution. Sasuke groaned as a huge wave of mud splashed all over him and Ino, who began to sob uncontrollably. <br />
<br />
His Primeapes victory dance was short lived as Kabutops rose menacingly to it’s feet, pointing one scythe forward. It then raised both scythe’s above his head and swiped them downwards, sending two beams of energy at Enma which slashed him across the chest. He turned towards Sasuke and looked down. Blood was seaping from the wounds and oozing down his fur, before dripping off and pooling on the ground. Sasuke whinced and grabbed his GPS Satellite TPP from his pocket. He had known all along that this battle may be too much for his pokemon, and was ready to call for help. He had just lifted it up to his face when Enma roared and turned back towards Kabutops. <i>’’No Enma!’’</i> Sasuke shouted, but his Primeape ignored him. Fretting slightly, Sasuke decided to respect his pokemons wishes, at least for now. <i>’’Ok you big klutz,’’</i> he muttered, while thinking of what orders to give next. <i>’’Stay up on the bank and use rock slide,’’</i> he yelled, noting all the rocks which were now littered around the swamp, <i>’’then follow up with rock tomb.’’</i> Enma nodded and roared again. <i>’’Then dive off the bank and give it a karate chop,’’</i> Sasuke added for good measure, then wiped a splodge of mud off Ino’s face with his sleeve, who’s was still snivelling in his arm.</span></span></div>

<span style="color: MediumTurquoise">Tetsu arived on the shore of Sapphire Island. The sun pleasantly beat down on his untidy silvery-blond hair and red, glowing face, his jacket tied around his waist. &quot;What a beautiful day.&quot; Tetsu chimed. He sighed and glanced around the beach. Many people (who were, unbenounced to him, trainers) and some Pokemon were scattered around the long stretch of gleaming white sand, tanning, building sand castles, and doing other beach going activities, along with profession specific activities, such as contest training or battling. &quot;I guess this isn't exactly the place to be at the moment.&quot; He whipped out his GPSTPP and pressed a button activating the device. It gave out a soft beep and a whir and the opened up. He pressed another button, making a map appear on-screen. He surveyed the map momentarily. Then, something caught his eye. A large river cut through a jungle and ended its trek across the island about a mile from where he was. &quot;Hmmm... Turquoise River, that sounds fun.&quot; He was in the mood for water, but not when all these people were hanging around. He turned towards the source of the river, gazing up the stretch of beach. &quot;Alright, off to Turquoise River.&quot; He started his journey, unaware of the possible danger and excitement he might find...</span><br />
And with that, I throw myself at the will of your hands and keyboards.</div>

<span style="color: Lime"><span style="font-size: 9px">Whilst on the small ship, Rekkuza decided to rent out a row boat to go to the island. Rekkuza, being the dark, mysterious man that he is, landed on the island a few minutes after he departed his cruiser ship. He tied up the small, wooden boat onto a small tree just off shore. He found some sea weed and used it as rope to assure that his ride wasn't going to go anywhere. He landed on the island, full with lush, green shrubbery and bushes. He was amazed, he had always loved forest type areas and slowly walked through them. He found himself stuck in a few bushes so he called out his newly hatched friend, Pinsir.<br />
Out from a Pokeball came a dual-horned creature known as a Pinsir. &quot;I'm giong to need you to use your spiked horns to cut through some of these more dense areas of the jungle.&quot; Rekkuza asked Pinsir. Recieving a short grunt of confirmation. The two looked into the jungle, knowing that the dangers of poisonous plants and other things that could harm himself, and Pinsir. Rekkuza, now having the brush clear enought to go without Pinsir, returns his two-pronged friend and calls out a very new creature; a Pidgey. The two started to head toward, what Rekkuza thought, would be the area with the least amount of people, as Rek doesn't like to be with a group...He was always like that....Always alone.....</span></span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: LimeGreen"><b>Dark Scizor:</b> As you speak to her, Alice got extremely excited and then practically smothered you with a hug. “Oh thank you! I’m glad to have such a strong trainer which Enma has approved of travelling with me” You blush slightly as Alice kneels down to Izumi and says, “Okay Izumi, use your sense. Try to work out where Enma went..” The small Mankey closes her blank eyes and then her tail stretches out straight as a blue aura envelops her. You step back in awe as a bright blue beam of energy appears from her eyes and she begins to spin; mimicking a compass. After a few moments, Izumi stops, the beam from her eyes pointing deeper in the Emerald Forest. Izumi then passes out, landing with a small thud on the ground. Alice rushes to her side and picks up the small Pig Monkey. “You’ll be fine .. Take a rest for a while” As Alice returns her, you look deep into the forest and see only darkness. <br />
<br />
After a while, you both decide to move on in the direction which Izumi pointed to. After 5 minutes of walking, you enter a rundown part of the forest, overrun with Arbok and Ekans. In the distance, you swear you could see a Primeape running through the pack of snakes. As Alice shouts out, “LOOK! Enmas here!” An Arbok rears up and bears it’s chest pattern as a signal of attack! Alice screams as it lashes out at her. What will you do?</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: LimeGreen">Saturn was convinced that following a blind Mankey was bad idea. But screaming near a nest filled with snakes was a worst idea. He could see that an Arbok was already in a fighting stand. The only way to stop it, was in a battle. He thought that it was time to call one of his Pokémon. After he decided what Pokémon he was going to use, he called it onto the field. A ladybug appeared in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ledian, stop that Arbok with your Psybeam and then, I want you to use a Tackle. Finally, unleash a Comet Punch. I don´t think that the snake is going to bother us after those attacks.&quot;<br />
<br />
The five star Pokémon nodded.</span></div>

Releasing Tropius and returning Wooper and Slowqueen, you use Tropius to tow the raft. The old man’s eyes light up in glee as you fling rope over Tropius’ legs and attach it to the raft. Letting out a solemn roar, Tropius flapped his huge wings and began to move towards what you hope you pointed to was Sapphire Island. Sfter about 5 minutes of travelling, you realise that you’re nowhere near land and you turn to the old man, who you assume is the leader of the group. He stares back at you with bright red eyes and laughs sinisterly, “Well well well.. “ He says in a low tone, “Seems we’re lost again eh?!” His body then began to twitch wildly as his form began to shrink, and his clothes fell off his form. A wicked laugh floods your hearing as a Dusclops stands where the old man was.. “You see, the thing is human, I’m starving and well, me and the others think that you and your pokemon will make a grand meal..” As Dusclops says this, the others then ‘melt’ into the raft, leaving a pile of clothes behind them. And 6 Ghosts appear; Haunter, Gastly, Shuppet, Duskull, Sableye and a Misdreavus. They all look at you madly and lick their lips. “We have been stranded for months in this vast open sea, we once lived on the island we spoke about, it was a harmony for Ghost types and they were all wiped out.. The island is no more and now we search for a new island to take over anstd call our own.. But we need food first. And you served your purpose!” Dusclops then sends a Shadow Punch at you, and Tropius begins to flail as he flies causing the ghost to tumble and miss. You gasp in relief and look into the diance as Dusclops rises onto his feet. You notice what looks like a small port. You assume its Sapphire Island and it will take you 10 mins to get there. What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
&quot;Zora R prophetic!&quot; Zora announced, his egocentricity continuing to display even in this potentially fatal situation. &quot;Now consider yourselfs entitled to a heavy dose of Tropius pwnage!&quot; full of confidence in his parters abilities, he turned towards him before shouting out his commands. &quot;Free yourself from those ties with a <b>Magical Leaf</b> attack, then demonstrate to Dusclops the devastating <b>Power</b> of <b>Nature</b>!&quot;</div>

John stepped down onto the beach, and took a breath of fresh air into his lungs, before observing the scenery. He looked into the trees, and smiled, before running his fingers through his hair. He took a few steps forward, before taking a seat on the sand, and looking out to sea. He took out a Pokeball, and placed it on the sand to the side of him. John tapped the ball with his finger, and it burst open in an explosion of light. Once the light had disappeared, all that was left was a Gyarados, floating in the air, who quickly made his way over to the water, and dived in. John then took out two more Pokeballs, and placed them on the sand to the other side of him. There were two more little explosions of light, before a Croconaw and a Chinchou appeared on the sand. Croconaw followed Gyarados into the water, while Chinchou chose to sit down next to John. <br />
<br />
A short while later, after all three Water Pokemon had had a little fun, John quickly grabbed their attention. All three made their way over, and settled down next to him, while John got his map out.<br />
&quot;Right, it's time we decide on where about we'll be going on this island. So, what do you three think?&quot; he asked, and the three Pokemon all looked at the map. After a couple of seconds, Chinchou quickly looked back up, and pointed towards a spot on the map, followed by Croconaw, and finally, Gyarados. John looked down at the map, and quickly glanced at all three choices.<br />
<br />
:170: - <span style="color: mediumturquoise">Turquoise River</span><br />
:159: - <span style="color: limegreen">Emerald Jungle</span><br />
:130: - <span style="color: seagreen">Jade Swamp</span><br />
<br />
After considering the options for a while, John finally gave in. He looked up, and shot a quick smile at Gyarados, before picking up Chinchou, and getting up onto his feet. Croconaw stood up at the same time, and looked up at John, with a sad look on her face, but John quickly nudged her with his foot, and she couldn't help but smile. Gyarados roared loudly, before looking down at John, happily. John then turned around towards the jungle, and started walking towards the Jade Swamp, with Chinchou in his arms, and Gyarados and Croconaw following behind.</span></div>

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: DarkRed"><u>Ruby Mountain - Please reply in <b>DarkRed</b></u><br />
<br />
<b>Lonely Wanderer:</b> As you and Cryseye approach Ruby Mountain, you’re astounded by its sheer size, it’s height easily surpasses the clouds. The ground you walk on is covered in jewels, which Cryseye eyes in delight, licking her lips. As you continue on, you begin to climb the mountain through the paths which have been made by the natives which reside on the island. Coming across a small tunnel, you stop and Cryseye peers in curious. Suddenly, Cryseye takes off into the tunnel and you yet again find yourself following your Dark pokemon. As you get further into the tunnel, the light shining in diminishes and you find yourself in complete darkness. A loud cry of “Sablee! EYE!” directs you to Cryseye who is being attacked by some sort of pokemon. You hear a shrill Screech which causes you to hold your ears in pain. A quick cry of “Zuuuu!” suggests to you that it’s a Zubat. Cryseye seems to have gotten into a fight with it. What will you do?</span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: DarkRed"><span style="font-size: 9px"><i>Why is Cryseye always shifting her attitude? </i>Andrea questioned herself in her mind as she gave chase to her Sableye, who was entering one of the hundreds of tunnels in the mountain. <i>Seriously, at one point she is very gentle and polite...next minute you know, she could be mischevious and hasty, running around while be deceiving. This is why I never let her out when Impish is around...</i><br />
<br />
As she stepped into a completely dark tunnel, she could've sworn that there was another figure in the tunnel besides herself and Cryseye...the evidence was when a screeching sound, like nails grinding on a chalkboard, had suddenly pierced through the air, forcing Andrea to cover her ears as they rang with pain. Right after the Screech faded, Andrea recognized a Pokémon cry that did not belong to her Sableye's, and she was able to identify the Pokémon to be a Zubat. She had seen another Zubat once in her time in her adventures, and that Zubat (and probably this one too) wasn't friendly at all. Groaning as her ear continously rang, she had seen a form move inside the darkness, and she predicted that that was her Sableye, Cryseye, who was probably trying to recover from the Screech attack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cryseye, can you hear me?&quot; Andrea asked her Sableye in the lost pitch blackness. She soon felt a claw tugging on her pant, and a small murmur of &quot;Sable!&quot; had signalled that Cryseye was right next to her. &quot;Okay, your safe here. Look, it's completely dark in here, so I want you to light up your crystallized eyes with <b>Flash</b>, then go and find where that Zubat is. Once you find it, then release an <b>Ice Punch</b> on a wing to try and disable its flying abilities. Despite if it falls or not, send a <b>Night Shade </b>towards the Zubat's direction afterwards.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another tug on Andrea's grey pants sent a message that Cryseye understood her commands, and she soon felt the claw let go of her pants as Andrea braced herself, ready to face the effects of the Flash attack.<br />
</span></span><br />
<br />
<b>OOC:</b> Ushi No Tane, you are now in my group. I've sent you a PM, so check it and respond ASAP.</div>

<b>Joshua:</b> After issuing your attacks, Hayley nods as Salamence growls at her lowly, and then launches even further above the trees, taunting Hayley to follow. Hayley begins to summon her Strength as she moves higher in to the sky to meet the majestic dragon. Salamence remains still as she smashes into him, sending him hurtling backwards, but as she grabs to hurl him to the ground, Salamence blasts her with a Point Blank Flamethrower in the face. Hayley screams in pain as her face is engulfed by the flames. Narius grins and so does Salamence as Hayley tries to shake the flames off, and when she does, her face is covered by burns. Engulfed by anger, Hayley then blast Salamence with Dragonbreath, and he fires his own to counter it. When hes not looking, Hayley charges her right fist with Ice Energy and smashes it in to Salamence’s jaw, causing it to freeze over more. Narius flinches then says, “Well Joshua, you’re showing your worth. Salamence.. Dragon Dance! Then Hyper Beam!” Salamence dances around in the sky, raising his offensive and speed and then opens his mouth, charging a lethal Hyper Beam which he then sends towards Hayley at tremendous force. What will you do?</span>

Thanks muchly Becki, and I hope my replies are up to scratch.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: Lime">Joshua winces as Hayley ends this round burned, but he smiles at Narius' compliment. &quot;Why thank you,&quot; he calls to his adversary. &quot;You and your Salamence are proving more challenging than I anticipated. But you left yourself wide open for this...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hayley, use Faint Attack to dodge the Hyper Beam and slam into Salamence's side. Then smash it in the jaw again with another Ice Punch, then finish it with a close up Dragonbreath to his face!&quot;</span></div>

Krabby stops concentrating, staring at the woman. Glaring at you, the woman puts her hands on her hips, and attempts to communicate once more. &quot;No...Want...Treasure?&quot; She manages to say, before pointing at Krabby, and then Magneto. Your brain struggles to get her meaning, but too late. Angrily, she stomps forward, gives you another hard slap, and begins to walk off with Krabby. &quot;Krabu, et toi...Moron.&quot; You hear her mutter.<br />
<br />
Before she can get thirty feet away from you, however, she disappears from sight, and you can see Krabby scuttling back towards you. Hurriedly, it pinches your leg, and amazingly begins to drag you along with it. You find yourself looking into a rather large pitfall, and water is beginning to collect at the bottom. Lying in the water, the woman's once more unconcious form lays. If you don't hurry, she'll drown...and there's no knowing what made the hole in the first place...<br />
<br />
What will you do?<br />
<br />
<b>Fabuvinny</b><br />
<br />
Unfortunatly, the Shellder is not ready to give up. It leaps from the water, blasting all three of you with an <b>ICE BEAM</b>, giving poor Tangle a headache and freezing Mary to the sand around her. Giggling, the small bivalve then begins to zoom around in circles, quite pleased with its actions. It hops up from the water a couple more times, spitting a mass of water at you each time.<br />
<br />
Angry, Tangle wobbles, but looks back to you for guidance, wondering if it should once again attack the Shellder before you continue to search the beach, or whether to just run for it.<br />
<br />
??? What will you do ???<br />
<br />
<b>Solarsaur</b><br />
<br />
Waves of ocean water break gently on the shore, and a light wind picks up, cooling you down. A flock of Wingull flies overhead, searching for any food scraps they can get their hands on. Er...beaks. Wings? Whatever. Krabby scuttle along the shore, being harassed by said Wingull. Suddenly, a group of Krabby skedaddly in front of you, barring your way. You notice yourself to be boxed in by the little buggers. There's at least 50 of them!<br />
<br />
They begin to advance slowly, pincers clicking, as they let out their odd cry. &quot;Cookie...COOKIE!&quot; Before they reach you, however, an opening appears straight down the middle of them, right in front of you, and a rather large Kinglar stalks forward, massive pincer clacking loudly. A crown made of seaweed and kelp adorns its head, and it glares at you. &quot;COOOOOOOKIE!&quot; It bellows, before slamming its claw into the sand, obviously demanding why you dare tread on its domain.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span><br />

The lady smiles warmly. &quot;Great. Ah, your Sneasel is a fine specimen...&quot; She trails off, shaking her head. &quot;If I weren't so busy, I'd examine it more closely. Ah well. Fredrick!&quot; She calls out. A young man with flaming red hair walks forward, holding a notepad like it was his life.<br />
<br />
He looks to you, and then to the woman. &quot;Yes, Cynthia?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've found someone to escort you to where you need to go. I'm sure he'll keep you safe. Now, I must go. Be careful, please. I don't need you...&quot; Cynthia trails off, looking at you. &quot;Just be careful.&quot; She finishes, walking off.<br />
<br />
Fredrick, a frown on his face, turns to you. &quot;Sorry. She's a bit overprotective of me. Nice to meet you.&quot; He says, holding out a hand to shake. &quot;Unfortunatly, I have one of the roughest jobs out here. You see, a rather large swarm of Beedrill has set up a colony not far from here. I need to go see how far this colony stretches, and how many their are. The last couple of scientists who attempted this...well...never mind that.&quot; A smile appears over his frown.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, shall we begin?&quot;</span><br />

The Shaman smiles once more. &quot;I am so happy that you are so eager to do this. The Temple Grounds are not far from here, though the path is dangerous. At least, it is now. A group of Bug Pokemon have taken over the path...hmm...as your first step towards training, I give you the duty of clearing these pests from the path, and enabling us to travel peacefully to and from the Temple. Come, I will set you on the right road.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man stands up shakily from his prone position, old age clearly inhibiting his movement. &quot;I'm afraid I don't have much time left...&quot; He mumbles, more to himself than anyone. He grabs a stick adorned with many different shamany things, like feathers, small skulls, and the like, and begins a slow limp outside. &quot;..BAH!&quot; He says before he gets halfway to the door. Mumbling to himself, the Shaman whacks the inside of the hut a few times, and a small child comes running in, breathless.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, Svorn, I am pleased you came so quickly. Please, be a kind little boy, and take this young lady to the Temple Path for me?&quot; He asks. The Boy, Svorn, nods, and grabs your hand, a smile plastered onto his face. &quot;Thisa way lady person!&quot; He giggles, and begins to tug you along. It isn't that long of a walk, and you arrive on the path in no time. &quot;May the Luckyness guide you...or somfin' lika that Lady Person!&quot; The boy giggles again, and takes off. The forest opens dark, foreboding, like a bad omen. Buzzes and snaps can be heard from not far up the path...<br />
<br />

Smiling, the man replied &quot;The name is Hanson. As for my Pokemon...I daresay you've seen anything of the sort around here. I've yet to see any Pokemon from my home region of Lehm here...&quot; He then trailed off, plucking two Pokeballs from his belt. &quot;Ah, I believe I shall use these two. <a href="http://www.hwachong.edu.sg/~y05hci263/trogly.gif" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hwachong.edu.sg%2F%7Ey05hci263%2Ftrogly.gif&amp;hash=a1d4c8e45cf7095fd0bd9035efc9d556" rel="nofollow noopener">Trogly</a> and <a href="http://www.hwachong.edu.sg/~y05hci263/arkoud_full.gif" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hwachong.edu.sg%2F%7Ey05hci263%2Farkoud_full.gif&amp;hash=7b1b666175bb3bbc69569e841e4f063a" rel="nofollow noopener">Arkound</a>!&quot; The two Pokemon appear, Trogly hopping once or twice on the soft forest floor, and Arkound scratching at the ground, looking around at all the vegetation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, as to your inquiry, I had always planned to show you what I am researching. Most all trainers are inquisitive, and I rightfully assumed you were no different. Now, let us begin. Best of luck to you Kaya!&quot; Hanson says, stepping back away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arkound, let's start off with a nice <b>HIDDEN POWER</b>, and then <b>ICE BEAM</b>. Pick your own targets. You two have done this often enough, so you shouldn't squabble. Trogly, begin with a <b>MUDDY WATER</b>, and then <b>SECRET POWER</b>!&quot;<br />
<br />

I don't expect long replies for a battle ;D<br />
<br />
The Drailisk roars in defiance at Gaurdian, who roars equally as loud back. With a sound like an explosion, Drailisk dashes forward, entering the water with Gaurdian, who immediatly begins to <b>THRASH</b> about in an attempt to hit the creature. Gaurdian manages to slam its tail into one of the creatures heads, but the other one hits Gaurdian with a blast of bluish-green flames, an obvious <b>DRAGONBREATH</b> attack.<br />
<br />
Angry now, more angry than before, really, Gaurdian summons up the <b>RAGE</b> of <b>DRAGON</b>s, and a large Twister forms inbetween the two water titans. With a loud screech, the twin-headed monster bursts through the cyclone, and immediatly shoots twin <b>BEAM</b>s of <b>ICE</b> at Gaurdian, hitting him in his stomach, and freezing it over lightly. Roaring in agony, the sea serpent blasts forward through the water, <b>BITING</b> down painfully into the Drailisk's left neck. The other head responds in kind, managing to get past Gaurdian's scales and into its flesh. With a cry, Gaurdian releases the left head, as the right one reappears, something blue and red held tightly in its teeth...<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span><br />
<br />
ZJ: I need to talk with Becki before I update you. You'll be included with the next batch, I promise.<br />
<br />
Thib: I still have yet to recieve word from you :&lt; PM me, IM me, or post in here saying if you'd like to restart or whatnot.<br />
<br />
All: Aplogies if they're crappy. I decided it'd be better to get a semi-cruddy set out than no set at all :&lt;</div>
