<span style="font-size: 12px">A bizarre place, where nothing is quite normal; to arrive here is a thing of rumor and myth. Running northeast to southwest, bisecting the region of Fizzytopia, is the majestic River Virga. Folklore says that on moonlit nights a hooded figure navigates its length aboard an old, narrow vessel made of wood. For the right price, they will ferry you up the river, to a place not on any map -- a place many say doesn’t even exist.</span><br />

<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 10px"><span style="font-size: 18px"><i><b>Zone Areas</b></i></span></span>&#8203;</div><br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: right">&#8203;</div><b><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: rgb(226, 80, 65)">The Skewed Forest:</span></span></b><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: rgb(226, 80, 65)"> Along the banks of the river grows a dense forest of white-barked trees, with branches that twist and tangle in ways not seen in any typical wood. Regardless of season, the branches are always thick with leaves and abloom with strange yet beautiful flowers unlike anything ever seen elsewhere. The forest teams with life, but the Pokémon found here don't seem quite normal...</span></span><br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: right"><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: rgb(226, 80, 65)"><b>The Twisty Shrine:</b> At the heart of the Skewed Forest is a large tree; so large it defies imagination. Its snow-white bark is covered in innumerable carvings, of pictures, of names, of wishes and ideas, in languages both familiar and foreign. Some of them are deep, and some of them are shallow; some are quite old, and others look brand new. Its branches seem to reach the heavens, and its roots, each one as thick around as a man, rise from the soil in fantastic knots and curls. In the hollow space formed between the earth and the twist of the mightiest of the roots is a shrine with no known origin to the deity Pokémon Lugia, said to have been so overwhelmed by its own power that it hid itself in the sea. An earnest prayer to the wooden effigy can bring clarity to those in need, or unshackle those who wish to be freed from the restraints of normalcy.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201)">The Lake of Reflections:</span></b><span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201)"> A rivulet breaks from the river, trickling down a steep slope to pool in the basin at the foot of the hills. Opalescent and almost ethereal, the water reflects back a distorted image of the world. Crooked reeds grow around its edge, skirted by oddly shaped lily pads and strangely colored grasses. Deep enough to swim in, its surface ripples with all the signs of a thriving ecosystem, but the creatures that call this place home are just a little unusual...<br />
<br />
<b>The Crooked Font:</b> On the far side of the Lake of Reflections is a crude fountain made of smooth yet irregularly shaped rocks of many colors, set into the side of a hill. It flows, never-ending, though there there is no evidence of a spring to feed it. The largest of the stones forms a centerpiece, upon which is painted odd yet recognizable images of the deity trio of Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres, their wings folded and their heads bowed as if in deep introspection. The water here is cool and sweet and pleasant to drink. It is so refreshing that it is nearly transcendental; those who imbibe talk of seeing the world with a new clarity, or discovering new resolve to walk a unique path in life.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: rgb(65, 168, 95)">The Topsy-Turvy Hills:</span></b><span style="color: rgb(65, 168, 95)"> Surrounding the Lake of Reflection are seven hills, with drastic slopes and lopsided valleys. So wild are the curves and peaks that to walk them is to not even know if one is coming, or going. Wildflowers grow along their sides in neon colors that defy nature, speckled like faerie lights in the tall grass. Even when the winds are still, the hillsides rustle with the comings and goings of little critters that, under close inspection, are a tad bit odd...<br />
<br />
<b>The Peculiar Peak:</b> Reaching the top of the tallest hill is surprisingly challenging. Though ostensibly of finite height, those who try to climb find themselves seeming to make no progress in their ascension -- up and up they walk, and yet the peak doesn't ever seem to get any closer. Still, it is just a hill; if one walks long enough up its side, surely one will reach the top eventually. If you do, a breathtaking view awaits. Here, one can see everything in the realm, which seems to stretch on forever in a tapestry of thickets, hills, valleys, and rivulets. Towering above the earth, one could almost catch the stars that streak through the sky as they fall in twos and threes in an endless cosmic cascade. A constellation likened to the deity Pokémon Ho-oh hangs like a crown jewel over the peak, promising to bring new and different life from the ashes of the old -- a clearer future, or a strange new journey.</span></span>&#8203;</div></div>

<span style="font-size: 12px">Clarity is the new mechanic by which normal Pokémon turn into Shadow Pokémon, and by which Shadow Pokémon can be purified. It replaces the negative bond system, and is one of two means of entry into the <i>Realm of Shadows</i>. It is completely player-tracked, although redemption of clarity must be approved by a ZA or ZU prior to adventuring.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px">★ Clarity operates on a scale of 00 to 30.<br />
★ Shadow Pokémon start with 00 clarity. All other Pokémon start with 30 clarity.<br />
★ Shadow Pokémon are purifiable when they reach 30 clarity.<br />
★ Non-shadow Pokémon are shadowfiable when they reach 00 clarity.<br />

<span style="font-size: 12px">Under the old system, Shadow Pokémon had a negative bond value between -20 and -01. To convert to the new system, take the value of the negative bond and subtract it from 30. The resulting value is your Pokémon's new clarity value. <b>e.g. if your Pokémon's previous bond value was -05, subtact 05 from 30. (30 - 05 = 25.) Your Pokémon's new clarity value would be 25.</b><br />
<br />
★ When converting from bond, you must provide a link to the most recent bond post for the Pokémon in question.</span><br />

<br />
<div style="text-align: center"><b><i>Redeeming</i></b>&#8203;</div><br />
<span style="font-size: 12px">When a Shadow Pokémon accumulates 30 clarity, or when the clarity of any other Pokémon reaches 00, the extreme bond value may be 'redeemed' for one <i>Realm of Shadows</i> adventure. To redeem clarity, reply to this thread with links to sources of all applied positive or negative clarity and the nickname, species, and gender of the Pokémon whose clarity is being redeemed.<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: Darkseagreen"><span style="font-size: 10px">The air whistled an ominous tune past the trainer’s ears, carrying whispers from worlds far away as if calling out to him. Lucas shifted his head ever so slightly to listen closer to what they were saying, and mumbles the words in repeat.<br />
<br />
“Thirst.”<br />
<br />
Thirst? If anything, he was hungry. Hungry and-<br />
<br />
“Ugh,” Lucas tried to shake the thoughts away. He was supposed to stay empty-headed for now just in case. A meditative trance so he could-<br />
<br />
“Squawk! Idiot.” Black’s voice called out from the sky. He had returned from his brief scouting mission. Lucas tried ignoring him at first, just so- “Squawk! You’re an idiot.”<br />
<br />
Lucas opened his eyes with a deep sigh, trying his best not to let his annoyance show. The Chatot perched itself on his trainer’s shoulders, opened its mouth to squawk and had it suddenly shut by his trainer’s hand.<br />
<br />
“Quiet,” he hissed at his Pokémon. “Now, did you find anything?”<br />
<br />
“Bee,” Greycoat resounded calmly. Lucas removed his hand from the bird’s beak to let him speak.<br />
<br />
“SQUAWK!” It furied out of spite. “Idiot, boat, boat, boat.”<br />
<br />
“Boat what?”<br />
<br />
“Boat,” the Chatot insisted.<br />
<br />
<i>’Infuriating little pet,’</i> the trainer thought to himself. The CHatot could perfectly answer him but decided not to and force his trainer’s hand. “Very well then. Grey!” he called out to his close-by Beheeyem who had mostly been staying quiet while his trainer meditated. “Transfer the memories if you can.” He pinned the Chatot down by his talons and sneered a little. “And make it hurt a little if you can.<br />
<br />
“Squawk,” the Chatot disapproved.<br />
<br />
“Beehee.” The Beheeyem agreed, but only to the transfer. He wasn’t planning on hurting his trainer or allies, or at least, not intentionally. Greycoat raised an arm with digits shining brilliant colours in alternating fashions. He held the digits up close to the Chatot who seemed rather calm about letting the Beheeyem do this, clearly having done this before. Blackbeard’s gaze grew hollow as Greycoat analysed his memories and tried to distil the events of the last few minutes in a puzzle of brain cells and firing synapses. Finally, less than half a minute later, the Beheeyem pulled his arm back gently. The Chatot’s hollow gaze lifted by his Impish nature before giving another squawk. The Beheeyem then focussed his attention on his trainer. Without discontinuing the flashing of his fingers, he raised his arm close to Lucas’ temple and started tampering with his memory. This was why the meditation was so important to him.<br />
<br />
Lucas and Greycoat had experimented with the Beheeyem’s psychic powers of memory tampering before. In most cases, Greycoat’s constructions were basic and error-prone; missing details, peripheral views or greyscaled colours. This time however, there was something new. There was no sound, and for a moment Lucas thought something had gone wrong and he had gone deaf. He felt reassured though as his memory was overwritten by that of Blackbeard’s. The Beheeyem couldn’t just insert a memory however he liked. Perhaps it was out of experience, or unwillingness, but either way, Lucas would have to have part of his memory replaced and substituted for a memory of near equal length if the Beheeyem was going to copy the scene into Lucas’ head. What’s more, once Greycoat was finished, Lucas might not recall which memory he had just inserted or that he even asked for it. For this reason, they had issued a small precaution. Lucas could prepare for a memory transplant by meditating at the same moment he sent Blackbeard out to scout the sky. Lucas would avoid doing anything directly important to remember. The result would be that, to Lucas’ mind, he meditated, had a reverie, then opened his eyes and asked Greycoat to override his memories. This way, Lucas would be sure that his implanted memory would be the trance-like vision he had. The vision that coincidentally, and so abruptly, ended with Blackbeard’s squawk.<br />
<br />
Greycoat lowered his arms when he finished with a confirming “Bee-yem.” Lucas’ own eyes returned from their hypnotic state as they slowly focussed back towards his Pokémon.<br />
<br />
“What?” It took a while before he recalled what had happened.<br />
<br />
“Oh right!” he erupted. “Grey, I asked you to transplant the memory, did you do that yet.<br />
<br />
“Bee.”<br />
<br />
“Cool. Then that means..” his eyes spun in small circles as he contemplated. I remember..flying..and..” The images this time were silent. There was no wind or the beating of Blackbeard’s wings, his wings. “I remember now. There is a boat, a dinghy one at that I’d say, and I think it’s coming this way. I think. I don’t remember because I turned back before I could be sure. He quickly grabbed his Chatot by the beak again. “You turned away on purpose didn’t you. You-“<br />
<br />
The sound of a boat hit the shore. There was no need to have gone through the memory transplant. All they had to do was wait. Lucas’s hands gently lost their grip as his mouth drooped a little at this realisation.<br />
<br />
“Cha-cha-cha. Idiot.”<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Lucas had no words for his travel across the river Virga. The ferryman was an odd fellow for sure, and Lucas felt obliged to hand over his payment of <a href="http://forums.upnetwork.net/showthread.php?t=8097" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.upnetwork.net%2Fshowthread.php%3Ft%3D8097&amp;hash=c19ccbb3b6d16984ce2f946e3ae53f6f" rel="nofollow noopener">one Silver Umbra (50 FC)</a> to the Charon of the Shadow Realm. A small thought nagged in his mind though. Was he supposed to bring two so he could get back as well?<br />

Running northeast to southwest, bisecting the region of Fizzytopia, is the majestic River Virga. Folklore says that on moonlit nights a hooded figure navigates its length aboard an old, narrow vessel made of wood. For the right price, they will ferry you up the river, to a place not on any map -- a place many say doesn’t even exist.</span><br />

<span style="color: rosybrown">Isaac's eyes strained against the darkness of the night. He wasn't used to being out this late anymore --- hell, he was hardly used to adventuring anymore. He had spent a long time in his cabin, lost in his thoughts after Kyle had left again. A bitterness consumed him, a bitterness that could only be lifted through adventure; and an uncharted location seemed just the place to do it. <br />
<br />
His mouth was dry and his steps were hurried as he rushed along the banks of the river. Kyp and Vinny ran alongside him, passing worried glances to one another as they followed their trainer. Their loyalty knew no bounds... but they also knew of the place Isaac was seeking. Vinny had glanced over the pieces of paper that he had written on, and she had heard him talking to the residents of New Fizz City for evidence of such a fantastic location. She wondered what he hoped to find in such a dark place, and she certainly hoped that nothing bad would befall her or Kyp. <br />
<br />
Kyp, meanwhile, was sticking close to Vinny. He knew what the Leafeon meant to their master, and he knew full well to ensure that no harm would befall her. For her and her daughter's sake. As he glanced towards her again, he couldn't help but notice how absolutely stunning she looked in the moonlight. A catch for sure, he wondered why she didn't exactly have a mate. She was certainly alluring an- Kyp's thoughts were interrupted by seeing Vinny stop, tilting her head and staring at him.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Are you okay?&quot;</i> She asked, moving closer to him. He shook his head and gave a toothy smile.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Sorry, Vinny. Just... thinking about this whole thing.&quot;</i> She nodded and gestured towards their trainer. He knew full well that she wanted to stick close to Isaac, especially when this hooded figure showed up... if it ever did. <br />
<br />
Isaac stuck close to the bank, looking out across the river. Vinny and Kyp approached him, Kyp felt his fur bristle slightly as he caught sight of a dingy wooden boat --- if you could even call it a boat, floating down the riverbend. The darkened figure grew crisper as it got closer to them, appearing as a hooded humanoid. Kyp forced down the fear in his throat, swallowing hard. He could feel Vinny shaking slightly from near him, her eyes darting to Isaac's belt --- where Ahri's Pokeball hung. As the boat docked itself, the figure said nothing... it simply held out a concealed hand (or at least what Kyp hoped was a hand) towards Isaac. Isaac reached into his pocket slowly, saying nothing as if he was in some kind of trance. He produced a small coin, silver in coloration, handing it to the figure. <br />
<br />
The figure lifted the coin, holding it up against the moonlit sky before dropping it into it's cloak. It moved slightly, allowing Isaac to step onto the raft with Vinny and Kyp. Isaac stepped on without hesitation, causing Vinny to quiver. She had never seen him like this. It was like it wasn't even him, a man driven by sheer hatred and desire. Kyp brushed against her, encouraging her onto the raft as they joined their trainer. <br />
<br />
Kyp stared down into the water as the figure lead them up the river. For the first time in his life, he was questioning Isaac's judgment.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
The boat docked itself on the banks of a seemingly lush forest. Despite the darkness, Kyp could make out the bundles of leaves that hung delicately amongst the horrifically gnarled branches of the tall trees. Isaac looked forward, still not speaking. Vinny's brow furrowed, she brushed her body against her trainer's leg and looked up at him. He brought a cigarette to his lips and lit it with a lighter, a sudden orange light in the otherwise oppressing darkness.<br />
<br />
Isaac's words were stuck in his throat. He wanted to say something reassuring to Vinny and Kyp... but this forest was beyond what he could imagine. The air felt oppressive here, and the plants that hung from the trees seemed almost alien. What did he want here? Not even he knew. Revenge? Vengeance? Some sort of powerful Pokemon that would fill the tremendous void he felt in his soul. People who spoke of this place had talked about the Pokemon, their oddities. <br />
<br />
... And Isaac was curious, morbidly so. So he trudged on in this twisted forest, with his two loyal Pokemon following close to him. <br />

The boat makes no sound as it strikes shore. A dense fog having closed in, the sudden change in inertia is the only thing indicating that you've come to a stop at all. You find yourself oddly disoriented as you disembark. The stars above you don't look familiar and none of the constellations you recognize seem to be there, impeding any attempt to ascertain your location. The air is dense, and smells a little sweet, though you cannot place the odor; whether or not it is comforting or oppressive is one of perspective. You can hear the soft burbling off a stream to your left, and distantly in that direction, you can see the opalescent sheen of water through the mist. To your right, the delicate leaves of a thousand trees barely crown above the surface of the haze, indicating what you can only assume to be a forest edge. What catches your attention, however, lies directly in front of you.<br />
<br />
It's a hill. Or, rather, many hills. The first and smallest sits directly at you 12'o'clock. Its neighbor, slightly taller, breaks off from it at about halfway up its left slope. The next does the same, slightly larger than the last and to its left, too. On it goes like this, each one taller, and each one to its left, and slightly offset too, so that they form a crescent that brings the last and tallest technically closest to you on you y-axis. It sits so far away on your x-axis, however, as to almost seem impossible to reach, as if something were not quite right, spatially. You stare, unsettled, for a moment at the greatest of the peaks, before moving forwards, between the water and the trees, towards what you somehow know is the 'first' hill. There is an order here, and even if you don't understand it, you must abide it, or risk becoming lost.<br />
<br />
The grass under your feet is soft, and thick, and as you move away from the river, the fog begins to recede. A glance backwards confirms it is still there, at your heels, and no matter how many steps you take it stays right there at your back, but so long as you keep moving forward, it does not consume you again. With newfound clarity, you can better see the forest and the lake, the former of which seems to stretch on beyond what you can see. The air is cool, with a gentle breeze that brings, wafting on it, the smell of water and soil. Your steps don't seem to bring you any closer to the near-yet-distant hill and yet, after some time, you realize that you've begun ascending, the lake basin dipping lower and lower below you, an inch at a time. The ground below your feet seems level, however, and none of those fixtures of your inner ear have shifted, as far as you are aware, as they would were you on an incline.<br />
<br />
You do not have the time to contemplate the strangeness of this, however. Though comfortably short beneath your feet, to every side of you and even in front of you, the grass is tall, and multicolored with sheens none only of green, but of blue and purple and red. Stalks tufted with congregates of downy seeds flutter in the gentle wind. There's the faint sound of rustling; then, something drops out of the sky.<br />
<br />
It happens in an instant. A very large bird which you recognize only by the distinct plumage on its head as being a Staraptor dives at multiple hundreds of of miles per hour, slowing only in the last few critical seconds as it spreads its wings to stall, body shifting from a nose-dive to talons-first. In half an instant its claws seize something that makes a truly horrifying sound, and then, with a few powerful beats of is wings, it is aloft again, and well above your head before you've even had time to process the event. The terrified survivors of the attack scurry out of the grass a fast as their little legs can carry them, certain death is still upon them. You see a flash of purple wizz past you, just to your right, and something yellow, just to your left. You've almost oriented yourself within the chaos, when a thing something -- round, orange, and distinctly rodent in nature -- slams into your shin, itself disoriented. Knocked by by its own reversed momentum, it rolls once, and then sits upright. Its round head swivels, looking to one side, and then to the other. It sniffs the air, small nose quivering, and then it focuses its gaze on you. Cocking its head, it stares, eyes utterly void of any discernible emotion. In fact, it looks almost hollow. Its previous terror seems utterly forgotten in the wake of your appearance. You, it seems, are more interesting than safety.<br />
<br />
What will you do?<br />

Everyone feels something different, here. For Isaac and his companions, it's a heavy, oppressive place, and the unease is palpable.The forest seems to swallow you as you begin the slow march inside, the treeline closing behind you as if the river and its bank never existed at all. No, it's more than that; it's as though nothing else, nothing but these woods, has ever existed in all of eternity. You press on.<br />
<br />
The branches and the vines all curl in unnatural loops around you, and the roots of the trees jut up from the ground, many of them with more than enough space between them and the earth below for critters to squeeze through. Some of the trees have knotholes and inside those knotholes you could swear that you can see eyes staring back at you, the moonlight bouncing off of their tapeti lucidi, and glittering like diamonds. They stalk you, watch you, judge you, pity you. What are you doing in a place like this? Why are you pursuing danger when you're so well loved, as indicated by the creatures at your feet who ignore all their instincts and neglect self preservation, in order to preserve <i>you</i>, the man who has brought them here into this place that even you recognize as being smothering? Maybe you're selfish. Maybe, you've just given up.<br />
<br />
There's a rustling in the leaves above your head, and all of the little, judging eyes peering out at you from the nooks and crannies disappear as if they were snuffed out by some sinister wind. As you peer up at the silhouette of the canopy, juxtaposed against the moonlight refracted through the thickening cloud cover, there is another sound, like a bow drug carelessly over the strings of a violent. <i>Skree. Skree. Skree.</i> It's perfectly timed, and repetitive, and then it reduplicates and you can hear it from both sides of you, then behind you, and in front of you, and all around you; a creaky, screeching chorus. Then you see the eyes, and the shadow of wings, on a skinny tree just to your left. The chorus disappears, all at once, and it's the only thing that remains, screaming at you with each rhythmic flutter of its wings.<br />

Running northeast to southwest, bisecting the region of Fizzytopia, is the majestic River Virga. Folklore says that on moonlit nights a hooded figure navigates its length aboard an old, narrow vessel made of wood. For the right price, they will ferry you up the river, to a place not on any map -- a place many say doesn’t even exist.<br />

So wild are the curves and peaks that to walk them is to not even know if one is coming, or going. Wildflowers grow along their sides in neon colors that defy nature, speckled like faerie lights in the tall grass. Even when the winds are still, the hillsides rustle with the comings and goings of little critters that, under close inspection, are a tad bit odd...<br />

Though ostensibly of finite height, those who try to climb find themselves seeming to make no progress in their ascension -- up and up they walk, and yet the peak doesn't ever seem to get any closer. Still, it is just a hill; if one walks long enough up its side, surely one will reach the top eventually. If you do, a breathtaking view awaits. Here, one can see everything in the realm, which seems to stretch on forever in a tapestry of thickets, hills, valleys, and rivulets. Towering above the earth, one could almost catch the stars that streak through the sky as they fall in twos and threes in an endless cosmic cascade. A constellation likened to the deity Pokémon Ho-oh hangs like a crown jewel over the peak, promising to bring new and different life from the ashes of the old -- a clearer future, or a strange new journey.<br />

</blockquote>Big swallows and breathes into his hands to warm them as he enters the very bottom of the Topsy Turvey Hills, having already handed off the mysterious coin he was given to the taxi that asked for it. He takes out the two pokeballs from his waist, the only two he had brought with him this night. He enlarges the ghost ball and tosses out his Sableye Mysteria. She appears and takes in the scenery with an appreciative grin before giving Big a look equivalent to raising her eyebrows at him, but with her gem eyes and lack of eyebrows it just comes off as unnerving. Big then tosses out his luxury ball releasing his Zubat Alucard. &quot;Hahaha. So we finally made it eh?&quot; The zubat somehow seems to be smiling even bigger than the Sableye as he settles onto Big's shoulder. &quot;Yeah.&quot; Big says a little quietly. &quot;This is the right place right Mysteria?&quot; Big asks. &quot;I'd hate to have put in all of this work in to go to a creepy place like this only to find out its just a normal creepy place.&quot; Mysteria nods. &quot;This is the correct place. I do not know that it can completely restore all the dark powers the Vampire claims he once had, but this place will give him access to the closest we will be able to manage.&quot; She giggles as she explains this and Alucard <i>politely</i> translates for her. Big nods solemnly. &quot;And you sure you want to do this Alucard, this is our last chance to go back.&quot; &quot;'This is our last chance to go back.'&quot; He mocks in his screechy zubat voice. &quot;Listen, when you had the power that I did, and have had it lost. Then you will understand my position.&quot; He growls. &quot;And if you want me to use that power for your needs and wants then it has to be All of it and under my terms.&quot; Big nods. &quot;Fine. I was just making sure gosh.&quot; He rolls his eyes. &quot;You don't need to bite my head off.&quot; He gives a half smile. And the trio walks into the Hills in search of that power.<br />

Everyone feels something different, here. For Isaac and his companions, it's a heavy, oppressive place, and the unease is palpable.The forest seems to swallow you as you begin the slow march inside, the treeline closing behind you as if the river and its bank never existed at all. No, it's more than that; it's as though nothing else, nothing but these woods, has ever existed in all of eternity. You press on.<br />
<br />
The branches and the vines all curl in unnatural loops around you, and the roots of the trees jut up from the ground, many of them with more than enough space between them and the earth below for critters to squeeze through. Some of the trees have knotholes and inside those knotholes you could swear that you can see eyes staring back at you, the moonlight bouncing off of their tapeti lucidi, and glittering like diamonds. They stalk you, watch you, judge you, pity you. What are you doing in a place like this? Why are you pursuing danger when you're so well loved, as indicated by the creatures at your feet who ignore all their instincts and neglect self preservation, in order to preserve <i>you</i>, the man who has brought them here into this place that even you recognize as being smothering? Maybe you're selfish. Maybe, you've just given up.<br />
<br />
There's a rustling in the leaves above your head, and all of the little, judging eyes peering out at you from the nooks and crannies disappear as if they were snuffed out by some sinister wind. As you peer up at the silhouette of the canopy, juxtaposed against the moonlight refracted through the thickening cloud cover, there is another sound, like a bow drug carelessly over the strings of a violent. <i>Skree. Skree. Skree.</i> It's perfectly timed, and repetitive, and then it reduplicates and you can hear it from both sides of you, then behind you, and in front of you, and all around you; a creaky, screeching chorus. Then you see the eyes, and the shadow of wings, on a skinny tree just to your left. The chorus disappears, all at once, and it's the only thing that remains, screaming at you with each rhythmic flutter of its wings.<br />

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: rosybrown">Vinny could sense something different about her master. He was in a dark place, and she didn't just mean the place they were in presently. His attitude and disregard for his own safety reminded her of the past. She shuddered just thinking about it. Kyp wasn't around then, and maybe that was for the best. She wasn't sure how loyal Kyp would be if he had seen what Isaac had been like three years ago... maybe he'd be like Vander --- antagonistic and aggressive towards Isaac. She sighed, her ears drooping slightly as she wandered the forest, taking care not to let Isaac out of her sight. <br />
<br />
Kyp, meanwhile, was keeping a watchful eye on Vinny. He couldn't help but notice that the entire atmosphere of this place seemed to be draining her. Was it worry for Isaac? Or was it something more sinister? He could feel his paws pad against the cold ground as he followed her, she seemed to be lost in thought. Probably over her daughter, considering her options if something terrible were to befall her. Kyp's face twisted into a snarl. He would ensure no harm befell Vinny, at least not while he was here. Even if it meant sacrificing himself to protect her. <br />
<br />
As Isaac continued walking through the twisted forest, he couldn't help but feel like he was being watched. Beside him, behind him... he could feel eyes clawing at him. He could feel a hunger, something ready to leap out at him the moment he let his guard down. As he continued walking, Vinny suddenly stopped, her eyes affixed forwards as she eyed the canopy above them. Kyp barked for Isaac's attention, causing him to turn just in time to hear the rustle of the leaves from overhead. Isaac's gut felt like it firmly lodged itself in his throat as he felt as the eyes around him suddenly cease, unmoving as whatever creature had just clawed it's way out of the trees frightened them away. Isaac could hear the horrific noise, like an awful violin that was played by hands that were far too eager. <br />
<br />
As he took a step back, he noticed the shimmer of two eyes piercing the otherwise blackness of the night. The noise became a resounding chorus as the frightening bug flew out of the trees. Vinny seemed hypnotized by it's rhythmic fluttering, slowly moving closer to it. <br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Vinny!&quot;</i> Barked Kyp, throwing himself in front of her and barring his teeth at the nasty insect. Isaac stared too, he could sense something off about the creature... a clawing darkness that seemed to be aching to get out. <br />
<br />
Kyp <b><i>howled</i></b> at the Nincada, boosting his own resolve as he charged forward, flinging <b><i>sparks </i></b>behind him as he ran at the creature. </span></span></div>

You -- or, rather, your Zubat -- have lofty goals of power. That’s what’s brought you here, unflinchingly and with only minor reservations. With Alucard at your shoulder, and Mysteria beside you, you begin to ascend the hills in hopes of finding this mysterious strength that your marginally curt companion seems to have lost.<br />
<br />
The hills are calm; tranquil, even. Though perpetual night looms above you and uncanny sights surround you, there is an absence of any true sense of danger. This place is weird, and unsettling, but not malevolent -- perhaps this is because of your compatriots? Alucard certainly doesn’t seem phased, and maybe that’s rubbing off on you. Then again, maybe you’ve just gone stupid, and are oblivious to the death that surrounds you, waiting to close in?! Or maybe, just maybe, there is no threat here at all. That’s certainly a possibility. So which is? Peer pressure, ignorance, or absence of evil intent? It’s unclear. All you know for sure is that you’re beginning to get dizzy.<br />
<br />
You’ve been making your way -- seemingly -- up the first of the hills. The tall grass billows like the waves of the ocean around you. Little flowers dot this ocean of green, the moonless sky shinies with stars above your head, and directly to your left, the lake glitters. Wait.<br />
<br />
Your left?<br />
<br />
Turning, you find yourself staring directly down into the lake below, as it sits at the foot of the hills. You can see your distant reflection in its surface. This is… impossible? Looking up, you see the sky. Looking down, you see the grass. Looking to your left, there is the lake, and you can’t possibly be seeing it from the angle that you’re seeing it from. That would place you parallel to the earth, and perfectly perpendicular to the hills, which isn’t within the realm of physical law. The hills are steep, but not <i>that</i> steep, and even if they were, you wouldn’t be able to stand on such a drastic incline. None of this makes sense. It’s impossible for you to wrap your head around. Part of you is curious, though -- if the sky is above you, the ground below you, and the lake to your left, then what is to your right? You look. You probably shouldn’t, but you do.<br />
<br />
It’s the forest. Sort of. That’s what’s to your right -- the forest, which should be below you, at the foot of the hills, is… everywere. Above you, below you, beside you. The trees just out in an impossible ring, like the mouth of an Eelektross, ready to swallow you whole into its inky black maw. And that spooks you a little, on a deeply instinctual level, and you take off at a sprint, running away from the forest that shouldn’t be. You take about three steps before tripping and rolling down the hill several feet, landing hard on a rock. That’s going to leave a bruise. When you regain your bearings and stand up… everything is fine. The sky is above you, the grass is below you, the lake below you to your left, where it should be, and the forest below you to your right, also where it should be. Everything is normal, insofar as this place can possibly <i>be</i> normal. Maybe you imagined it all? That would be stupid, and embarrassing. Speaking of stupid, and embarassing…<br />
<br />
A chattering noise demands your attention. Still reeling slightly, you spin in place looking for the source, but it’s the source that finds you. Perched on a nearby stone, not unlike the one you landed on, is a small white-and-blue creature, its beady little eyes shining eerily as it points at you with one stubby paw. Its tail is thrashing, almost joyously, and that’s what leads you to realize: the chittering noise is the sound of it laughing at you. It must have found your panic rather funny.<br />
<br />
What will you do?<br />
<br />

Aggression. Malice. Hatred. Danger. Everyone feels something different, here. For Isaac and his friends, there seems to be nothing good. So why did you come? That’s the question that everyone has to ask themselves eventually, in a place like this. That’s the question that determines what you take away. Hope? Despair? Strength? Power? Love? Hate?<br />
<br />
Kyp is quick to act. For him, this is a bad place, and the creature in front of him his a threat. It can’t really be helped -- he wants to protect someone. Maybe that desire to be her savior clouds his judgement. Maybe it hones it. His howl echoes through the trees, which shake viciously as all the things that live in them take flight. You can see their silhouettes as flee, by foot and by wing. Kyp has never looked more <b>ready to attack</b> as he launches himself forward bt even when the sparks cast from his coiled body land on the Nincada, it doesn’t flinch, as if the electricity <b>doesn’t affect it.</b> This utter lack of reaction seems to cause Kyp to falter, and in that second of indecision, the Nincada kicks up a cloud of <b>sand</b>. Momentarily blinded by the <b>attack</b>, Kyp shakes his head furiously and paws at his face, trying to dislodge the sand in his eyes. When he has finally cleared his vision enough to function, the Nincada is gone, leaving behind only a hole, where it has evidently <b>dug</b> its way into the earth. An unseen chorus rises up around the three of you; one hundred pairs of wings screeching invisibly in the darkness.<br />

You -- or, rather, your Zubat -- have lofty goals of power. That’s what’s brought you here, unflinchingly and with only minor reservations. With Alucard at your shoulder, and Mysteria beside you, you begin to ascend the hills in hopes of finding this mysterious strength that your marginally curt companion seems to have lost.<br />
<br />
The hills are calm; tranquil, even. Though perpetual night looms above you and uncanny sights surround you, there is an absence of any true sense of danger. This place is weird, and unsettling, but not malevolent -- perhaps this is because of your compatriots? Alucard certainly doesn’t seem phased, and maybe that’s rubbing off on you. Then again, maybe you’ve just gone stupid, and are oblivious to the death that surrounds you, waiting to close in?! Or maybe, just maybe, there is no threat here at all. That’s certainly a possibility. So which is? Peer pressure, ignorance, or absence of evil intent? It’s unclear. All you know for sure is that you’re beginning to get dizzy.<br />
<br />
You’ve been making your way -- seemingly -- up the first of the hills. The tall grass billows like the waves of the ocean around you. Little flowers dot this ocean of green, the moonless sky shinies with stars above your head, and directly to your left, the lake glitters. Wait.<br />
<br />
Your left?<br />
<br />
Turning, you find yourself staring directly down into the lake below, as it sits at the foot of the hills. You can see your distant reflection in its surface. This is… impossible? Looking up, you see the sky. Looking down, you see the grass. Looking to your left, there is the lake, and you can’t possibly be seeing it from the angle that you’re seeing it from. That would place you parallel to the earth, and perfectly perpendicular to the hills, which isn’t within the realm of physical law. The hills are steep, but not <i>that</i> steep, and even if they were, you wouldn’t be able to stand on such a drastic incline. None of this makes sense. It’s impossible for you to wrap your head around. Part of you is curious, though -- if the sky is above you, the ground below you, and the lake to your left, then what is to your right? You look. You probably shouldn’t, but you do.<br />
<br />
It’s the forest. Sort of. That’s what’s to your right -- the forest, which should be below you, at the foot of the hills, is… everywere. Above you, below you, beside you. The trees just out in an impossible ring, like the mouth of an Eelektross, ready to swallow you whole into its inky black maw. And that spooks you a little, on a deeply instinctual level, and you take off at a sprint, running away from the forest that shouldn’t be. You take about three steps before tripping and rolling down the hill several feet, landing hard on a rock. That’s going to leave a bruise. When you regain your bearings and stand up… everything is fine. The sky is above you, the grass is below you, the lake below you to your left, where it should be, and the forest below you to your right, also where it should be. Everything is normal, insofar as this place can possibly <i>be</i> normal. Maybe you imagined it all? That would be stupid, and embarrassing. Speaking of stupid, and embarassing…<br />
<br />
A chattering noise demands your attention. Still reeling slightly, you spin in place looking for the source, but it’s the source that finds you. Perched on a nearby stone, not unlike the one you landed on, is a small white-and-blue creature, its beady little eyes shining eerily as it points at you with one stubby paw. Its tail is thrashing, almost joyously, and that’s what leads you to realize: the chittering noise is the sound of it laughing at you. It must have found your panic rather funny.<br />
<br />
What will you do?<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: #00b3b3">Big's head was already forming a headache when he got to this place, and while a calm cool tranquil night with his pokemon is normally what he would be into to relax and get rid of a headache. The pokemon definitely helped though, their presence while annoying on the surface, is reassuring and familiar in this foreign place. That is until the world starts to literally spin. He shakes his head and looks left to find himself looking down into the lake. &quot;What the... Guys, are you seeing this?&quot; He asks his companions and oddly enough, they don't reply, snarky or otherwise. He looks back to them and they are still present, they just don't seem to have heard him. But then the logic hits him, if the Lake is up at a right angle to his left, he has to look and see what is to his right. He slowly does so and his head pounds as he looks into the void that the forest. He swallows hard and his heart begins to beat too fast and he turns to run, almost instinctually... and makes it about 3 steps before tripping on a rock in the ground and coming back to his senses. And the first sense that returns is hearing where he immediately hears several sets of laughter. Both Mysteria and Alucard are rolling on the ground laughing. But that, he expected, it was embarrassing and he knew those two were going to give him shit, but what he wasn't expecting was the third set of chittering laughter. Big sits up and glares toward the source and spots the Pachirisu. Maybe it was this place, maybe it was Alucard and Mysteria's bad influence on him, or maybe it was this fucking headache that wouldn't go away, but he wasn't going to suffer this electric type's irritation unpunished. &quot;Alucard, Mysteria. Go give that squirrel something to laugh at. Alucard Supersonic, Mysteria Shadow Ball.&quot;</span></div>

<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: DarkSeaGreen">It appears you're a laughing stock, now, and that makes you understandably cranky. Head throbbing from what might be described as a superhuman case of motion sickness, you bark out orders to your companions. It takes a moment for them to regain their composure, but eventually they right themselves. Mysteria, having four limbs with which to pull herself off the ground, is the first to strike, and Pachirisu is still laughing, right up until the moment that a giant orb of ghostly energy beans it right in the head. It goes reeling, knocked clean off of its geological perch and into the grass. By the time Alucard has taken flight again, little wings beating the air for all they're worth, the rodent has righted itself and begun to shake off the ectoplasm, paws furiously scraping at its own head. The sound of moving air causes it to look up, and it shrieks as it finds the eyeless face and gaping mouth of your Zubat meer inches from its own snout. It makes a mad scramble to put some distance between itself and the poison type, but a shrill noise cuts through the night, courtesy of Alucard, and forces the Pachirisu to stop in its tracks, curling up in a ball to try and shield its sensitive ears from the acoustic onslaught. It seems overwhelmed, thrashing about in mild <b>confusion</b>. It begins to throw off <b>sparks</b> to protect itself, and as they rain down on Alucard the fly-type seems to be especially hard-hit by the damage. His flight grows even more erratic than usual, and then he drops to the ground, twitching. When he doesn't right himself after a moment, you realize that he might be <b>paralyzed</b> by the electricity-induced muscle contractions.<br />
<br />
The Pachirisu doesn't appear to have expected to fight, and it isn't posing much of a threat. Alucard seems to have taken a single bad hit, however, and may not be up for combat. You still have Mysteria, perfectly unscathed, in your corner however.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span><br />

The Lake of Reflections:</b> A rivulet breaks from the river, trickling down a steep slope to pool in the basin at the foot of the hills. Opalescent and almost ethereal, the water reflects back a distorted image of the world. Crooked reeds grow around its edge, skirted by oddly shaped lily pads and strangely colored grasses. Deep enough to swim in, its surface ripples with all the signs of a thriving ecosystem, but the creatures that call this place home are just a little unusual...<br />
<br />
<b>INTERIOR<br />
The Crooked Font:</b> On the far side of the Lake of Reflections is a crude fountain made of smooth yet irregularly shaped rocks of many colors, set into the side of a hill. It flows, never-ending, though there there is no evidence of a spring to feed it. The largest of the stones forms a centerpiece, upon which is painted odd yet recognizable images of the deity trio of Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres, their wings folded and their heads bowed as if in deep introspection. The water here is cool and sweet and pleasant to drink. It is so refreshing that it is nearly transcendental; those who imbibe talk of seeing the world with a new clarity, or discovering new resolve to walk a unique path in life.

&quot;I'm too old for this shit&quot;, Glen grumbled as flew through the air on the back of his Dragonite. He rarely travelled this far, not anymore at least. His Pokemon would certainly enjoy being back in the field again, they often got bored hanging around the ranch. His son, Jared, had contacted him recently, telling him how Xander had left home and was now off adventuring through Fizzytopia. Glen thought it was about time, the kid had a mountain of potential, he needed to realise that for himself. His son had also told him that he was attempting to set up a Steel Gym. It wasn't the mantle of Champion that he always wished his son would pursue, but a Gym Leader was still a position of high regard. His relationship with his son was strenuous, there was a bit of bad blood there, the only time they really got on was when it came to Pokemon. He'd left the ranch in an attempt to bend the bond between him and his son. He'd received a powerful Pokemon a long time ago from an old acquaintance. It needed a strong trainer to keep it in check, which he'd done for over a decade. However a Shadow Pokemon was not something his son needed to deal with, he likely wasn't equipped to handle it. He'd come into possession of an object that was meant to lead one to a twisted land from where Shadow Pokemon go, apparently it was also possible to purify them there. &quot;This better not be a fucking waste of time Dragonite&quot;, the Dragonite snorted in agreement. He held up the Silver Umbra, which was beginning to shine brighter. &quot;I think we're nearly there Dragonite, drop below the cloud line.&quot; The Dragonite began to descend, passing through the clouds to reveal the strange and twisted land below. The Realm of Shadows.<br />
<br />
A weird and warped mountain range, a weird white wood and a deep reflective lake. &quot;If anything is going to purify this bastard it's got to be that lake&quot;, it made sense to him, water often possessed purifying properties. Dragonite touched down with a thud before lowering itself down so its ageing master could slide off. Glen stretched out his aching bones, he wasn't built for adventuring anymore, he didn't want to admit it, he wouldn't admit it to anyone else, but it was the truth. &quot;Alright, no time to waste, let's get to work.&quot; He tossed out another two Pokeballs, both into the water. The first Pokemon happily dived in, his Lapras was always happy to be called upon. The second wasn't at all keen to take the plunge however, but it was of no surprise to him. &quot;Get in the bloody water you arrogant piece of shit&quot;, he spat at the Shadow Metagross. Tough love was the only thing that seemed to work with it, he liked to believe the Shadow Pokemon respected his roughness. &quot;Don't make me ask again, you know why where here, its time for you to be purified.&quot; The Shadow Metagross groaned, it detested the idea. &quot;Don't make me force you into the water, you know I can.&quot; The Shadow Metagross groaned again before levitating down into the water. Nothing happened. &quot;Hmmm&quot;, Glen wondered what to try next, &quot;maybe if we head further into the lake.&quot; He hopped onto Lapras's shell. &quot;Take us out further big fella, Dragonite follow overhead and keep a close eye on Metagross.&quot; He kept the Silver Umbra in his grasp, was he meant to do something with this, or was it just some trinket? </span></div>

It's like the earth and the sky itself are screaming at you as you and your Dragonite touch down near the water -- a silent, bitter wail. Even in a place like this, where nothing seems to be <i>right</i>, something is very, very wrong. Do you notice? You don't seem to, as you release your Lapras without care into the lake, its massive form breaking the mirror-like surface of the water into concentric waves as the ripples travel outward angrily. The air is still, and save for the sound of the waves lapping softly at the water's edge, you can't hear a single thing -- until you start cursing.<br />
<br />
The verbal abuse you hurl at the uncooperative creature in your care echoes off the hills in the near distance. Threats of force -- violence, perhaps? -- eventually drive the Metagross into the lake beside your Lapras, but nothing happens. Were you expecting a cataclysmic transformation? A baptism to wash away sins either real or imagined? <i>What a terribly naive notion</i> -- it's almost as though the water itself is chiding you in this way, as it grows mostly still again. You're unflappable in your determination to alter the Pokémon entrusted to you, and steadfast in your ignorance of the unrest around you.<br />
<br />
Until you mount your Lapas.<br />
<br />
The starless sky seems to grow darker as you settle your weary frame upon its heavy shell. The only sounds that cuts through the windless air are the water lapping around Lapras' body, and the frantic flapping of Dragonite's wings as they work to keep its massive frame aloft -- <i>fwipfwipfwipfwip</i>. The leaves of the trees in the forest to you east don't rustle. Not a single wild Pokémon cries out. Lapras begins to ease itself forward, out into the expansive body of water that lays out in front of you like an ever-changing opal, liquid and iridescent. The bright and shining water contrasts with the ever more-<b>shadowy</b> <b>sky</b> above you, and Lapras begins to flag before its even really begun. Head drooping, it grows still only a few yards from shore, and makes a thin, whimpering sound. It seems as though it's in pain. Above you, DRagonites frame rises and falls with an uncharacteristic instability, visibly struggling to maintain flight. Strangely, beside you, hovering just above the swirling colors of the lake, Metagross seems fine. You don't have time to give it much thought, however, because an inhuman force rips you off of Lapras. Your body braces on instinct, expecting to fall into the water, but the splash never comes. Instead, you reorient yourself to find that someone -- or something -- has you by the collar. It stands on the surface of the lake as if the water were glass; your feet dip below the surface, and you can feel your shoes begin to flood. Next to you, an aqueous shape rises up, and takes solid form, head and shoulders above the water. A tall fin on its crown flattens in a gesture you recognize as highly aggressive, but that's the least of your concerns. An intense aura pours off of it, familiar and yet like nothing you've ever felt -- it reminds you of Metagross, but infinitely stronger.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are trespassing,&quot; the figure grasping you informs, in a language you've never heard yet somehow understand. A heavy, white hood hides its face from you, but the voice is sharp, like a swift, narrow stream of water burbling by. There is an unmistakable sense of peril around you, and it is overwhelming.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span><br />

It didn't take long for Glen to realise something was wrong. Lapras seemed to be struggling almost immediately, as did Dragonite. These were two of his strongest Pokemon, they'd been with him for decades! Sure, he didn't train with them as much as he used to, but they were no slouches. The Metagross seemed fine however, meaning it must have had something to do with the environment. Before he could determine a new course of action, Glen found himself tumbling off Lapras's shell. He braced for the impact into the cold water, but something grabbed him. Dragonite? Metagross? Nope, it was something else entirely. He couldn't get a clear look, but he could sense the strength emanating from the hooded figure. The Vaporeon that occupied him looked like a handful as well, were his Pokemon not acting strangely he was certain they would make quick work of it. Right now though, it was best not to jump straight into conflict, at least until he better understood the environment. <br />
<br />
By now, Glen's shoes were full of water, his socks soaping wet. &quot;Good catch, now put me down before I break your arm&quot;, he really wasn't in a position to do so, but he rarely thought about his threats before they left his mouth. &quot;I'm no bloody trespasser, I have this stupid little trinket that was meant to give me access to this place&quot;, he held up the Silver Umbra, which he had thankfully managed to hang onto when he was tossed from his Pokemon's back. &quot;I swear to Arceus if its a fucking fake I'm going to kill someone with my bare hands. </span></div>

<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: CadetBlue">The figure that holds you scowls at the coin in your hand, set jaw and curled lip just barely visible from beneath the shadow of the otherwise obscuring hood. There is a sharp pain in your hand as a pressurized stream of water -- narrow and intense, like a water pick -- knocks the Umbra out of you hand, courtesy of the Vaporeon. It tumbles through the air to serendipitously land in the open palm of the entity's free hand. It's evident that your attitude is doing nothing to endear you to the powerful entity, if the way the grip on the front of your shirt tightens is any indication.<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem to misunderstand,&quot; drawls the guardian, in a tone that is terse and tensely smug, like an adult struggling to be polite to an unruly child that has long since strained their patience. &quot;This buys you passage upon my vessel, and nothing more. Where it takes you is my discretion, and mine alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
The entity holds up the Umbra between a fore- and a middle finger, and you watch helplessly as the sterling metal grows dull and matte, before crumbling like ash and blowing away on the wind in little flakes.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have no contract,&quot; states the ethereal stranger, hand opening as the last of the detritus leaves it. You've curried absolutely no favor in this brief interaction. From the corner of your eye, you can see as Dragonite lands on the shore, having enough experience to know it would be better to touch down while it still has the strength to do so, rather than risk a collapse into the water as its energy continues to flag. The sky grows darker, blackness swirling ominously in the air above you, and Lapras whimpers again.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: CadetBlue">The figure that holds you scowls at the coin in your hand, set jaw and curled lip just barely visible from beneath the shadow of the otherwise obscuring hood. There is a sharp pain in your hand as a pressurized stream of water -- narrow and intense, like a water pick -- knocks the Umbra out of you hand, courtesy of the Vaporeon. It tumbles through the air to serendipitously land in the open palm of the entity's free hand. It's evident that your attitude is doing nothing to endear you to the powerful entity, if the way the grip on the front of your shirt tightens is any indication.<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem to misunderstand,&quot; drawls the guardian, in a tone that is terse and tensely smug, like an adult struggling to be polite to an unruly child that has long since strained their patience. &quot;This buys you passage upon my vessel, and nothing more. Where it takes you is my discretion, and mine alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
The entity holds up the Umbra between a fore- and a middle finger, and you watch helplessly as the sterling metal grows dull and matte, before crumbling like ash and blowing away on the wind in little flakes.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have no contract,&quot; states the ethereal stranger, hand opening as the last of the detritus leaves it. You've curried absolutely no favor in this brief interaction. From the corner of your eye, you can see as Dragonite lands on the shore, having enough experience to know it would be better to touch down while it still has the strength to do so, rather than risk a collapse into the water as its energy continues to flag. The sky grows darker, blackness swirling ominously in the air above you, and Lapras whimpers again.<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></span><br />

How was he meant to know what the coin was for?! Glen was starting to get angry. It's not like the token had come with an instruction manual, all he knew was that it would lead him to this place. He felt like punching this 'thing', right in the guts, if it had any. However, this his Pokemon clearly flagging an the ominous clouds strengthening, he knew he had to muster up some sort of apology if he was going to achieve what he came here to do.....<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen here mate&quot;, Glen grumbled, &quot;I had no way of knowing how to use the coin, if I was meant to bring it to you, that should have been more clear. Its clear you've got a job to do and so do I. I need to fix this wretched soul.&quot; Glen gestured to the Shadow Metagross, who'd been surprisingly settled. &quot;My son needs it, I haven't always been the best father, I've never really given him much, other than judgement and criticism. I just want to do one good thing for him before my time passes, surely you've got to understand that? I arrived with the coin, you've taken the coin, now help me like you're meant to. Tell me how I can purify the shadows that seep deep into this Pokemon's soul. Take me on your vessel.&quot; He hadn't really said sorry, but he never said sorry, especially when he hadn't done anything wrong, at least not to his knowledge. When push came to shove, this 'thing' whatever it was, had a duty to fulfil. He'd paid the toll, now he wanted what was owed in return. He recalled Dragonite and Lapras into their balls, they were better off in there for now and perhaps the 'thing', would see that he was willing to listen now.</span></div>

<span style="font-size: 10px"><span style="color: RosyBrown">Aggression. Malice. Hatred. Danger. Everyone feels something different, here. For Isaac and his friends, there seems to be nothing good. So why did you come? That’s the question that everyone has to ask themselves eventually, in a place like this. That’s the question that determines what you take away. Hope? Despair? Strength? Power? Love? Hate?<br />
<br />
Kyp is quick to act. For him, this is a bad place, and the creature in front of him his a threat. It can’t really be helped -- he wants to protect someone. Maybe that desire to be her savior clouds his judgement. Maybe it hones it. His howl echoes through the trees, which shake viciously as all the things that live in them take flight. You can see their silhouettes as flee, by foot and by wing. Kyp has never looked more <b>ready to attack</b> as he launches himself forward bt even when the sparks cast from his coiled body land on the Nincada, it doesn’t flinch, as if the electricity <b>doesn’t affect it.</b> This utter lack of reaction seems to cause Kyp to falter, and in that second of indecision, the Nincada kicks up a cloud of <b>sand</b>. Momentarily blinded by the <b>attack</b>, Kyp shakes his head furiously and paws at his face, trying to dislodge the sand in his eyes. When he has finally cleared his vision enough to function, the Nincada is gone, leaving behind only a hole, where it has evidently <b>dug</b> its way into the earth. An unseen chorus rises up around the three of you; one hundred pairs of wings screeching invisibly in the darkness.</span></span><br />

</blockquote><span style="color: rosybrown"><span style="font-size: 12px">Vinny grimaced, she had always known that Kyp was far too reckless for his own good. However, she never thought that he would jump into action without consulting their master first. Vinny's attention jerked to Isaac as Kyp charged forward, she gave her master a pleading look, begging for him to give some sort of direction, give them some semblance of a plan... yet, there was nothing. Isaac's expression was trance-like, staring wide-eyed at the forest, eyes prying around for the source of the horrific chorus that was unfolding around them.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px">Kyp meanwhile, had faltered heavily. His spur of the moment decision to attack the creature had failed, as in his haste he had not observed the creature closely enough to notice it's obvious ground typing. He felt like a failure, his legs buckled beneath him slightly as the creature kicked sand in his face. </span><br />
<br />
&quot;Isaac!&quot; Vinny called out, trying to get her master's attention. To Isaac, it just sounded like a sharp, low bark. Isaac turned his attention just in time to see the battle unfolding, the creature kicked sand into Kyp's eyes and quickly buried underground. Isaac was dumbfounded, he was usually a better trainer than this... but his mind was completely blank. His mind felt like it was trudging through sludge as he tried to think of a command, his mouth moved, yet he said nothing. Vinny's eyes widened --- where on Earth had their master brought them to?<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyp!&quot; Kyp turns his head quickly, trying to blink the sand out of his eyes that the creature had previously tossed his way. He saw Vinny, rushing towards him quickly and shoving him out of the way. She slammed her feet down and prepped herself with a<i><b> Swords Dance</b></i>, ready to strike the creature the moment it leap out of that hole.<br />
<br />
Kyp stared in disbelief, he couldn't believe that Vinny would willingly throw herself in front of him. He grimaced slightly, feeling the pain in his hide from where Vinny's head had slammed into him. Although he was distraught watching her waiting for the creature... he couldn't help but feel his heart pound steadily in his chest -- a romp of emotion from being rescued by the grassy fox. </span></span></div>
