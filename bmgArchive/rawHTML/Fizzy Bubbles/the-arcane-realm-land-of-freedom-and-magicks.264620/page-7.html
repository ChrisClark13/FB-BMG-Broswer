<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: plum"><b>ShadowDRGN- </b>You head out of the cabin in search of the Sitrus Berry tree. Thankfully with the directions you were given and Boss's nose, it takes you no time at all to locate the fruit laden tree. Boss quickly climbs up and jumps from branch to branch, dropping down Sitrus Berries for you to catch. By the time Boss hops out of the tree, you've got five Sitrus berries, two for the Buizel and <b>three </b>for yourself to hang onto. Boss is munching on a berry as he follows you back to the cabin, at least he'd have a full belly, as well as a full bar of health. When you enter the cabin, Greg approaches you with a cup of what appears to be tea. <br />
<br />
&quot;Cheri Berry tea, it'll help loosen up your muscles, trust me, it helps.&quot; He then sits in a nearby lounge chair, before directing you to one. His wife emerges from the bedroom, collecting two of the Sitrus berries from you before heading back in to feed them to the Buizel. She soon reemerges and takes a seat next to her husband. <br />
<br />
&quot;That Buizel owes you a great deal of thanks kid, you probably saved its life. I owe you an apology, I shouldn't of accused you of hurting it.&quot; Darla adjusts herself before accepting a cup of tea from her husband. &quot;As for the Full Moon, no one knows exactly. As the Full Moon gets closer, the worst kind of Pokemon show up. They tend to be hyper aggressive and target the more placid Pokemon, like the Buizel.&quot; Almost at the mention of its name, you hear a thump from the bedroom and all of you quickly rush in.<br />
<br />
The Buizel is back on its tough feet, moving fairly freely but it wasn't fully recovered, not yet. You notice a fire burning in its eyes, it was clear it wanted revenge. Boss rushes in to block the Buizel, barring its passage with out stretched arms.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Pan Pancham cham&quot;</i>, Boss cautions, likely telling the Buizel it needed to rest. <br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Bui Bui Bui Buizel!&quot; </i>The Buizel shouts in reply, raising a fist in front of its face. Boss shrugs and steps aside, whatever it said must have been compelling. <br />
<br />
&quot;Seems to me like the Buizel wants vengeance, it'll probably just end up getting beaten again&quot;, Greg assesses. &quot;What if you helped it train kid? Your Pancham could probably use some training as well. There is this old guy, a retiree from the Alolan region who has cabin a little ways back in the forest, pretty sure he used to be some sort of master of something or other. He might be willing to teach you a thing or two, he'd probably enjoy the change in pace.&quot;</span></div>

Priceless artifacts in a room that few had seen? Consider your curiosity throughly piqued. You just really hoped that you didn't accidentally break anything else in this expansive Hall of Archives. Yamask's cold stare didn't deter you from looking around, although you were almost 99.9% sure that that <i>particular</i> cold glare meant that it was as gung ho as you were to explore the ancient archives. <br />
<br />
You walked away from the Drampa, looking around for anything that seemed to jump out at you in such a way that made your eyes glimmer. Yamask floated beside you, it was silent but it's prying eyes seemed to be searching for anything interesting within the archives. Finally your eyes came to rest on something: a scroll. The scroll itself was extremely plain in nature, just an old rolled up scrap of paper. Yet it was presented it such a way that caused your eyes to be drawn to it. It was placed on an elegantly decorated altar, made of gold --- causing you to again ponder how rich this church truly was. Such a plain scroll was surely not deserving of such a fancy stand, but here it was. Maybe it wasn't as plain as you thought...<br />
<br />
An array of thoughts swept through your mind, thinking about all the secrets this scroll must hold. Maybe it holds some ancient secrets that have been hidden away for millenia? Or even secret Pokemon moves that have since been lost to the ages? The possibilities were endless! And you were sure one peek wouldn't hurt...</span><br />

</blockquote><span style="color: royalblue">Hugo knew he probably should be wasting time. The Silent Nun was in trouble and every second that passed could be another moment of suffering that it would endure. But even so, perhaps there was something in here that would contextualize this place…or better yet…would assist Hugo in his mission. Sure, that works. That’s what he convinced himself of at least. <br />
<br />
Hugo was drawn to the scroll, but he couldn’t pinpoint exactly why. Was it the lavish, ornate stand on which it was placed? Perhaps, but there was so much outlandishness in this entire building that it didn’t really stand out that much by comparison. No, it was something else. Something pulling Hugo toward it. <br />
<br />
And Yamask too. The Spirit floated above the scroll, examining it with its blood red eye. <br />
<br />
“Right?” Hugo asked to his spectral companion. “I’m not sure what it is about this thing…”<br />
<br />
He reached for it, but then pulled away. “You know, we really shouldn’t. We don’t have much time, and besides, pretty much everything else we’ve touched in here has broken. Do we really need to go down that path again? This could be extremely precious. Extremely valuable. And if we destroyed it, then what? We need to find the nun.”<br />
<br />
Just as he was about to leave, however, he reconsidered. Damn curiosity. “But then again…maybe if we’re <i>reeeeaaally</i> careful, and put it right back, it should be fine, right? Should we really withhold this from ourselves? It’s practically begging to be read. What harm can it do, right?”<br />
<br />
Against his better instinct, Hugo lifted the scroll from the platform.</span></div>

</blockquote>Jason takes the time to take in the scenery and catch his breath while they hike up to the berry tree. Now that Buizel isn't in danger, more pressing thoughts end up in his mind. Just where exactly is this place? The more he walks around and stares out at the cup-shaped mountains, the more he feels like a foreigner. But... he's still in Unova, isn't he? He couldn't just walk right out of the Region in a matter of days, could he?<br />
<br />
His thoughts are inturrupted when something round and firm smacks the top of his head, jolting him out of his ruminations. Jason groans and rubs the top of his head, and then bends down to pick up the Sitrus Berry when it rolls to his feet. Glancing up, he sees Boss snickering and reaching for another ripe berry, &quot;hey!&quot; Jason calls out, &quot;what was that for?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Pancham just stares back and throws another berry as Jason is standing up. His Trainer sees the streak of yellow flying towards him and responds by reaching out to catch it before it strikes him in the head again. Boss grins wider when he sees that his Trainer wasn't just spacing out quietly, and then aims up high to toss one more, forcing Jason to run around on the grass to nab it like a baseball catcher trying to position themselves under a pop fly.<br />
<br />
Realizing what he was doing, Jason chuckles and sets his bag down along with the three collected berries, &quot;you're gonna hafta do better than that!&quot; he challenges the Pokemon, who eagerly obliges as they collect more berries. They only manage to find two more that are ripe enough to eat; the rest simply splatter unceremoniously on the ground. Once they're done, Jason stows the berries in his lunchbox.<br />
<br />
An hour or so later, the two open the door again and announce their return to the old couple. Jason hesitantly accepts the tea, not really used to any hot drinks other than the occasional hit of coffee in the early morning. The spicy flavor seems to resonate with him, though, and he quickly sips it down while he listens to his questions from earlier finally receive an answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, there's no need to apologize. It's my fault for myself look so tough and scary,&quot; he admits, before he sets the cup of tea on the table, &quot;so the Pokemon around here get stronger when the Full Moon shows up... sounds like something from a video game, honestly. But I guess if it means that they get tougher, it might be a good way to get str-&quot; Jason jumps in his seat when he hears the thump and goes with them to investigate when he sees Buizel trying to make his way out of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-hey! You only started getting better, man,&quot; Jason cautions in support of Boss, stepping forwards as he nods to Greg, &quot;I get that you want to get even with them... trust me, there's plenty of people I want to get even with, too, but you gotta take your time. Rushing in alone and with nobody to help you isn't badass, it's just dumb!&quot;<br />
<br />
The Trainer kneels down, getting as close to eye-level with the Buizel as he can, &quot;that old dude says there's a place around here where all three of us can get stronger,&quot; he motions between the Buizel, Boss and himself, before he brings out the Pokeball in his pocket and presents it to the orange Pokemon, &quot;whaddya say, wanna try to teach those asshats a lesson together?&quot;</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: plum"><b>ShadowDRGN- </b>You warn the Buizel that rushing in alone and blind was more dumb that tough, a fair point. You get down on the Water type's level, looking it dead in the eyes. They were burning with passion and rage, you could see the potential in the Buizel, but it needed training if it was to reach that potential, the type of training a trainer like you could provide. You pull an empty Pokeball from your pocket and present it to the Buizel, but it immediately breaks eye contact, turning its head and crossing its arms. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be disheartened lad&quot;, Greg encourages you, &quot;I think capturing this Buizel is a wise decision, but maybe it wants to bond with you a bit more first?&quot; The old fisherman made a good point, perhaps the Buizel wanted to get to know you a bit more before it allowed you to capture it? The training would present a perfect opportunity to bond with it as well. When you float the idea of doing some training together, you get the attention of the Buizel once more, it was certainly up for that! Boss steps in, giving the Buizel a fist bump, he was looking forward to doing some training as well. <br />
<br />
<b>The Buizel will now travel with you. It is a Male, lvl 10 Buizel with the ability Swift Swim. It also knows the Egg Move Helping Hand. </b><br />
<br />
Darla then approaches you, an old map in her hand. She presents you with the map, opening it you read the title running across the top of it, 'The Arcane Realm.' Where the hell was the Arcane Realm?! &quot;This is where we are here, near the Lake of the Moon, in the Land of Cups&quot;, she points to a spot near a massive lake on one side of the map. &quot;The man your looking for lives here, about an hours walk and if you skirt along the edge of the lake you shouldn't get too lost&quot;, Darla points to another spot, north of your current location. She was right, it seemed if you followed the lake, you would get to where you needed to go. &quot;Keep the map, you probably need it more than we do.&quot;<br />
<br />
<b>You received a map of the Arcane Realm!</b></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: royalblue">Their plan had worked! The Grass Knot worked perfectly, tripping the feisty Fennekin into a puddle. Then, despite the Fennekin's best efforts Froakie followed up with an Ice Beam, freezing her in place. Temporarily at least. Xander then offered the opportunity to capture the Fennekin to Adrienne. Oh no, she was too good for the Fennekin! Apparently she was a Bug type specialist? Made sense, she'd been bugging him since they'd met! Xander made sure to keep that thought to himself, it would probably earn him a Double Slap! Still, he'd done the polite thing and she'd knocked it back, her loss. Her not wanting the Fennekin kind of made him want it more, so he could show her the potential that she'd passed on. He felt half bad making the catch with spite in mind, but truly, the Fennekin was a good fit for him and his team. The Kalosian Fire Starter would complete his Kalosian trio and it certainly had battle potential, staving off Froakie and Chimchar was no easy task! Xander pulled out a <a href="http://forums.upnetwork.net/showpost.php?p=829050&amp;postcount=323" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.upnetwork.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D829050%26postcount%3D323&amp;hash=215e88df2449ea0f7a08c370c26bed6f" rel="nofollow noopener">Luxury Ball</a>, he figured the Fennekin would appreciate the finer style of Pokeball. <br />
<br />
Chimchar stood ready, if the capture wasn't successful and the Fennekin freed itself from the ice, he was prepared to drop that <b>Gunk Shot</b>, into it. &quot;Alright Fennekin, time for you to leave your life of thievery behind, because you'll be coming with us. Xander pulled the ball up to his ear, lifting his knee up before pitching the Luxury Ball towards the Fennekin like a baseball pitcher. Once they had the Fennekin they could have it lead them back to its den, who knew what sort of treasures it had stashed away in there!</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: royalblue"><b>TKF:</b> Your plan worked as intended, except for the part where Adrienne didn't want the Fennekin. Her specialism didn't seem to surprise you. In fact, like the clever clogs you are, you started punning your way to an early grave! Or you would if Adrienne or some other sadistic, world-affecting person caught you at it, but they didn't. Obviously. You'd just have to take the Fennekin and raise its toasty self to perfection, then rub the loss in her face later. Is that implying you'd want to meet her again? Oh my.<br />

Meanwhile, the Fennekin had slowly melted the ice, enough that what remained of it she caused to shatter with fiery fangs and a sudden bucking movement. It smashed like glass, and she was off again, spring to the Chimchar like her life depended on it. The Pokemon made the stretch, beginning to <b>scratch</b> the monkey's eyes out with ferocity as of yet unseen; only for the Luxury Ball to save the Sinnohan battler. Only the best for your little thief!<br />
<br />
One, twice, thrice... You were certain that she'd break free and that Chimchar – who was now nursing the bloody gashes on his face – would have to end this with a Gunk Shot. Finally, though, it fell still, and you realised you'd caught a level 14 Fennekin! A pokedex reading later on would reveal it also knew Psychic Terrain! What a gal. Froakie had gained four levels and Chimchar three for their suffering.<br />
<br />
After your prize was claimed, you'd realise that Adrienne's Vivillion had returned, and the trainer had swallowed what remained of her camping gear into a specialist, secret base laptop. She was making tracks. “Rosetta's found the nest. You can come or not, whichever you prefer.” She sounded aloof, but she wouldn't extend the invitation if you weren't wanted. So, what will you do?</span></div>

<span style="color: royalblue"><b>TKF:</b> Your plan worked as intended, except for the part where Adrienne didn't want the Fennekin. Her specialism didn't seem to surprise you. In fact, like the clever clogs you are, you started punning your way to an early grave! Or you would if Adrienne or some other sadistic, world-affecting person caught you at it, but they didn't. Obviously. You'd just have to take the Fennekin and raise its toasty self to perfection, then rub the loss in her face later. Is that implying you'd want to meet her again? Oh my.<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: royalblue"> Despite the Fennekin breaking free and ferociously scratching Chimchar, the capture was a success! Xander collected the Luxury Ball, giving it a quick scan with his Pokedex to assess the Fennekin's stats and moves. &quot;Not bad, not bad at all&quot;, Xander mused, he fixed the ball to his belt. With Adrienne's Vivillion returning with the nests location, there was no need to have the Fennekin lead them there. He would consider bringing her out once they were there, she might just have a couple of things hidden away that would be of use to them. Xander looked to Froakie and Chimchar. The pair were looking a little battered, but they were stronger from the fight. Once they'd recovered what they needed from the nest, he'd set them up to heal. As he looked at the two Pokemon, he noticed them start to glow. The pair looked to each other and grasped hands, the glowing stopped.... <br />
<br />
<b>Xander caught a Fennekin!<br />
Chimchar reached level 16! Froakie reached level 16!</b><br />
<br />
&quot;What was that guys?&quot; Xander questioned, but the Froakie and Chimchar shrugged it off and pointed towards Adrienne who was rushing off in pursuit of her Vivillion. &quot;Good point, lets get going!&quot; Xander raced off after Adrienne, Froakie and Chimchar trailing behind him a bit now due to their exhaustion. &quot;Hey Adrienne!&quot; Xander shouted out, &quot;since Fennekin is mine now, the contents of its nest technically belong to me as well. You can have your Buginium Z but everything else in there is mine!&quot; He picked up the pace, not wanting to give the girl a chance to claim anything for herself.</span></div>

As it was, you'd gotten exceedingly cocky as the day went on, and your companion wasn't appreciating your attitude.<br />

“Do you really think so?” She challenged, and then suddenly raised her voice, “Rosetta, you know what to do!” Before you could react, the bug had whipped up a Tailwind, bursting into the distance with a sudden boost of speed. You could still see her: the sun casting off her shining pink wings ever so beautifully, as she suddenly dove into a collection of trees and bushes, only to emerge in a full charge. If you or your Pokemon got close, you'd notice the entire place was now covered in Electroweb; threatening to trap and shock whoever attempted to break through – and the Vivillion was guarding the perimeter.

A smirk on her face, Adrienne overtook you just in time to get in your way, arms folded.

And then, once I have beaten you, I will give you an appropriate reward for your time – not that you deserve one. I think that you and Fennekin suit each other well, don't you, little thief?” She produced a Luxury Ball from her bag, the black and gold sphere contained in a seal-coated capsule, “Choose your Pokemon wisely, little thief.

</blockquote><span style="color: plum"><span style="color: royalblue"> Adrienne finally decided to show a bit of backbone, she was going to battle him? This would be fun. He already knew she was a Bug type specialist, he had just the Fire type for her. There was a fair chance she'd have a few Bugs with different secondary typings, Bug type's were adaptable like that, but he doubt they possessed the strength of the Pokemon he planned on battling with. However, he also had the Vivillion to worry about, the bastard bug had put Electrowebs up around the Fennekin's den! The contents were rightfully his and he had a plan to break through. &quot;A battle? Sure, just let me check on my Pokemon&quot;, Xander turned to face Froakie and Chimchar, the pair were both too weak to battle a fresh Pokemon, but he had another job for them. He crouched and subtly knocked his newly caught Fennekin's Luxury ball loose from his belt. It rolled towards Froakie, who picked the ball up curiously, what did Xander have in mind? &quot;Alright guys listen closely. I'm going to pull out all the stops here, that should keep Adrienne's attention on the battle. When you get the chance I want the pair of you to slip away, double back then flank around. Release Fennekin from her ball and fill her in on the situation. Chimchar, you might be able to <b>Dig </b>a tunnel through to the den to get around the Electrowebs, Fennekin will know exactly where to dig.&quot; Xander rose, turning to face Adrienne once more. &quot;Sorry to keep you waiting, but they are both too tired to battle so I'll have to use someone else...&quot; </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: plum"><span style="color: plum"><span style="color: royalblue">Xander flicked a ball out in front of himself and it quickly burst open with a torrent of fire. A mighty roar followed as Charizard announced itself, flexing its muscles and flapping its wings. The Charizard glared back at Xander, Froakie and Chimchar. The smaller Pokemon glared right back, their relationship with the massive fire lizard wasn't great. It thought itself above them, it was, but it didn't have to act like it. The Charizard flicked its tail around to display a small piece of armour fixed around its tail, a stunning blue stone embedded in it. Xander had a feeling Adrienne would know what it was, but he wasn't about to rush into using it. &quot;What do you think of my Charizard?&quot; Xander questioned, hoping to get a bit of shock out of the Bug type specialist. &quot;My Grandfather used to be a league champ, this Charizard is a direct descendant of his, hence the increased size and strength.&quot; Xander remained confident when addressing Adrienne, but he was slightly nervous about using Charizard. It was rather arrogant, it knew its lineage and wanted to surpass its ancestors. At times it thought it knew better than he did and would act on its own, but Xander had been slowly earning its respect and they'd gotten to the point where it would listen to him on most occasions. He was confident that as long as they kept the upper hand, Charizard would listen, but if they started feel behind things would likely go off track. &quot;So, who are we going to be fighting?&quot;</span></span></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: royalblue">&quot;Vikavolt&quot;, Xander analysed their opponent, it was one they hadn't faced before. He pulled out his Pokedex to get a read on its stats, but they were a bit conflicting. &quot;What? This doesn't make sense!&quot; Xander grumbled, who'd done this research?! The Pokedex claimed that Vikavolt's best stat was Special Attack and it had low speed, yet the Pokedex descriptions made note of Vikavolt's powerful mandibles and high speed capabilities! Whoever was in charge of this dex entry need their position reviewed! Xander looked at Charizard. An Electric Pokemon changed things, Charizard wasn't the only one with a type advantage now. With Vikavolt's high special attack, super effective Electric attacks were going to sting. If they Mega Evolved now they would resist both of the Bug's STABs, Xander could sense this was what Charizard expected from him. &quot;Alright then Charizard, let's do this!&quot; Xander held up his wrist, his keystone glowing as he prepared to activate his Mega Evolution. The keystone began to resonate with Charizard's and as tendrils of energy began to leap between the two stones, Charizard became enveloped in a rainbow glow. &quot;Let the strength of our bond unleash power unrivalled&quot;, Xander shouted, &quot;Mega Evolve!&quot; <br />
<br />
Charizard let out a mighty roar as its body underwent intense changes. Its skin turns jet black, with royal blue highlights giving it a truly dignified look. Its horns sharpened and barbs sprouted from its shoulders as its wings became more draconian. Red flames turn blistering blue as fire gathers in his maw, cementing his fearsome appearance. Adrienne would face the full force of Mega Charizard X, the now Fire and Dragon type flashed its <b>Tough Claws</b>, at its opponent, it would feel their sting soon enough. Xander still marvelled at the Mega Evolution, it was such a drastic change. &quot;Alright Charizard, how about we show them the power of Mega Evolution?&quot; The Charizard growled, he agreed. &quot;Alright open with a <b>Heat Wave</b>, then test our luck with an <b>Ancient Power. </b>If it tries to get in close, make it regret it with a <b>Crossfire</b>, otherwise trap it in a <b>Fire Spin</b>!&quot;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #4169e1">Meanwhile, the Mega Evolution had given the trio of Froakie, Chimchar and Fennekin the perfect distraction to slip away. Froakie and Chimchar looked to Fennekin for advice, they'd just finish fighting her but now they were team mates, meaning that they trusted her to lead them in the right way. They had to be at their stealthy best, they couldn't let Adrienne or her Vivillion become aware of their secret mission. </span></div>

<span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: royalBlue"><i>Why does this always happen to me?</i><br />
<br />
The question had been rattling around Alice Hope's mind for a while now as she trudged along the rural road. She certainly felt like a fool, or like she was being taken for one at this point, by this Pokemon world that had held her for so long. To say that she was a hostage in it was wrong. The Phantom Isles had pushed her into her own memories and revealed that she had probably hailed from it, so it was more accurate to say that it had rescued her back... But still. Alice didn't appreciate being thrown from one realm to another, some adventures unresolved, wondering if she had succeeded as the heroine or been brutally murdered and somehow restored. Was Bedlam Ridge still in one piece, or had Rigel won the battle and shot her in the head...?<br />
<br />
Absently, her fingers touched her forehead, and then blue eyes peered downward through the glasses on her nose. A soot-black Bagon, Eridian, walked at her side. His changing of colour had been a Halloween curse, but he seemed to be perfectly happy with himself. Alice knew she'd feel the same way eventually. If she was going to be happy with all of the progress she'd made since tumbling into the wonderland, she had to accept the bad as well. A world full of monsters and gangs couldn't be free of problems for all, after all, and it was hard to see herself as a protagonist with plot armour. The dragon noticed her stare and looked up, the blonde smiling apologetically.<br />
<br />
“Aww, Eri. I'm fine. I'm just thinking hard, that's all.” She explained, glossy lips pulling into an apologetic smile. For as pathetic as the dragon had considered her when they first met so many years ago, Alice had come far and he respected her far more these days. The biped grunted his acknowledgement, stoic as ever. In spite of her growth, though, the young woman still suffered her anxieties, and hadn't wanted to walk the country road 'alone'. He couldn't hold it against her, since she didn't remember how they had even got there to begin with.<br />
<br />
It was sunny and cloudless, but every time the wind blew, Alice wished she had a coat. Her feet were cozy in their faux fur-lined ankle booties, and the grey leggings she wore were thick; but the purple top's sheer sleeves didn't do much to guard against the temperature. They were on the wrong side of spring for that. Not to mention, her loose locks now resembled a bird's nest. She could do with gloves, too...<br />
<br />
The Fool's Path threatened to branch off again, and Alice sighed, stopping at the crossroads. “Now what do we do?” The idol complained, pouting dramatically. After a time, she concluded, “You know what The Doctor said,” Spoiler: Eridian had no bloody idea what she was talking about, “Turn Left.”<br />
<br />
And so, turn left they did.</span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote>(Going to start you from the initial post)<br />
<span style="color: royalblue"><br />
Quoting some odd doctor, you get a weird look from Eridian when you decide to turn left. What, did he expect you to turn right? What a fool! You continue along the Fool's Path, surely there would be a sign or something around to tell you where exactly this path was leading. If it truly was a Fool's Path, maybe it was just a big loop or something? The path seemed well worn at any rate, deep grooves were a clear sign of the wagons and carts that were likely dragged through here on the daily. Despite the obvious signs of traffic however, you'd yet to run into anyone. Thankfully that was about to change. Eridian perks up as it spots a cart up ahead, tipped on its side and with a large portion of its contents sprawled across the road. A small flock of Pidove have descended from the trees and begun to peck at the wares, much to the distress of the elderly gentlemen who is trying to scare them away. Eridian rushes forward, the smoke black Bagon quickly closes in on the cart. He growls at the Pidove, trying to help the man in his plight, but was helping him worth your time? As you get closer to the scene, you notice the cart seems to be intact, but a rather large hole in the ground seems to be the reason it is on its side. Whatever was pulling the cart seems to be gone as well, some broken ropes suggesting that whatever it was had broken free when the cart fell. <br />
<br />
&quot;Would you lend me a hand young lass?&quot; The old man pleads, &quot;I need to get to market and if I loose any more produce I'll loose everything!&quot; He seems to be down on his luck, but perhaps your arrival would turn things around?&quot;</span></div>

<b>ShadowDRGN- </b>You warn the Buizel that rushing in alone and blind was more dumb that tough, a fair point. You get down on the Water type's level, looking it dead in the eyes. They were burning with passion and rage, you could see the potential in the Buizel, but it needed training if it was to reach that potential, the type of training a trainer like you could provide. You pull an empty Pokeball from your pocket and present it to the Buizel, but it immediately breaks eye contact, turning its head and crossing its arms.<br />

&quot;Don't be disheartened lad&quot;, Greg encourages you, &quot;I think capturing this Buizel is a wise decision, but maybe it wants to bond with you a bit more first?&quot; The old fisherman made a good point, perhaps the Buizel wanted to get to know you a bit more before it allowed you to capture it? The training would present a perfect opportunity to bond with it as well. When you float the idea of doing some training together, you get the attention of the Buizel once more, it was certainly up for that! Boss steps in, giving the Buizel a fist bump, he was looking forward to doing some training as well.<br />
<br />
<b>The Buizel will now travel with you. It is a Male, lvl 10 Buizel with the ability Swift Swim. It also knows the Egg Move Helping Hand. </b><br />
<br />
Darla then approaches you, an old map in her hand. She presents you with the map, opening it you read the title running across the top of it, 'The Arcane Realm.' Where the hell was the Arcane Realm?! &quot;This is where we are here, near the Lake of the Moon, in the Land of Cups&quot;, she points to a spot near a massive lake on one side of the map. &quot;The man your looking for lives here, about an hours walk and if you skirt along the edge of the lake you shouldn't get too lost&quot;, Darla points to another spot, north of your current location. She was right, it seemed if you followed the lake, you would get to where you needed to go. &quot;Keep the map, you probably need it more than we do.&quot;<br />
<br />
<b>You received a map of the Arcane Realm!</b>

</blockquote>Jason smiles when he sees Boss give the Buizel a fitting gesture of agreement, &quot;alright! Let's go see what this master dude can teach us!&quot; he says, rather hyped up for the idea of learning for once. His mind is already drawing all sorts of pictures in his head of who this guy is and what he's a master of. Maybe he's one with the sword, or an ace Pokemon Trainer, or even a former boxing champ! Boss can definitely sense where his Trainer's head is at, and he turns around with a smirk and an encouraging nod. Looks like he's also pretty amped.<br />
<br />
Jason stands up and places the Pokeball back in his bag, stretching his legs a bit as he turns to head out the door, before he notices Darla approaching him with with something. He curiously glances down at the paper to see what it was, before the unusual and unfamiliar chart surprises him enough to the point where he double-takes. <i>What the hell!?</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... uh... thanks, ma'am,&quot; he stammers and takes the map in his hands, continuing to stare down at it in shock. So his gut ended up being right all along: He isn't in Unova anymore. Part of him wants to ask how he got here, but before he can speak, his instincts tell him that he probably won't get a solid answer from this couple. He just re-folds the map once he's seen where he has to go and places it in his bag, before turning to the duo of Pokemon next to him, &quot;let's get going. If this dude's house is just an hour away, then we'll have someplace to stay the night instead of camping out,&quot; he explains, mostly to Buizel as Boss is already in-agreement that spending another night on the cold, hard ground is out.<br />
<br />
As he reaches the doorway to the cabin, he turns to the old couple and nods curtly to signal his goodbye, &quot;thanks for the tea and helping out Buizel. If I come around here again, mind if I drop by for a bit?&quot; he asks. He feels as though a question like that coming from a guy like him is a little undeserved, but even so. If this truly is a faraway land he finds himself in, he should try and make friends... ones he can trust, at least.</span></div>

(Going to start you from the initial post)<br />
<br />
<span style="color: royalblue">Quoting some odd doctor, you get a weird look from Eridian when you decide to turn left. What, did he expect you to turn right? What a fool! You continue along the Fool's Path, surely there would be a sign or something around to tell you where exactly this path was leading. If it truly was a Fool's Path, maybe it was just a big loop or something? The path seemed well worn at any rate, deep grooves were a clear sign of the wagons and carts that were likely dragged through here on the daily. Despite the obvious signs of traffic however, you'd yet to run into anyone. Thankfully that was about to change. Eridian perks up as it spots a cart up ahead, tipped on its side and with a large portion of its contents sprawled across the road. A small flock of Pidove have descended from the trees and begun to peck at the wares, much to the distress of the elderly gentlemen who is trying to scare them away. Eridian rushes forward, the smoke black Bagon quickly closes in on the cart. He growls at the Pidove, trying to help the man in his plight, but was helping him worth your time? As you get closer to the scene, you notice the cart seems to be intact, but a rather large hole in the ground seems to be the reason it is on its side. Whatever was pulling the cart seems to be gone as well, some broken ropes suggesting that whatever it was had broken free when the cart fell. <br />
<br />
&quot;Would you lend me a hand young lass?&quot; The old man pleads, &quot;I need to get to market and if I loose any more produce I'll loose everything!&quot; He seems to be down on his luck, but perhaps your arrival would turn things around?&quot;</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: royalblue">Alice continued along the Fool's Path, wondering if maybe it was a big loop, although it most likely wasn't. She attributed the name to stories, or perhaps misfortune that had befallen people, or however many had gotten lost here. None of that was particularly optimistic, if she was to be honest, and that was grand considering here she was... But eh. Ignoring Eridian's odd looks, the woman's attention was soon grabbed by the first sign of other life that the duo had found: a turned-over cart, with a poor elderly gentleman trying to scare away some irritating Pidove. &quot;We should do something about that, Eridian--&quot;<br />
<br />
Before she could move to follow him, the scrappy dragon was already charging the scene. That was convenient, because Alice hated to run at the best of times, and she had done it enough in her life already. He growls aggressively, pint sized but fearsome nonetheless, attempting to get rid of the little buggers. As the trainer grew closer, she could see that the cart itself was fine - although it was hard to say about the stuff he was carrying - and a hole had caused the problem. Maybe the Pokemon was too dumb to avoid it, or something had forced it to stay this direction or otherwise ignore the hazard? She figured a skilled merchant would be used to such things by now and be more prepared for it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sure. We can help pick everything up and help lead the cart if you want.&quot; Alice offered, releasing her Pineco in a flurry of hearts to aid them, &quot;Eridian, Farren; use your Strength to put this cart back the right way up, will you? Farren, your string shot would be good, too.&quot; She asked of them, and the Pokemon grunted their affirmatives. Eridian began to try and push the cart from the ditch, Farren using his string to try and pull the cart in a good direction so that they could turn it back onto its wheels. &quot;Unless there's something else you wanted us to help you with?&quot;</span></div>

What an absolute hack! Adrienne had absolute no honour, using a move like Guillotine? Anyone could win like that! It was disrespectful and Xander was going to give her an earful for it. Not simply because he was disgusted by Adrienne's disrespect for battle, but because he was buying time for his gang of stealthy thieves to infiltrate the nest. He held up Charizard's ball and recalled it, this wouldn't be great for their bond, he would have lost a lot of Charizard's respect for this. &quot;You silver spoon fed princess!&quot; Xander let the rage embrace him, his eyes red with fury. &quot;Never have I met a person more disrespectful than yourself. Guillotine?! Anyone can win a battle with a bit of luck and a guaranteed OHKO move, do you think that makes you a good battler? The answer is no, it makes you a hack! Honestly, ever since I came to you're aid you've been nothing but disrespectful and rude. Have I been perfect? No, but its a bit hard to be nice when you're being mocked at every turn. Karma will catch up with you and it will sting! You deserve much worse than your Z Crystal getting stolen and I'm certain you'll get what is coming to you if you continue to act like you do. You think your above everyone else, but really you're no better than a lowly Grubbin!&quot; Xander took a deep breath, okay, he needed to cool it a bit. He looked around for a sign of Froakie, Chimchar on Fennekin, they had to be close to infiltrating the nest by now.....</span></div>

<article class="message-body js-selectToQuote">
<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: plum"> <b>ShadowDRGN- </b>Collecting the map and saying well to your knew friends, you exit the dwelling and head off in the direction you'd been pointed. The Arcane Realm huh? You had no idea how you could have gone from the Unova region to some unknown realm, maybe your questions would be properly answered at some point but right now you had another task to worry about. It was starting to get dark and if you didn't get to the master's house by nightfall, you'd be forced to camp outside. It would be much better spending the night inside, especially if there were aggressive Water Pokemon getting around.....<br />
<br />
You follow the lake for the most part, although you turn to the map when you feel like you're getting close. You were, Boss and the Buizel come to a stop, their more sensitive ears picking up a sound up ahead. They rush forward, surely you were getting sick of running at this point? You pursue anyway and soon hear the same chopping noise as they do, repetitive and rhythmic. You emerge into a clearing with a large cabin on the far side and a large Machamp in the middle, repetitively punching a large log that it has driven into the ground. It alternated its punches, taking turns striking with each of its four arms. Each punch hit the same spot with practised precision. Finally the log gives in an topples with a sickly crack. A hearty laugh fills the clearing, not from the Machamp, but from its trainer. &quot;Well done Machamp, but I think we have some guests so that's enough training for today.&quot; You hadn't noticed the bulky elder at first, your eyes were too focused on his Machamp. &quot;Alola traveller!&quot; he greets you with cheer, &quot;what brings you out here at this time of evening?&quot; <br />
<br />
<span style="color: royalblue"> <b>Meetan- </b>Eridian quickly scares off the Pidove, they weren't about to mess with a little black thug dragon! Thankfully that means the majority of the elderly traders goods are intact, the mountain of spilled berries and home-baked goods were salvageable but their value would likely be depreciated. That likely wasn't good, as from what you could gather from the merchant's behaviour, he needed the money. You quickly come to his aid though, tossing out a ball and releasing Farren the Pineco. The Pink Pineco was just one of many oddly coloured Pokemon you possessed, but in a place called the Arcane Realm, people had probably seen much stranger things than a black Bagon and a Pink Pineco. First things first, you had to get the cart back on four wheels. You order Eridian to use his Strength to lift the cart, which he does with ease. Farren follows with a String Shot, pinning the thread to cart's rear before reeling it in, ensuring the the cart isn't placed back in the same hole it had hit to tip over. With the cart back on all four wheels, the elderly merchant begins to load the items back in, working as fast as his ageing body would allow. You begin to help, as does Eridian and Farren, although the Pineco struggles without any notable appendages. You offer to help pull the cart as well, but the old man shakes his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I need to get my Tauros back, I'd be lost without him&quot;, the old man is shaking in panic at this point. &quot;Something has been messing up the road recently, there are holes like this all over the place. I didn't see this one until it was too late and the cart tipped, Tauros panicked and broke free, bolting off in that direction.&quot; He points off the road, through a thicket of trees. You can clearly see tracks heading off in that direction, it likely wouldn't be overly hard to track the spooked Tauros. &quot;I can finish loading everything back up, would you be a dear and go find my Tauros? He might need to be calmed down, but he's not overly aggressive.&quot;</span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><div style="text-align: center"><span style="color: seagreen"><u><span style="font-size: 22px">Missingno. Master</span></u></span>&#8203;</div><br />
<span style="color: seagreen"><span style="font-size: 12px">The Grimer seemed to shrink down slightly, their belief in their leader and the need for a barrier waning. Your Furret's words had made them contemplate why they were really fighting, the simple words of their leader that humans were terrible? They were certainly starting to doubt that he was even remotely steering them in an accurate direction. They murmured to one another, tossing glances in the direction of yourself and your Pokemon as well as back at their leader. The Muk seemed to be growing agitated. It was itching for fight, and not having one was clearly bothering it. It's multicolored skin flashed in irritation, yet it remained hidden behind it's metaphorical wall. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, as her name implied, Help literally swung into action. She used her circular body to swing herself in all sorts of directions, landing near the fallen Grimer and chiming a bell, causing the creature to rise. </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgb(247, 218, 100)"><span style="font-size: 12px"><b>'T-THANK YOU.'</b></span></span><span style="color: seagreen"><span style="font-size: 12px"> It murmured, clearly less aggressive and more shy than it's companions. It extended a hand to Help, clearly grateful for her going out of her way to revive it. It looked back at his companions, a frown crossing it's goopy face. </span></span><span style="color: rgb(247, 218, 100)"><span style="font-size: 12px"><b>'MUK WON'T BACK DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT. HE LOVES ATTACKING HUMANS.'</b></span></span><span style="color: seagreen"><span style="font-size: 12px"> It sighed, looking back at it's companions. </span></span><span style="color: rgb(247, 218, 100)"><span style="font-size: 12px"><b>'MY BROTHERS MEAN WELL... BUT THEY'RE TOO AFRAID TO CROSS MUK.'</b></span></span><span style="color: seagreen"><span style="font-size: 12px"> It watched the group for a while, noticing a shadow moving with seemingly nothing attached to it.</span></span><span style="color: rgb(247, 218, 100)"><span style="font-size: 12px"> <b>'DO YOU... SEE THAT?'</b></span></span><span style="color: seagreen"><span style="font-size: 12px"> It asked, pointing towards the ground and drawing her attention to the small shadow. Help seemed slightly confused, the Grimer and Muk hadn't noticed it yet. It's patterns were irregular and it worked it's way to the backside of the Muk.<br />
<br />
<i>'TUMMMMP!'</i> The cry of the Phantump rang out, ascending out of the ground like a phantom and forcing it's small body weight at the large Muk. The Muk hissed out in response, sinking back into the ground before turning around and grabbing the Phantump Screeching loudly in it's face. <br />
<br />
<b>'YOU DARE ATTACK ME?!'</b> The Muk swung the Phantump around, tossing it's body towards your ground. Thinking quickly, Laugh set up the Protect, cushioning the blow of the Phantump. It bounced off the protect, landing on the cold grassy ground in front of your group. 'YOU DARE SIDE WITH HUMANS? AFTER WHAT THEY DID TO YOUR MOTHER?' Muk's words were not sympathetic, but rather mocking. The Phantump pulled itself up, staring at the Muk with distaste. <br />
<br />
<i>'They...'</i> It groaned in pain, slowly floating back up. <i>'They caught her... it's not like she's dead.'</i> The Phantump coughed, clearly close to fainting from the sheer force of the throw plus it's earlier battle with you. The Muk's smirk curled in distaste, looking at the small ghost. <br />
<br />
<b>'YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT? YOU'RE MORE FOOLISH THAN I THOUGHT!'</b> It screamed out the last words, swinging it's arm to deal the final blow. The Phantump reacted quickly, closing it's eyes as an invisible Bond was formed between itself and the Muk. The Muk smacked it with a large hand, Knocking it's block off. The Phantump flew backwards, vanishing before it's body was able to hit your protective shield. The Muk chuckled seeing it's body dissipate, it was ready to Fling one of it's companions at you but it suddenly began to spasm. <br />
<br />
<b>'W-WHAT?! WHAT IS THIS?'</b> It cried out, screaming in horror as it felt it's health drain. <b>'NO! N-NO!'</b> It cried out loudly, melting back into the ground. The Grimer turned in horror. <br />
<br />
<i><b>'MUK?!' </b></i>They cried out, seeing that their companion was no more. They all looked at one another before quickly fleeing, running from the battle. <br />
<br />
<i>Ava gained 2 Levels<br />
Laugh gained 2 Levels<br />
Help gained 1 Level</i><br />
<br />
Help and the previously fallen Grimer looked around, their faces dimming as they realized that they Phantump was truly gone. Grimer sighed, glancing at where the Muk had melted into the ground. <b>'IT NEEDED TO BE DONE... NOW HUMANS CAN VISIT AGAIN.'</b> It frowned, clearly not believing the words it was speaking. <b>'I SHOULD LEAVE TOO. THIS AREA CAN FINALLY HEAL WITHOUT US AROUND.'</b> It glanced at your team, clearly feeling guilty for polluting the area. </span><br />
<br />
<i><b><span style="font-size: 12px">What do you do?</span></b></i></span><br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center"><span style="color: royalblue"><u><span style="font-size: 22px">King Ghidorah</span></u> </span>&#8203;</div><br />
<span style="color: royalblue"><span style="font-size: 12px">One peek. Surely that couldn't hurt, right? You lifted the scroll from it's platform an-<br />
<br />
<i>Oh my god.</i><br />
<br />
The scroll turned to dust in your hand. You glanced around in horror, hoping that no one had seen you do that. Your Yamask's cold expression remained, not reacting to what had just happened. You hurriedly uncupped your hand, allowing the tan coloured flakes of dust that had formerly been a scroll to fall back onto the podium. You scooped all the flakes into a pile, trying your best to insist that you had simply found that pile on that lavish podium. However, you knew that wasn't exactly believable. You were about to walk away, until you noticed a faint glimmer from within the pile. Curiosity slapped you across the face once again, you reached into the pile and produced a shimmering <i>Heart Shaped Scale</i>. Your eyes wandered for a few moments until you noticed a golden plaque below the podium. <br />
<br />
<i>'Protective Scroll of Ancient Scale' </i><br />
<br />
You sighed in relief, realizing that you had not destroyed a priceless artifact... you had merely destroyed the casing it was kept in. You glanced at the scale in your hand... surely no one would notice if you took it, right? You knew that these artifacts were indeed priceless and that they had presumably been down here for years and years --- not to mention that you knew you had a mission to attend to, yet, you had to admit that you certainly knew the rarity of these scales. What use was it down here? Sitting on a lavish podium in archives where no one would use it. </span><br />

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: royalblue"><b>TKF:</b> Adrienne snorted, rolling your eyes before you were even done with your speech. She was a dishonourable, spoiled hack and you made sure that she knew it! Her winning tactic had angered you enough to see red, and you knew that limitless bond with Charizard might suddenly have a hard line ruled through it because of her behaviour. Unbelievable!<br />
<br />
“Silver spoon fed princess? Am I? Did it ever occur to you that Buginum Z was something that I earned fair and square? Do you think that these powerful Pokemon were just given to me? Hah. You're far from perfect. You're a child who thinks that he's a big man, who thinks that he knows everything. Perhaps I should have taken that Fennekin after all. At the very least, I could have found it a better trainer than the likes of <b><i>you</i></b>.”<br />
<br />
Her lofty tone ends in venom, pink eyes skimming you over like you were worse than a lowly Grubin – like you were scum that weren't worth the sole of a murderer's shoes. “My 'lowly' Grubin grew into this, a powerful battler. I could think of worse comparisons. A true trainer is ready for whatever comes their way, including an arrogant little thief's super effective mega evolution. As if your tactics were any better, some brute force easy mode. Don't play like you're some knight to me, little boy. Karma has caught up to you, now, and it's going to do one worse. All of your own impatience and judgement will now lose you your bounty.” She tilted her head ever so slightly, beautiful pink waves falling to the side.<br />
<br />
“I was going to give you a chance to battle me, for us to share the assumed treasures equally, along with whatever I was going to give you for your help today. But I see your presumptuous little behind doesn't deserve it.” Adrienne's voice was sheer cold. You thought she was nasty before? Now she's actively punishing you for your stereotypes, for your insolence, for your little tantrum to boot. It sounds like you, the grandson of a champion, were in fact in the presence of an elite trainer... So much for that silver spoon. “A boy who preaches about honour while sending his babies to raid. There's so much irony, you really will be a fun story for the message boards, won't you? We from Kalos love a good gossip, it's the same in Hoenn and Unova, too. I wonder how it is in Fizzytopia? Your grandfather would be so disappointed to hear about your reputation, if he's still kicking, that is...”<br />
<br />
She's smirking. She doesn't care about your feelings anymore, if she ever did. You could try grovelling or apologising, but it might be too late. You could try distracting her with a new Pokemon to strike, but could you even do anything substantial if you tried? “Viki, help Rosetta take care of those children.” The older teenager ordered, her Vikavolt lifting from the ground to shoot off into the bushes behind you – where the Vivillion had suddenly taken some kind of nosedive. “Time to show their parent what consequences look like...”<br />
<br />
What do you do?</span></div>
