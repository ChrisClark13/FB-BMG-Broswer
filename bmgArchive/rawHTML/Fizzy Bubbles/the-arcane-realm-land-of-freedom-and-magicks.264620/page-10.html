<span style="color: plum"><b>Raves:</b> Menefer listens the whole time, maintaining as much eye contact as you can keep up. He's clearly interested in the tale that you're weaving for him, although he briefly looks away from you to smile and nod encouragingly at the Infernape and Lunatone. If your brief sadness at your past had broken through, Menefer showed no indication that he noticed, and it seemed like your not-so-secret crush was at least a secret to him. Of course, if you wanted to keep it this way, it might be best to get your shit together. Arceus weeps, Alex, but your Pokemon will be laughing you into an early grave of humiliation if you give them anymore to work with. You're a comedy sketch all your own.<br />
<br />
“Those are amazing names. Historical references, yes? Or-- stories? I'm sorry, neither are my strongest suit but they do ring bells!” He added in compliment. “My own Pokemon are around here somewhere... Ammie, Ramses?” Menefer briefly looked around, and soon enough, an eerily grinning Banette was at one side and a Solrock at his other. The levitating sun seems particularly interested in the Lunatone – or you think so, it's hard to tell, to be honest. Their faces were harder to read than Lunatones', who at least had some light in their eyes. Solrock was more... Just rocky, really. “They went off to explore while I stargazed. They have a lot less patience than me, I think.” He laughed, and then the Banette did, too. It was a little creepy.<br />
<br />
“So, the two of us and four companions, for now at least! They might wander off again. It's not that they're untrained, but we did think it'd be good if they covered more ground, and they always come back if I call.” It seems like his trust and bond in his Pokemon is strong, so the ghostie probably won't try to dig into your soul and devour all of the darkness within it. Reassuring! The Solrock moved higher, turning roughly north-west. “You've found something, Ramses?”<br />
The Pokemon spoke, and shifted in a way that might be a nod if it had a neck attached. “Okay, then I guess we go this way.” Menefer decided, glancing back at you. “Are you ready to go?”<br />
<br />
Of course you are, you lovesick dolt, but it's decorum to ask anyway. What do you do?</span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: plum">Alex nodded as Menefer made a fairly accurate guess on the origin of his pokemon's names, still surprisingly cheerful. &quot;Yeah, a bit of both. Most of my team's names stem from mythology or history, both real and fictional, and they're as dependable as their namesakes,&quot; he explained, before the cute guy called two names, and fairly soon he found the man's companions, a possessed voodoo doll with a perpetual zipper grin at one side and the other side...a Solrock. That was clear as day, and as he looked upon it, Alex's mind thought back to that tomb he had visited all those years ago. <i>I followed the moon sigil and came into contact with Nuhuko...had I went with the sun, would I have encountered something like you?</i> Menefer's reasons for their absence was simple enough, scouting.<br />
<br />
While Ramses stared at the pumpkin tinted Lunatone, the subject merely looked back unflinchingly, as difficult to read as the Solrock. Nuhuko knew of course that he was often considered one half of a duality, and to find himself in the presence of his counterpart was interesting. The laugh of the cute human and Banette made Alex give a nervous chuckle, if only to try and fit in a bit with this stranger, but he could see a couple of parallels between him and Menefer. They both had something of unusual pasts twinged with tragedy, their pokemon allies were relatively opposite in nature, with his pair inherently patient and theirs a bit impatient, and the two were in the same location following their hearts. Speaking of heart, Menefer inferred a semblance of trust between him and his pokemon, judging by the fact they returned to him whenever he called, and as the Solrock rose into the air and turned north west or so, it seemed as if they had a destination in mind. Something of interest, perhaps, as Menefer looked back at Alex and asked if he was ready to head out.<br />
<br />
Pushing back his fluttering heart into its chest, he replied. &quot;Y-yeah, we're good to go. Lead the way and we'll keep an eye out for anything that could be trouble. If there's one thing I've learned through the years, it's that trouble always follows adventure.&quot; He was almost kicking himself for making the possibility of danger, but in retrospect that had always been the case, whether it was a criminal organisation, an errant toxic fungus or even the cold, uncaring grip of Death itself. Good thing he had found a way around all three and come out on top. Ready to head out, he was aiming to be beside this handsome fellow on this stroll through the desert, while a few feet behind him Nothung was aiming to banter with the Banette over Alex's amusing infatuation. Hopefully Ammie had a sense of humour.</span></div>

<span style="color: royalblue"><span style="font-size: 12px">As you entered the pastry shop a small bell chimed, signaling to whoever was inside that someone had entered the small building. You marveled at the small shop, it seemed so insignificant in the grand scheme of things... yet apparently a world renowned chef worked here, making beautiful pastries for the whole of the Castle Town. As you entered the building, you saw no evidence of said chef. It was clear that the shop was open, as you made sure to double check that the open sign was flipped after you entered... yet there seemed to be no one here except a large Blissey wearing an apron.<br />
<br />
&quot;See!&quot; She called out, waddling towards you with a smile on her face. &quot;See! See!&quot; She called out, gesturing for you to approach the counter. Slightly confused, you made your way to the counter where she showed you all sorts of baked goods. &quot;Bliss!&quot; She called out, scooping on up in both arms and offering it to you. It appeared as though she wanted you to try it. <br />
<br />
&quot;BB! What have I told you about giving away free samples?&quot; <a href="https://i.imgur.com/SMaPTO1.png" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FSMaPTO1.png&amp;hash=88686d881616f40509fc4542c2e01f1c" rel="nofollow noopener">A man</a> came out from behind the counter. His skin and hair were dark, well kept and he was dressed quite fashionably. The Blissey put her hands on her body, as if to mimic a woman putting her hands on her hips and scolding a man. She gave some stern cries at the man, who you assumed was her master. He sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose. &quot;Yeah yeah, alright. Let him try it.&quot; He chuckled, watching as you took a bite of the pastry. <br />
<br />
It was amazing. <br />
<br />
Warm, fresh, and filled with strawberries and creme. You could barely contain a pleasured noise that threatened to escape your lips. <br />
<br />
&quot;Any good?&quot; The man asked, a coy grin on his face. He stuck out his hand. &quot;Lucius Kovitz, nice to meet you.&quot; He eyed you before continuing. &quot;Never seen you around here, what brings you to the shop?&quot; </span><br />
<br />
<i><b><span style="font-size: 12px">What do you do?</span></b></i></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: RoyalBlue">The shop was small and quaint, and felt comforting. It was also a bit... empty. Which seemed concerning. Did he get the wrong place? Leo shook his head. No, sure this had to be the place. The smell was enough to let him know. He looked at the Blissey who was making pastries. Was the renowned chef this Blissey? Thinking about it, the eggs Blissey carry with them would make for excellent pastries, as long as the Pokemon was consenting to assist. <br />
<br />
As he was lost in though, the Pokemon approached Leo, letting out gleeful cries. Shaking his head, he looked at the Blissey and saw she was motioning towards the display case. The boy walked over and looked at the case. Copious amounts of fresh baked pastries sat perfectly lined up on shelves. They glistened under the light and smelled amazing. The Blissey then scooped one up and handed it to him. Leo started to try and take a bite, but a man came out of the back and started to chide the Blissey.<br />
<br />
This caused Leo to recoil in shock, and just hold the pastry as the man talked to the Blissey. He was taller than Leo, his hair well kept and skin the shade of chocolate. His voice also had a chocolaty richness to it as well, and seemed soothing even so he was mad at the Pokemon. The man was also well groomed, and dressed in fancy clothes. Compared to his hoodie... Well it was obvious this man was well off. Leo just sighed, expecting to not be able to try the pastry at this rate. he then saw the man sigh, and was told he was able to try it.<br />
<br />
Biting into it, warm buttery pastry melded with sweet cream and a sweet berry... It tasted similar to a Rawst to him, but was more sweeter and without the bitterness. He let out an audible sound of happiness, feeling the sweet flavors dance across his mouth with each bite. This was amazing. More amazing than anything he'd be able to dream to pull off. <br />
<br />
&quot;Any good?&quot; He heard the man ask before introducing himself as Lucius Kovitz and asking Leo where he was from.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was amazing...&quot; Was the only thing Leo could muster for a little bit. Taking a minute to let that euphoric pastry do its magic, Leo cleared his throat. &quot;Leo. My name is Leo. I heard there was a world famous patisserie here and I had to try it. I'm an up and coming baker, so I want to journey around the land to get inspiration and grow!&quot; He exclaimed with a cheeky grin. </span></div>

<b><u>Silverstream-</u></b><br />
<br />
You decide to give chase to the hooded figure. You follow them through a few back alleys, but notice its getting darker and darker. It soon feels you're being dragged along, as the figure stops every so often to make sure you're still giving chase. And if you look tired out... You get taunted until you resume the chase. The alleyways at this point more felt like a labyrinth than an actual city. Sure, the City of Pentacles was one of the largest in Fizzytopia, but this just felt... Unnatural for slums. Guess why it's called the Devil's Playground. <br />
<br />
Soon the figure stops in front of a door and goes inside of it. Seems that they were leading you here for some reason. You see your pack of cigarettes carefully placed in front of the door. It's quite old, made of oak and three metal bars seemed to serve as a window. The smell of plants hits you hard, the aroma seeming to waft from the opening in the door. Taking a step back, you see a small sign above the door. &quot;The Little Imp.&quot;<br />
<br />
This place seemed to be some type of bar or tavern. Slums had those dives, the seedy places that served swill and had a &quot;secret menu&quot; that was usually everything on the black market besides an actual drink. Escorts and Drugs were usually the common two secret menus, and you could tell that this was a place that served both. Though, it seemed that whoever ran this place wanted you to come here. And based on that smell, you could tell this place had what you wanted. <br />
<br />
What do you do?<br />

<span style="color: plum"><b>TKF:</b> Billy smiled and nodded when you gave your permission, and he repeated your sentiment to the Braixen: she was doing a really good job and to keep it up! Braixen nodded, trying not to let the fuss carry her away. Keeping her brain empty was seriously difficult. How did Slowpoke live?! How did you live?! I mean--<br />
<br />
“Braixen, try to reach out to Megara with your psychic powers. See if you can feel what she's doing, so you know what you need to try and aim for.” Billy suggested. The Braixen nodded, closing her eyes, her body beginning to radiate blue. It was a gentle glow, and Megara closed her eyes, reaching out a single vine to wrap around one of the witch's paws. There was something lovely about seeing the two of them there, attempting to forge some kind of bond. After a few seconds, Megara began to charge her attack. A light began to form at her open maw, building up in brightness and size until it was a rather threatening green sphere; sparking with energy drawn from nature itself. With a force that the tender creature didn't otherwise seem capable of, the Energy Ball was flung into the sky, and Braixen used a flurry of Embers to blow it up high above them all, the two of them eliminating the chance of the orb falling and causing damage to the meadow.<br />
<br />
“Did that help any, Braixen?” Billy asked. She nodded curtly, glancing from Billy and back to the Meganium, the two of them exchanging serious expressions. They weren't mean, but they were definitely communicating something between them. “Then we'll do the next step when you're ready.”<br />
<br />
Braixen nodded, giving her signal. “Alright. Be careful, Megara, remember you're bigger than her.”<br />
“Megaanium!” The grassy dino replied, not needing the reminder. You could see Braixen change her stature, standing as if to brace herself for the oncoming blow. Once again, Megara charges her Energy Ball, although this one stopped at a smaller size. Less violent about her execution, the Energy Ball was spat towards Braixen, and the fox took the full brunt of the blow. It sent her off her paws and up into the air a foot or so before she landed hard on her back. Billy and Megara flinched, the pair of them so in sync they managed to mirror each other's apologetic expressions perfectly.<br />
<br />
“We're sorry, Braixen! Are you alright?” Billy asked. The Braixen nodded, shaking herself off as gracefully as she could and standing up. Megara took a few steps closer, seemingly asking the same thing. Braixen looked embarrassed by the fuss, but mostly okay. But how about you? Do the both of you still want to go on?</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: plum"><br />
It was certainly an interesting process. Xander didn't really know what to expect going into this specialised training, he never would have approached it like this. He was more direct, where this was a more holistic approach. They'd soon see if it was working, as Braixen dusts herself off, the last blow having knocked her well off her feet. Xander half expected to through in the towel now, her ego bruised after the blow, but the Braixen was showing more resilience than he expected. To heal off the damage she'd taken, the Braixen pulls the wand-like stick from her tail and casts a <b>Wish</b> for herself. It would take some time for it to come true, but it would heal away the damage she'd taken from the Energy Ball. <br />
<br />
&quot;Great stuff Braixen&quot;, Xander complemented, &quot;but how did that feel? Did you get a good feel for the energy?&quot; It was hard to tell, but Braixen seemed confident that she had a feel for move, at least well enough to continue. Xander turned to Billy and Megara, &quot;don't look so worried Megara&quot;, Xander chuckled, &quot;Braixen will be fine, you're doing a great job helping her. Billy, I think Braixen is okay to push on, maybe we avoid damage again, until the Wish comes through at least? What is the next step anyway? Does Braixen try and channel the energy herself now?&quot; Xander looked around, he'd been paying so much attention to Braixen after she got hit that he'd completely lost sight of Grotle and Bayleef. The pair were off on their own now, if they got themselves into trouble they'd have to resolve it themselves!</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: plum"><b>TKF:</b> You had completely lost sight of Bayleef and Grotle, and if they got into trouble, they'd have to resolve it for themselves. Right now, Braixen was at the forefront of your mind, and wishing for healing and good luck filled her with determination! “Well, for one, if the stick helps her with manifesting the move, she is more than welcome to use it. I personally don't have experience with Braixen myself.” Billy said. “And we can avoid damage until the Wish comes through, but Megara does know Heal Pulse, and she'd be more than happy to use it to make you feel better, Braixen.”<br />
<br />
“Megaa...” The dinosaur agreed solemnly, but Braixen merely said a few things, wearing a confident expression. It seemed like Meganium could keep her healing to herself! The fox was happy to go on as she was.<br />
“Alright, well, if that's the case. One more demonstration and you can have a try, yeah?” The fox agreed with her tutor's stipulation, and with one more Energy Ball projected into the sky (and swiftly countered for nature preservation purposes), they were good to go. You were nervous and excited as Billy once again reminded Braixen to keep her focus. She was inspired by this point, however, and it wasn't difficult to do. She closed her eyes, took her deep breath, and began to swish her wand gently through the air. It was almost artistic, hypnotic, and soon she stopped: one fore paw over the other, the wand pointed skyward. Your eyes widened, and Billy looked intrigued, too.<br />
<br />
It was happening! There was a spark of green at the end of the wand, Braixen could feel the magic flowing from the tips of her toes to her fingers, to her dependable wand. Slowly, light gathered from the sparks, maintaining form, only to fire off haphazardly. Megara panicked and covered Billy, the damage to her minimal, and you were just lucky that Braixen wasn't facing you. It had shorted out, but it was most certainly the beginnings of an Energy Ball!<br />
<br />
The Pokemon seems let down, however. She'd gotten her hopes up. Do you want to carry on, try something else, or take a break?<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
<b>Raves:</b> You try to laugh to fit in with the stranger and the pieces of his pack that are present (although, to be fair, how many Pokemon Menefer has you can't be sure of right now). However, as unnerving as Ammie could be, it was quashed by the pride you felt to have explained your Pokemon and to dwell on their bonds between themselves and you, and to think of how you and Menefer are a perfect parallel – a duality, like Solrock and Lunatone, even! You try not to believe in such things like fate and destiny given how cruel it can be, even if you enjoy the stories, but this really does feel like it lined up perfectly. Hell, while you don't want to discourage Menefer, you almost hope for trouble to come knocking. If you could show up what you were capable of, imagine how impressed he'd be when just hearing you talk seems to brighten his night!<br />
<br />
You set off, chatting away, and your Pokemon are doing the same. Well, it's hard to tell if Ramses is, but Ammie and Nuhuko are one hundred percent mocking the pair of you as you cross the desert. As it turned out, Ammie indeed had a sense of humour, and it was as childlike as the doll she had transfigured from however long ago (she had yet to offer up such a history). Menefer is just letting the conversation flow naturally, from his favourite foods (he really enjoys grapes and bloody meats, as it happened) to the constellations and if you knew anything about them. He wanted to know about your other Pokemon, too – he wasn't exactly a trainer with badges or the like, but he admired those who were.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Ramses has you a halt, and he's hovering intently above a spot that Ammie is reinforcing. It looks like they think something might be there, buried beneath the hard ground, some way down. “Our Pokemon could probably use their psychic powers to help shift things, but I feel like Dig or Rock Smash or skills like that might be more effective. Can your Pokemon help us with that?” Menefer asked hopefully, brown eyes shining at you with concern.<br />
Well, do you?! Hurry up and impress the guy, man! God.</span></div>

Xander watched as Megara gave one final demonstration. Braixen seemed intent on nailing the move on her first attempt, the amount of focus she put into channelling the energy was visible. For a moment it seemed like she had the move with her grasp, energy gathering around the stick that allowed her to better channel her power. Unfortunately the Fire type lost control of the attack, sending sparks of energy flying off haphazardly. Thankfully no one was hurt, well, not physically. Braixen's pride was clearly wounded again, she'd tried so hard, but still failed. That's how she would have seen it, but not how Xander had. She'd come so close and it was only her first attempt! Xander had half a mind to console her and urge her to try again, but he sensed this wasn't the right way to approach this. He'd gotten to know Braixen now, he had a better feel for how her mind worked. If he got her to try again, she'd focus on the failed attempt and they'd likely see the same result. Maybe a break was what they needed? Maybe she needed time to relax and forget her failing, maybe they'd find something to motivate her towards success....<br />
<br />
&quot;Great attempt Braixen&quot;, Xander sad cheerfully, &quot;you really tried hard then. Why don't we take a break for a bit before we try again?&quot; Xander looked over to Billy. &quot;How about we take a break Billy? We can see where Bayleef and Grotle ran off to and maybe have a bite to eat before we give it another shot.&quot; Xander had a feeling Billy would agree with his choice, he didn't seem like the pushy type. Xander looked in the direction he'd last seen Bayleef and Grotle, the pair couldn't have gotten too far away, surely!</span></div>

They'd searched for Grotle and Bayleef to no avail, the two were nowhere to be seen. Xander was beginning to worry, but not as much as Billy was. It was as if he could sense the impending event. They watched in horror as a wave of despair swept across the meadow, the stunning flowers wilting one by one. The sun was hidden behind dark clouds, a sense of dread hung in the air. It was as if they'd been pulled into some alternate world, dragged from a world of life to a world of death. Braixen looked concerned, not as concerned as Billy and Megara though, who likely had a strong connection with the flowers due to all the work they'd put into caring for them. Xander was concerned about the flowers, but more concerned about his Pokemon. He hoped they were okay, that they were safe and unaffected by whatever was happening. He also hoped they had nothing to do with what had happened, he couldn't imagine how they could have caused this though. <br />
<br />
&quot;Billy is Megara okay?&quot; Xander questioned, concerned that whatever was damaging the flowers might also have an effect on the Grass typed Meganium, and by extension, his two missing Grass types. &quot;What could have caused this? We need to find Grotle and Bayleef now, I need to know if they are okay.&quot; Xander turned to Braixen now, hoping the Fire type could help them locate the pair. &quot;Braixen, send a <b>Fire Spin</b> up into the air, hopefully Grotle and Bayleef will see it and come back.&quot;</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: royalblue"><b>Meetan- </b>Phil lets out a chuckle as he catches your quip about running over children, seems he did have a sense of humour! He seems to work out where he needs to go and sits back down, happy that you've agreed to stay with him until he finds his buyer. &quot;Thanks a lot Alice, if only all youngster were as kind as you.&quot; He steers Tauros through the crowd and down a side alley, eventually coming to a stop outside an old warehouse. The warehouse doors are wide open, the first thing you notice is a pair of old jeeps. These certainly weren't from around here, it seemed like most of the Arcane Realm relied on old fashioned modes of transport. A group of men soon make themselves noticed, they're almost as rough looking as the jeeps! Covered in tattoos, torn jackets and jeans, mud stained boots. Half of them had shaved heads, the remainder sporting haircuts you wouldn't pay a barber for. You notice a couple of pokeballs on their belts as well and as one steps forward to confront Phil an Ariados scuttles up his back and onto his shoulder. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're late old timer, that means we won't be paying you the full amount&quot;, this bloke seems at least half educated, although his lackeys appear less so as they snicker and nudge one another. Phil looks shocked, he was certain you'd get here on time. <br />
<br />
&quot;We had trouble on the road, a Trapinch had put holes all through the Fool's Path. I can't be that late, I need the full amount.&quot; You notice the man's interest perk slightly when Phil mentions the Trapinch, your Trapinch. <br />
<br />
&quot;You'll get what we give you&quot;, the man motions for his men to collect the goods and they slowly approach the cart. Phil looks devastated that he won't be getting the money he was promised, surely this wasn't fair? <br />
<br />
<span style="color: plum"><br />
<b>ShadowDRGN- </b>As you recall Boss and head inside, you apologise to Mal, explaining that Buizel wasn't exactly your Pokemon yet. You intended to rectify that at some point, but for now the Buizel wasn't ready to call you its trainer. Mal chuckled, he certainly did that a lot.... &quot;It's alright kid, I totally get that. I met Machamp when I was a kid, it was only a Machop back then though. Before I could catch it, it demanded I beat it in a fight! All the bruises were worth it, not sure about the broken rib though!&quot; He began chuckling even louder as he follows you inside. Their is a fire cracking in the hearth, and he quickly presents you with a bowl of soup for dinner before directing you to a spare bedroom. &quot;Don't stay up too late, training will start at the crack of dawn!&quot; <br />
<br />
The door closes behind you, leaving you to inspect the relatively barren room. A small wardrobe, a pair single beds and a window with curtains drawn. Buizel looks at you, giving you a reassuring nod before leaping onto one of the beds. It had probably never been in a bed before today and now it had been in two! It certainly seemed to enjoy the comfort, because as soon as it weaved its way under the blankets, the Water type was asleep! It was probably a sign that you should get to sleep as well, it seemed Boss and Buizel wouldn't be the only ones training tomorrow.....<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center">......<br />&#8203;</div>You wake up suddenly as the door almost seems to break from its hinges. &quot;Time to wake up kid, training starts in two minutes!&quot;, barely any light seeps through the window. Buizel leaps out of bed, fire and determination still burning in its eyes. It likely wasn't wise to keep Master Mal waiting, if you were late he'd probably find a way to make the training even harder!</span></span></div>

She didn't want to be judgemental - she was an outsider, too! - but outsiders with messy jeeps, in a shady alley, coming out and looking like that? There was a lesson to be learned here somewhere, surely... Oh, wait, no there wasn't. They had a freaky Ariados and were acting like pieces of shit. With the way the guy reacted at the mention of Trapinch, too, Alice quickly put potential dots together: these were the poachers, and they'd likely drive miles with Tauros, too, if they had the opportunity, along with whatever was left of Phil's farm. She wondered what else they hid in that warehouse of theirs...<br />
<br />
&quot;No. You'll get what <i><b>he</b></i> gives you.&quot; Alice slid off the back of the cart inelegantly, reaching for one of her Love Balls, which she quickly released. The familiar form of the black Bagon landed on the street, and seeing what he had to work with, the little dragon eyed his opponents up with a snarl. &quot;You pay the full amount, up front, before you put your hands on anything - or you deal with me. Do you understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eridian was showing teeth, and as if to make a point to the Ariados on the thug's shoulders, his maw began to glow a hot, threatening orange. If they recognised her, they'd hopefully know not to mess with her, but if they didn't and were willing to try it on? Alice was willing to give them a shock. These goons clearly liked to pick on who they perceived as weak, and she was absolutely here to ruin their day. &quot;Have Tauros back up and out of here, and stay where people can see you. I'll catch up on you after, okay? Call or send something if they try anything.&quot; Alice added to Phil. She had her mind made up, clearly, and Tauros would likely get spooked if they battled around it. Admittedly, she'd have no issue with Tauros literally trampling these fools, but she didn't want to risk herself or Phil in the process - the goods on the cart would end up all over the place. Her blue eyes returned to the group, sizing them up. She was more nervous than she looked, but she'd faced far worse and come out... Alive, maybe. Debatedly. To be confirmed. &quot;So, how are we doing this?&quot;</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: plum"><b>TKF:</b> You tell Billy that you need to look for Grotle and Bayleef, neither of which are anywhere in sight. Even with Braixen's fire spin, the two Pokemon don't emerge. “Mega, meg~~” The grassy dinosaur replied to you solemnly, the antenna on her head twitching. She could detect something, but before you had a chance to ask what it was, there's the sound of screams in the distance and a single young trainer comes running over the hill towards you. Panic was written all over her face.<br />
<br />
“Ellie! What's happening up there?!” Billy called out, and he begins to move closer as if to meet the other part way. She's definitely younger than you both, but tall for her age, curls bouncing and billowing wildly with every hasty slip and step through the long grass. Braixen doesn't look pleased. It's not that she doesn't trust this Ellie, but rather that she seems keen to the destruction going on up and out of sight.<br />
“It's horrible! A bunch of Pokemon wandered off to search for something, so of course their trainers went with them, and now they're all destroying the meadow in a mania! Or attacking each other, it's complete chaos!” Ellie was practically sobbing, “The wild Pokemon, too-- the Flabebe, you should have seen them, the poor things...!”<br />
“Hey, it's going to be okay--”<br />
“Billy, there's going to be nothing left! We have to do something!” The girl finally breaks down, crying inconsolably. Braixen bares her teeth, growling, while Billy holds and tries to comfort his junior.<br />
<br />
“If your Pokemon went off to play up that way, they could have been drawn in, too.” Billy warned. It went without saying, but your move tutoring was definitely on hold. “We can go and find them, and you can try to return them and if you want to, run. But if you want to stay, if you think you can help, it sounds like we're going to need it. I hate to say it, but we're not the best battlers in the world, even if I'm not too shabby. And it's the same for everyone else, too.”<br />
<br />
The Meadow attracts all kinds, and apparently, that includes bad apples, too. Over the hill, through the flowers, anarchy ensues. Strengthened by the bond of nature, Meganium and Braixen can feel it in their very souls. Mandibuzz shriek as they circle the hysteria, keen eyes fixed on fearful prey that they intend to devour. Your Pokemon wait for you, somewhere, to rescue them from play gone wrong. Adrienne had shown you that a champion's blood means nothing. That doesn't make you a champion yourself.<br />
<br />
But can you become one, here and now, for these people? For this magical place?<br />

<span style="color: plum"><b>Raves:</b> You try to laugh to fit in with the stranger and the pieces of his pack that are present (although, to be fair, how many Pokemon Menefer has you can't be sure of right now). However, as unnerving as Ammie could be, it was quashed by the pride you felt to have explained your Pokemon and to dwell on their bonds between themselves and you, and to think of how you and Menefer are a perfect parallel – a duality, like Solrock and Lunatone, even! You try not to believe in such things like fate and destiny given how cruel it can be, even if you enjoy the stories, but this really does feel like it lined up perfectly. Hell, while you don't want to discourage Menefer, you almost hope for trouble to come knocking. If you could show up what you were capable of, imagine how impressed he'd be when just hearing you talk seems to brighten his night!<br />
<br />
You set off, chatting away, and your Pokemon are doing the same. Well, it's hard to tell if Ramses is, but Ammie and Nuhuko are one hundred percent mocking the pair of you as you cross the desert. As it turned out, Ammie indeed had a sense of humour, and it was as childlike as the doll she had transfigured from however long ago (she had yet to offer up such a history). Menefer is just letting the conversation flow naturally, from his favourite foods (he really enjoys grapes and bloody meats, as it happened) to the constellations and if you knew anything about them. He wanted to know about your other Pokemon, too – he wasn't exactly a trainer with badges or the like, but he admired those who were.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Ramses has you a halt, and he's hovering intently above a spot that Ammie is reinforcing. It looks like they think something might be there, buried beneath the hard ground, some way down. “Our Pokemon could probably use their psychic powers to help shift things, but I feel like Dig or Rock Smash or skills like that might be more effective. Can your Pokemon help us with that?” Menefer asked hopefully, brown eyes shining at you with concern.<br />
Well, do you?! Hurry up and impress the guy, man! God.</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: plum">He wasn't the most sociable person in Fizzytopia. Heck, some would say that Alex was one of the hardest guys to approach in conversation in the region and yet here he was, chatting with Menefer and somehow not making a mess of things. Behind them, Nuhuko had been greatly amused by Ammie, the Banette indeed seeing the hilarity in the awkwardness of the situation and the obvious crush, and were poking fun at the oblivious pair with the fervent velocity of a swarm of Beedrill. Nothung meanwhile was keeping himself to himself, though struggling to maintain composure at the Lunatone's cheeky bobs and humming and the Infernape was sporting quite the grin. As the conversation between the humans went from foods (Alex quite liked grapes too, though had something of a penchant for fish) and constellations (again, he was quite versed in which ones were which, and made mention of his old Drapion who now went by a name related to Scorpio) he felt that he really was learning a lot on what it meant to be casual, and when the discussion turned to other pokemon, that's when he realised he had opportunity to really talk.<br />
<br />
&quot;I surprised myself when I took a look at how much pokemon I've got, and while I did kinda see me being more of a terrestrial trainer, with the rock and ground types, I'm also surprisingly somewhat of a mystic trainer judging by the psychic and ghosts I've got too. I've also got a couple of normal types though, and one of my more dependable pokemon, who couldn't join me today, is an Abomasnow who stood their ground well against a much bigger one on Mt. Zephyria. I mean, we still sorta lost in the end given it was running off some serious mega evolution energy, but everything worked out in the end.&quot; Giving him a smile, Alex was surprised at himself. Here he was, a well known loner in Fizzytopia, suddenly getting along well with this cute guy, and he wondered whether it was the magic of the Arcane Realm or something else, when the Solrock stopped and hovered.<br />
<br />
Raising an eyebrow, the group had came across a spot in the hard ground that seemed suspicious, as if there was something down there, and as Menefer gave the statement of using psychic force to push through, the mention of pokemon capable of digging was not lost to Alex, and as he readied himself to sic Nothung upon the hardened dirt, his eyes caught those of Menefer, and <i>oh Arceus why were they so gorgeous? Those hazel spheres like precious stones shining in the starlight, those soft lips in a slight quiver...</i><br />
<br />
He quickly composed himself, giving his head a quick shake. &quot;Ah! Sorry, bit of sand in my face...yeah, I've got someone who could help us out here, someone who pretty much lives for this sorta terrain.&quot; Grabbing a ball from his belt and enlarging it, he released its occupant, the small mouse blinking and giving his bricklike body a small shake. &quot;Glasspine, there's a spot of rough terrain we need to have a look at. Soften up the soil with a <b>rototiller</b> move, then <b>hone</b> your <b>claws</b> and start <b>dig</b>ging into it. You're used to this sort of terrain, so it shouldn't be too difficult.&quot; Giving a small nod, the Sandshrew readied himself for the task, while paying no heed to the other human in the vicinity. Nuhuko of course was hovering nearby, ready to give the ground type a <b>helping hand</b> when they actually put claws to earth and giving him some much needed oomph, all the while Alex stood back and smiled towards Menefer. Gods above, if this wasn't a change of experience for him.</span></div>

Still on the search for answers and his missing Grotle and Bayleef, Xander is shocked when a young girl comes racing towards them. It was kind of hard to make out what exactly was going on due to the panic in her voice, but it didn't sound good. Something about some trainers and Pokemon going off to find something and then going crazy and destroying the meadow? Xander couldn't even fathom what could possibly have that affect on people and Pokemon. He hoped that Grotle and Bayleef weren't apart of the group destroying the meadow, or being targeted by them. They needed to move quickly. Billy seemed to think he would run as soon as he recalled his Pokemon, he obviously didn't know Xander well enough. Sure, the last time he tried to help someone it didn't end well, but he'd come to realise that was probably just a one off. If everyone in the world was simply concerned with self preservation, the world would fall apart. Some people had to stand up and fight for others and he was one of them. He wasn't as connected to this place as Billy was, but he knew the lore. He knew the flowers here would play an important role at some point in the future, they would save thousands of lives. That meant that he had an opportunity to save thousands of lives by saving these flowers. Xander contemplated bringing Chimchar and Froakie out to help, but perhaps it would be better to wait until they knew exactly what was going on. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Billy, we can't waste any time&quot;, Xander began to run in the direction the girl came from, Braixen trailing behind him.</span></div>

<b>ShadowDRGN- </b>As you recall Boss and head inside, you apologise to Mal, explaining that Buizel wasn't exactly your Pokemon yet. You intended to rectify that at some point, but for now the Buizel wasn't ready to call you its trainer. Mal chuckled, he certainly did that a lot.... &quot;It's alright kid, I totally get that. I met Machamp when I was a kid, it was only a Machop back then though. Before I could catch it, it demanded I beat it in a fight! All the bruises were worth it, not sure about the broken rib though!&quot; He began chuckling even louder as he follows you inside. Their is a fire cracking in the hearth, and he quickly presents you with a bowl of soup for dinner before directing you to a spare bedroom. &quot;Don't stay up too late, training will start at the crack of dawn!&quot;<br />
<br />
The door closes behind you, leaving you to inspect the relatively barren room. A small wardrobe, a pair single beds and a window with curtains drawn. Buizel looks at you, giving you a reassuring nod before leaping onto one of the beds. It had probably never been in a bed before today and now it had been in two! It certainly seemed to enjoy the comfort, because as soon as it weaved its way under the blankets, the Water type was asleep! It was probably a sign that you should get to sleep as well, it seemed Boss and Buizel wouldn't be the only ones training tomorrow.....<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center">......&#8203;</div> <br />
You wake up suddenly as the door almost seems to break from its hinges. &quot;Time to wake up kid, training starts in two minutes!&quot;, barely any light seeps through the window. Buizel leaps out of bed, fire and determination still burning in its eyes. It likely wasn't wise to keep Master Mal waiting, if you were late he'd probably find a way to make the training even harder!
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote>Jason nods in appreciation for letting Buizel stay out for now, and he heads inside wordlessly with Mal and Buizel at his back. He only has a few moments to take in the place before he finds the bowl of soup thrust before him, &quot;oh... uh, thanks,&quot; he says as he takes it and starts to eat. His stomach is certainly satisfied with anything filling, but his taste buds find themselves jealous of the ripe and juicy berries that both Boss and Buizel ate earlier today.<br />
<br />
He continues to sip at the brew as he's brought into the bedroom. It's certainly... a lot different to his room back home. Being able to see the walls instead of a mesh of band posters pinned over-top is the biggest thing that strikes him, as is a floor that's actually traversable by human feet. He checks the room again for a TV or something hiding in the corners, but a sense of mild disappointment washes over him at the revelation of just how spartan these accommodations are. <i>Guess I'll just have to deal...</i> he thinks as he tilts the nearly-empty bowl over and drinks down the last of the soup, placing it by his bag.<br />
<br />
There's a weighty thud as Jason sets his duffel bag on the floor by the wardrobe. He briefly considers placing his clothes inside as he's changing into a fresher set of threads while Buizel isn't looking, but he ultimately thinks against it. He doesn't know how long he's going to be training here, after all. As long as he has a way to do laundry, his bag should suffice for holding his things. <br />
<br />
As he's placing his used clothes in a separate compartment from the rest, he catches a glimpse of his skateboard at the very bottom of his bag, under all his other supplies. A bit of melancholy creeps over Jason's face as he stares at it more and runs his fingers over the scratched-up underside of the deck. It was the very last thing he packed, but with how little opportunities he's had to ride it, it looks like it got shoved under everything else over time. From how old and rural this place is, it doesn't seem like he'll get the opportunity to ride it for a while yet, either.<br />
<br />
A sigh escapes Jason as he falls backwards onto the bed, head resting on his crossed forearms. He pulls out his phone and holds it lazily above his head to check the power. Even if he had to be up early, a little bit of time to game wouldn't hurt... except his battery is already on its last legs, and he didn't have any more juice in his spare charging packs. He grumbles and sets it back in his pocket, before glancing over at Buizel sleeping soundly, &quot;well, guess he enjoys it, at least,&quot; he whispers to himself. He thinks about how new and comfy a bed must be a Pokemon that's only ever lived in the wild, and finds himself with a bit more appreciation for having one to sleep in again after such a tiring journey. <br />
<br />
Jason's thoughts drift towards his hometown as he pulls the plain covers over his chest. Mental replays of the night where everything between him and Marcus changed invade his dreams, and once again, he finds himself staring out over Driftveil and proclaiming that one day he'll come back to settle things... except this time Buizel is at his side...<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center">.........<b><i>SLAM!</i></b>&#8203;</div><br />
&quot;Shit!&quot; Jason loudly exclaims as he jumps up in his bed at the frighteningly sudden sound. He's almost in a cold sweat, and he rubs what little sleep remains in him out of his eyes as he listens to the Master's wake-up call. <br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah! Just a sec!&quot; he calls out as he slides over to sit on the bedside, catching his breath. He watches Buizel scramble out the door as fast as he can, and elects to not dawdle, as well. He grabs Boss's Pokeball off his bag strap and hurriedly puts on his shoes before running out the door to catch up before two minutes are up.<br />
<br />
Once he's outside, he quickly takes his place beside Buizel and looks to the Master expectantly, waiting with hands in his pockets more out of habit than anything. Despite his sudden awakening, he feels a buzz of excitement running through him. Maybe the Master lives in a bit of a disappointingly plain cabin, and maybe he's not entirely what the Trainer expected, but he still seems like a cool guy, and Jason's still eager to see what expertise he has to offer.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what's our first lesson gonna be, Master?&quot;</span></div>

<b>ShadowDRGN- </b>Rudely awakened, you drag yourselves out onto the front porch, Buizel alongside you. Almost in unison the pair of you rub the sleep from your eyes and let out a yawn, this was going to be a long day. It was still fairly dark out, the ground was wet with morning dew. Bird Pokemon were beginning to awaken, their song-like cries emanating from the forest. Master Mal stands in the middle of the clearing, two steel buckets in his hands. His Machamp stands behind him, four smaller buckets in its grasp. The duo toss the buckets towards you, they clang and crash across the ground in front of you. What were you meant to do with these?<br />
<br />
&quot;We need some water from the lake&quot;, Mal states bluntly. &quot;The three of you need to retrieve two buckets each. Once you get back we'll discuss your training.&quot; Buizel looks a little apprehensive about going back to the lake but at least he wouldn't be alone this time. &quot;Oh one more thing, the <br />
full moon is tonight, so be careful down at the lake. I wouldn't spend too long filling up, get in and get out before you get spotted.&quot; There it was, more talk about the full moon and aggressive Pokemon. Why on earth would the full moon cause Water Pokemon to act so aggressive? This place was called the Arcane Realm, maybe it had something to do with magic? Either way, it was probably best to avoid direct conflict until you finished your training under Master Mal.</span></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: royalblue">Alice was satisfied that the men had quickly surrendered, but she still didn't trust it. They had been far too confident mere moments ago, and while perhaps they had just dismissed her as some damsel before, it wasn't as if the Ariados was matching their fear. She kept her eyes on them until Phil called her out, and her cheeks immediately burned red, stomach twisting. Was he seriously saying that to her? In private? She knew that he was desperate-- but really?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but they weren't even going to pay you properly for it! Not much might be better than nothing, but all of your pay is better than that!&quot; And Alice was suspicious of that, too. She genuinely wondered if the bills were falsified or something, but it wasn't like Alice had the knowledge to figure out something of the sort, and interrogations didn't always reap honest answers (still worth a try on these losers, though...). &quot;I won't, I promise. I wasn't here trying to make trouble for you, I just wanted you to get all of the money you needed. Can't you see they're shady as hell? Didn't you see the face that guy made? They're probably at least linked to the poachers!&quot; Her voice was still hushed, expression showing urgency. Honestly, she wasn't sure why she was bothering-- Phil probably didn't care this point now that he'd scolded her. He had his own affairs that he was clearly locked into. At least she had escorted him, anyway, and hopefully he could leave without a problem and things would work out fine for him. For her, on the other hand, she felt torn. Once Phil was gone, she probably had a duty to at least check this stuff out... But what to do? That was the question. The end of this exchange would likely help with that, and if Eridian had picked up on anything or what his instincts told them to do.</span></div>

<b>ShadowDRGN- </b>Rudely awakened, you drag yourselves out onto the front porch, Buizel alongside you. Almost in unison the pair of you rub the sleep from your eyes and let out a yawn, this was going to be a long day. It was still fairly dark out, the ground was wet with morning dew. Bird Pokemon were beginning to awaken, their song-like cries emanating from the forest. Master Mal stands in the middle of the clearing, two steel buckets in his hands. His Machamp stands behind him, four smaller buckets in its grasp. The duo toss the buckets towards you, they clang and crash across the ground in front of you. What were you meant to do with these?<br />
<br />
&quot;We need some water from the lake&quot;, Mal states bluntly. &quot;The three of you need to retrieve two buckets each. Once you get back we'll discuss your training.&quot; Buizel looks a little apprehensive about going back to the lake but at least he wouldn't be alone this time. &quot;Oh one more thing, the<br />
full moon is tonight, so be careful down at the lake. I wouldn't spend too long filling up, get in and get out before you get spotted.&quot; There it was, more talk about the full moon and aggressive Pokemon. Why on earth would the full moon cause Water Pokemon to act so aggressive? This place was called the Arcane Realm, maybe it had something to do with magic? Either way, it was probably best to avoid direct conflict until you finished your training under Master Mal.

</blockquote>Jason's lethargy is quickly broken when he hears the harsh sound of metal clattering at his feet. His eyes open wide, and he quickly squats down to grab at the buckets, taking two pairs to cover for Boss until he's sent out. He and the Buizel exchange a little glance of disappointment at the mention that this isn't even part of his training. This is just the Master offloading errands onto them. <i>Great...</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, guess we'll go do that,&quot; Jason says, trying to hold back a sigh. It's still fairly obvious that his excitement levels just took a major hit, but he'll live. Although his eyes do sharpen slightly at the mention of the Full Moon once again...<i> 'before I get spotted'? By what, a Wild Pokemon? Or... is he referring to something else? </i>Jason wracks his brain a bit, but he can't seem to understand it. Magic isn't really a topic he's put a lot of thought into, or believed in, for that matter. Some Pokemon might have strange powers, but the moon? <i>No way.</i> Then again... the way he just wandered into this vast, foreign land just by getting lost for a few days doesn't really sound like anything other than magic, either.<br />
<br />
His train of thought is quickly set to another track when he sees Buizel starting to trudge down towards the lake without him, &quot;oh, hey! Wait up, man!&quot; he calls after it and runs, making the buckets he's holding clang together with each hurried step. Once he's caught up, he asks the Buizel to stop for a moment as he puts one pair of buckets down and pulls out a Pokeball from his pocket: Boss's Pokeball. <br />
<br />
He unlatches it, causing a beam of energy to crackle out in front of him for a few moments. Boss emerges with a stretch and a yawn, and Jason leans down to pat the Pokemon on the head, &quot;yo! Sleep alright, Boss?&quot; he asks, and the Pancham gives a thumbs-up before curiously eyeing the buckets Jason and Buizel were holding. The Trainer follows Boss' gaze and nods towards them, &quot;The Master asked us to grab some water from the lake before our training began. I don't think I could carry four full buckets at once, though. I know it's a bit of a bummer, but can I count on you to help?&quot;<br />
<br />
Boss listens to Jason's explanation, his face forming a little frown as he shares the sentiment. Ultimately, however, he nods and waders over to pick up the pails that Jason set down. Hoisting them over his shoulders, he gives Jason a <i>&quot;let's go!&quot;</i> gesture and begins to head down the path, letting Buizel take the lead since it likely knew the lake area much better than they did. Jason's smile returns, and he puts Boss' ball away before he follows after them. With everyone working together, maybe this won't be as much of a chore, after all.</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: plum"><b>Raves:</b> More than talking about yourself, you really enjoy talking about your Pokemon, which is sweet, really. You have a reputation in Fizzytopia for being difficult to approach, but Menefer doesn't see it. He sees your wanderlust, your intelligence, your caring nature and connection to the world around you and no amount of grinning and playfulness from the gang around you will change that.<br />
<br />
Menefer appeals to you for help, but you're too busy losing yourself in the wonder of his eyes and the appeal of his lips to respond. You're very embarrassed when you remember yourself, and even the other seems to meekly chuckle in reply, as if he's finally beginning to notice how weird you're acting. “It's okay.” He comforts anyway, intrigued as to who you're going to introduce next. Out comes a Sandshrew, and your awkwardness falls away to reveal the practical and quick-thinking trainer side. Thank the gods! “Oh, that's a beautiful name, Glasspine. Although Glass does make me think of an Alolan Sandshrew-- you know, like a pine tree covered in snow.” He offers an alternate angle to your own image. “Can you all offer some help to Glasspine, too? Nuhuko is doing his part.”<br />
<br />
Ammie shakes her head 'no', and proceeds to make as much of a kissing gesture as her zipper will allow, arms outstretched to the Lunatone as if to impress such kisses upon them. Menefer sighs, hand to his head, looking a bit embarrassed himself now. “I-- I'm sorry. Ramses, surely you...?” He trailed off desperately. Thankfully the Solrock does his bit, using his psychic powers to shift the sprays of rock and dirt away and to pull at the ground; aiding in Glasspine's dig. Eventually the two of them are working at opposite sides, seeming to dig in a square shape. It soon becomes obvious why – they're digging up what looks to be a huge box; solid and muddy brown in colour but engraved with golden heiroglyphs that you couldn't hope to decipher. A big smile pulls at Menefer's lips, and even Ammie is distracted from her antics, the pair of them giddy with excitement. No wonder – you certainly hadn't expected a find such as this!<br />
<br />
“Giratina roars... Look at that. It's beautiful.” Menefer breathes. There's practically a small crater where the team have been digging the thing up, and he moves in for a closer look, the Banette floating beside him as if to offer a hand incase he slipped. Or you think so, anyway, because it just looks permanently menacing. “It's more beautiful than I could imagine, I... Here. Alex, I think this is how we open it...” On one side of the cube, there were two hand-shaped dips. Menefer steadies himself, holding partially onto his ghost, and he's looking at you seriously, like the world depends upon you.<br />
<br />
“I think you should do it. Be the one to open it, I mean.” Menefer said, “We might not have found this without you, and you did offer your time... And it would mean a lot to me. To share this moment with you-- sorry. That's cheesy... Or we could do it together?”<br />
<br />
What do you do?<br />
<br />

<br />
<b>TKF:</b> It wasn't that Billy's first assumption was that you would immediately take off, but he was presenting the option to you. You were an outsider, and if Pokemon were losing their minds and taking it out on whatever they set eyes on, that wasn't a danger that most people wanted to entertain. You, however, were different. You knew that there were more souls than the mere living here, and that in the future, this meadow would send them all to the new world. Every flower respresented a chance to reborn, and you couldn't let that be destroyed. Billy smiled faintly at you, glad for your assistance.<br />
<br />
“Get everything and everyone else out of here that you can.” Billy told the girl, gradually releasing her, “We'll go and do what we can up there.”<br />
“Just be careful.” The tearful girl said, nodding, and Billy and Megara ran after you both.<br />
<br />
What you both saw over the hill was, as the girl had worded it, complete chaos. It was frankly a warzone: wild and captured Pokemon alike, throwing themselves at each other with no mercy or hesitation. The grass was a state, some trees had even been taken down and the flowers didn't even need describing at this stage. They were a sad state compared to before, and things were only going to get worse the longer this went on. Worst of all, in the mayhem, you could see Grotle and Bayleef taking part. Love did not conquer all. They were attacking each other. Trainers were trying to return their Pokemon with mixed results, beams of red and other colours sometimes dodged or interrupted by something other than their target.<br />
<br />
“We need to get the trainer's Pokemon to safety if we can't break the spell.” Billy said. Megara had already joined in the fray, using her vine whips to try and pull an angry Sandslash back before it could dive underground and escape its trainer once more – and further damage the meadow. “It looks like Pokemon that weren't lured in are resisting it, but I don't know where the source is. Maybe if we can stop it, we can stop all of this, too – or stop it from getting worse.”<br />
<br />

</blockquote><span style="color: plum">The Sandshrew's appearance and name once again were to the positive vibes of Menefer, the cute guy complimenting the name and the comparisons to the alolan variant, while posturing to his own pokemon for support. With the ground type honed and ready, the claws struck the earth as he started to dig, Ramses offering psychic support as the helping hand from Nuhuko appeared to give the Sandshrew a second wind whenever he appeared to slow down a little, all the while Alex stood back, reflecting on the words. &quot;I hadn't quite thought of that one. He got his name based solely off wordplay, with glass being derived from sand and spines being present on Sandslash...which admittedly Glass has been holding off on evolving. I feel he's just waiting for the right moment,&quot; he explained, before noticing the two tunneling pokemon were at opposite ends and digging something in a square shape.<br />
<br />
Alex had almost expected them to run into a miffed Trapinch or other ground-dwelling wild pokemon, but the massive box they uncovered was something different. Golden symbols engraved on it, runes he couldn't decipher with his own knowledge, to his mild chagrin, but what really sealed the deal on the discovery was the smile on Menefer's face, the man enamoured with the box. This was certainly something unique, though he couldn't tell quite whether that was rock or ancient wood on the shell of the box. As the man descended the impromptu crater the group had made, Ammie giving him some support if he lost his footing, he pointed out its beauty and looked at a side of the box, where two dips shaped like hands lay. Still atop the crater, the offer Menefer made on opening the box had him, and the thought of sharing this moment with him...oh gods, did he actually say that?<br />
<br />
Alex blushed much more visibly at the statement as he carefully descended the crater, Nothung standing atop to keep an eye out for anything while Nuhuko hovered overhead, eyes aglow as they helped keep Alex steady. Reaching the box, he looked over it with a small smile, and turned to the handsome man. &quot;Uh...well, we both found it together, and looking at it, the box does seem pretty heavy for one person to open...&quot; he murmured, looking into Menefer's eyes, &quot;and we don't know what's in it either. While it could be something amazing, there's also the chance we accidentally dug up an old king's tomb and there's a mummy inside, but opening it with you would be great. I mean, we did work together to find this, so both of us should share the honour of opening something as beautiful as you...&quot;<br />
<br />
He hadn't realised quite what he had said, given his fixation on Menefer's eyes, but with a nod Alex readied himself, placing one hand at the side of the box and his other towards the dip, looking at Menefer and hoping for the same, while the Lunatone floated, intrigued by the hieroglyphics. They were old, surely they could have a quick study while those two lovebirds were performing an awkward dance of opening this thing.</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: plum"><b>Raves:</b> Thankfully only your heart had fallen, and not the rest of you, because it would have been even more of an embarrassing situation than the one you had planted yourself in. Menefer caught your eyes for a moment as if surprised by what you had said, but then he looked down and bashfully chuckled – that didn't seem like a bad reaction? Shyly, he moved some of his long mane from his face, eyes following your feet as they trudged over to the box. His gaze lifted, and he saw you with one hand at the ready. He seemed taken aback once again, even though you had voiced your suggestion, and then he laughed again.<br />
<br />
“No, I think it still requires one person to open it. Here. Like this.” Menefer moved behind you, arms slipping past so that he could take your hands. The gesture made you shiver for more reasons than one: his skin was cold to the touch, hands not as soft as they might first appear, but not unpleasant to hold. He steered your hands into place, palms down into the slots, Menefer's hands above yours. You could feel his hair tickle your skin, you were both so close...<br />
<br />
The box made some noises, as if something was moving in a deep and distant cavern, and the hieroglyphs began to glow a dark purple. There was a sudden, sharp sensation against both palms as if you had just been pricked – certainly enough to draw a bit of blood. It was only then that the box began to open, the top showing its secrets, piece by piece the top sliding open. You get a bad feeling. Your Pokemon get a bad feeling. The other Pokemon look nothing short of monstrously excited.<br />
<br />
Menefer releases you carefully, checking to make sure you still have balance before he attempts to lean into the crate. There are various things in there, buried in sand, and Menefer is quick to root through. He drops a few things outside of it, including a Razor Fang, before finally picking out what interests him. His Banette looks like he hit the jackpot. It's a purple orb, swirling with ominous colours.<br />
<br />
“It' was really here, and we found it... Finally.” Menefer breathed, voice intense, almost lustful. He sets his eyes on you and offers a hand. “And I found it because of you, Alex. Thank you, so much, for everything. I can't tell you how much this means to me, to my family, to so many people-- it has quite a story. I can tell you if you like, but first-- here.”<br />
<br />
He seems to have totally forgotten the rest of the bounty in his outpouring of emotion. Maybe that means it's all yours? But right now, Menefer's holding out a hand expectantly, brown eyes intense and yet ever so soft as they long for you. Whatever dark aura that orb has, Menefer seems entirely oblivious to it. Maybe it's just in your head, or maybe that thing is holding him more than he's holding it. What do you do...?</span></div>
