<span style="color: plum">As you and your pokemon came through the wall, the rest of the illusion broke, the other caverns you had gone down were well, all a part of this big chamber. You could still see the rubble of the collapse from where you encountered the Cubone and Zorua, but it looked like it had glass walls around it.<br />
<br />
But you can also see that the Magma pit and other cavern where Mayvis and Matthew were as well. The Rock Tomb your dusk Lyconroc used to trap them was almost all blasted away, and the duo were racing through out the maze of glass walls, which probably to them was cavern walls still.<br />
The former cavern with heat coming out of it, was a magma pit alright, but as you looked on to it, you realized you could've never flown over it because there was a invisible glass barrier, and it would have been extremely hard to regain balance with out touching the lava pit.<br />
<br />
But how did Krelia jump down from above? Your eye's travel back to where she was in the former dead end. Ah! There was a glass landing pad, or walkway over hanging the maze, in fact there was an over hang looking down into all the caverns. Another question popped into your mind, where had the zorua gone to go get her? Soon enough your answer became clear as you ran up a glass staircase with Krelia and the two pokemon following her. Up at the top of the staircase and maze was a true cavern entrance. This is where Krelia and the pokemon where heading.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Mayvis and Matthew slowed down to a stop outside the main cavern where you ran into the wall.<br />
You couldn't hear what they were saying, as they glass blocked most of the noise coming in and going out.<br />
But you saw that they were starting to feel the cavern walls. The zorua was right, they will soon find out about this illusion maze.<br />
You put on a burst of speed and got up to the top and ran into the cavern.<br />
<br />
Inside, there was a HUGE as shuckle battlefield, and Krelia was racing over it to the other end.<br />
&quot; I Must Stop them here, please join me as I only brought two pokemon with me. After we defeat them I will explain why I had to stop them okay?&quot; Krelia said, puffing as she got to the rectangle marked where trainers had to stand in a fight, at least for a battlefield like this.<br />
<br />
Will you join her in the fight? <br />
What will you do?</span>

The true intricacy of the illusion was revealed to Jayson once they were inside the large arena. What was this doing below a mountain? It all seemed very odd, surely Krelia had not made this all herself? As they watched on anxiously, they saw the pair of crooks, Mavis and Matthew, finally realise that there were illusions at work here. The pair would soon be open them and Krelia knew as well as he that the only way they were going to stop them was with force. Jayson joined the stranger on the far side of the arena. Fenrir and Genghis prepared themselves, they knew this was going to be a tough fight for them. The young Larvitar climbed down from the Dusk Lycanroc's back, a small tremor of fear ran through the Rock type. Fenrir gives him a reassuring look, they were in this together. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fenrir set a <b>Stealth Rock </b>at the entrance and <b>Snarl </b>at the pair of Pokemon as they enter the arena. Genghis give them your best <b>Leer</b> to intimidate them.&quot; If they could unsettle the pair early, they might just stand a chance. If Krelia added two Pokemon of her own to the fight, the numbers advantage would also be their's. He felt like they would need the advantage, as the pair of Rock type's he was using would be completely outmatched. &quot;If you can help weaken them in any way that would be appreciated&quot;, Jayson turned to Krelia, &quot;if we can reduce their stats we can try and expose some weaknesses.&quot; Looking back to his Pokemon, Jayson issued a couple more orders. &quot;Fenrir I want you to get an early <b>Super Fang</b>, in on the Mega Swampert. Genghis try to remain mobile, stick to targeting the Gastrodon with <b>Dark Pulse </b>and <b>Earth Power</b>.&quot; [color]</span></div>

Krelia looked at you and nodded and somehow she pulled out another Pokeball and tossed both of them up into the air.<br />
Solembum and a Delphox with black fur instead of red appeared on the battlefield.<br />
A Fire-type!!! Seriously?<br />
She looks at you and your face, then rolls her eyes. &quot;You'll see.&quot; She says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arya, <b>Sunny day</b> then follow it up with <b>Will-o-wisp</b>, then use <b>Confide</b>! Solembum <b>Attract</b> on the Gastradon, then follow it up with <b>Charm</b>, then with <b>Taunt</b>!&quot;<br />
Interesting moves, but they still need to land in order for it to work.<br />
<br />
At the moment the commands were given, Mayvis and Matthew entered the cavern with their two pokemon, Mega Swampert, and Gastradon. Your pokemon jump into action and fire off the moves you told them to use, Krelia's were not far behind yours too.<br />
The <b>Stealth Rock </b>hit them, as well as the <b>Snarl</b> and <b>Leer </b>the two moves blasted them back a little, but Mayvis and Matthew were quick to recover, shouting off moves. But, you couldn't hear what they were calling out their voices blending with each other, and hiding what they were saying. That didn't matter because it was clear what they used.<br />
A giant <b>Muddy Wave</b> was racing towards all of your and Krelia's pokemon. The <b>Sunny day</b> Krelia set up a moment ago would weaken it a bit, but will that bit be enough? You weren't sure.<br />
<br />
Just as the wave was nearly upon you, it seemed to hit a wall and part around Your pokemon. But what!?!<br />
How? You and Krelia turn and look at each other with confused looks, as neither of you had used protection moves? You both look behind you to Zorua and Cubone, and both of the little pokemon seemed to be using <b>Detect</b> the fighting type protect move.<br />
Wow.<br />
&quot;<i>Hurry up, Cuie and I can't keep this up forever</i>&quot;<br />
The Zorua looked at you, and there was a fierce look in its eyes like it hated these two goons.<br />
<br />
Something clicked in your head, Krelia said they were abandoned from their trainers as babies because of their lameness and telepathy, but they still look to be young, not really grown much to be considered older, as they have only been here for a month, like Krelia. Mayvis and Matthew were the ones who had abandoned them. They were the original trainers for both the Cubone and Zorua.<br />
Your blood boiled within you. And you turned back to the battlefield, determined to beat these two.<br />
<br />
Fenrir, jumped into action, hitting Swampert with the Super Fang, while Genghis got a hit with Earth Power, the Dark Pulse had missed. Krelia's pokemons' moves landed, and you supposed that would help greatly, in the long run, should this match be drawn out.<br />
<br />
What are your next moves?<br />

Just as the wave was nearly upon you, it seemed to hit a wall and part around Your pokemon. But what!?!<br />
How? You and Krelia turn and look at each other with confused looks, as neither of you had used protection moves? You both look behind you to Zorua and Cubone, and both of the little pokemon seemed to be using <b>Detect</b> the fighting type protect move.<br />
Wow.<br />
&quot;<i>Hurry up, Cuie and I can't keep this up forever</i>&quot;<br />
The Zorua looked at you, and there was a fierce look in its eyes like it hated these two goons.<br />
<br />
Something clicked in your head, Krelia said they were abandoned from their trainers as babies because of their lameness and telepathy, but they still look to be young, not really grown much to be considered older, as they have only been here for a month, like Krelia. Mayvis and Matthew were the ones who had abandoned them. They were the original trainers for both the Cubone and Zorua.<br />
Your blood boiled within you. And you turned back to the battlefield, determined to beat these two.<br />
<br />
Fenrir, jumped into action, hitting Swampert with the Super Fang, while Genghis got a hit with Earth Power, the Dark Pulse had missed. Krelia's pokemons' moves landed, and you supposed that would help greatly, in the long run, should this match be drawn out.<br />
<br />
What are your next moves?</span>

The battle had begun and Jayson was already thankful for the assistance of Krelia's Pokemon, as well as the two abandoned younglings that he now realised once belonged to Matthew and Mayvis. They'd weakened the Mega Swampert and Gastrodon to some degree, but mostly from a strategical standpoint by lowering their stats and ability to deal damage. Jayson was thankful for the Sunny Day, he had no idea how it was working inside and underground, but it was the only thing stopping the abuse of Water moves to quickly annihilate his Rock type Pokemon. The two Water and Ground type Pokemon, Swampert and Gastrodon only had one weakness, one that would be hard to exploit. Genghis looked at him, the little Larvitar was eager to show off his hidden talent. &quot;We have to be careful Genghis, you'll probably only get one shot and we have to make sure it counts, not to mention it will leave you taxed.&quot; Jayson looked at his opponents. The Swampert would be hard to contain, but the Gastrodon was certainly the more exposed of the pair. A plan came to mind. &quot;Fenrir trap the Gastrodon in a <b>Rock Tomb</b>, Genghis once it is trapped hammer it with a <b>Frenzy Plant</b>!&quot; The Larvitar smiled with delight, it was his time to show off. &quot;Fenrir while Genghis recovers, do your best to <b>Counter</b> any attacks that comes his way. Krelia can you and your Pokemon try and keep the Swampert occupied? It would certainly be beneficial. Jayson gave a look to the Cubone and Zorua, the two young Pokemon sure were determined to be rid of their former trainers. </span></div>

While you were busy with choosing your pokemons orders, the duo launched another attack at you and Krelia, It was another Muddy Water wave. Why they were doing that didn't make sense, However, it did wash away the Stealth Rock you set up, luckily your pokemon jumped out of the way and continued their assault on the Gastradon. Pinning it with the Rock Tomb and Frenzy Plant. It was super effective, however, it didn't finish off the Gastradon, though it looked severely weakened by the attack.<br />
Mayvis screamed &quot;NOOOOO!&quot; she looked at you, and threw another Pokeball out, this time the pokemon took you by surprise, for it was a Spiritomb.<br />
&quot;Shadow Ball!&quot; Mayvis screamed, pointing at you and your pokemon. The shadowy ball flew towards you and your pokemon, Counter couldn't save you from this move.<br />
<br />
Just as it was gonna hit your Dusk Lyconroc and Larvitar, it was hit by another Shadow Ball, this one came from Krelia's Meowth. You hadn't heard her call out the move, but she was busy pulling a Z-ring on and locking a Grassium Z onto it. Her Meowth had a paw on the Delphox, but the other paw was pointed at the Spiritomb. Huh, it acted all on its own.<br />
<br />
The Delphox of Krelia's was gathering sunlight in from its previous Sunny Day move, It looked like Krelia was going to Bloom Doom the Swampert of Matthew's. Good.<br />
Solembum was using Helping Hand, to power up the Solar Beam that was going to be turned into Bloom Doom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lets Go Areya, BLOOM DOOM!&quot; Krelia finished the dance for using the Grassium Z and had a smile on her face, as Areya fired off the Z-Move.<br />
<br />
A Direct Hit!!!! The Swampert stood no chance against that move and got fried on the spot. The swampert fell forward with a thud, unconscious.<br />
Matthew glared at Krelia, withdrew Swampert, and sent out a Venamoth, Which used Powder upon leaving the Pokeball.<br />
<br />
The battle was going well, one pokemon down, and it looked like only three more to go. You hoped at least.<br />
Another grass type move or any other kind of move should finish off. You and Krelia had the upper hand for the moment. But for how long.<br />
<br />
What are your next moves?<br />

Their planned combo was pulled off, much to Jayson's delight, although the Gastrodon still seemed to be hanging on. Krelia had made quick work of the Mega Swampert however, abusing the intense sunlight to power a devastating Bloom Doom. It didn't surprise Jayson that Krelia possessed a Z Crystal, it wouldn't surprise him if she had multiple. The strange woman seemed to possess a great deal of strength and experience, she certainly wasn't someone Jayson would want to get on the bad side of. He'd been hoping that Matthew and Mayvis would only have one Pokemon each, but it didn't take long for Matthew to replace his fallen Swampert with a Venomoth. Jayson smiled, this would be much easier to handle. <br />
<br />
&quot;Krelia could you get Solembum to Taunt the Venomoth?&quot; The last thing they needed was a bunch of poisoned Pokemon. &quot;Fenrir finish the Gastrodon with a <b>Sucker Punch </b>then turn onto the Venomoth with a <b>Stone Edge</b>. Genghis I hope you enjoyed your time recovering because it is time to go back on the offensive. Make sure the Gastrodon is down for the count with an <b>Earth Power</b>, before helping target the Venomoth with an <b>Ancient Power</b>.&quot; It was a simple plan but they had to abuse their type advantage while they could. Once the Gastrodon was down, Mayvis would likely call on another unknown Pokemon, that could easily put them back on the ropes again. The quicker these two were disposed of, the better they all would be. Maybe then Jayson would get a full explanation about this whole situation. </span></div>

&quot;He does as he pleases normally, but in extreme emergencies like now, he will listen to others, if only for a while.&quot; Krelia spoke, as she pulled off the grassium-z tucking it in her hand bag, the was an audible clank and there was echo, as if that bag was lager on the inside than on the outside.<br />

However, the Venomoth recovered fast, dodging the <b>Stone Edge</b>, Matthew called out &quot;<b>Venoshock</b> Now!&quot; While Mayvis Spirittomb dealt with Areya and Solembum's combined attacks, Flicking in and out of it's Odd Keystone to avoid the <b>Fire Blast </b>and <b>Pay Day, </b>Krelia was ordering them to use.<br />
<br />
On the other side of the arena, where no one could see them, Cubone and Zorua were creeping along a wall edge, shuffling closer and closer to their former owners. The Zorua was casting an illusion of them being stalactites that were everywhere, Effectively hiding the two from everyone's sight.<br />
</span><br />
Suddenly, the Spiritomb switched targets, firing off three consecutive Shadow Balls at your pokemon, Two hitting Fenrir, one hitting Genghis. The blast from the sudden attack, surprised your pokemon, though it didn't hurt them too badly. The Venomoth, on the other hand, fired off a Bug Buzz at the Delphox and Meowth, hitting both as they both were standing close to each other.<br />
Areya took neutral damage, thanks to her Fire typing, but Solembum took the brunt of the blow, staggering him off his feet a little.<br />
<br />
Ouch. Hmm.<br />

Even those with barely a sense of magic could feel the alarming amount of energy storming through the trees and gnarling them in mangled and twisted form. The forest was somewhat alarming to those seeing it from afar, just a blackened mess of gnarled branches, twisting every which way and making what appeared to be a large, looming monster. <br />
<br />
But, little of this was of concern to lovers. Despite the twisted forest, deep within it were two trees, twisted together as the forever preserved forms of a princess and her commoner lover. Two people who could never be properly together in life... but now eternally embracing one another in death. It was beautiful, and couples from all over the Pokemon world were compelled to visit the spot with their lover. This was no different in your case, although your loving circumstance may be slightly different from most. But, perhaps that's why you felt so compelled to enter this forest. You felt akin to the princess and the commoner, a love that was not understood by most but still as deep as anyone else's. It was like you and Laugh. A human and a Pokemon, but so deeply entwined to one another that your love was far deeper than most people could understand. <br />
<br />
As you walked together, hand in hand, you pointed out various trees to Laugh. She seemed pleased by your observations, listening intently to everything you had to say. It was a passionate exchange, and you felt your heart brimming with happiness. You could barely contain your primal desire to sit under the trees with her, and your were determined to do so. You kept up your pace, knowing full well that you'd make it eventually... so long as there were no hiccups along the way. <br />
<br />
As you continued walking, you could feel... something within the trees. Something watching you. But when you looked around... all you could see was the many gnarled trees and various stumps that populated the forest. Although you tried to shake off the feeling, you couldn't bare it, turning around and staring at a stump that was radiating some sort of energy. As you bent down, your hand slipping out of Laugh's hand, the stump suddenly lit up with two large red eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tump!&quot; It screeched, muttering something in an ancient language at you before you were slapped with a barrage of <i><b>seeds</b></i>. Your head slowly began to feel heavy, filled with <i><b>worry</b></i> as you watched a ghost rise out of the stump. <br />

</blockquote><span style="color: SeaGreen">The day was a happy one indeed, for both Terri and Laugh. The couple made their way through the forest, the Froslass listening intently to everything Terri was saying, the two of them having such a good time with each other. Neither one of them could wait until they got to the trees, and could sit beneath them...<br />
<br />
And yet, as they forged ahead, something kept gnawing at Terri, and she couldn't work out what. Figuratively, of course- were something actually physically gnawing on her, figuring out the source ought to be absurdly easy. Something seemed to be watching them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you sense that, though?&quot; Terri murmured.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>I do,</i>&quot; confirmed Laugh. &quot;<i>But what is it?</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
Terri looked around, her eyes falling upon a strange stump that was positively radiating energy of some sort. &quot;Hm,&quot; she murmured. Laugh wasn't so sure this was a good idea, and on some level, neither did Terri. But, as has been the case so many times before, Terri's curiosity prevailed. She bent down to examine the stump closer... and a pair of red eyes lit up on the stump itself! And the next thing Terri knew, she was smacked in the head with a barrage of odd seeds. The seeds themselves didn't hurt too much, though Terri couldn't help but notice that her head was feeling a bit heavy now. Oh, Arceus, what were those seeds doing to her?! It dimly occurred to her that it wasn't like her to worry so easily, and yet, this realization only intensified said worry. As the ghostly figure rose up out of the stump, Terri's breathing quickened, to the point where she didn't even think about digging out her Pokédex. So many worrying thoughts ran through her mind, all of them uninvited and unwelcome, not that that mattered to them in the slightest. What did this Phantump do to her? What would it do to them now? What if her father was right all along about the outside world and about humanity? What if... what if Laugh left her?<br />
<br />
Terri had let out a small, shuddering gasp at that last thought, and it was with no small amount of concern that Laugh was regarding her. Considering what she'd seen so far, and Terri's reaction, the Froslass realized this must be the work of a Worry Seed attack. Gently, Laugh took hold of Terri's hand, which prompted Terri to look at the Ice/Ghost-type. The look Laugh was giving was a reassuring one, which, while not enough to shake off the Worry Seed's effects, did at least keep the worst of Terri's nightmarish worries at bay.<br />
<br />
With this established, Laugh turned to face the Phantump, floating protectively between it and her girlfriend. &quot;<i>Why have you done this to my beloved?</i>&quot; the Froslass asked, her tone non-confrontational. Indeed, Laugh was hoping this could be resolved without violence- something she and Terri tended to have in common, in fact. However, also like Terri, if a violent approach was inevitable, Laugh was not unprepared. If the Phantump's response was another sudden attack, Laugh was prepared to block it with <b>Protect</b>. And as far as fighting back went, Laugh was willing to let loose the frigid fury of her <b>Ice Beam</b>, or else channel her ghostly strength into a <b>Shadow Ball</b>. And all the while, Terri tried to calm herself down, tried to take comfort in Laugh's efforts to defend her. Maybe she'd even clear her mind enough to be able to actually think about the situation, if she was lucky.</span></div>

&quot;The moment man devoured the fruit of knowledge, he sealed his fate... Entrusting his future to the cards, man clings to a dim hope. Yes, the Arcana is the means by which all is revealed...&quot; Nyx Avatar (Persona 3)<br />
<br />
Once a simple place where new trainers were sent to learn the basics of adventuring, with the vast changes to Fizzytopia the Arcane Realm seemed to have faded from existence. Though gone, it was never forgotten by the bitter trainers who were forced into spending what felt like years in that simplistic place. A place where no growth was truly given, and only stagnation existed. Yet, when the realm disappeared, all were freed from their restraints and truly allowed to begin anew. <br />

Now, it seems that the Arcane Realm has resurfaced in Fizzytopia. Showing up where the old Arcane Realm use to be, this new one is vastly different then the one that the denizens of Fizzytopia are use to. Now truly a place of magic and mystery, it says the very land itself is influenced by the “cards”/ What these cards are, and what they refer to nobody particularly knows. The only thing that is certain, though, is that this Arcane Realm is teeming with life, and has infinite possibilities for adventure.</span><br />
<div style="text-align: center">&#8203;</div><br />
<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-family: 'TimesNewRoman'"><b><span style="font-size: 26px">The Forest of Wands</span></b></span>&#8203;</div><span style="font-family: 'TimesNewRoman'"><span style="color: SeaGreen"><br />
<br />
Once monikered the Forest of Adventure, the Forest of Wands has been changed and twisted by the surplus of magical energy flowing through the Arcane Realm. THe once simplistic woods are now a labyrinth where magic flows through the roots of the trees and a sense of dread and whimsy encompass all who enter. Though, it was possible that this was here the entire time, like everything else, and the deep magic that flows through these woods caused trainers to dream of the much more simplistic Arcane Realm. <i>(Please reply in SeaGreen)</i><br />
<br />
<b><u>VII. Chariot Inn</u></b> - An inn and tavern for travelers located at the mouth of the woods, named for being a common resting spot for knights on their patrols through the kingdom. Travelers from far and wide make their stop here, either preparing to brave the forest or just to experience the Arcane Realm in full. A variety a favors can be done here for those staying here, or it can serve as a stepping stone to travel into the woods. Though, it is ill-advised to leave the inn during the night. Grim things are said to happen.</span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: SeaGreen">Considering the choice of terminology involved in the local names in this region, was it of any surprise that Chroma would crop up in these lands eventually? Between the <i>Arcane</i> Realm, the Forest of <i>Wands</i>, the <i>Magician's</i> Hamlet, and the <i>Heirophant's</i> Crypt, as well as the tarot theme that permeated even the areas without callouts to the mystic arts in their names, it ultimately proved too difficult for the young woman to resist paying the realm a visit.<br />
<br />
Just getting to the place had been a tiresome journey, so heading right into the woods as soon as she arrived seemed like a poor decision. Thankfully, this was sort of occasion the Forest of Wands was prepared for- between Legere the abra's extrasensory perception and a plain old map she had picked up along the way, it wasn't very hard for her to find the Chariot Inn in the slightest! Sure, the name sounded like it would've been a better fit in the Kingdom of Swords than the Forest of Wands, but that was a minor detail compared to escaping having to set up the tent in the dark again.<br />
<br />
Of course, inns like these are prone to picking more than their fair share of oddball travelers, especially when they serve as a resting stop to and from a places such as the Hermit's Mire and Fortune's Woods. Would her stay be a vibrantly colorful one this evening, or had she perhaps arrived when it had more blandly mundane patrons? At this point, only time would tell.</span></div>

<span style="color: plum"><span style="color: plum">Solembum, hearing you, rolled its eyes but <b>Taunted </b>the Venomoth regardless of what ever that cat thought.<br />
&quot;He does as he pleases normally, but in extreme emergencies like now, he will listen to others, if only for a while.&quot; Krelia spoke, as she pulled off the grassium-z tucking it in her hand bag, the was an audible clank and there was echo, as if that bag was lager on the inside than on the outside.<br />
<br />
Your Dusk Lyconroc's <b>Sucker Punch </b>landed, as well as Genghis's <b>Earth Power </b>effectively finishing off the Gastradon, and striking the Venomoth.<br />
However, the Venomoth recovered fast, dodging the <b>Stone Edge</b>, Matthew called out &quot;<b>Venoshock</b> Now!&quot; While Mayvis Spirittomb dealt with Areya and Solembum's combined attacks, Flicking in and out of it's Odd Keystone to avoid the <b>Fire Blast </b>and <b>Pay Day, </b>Krelia was ordering them to use.<br />
<br />
On the other side of the arena, where no one could see them, Cubone and Zorua were creeping along a wall edge, shuffling closer and closer to their former owners. The Zorua was casting an illusion of them being stalactites that were everywhere, Effectively hiding the two from everyone's sight.<br />
</span><br />
Suddenly, the Spiritomb switched targets, firing off three consecutive Shadow Balls at your pokemon, Two hitting Fenrir, one hitting Genghis. The blast from the sudden attack, surprised your pokemon, though it didn't hurt them too badly. The Venomoth, on the other hand, fired off a Bug Buzz at the Delphox and Meowth, hitting both as they both were standing close to each other.<br />
Areya took neutral damage, thanks to her Fire typing, but Solembum took the brunt of the blow, staggering him off his feet a little.<br />
<br />
Ouch. Hmm.<br />
<span style="color: plum">What are your next moves?</span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: plum"><br />
The Spiritomb presented them with an issue. The Ghost/Dark typing was renowned for its lack of weakness, it hadn't been until recently when Fairy types became recognised that the typing gained its first weakness. The only issue was that Fairy type moves were often few and far between, none of the Pokemon at his disposal had access to the type. Assessing the Spiritomb, Jayson watched as the spectre retreated into its stone to dodge the attacks coming from Krelia's Pokemon. It was then that he realised that the stone was a double edged sword. While it made the Spiritomb hard to hit, its connection to the stone could easily be exploited if one was clever enough.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fenrir, <b>Rock Tomb </b>the Venomoth to help pin it down, while Genghis <b>Screeches </b>at the Spiritomb.&quot; Jayson looked to Krelia, &quot;let's trade dance partners, you take the Venomoth while we bury this Spiritomb.&quot; Jayson dug into his pocket, selecting his <b>Groundium Z</b> crystal and slotting it into his Z Gauntlet. He looked to Fenrir, the Dusk Lycanroc had practised this move many a time but this was the first time he'd be using it in battle. &quot;Let's go Fenrir!&quot; The Lycanroc begins <b>stomping </b>on the ground, working himself into a <b>tantrum.</b> Jayson begins to work his way through the dance, moving with swiftness and elegance as the crystal and Fenrir begin to glow, the power growing. Fenrir begins to charge forward, heading straight for the Spiritomb, or more preciously, the stone the Spiritomb is bound to. &quot;<b>TECTONIC RAGE!</b> Bury that stone beneath the mountain, the Spiritomb along with it!&quot; Jayson hoped that not only would this leave the Spiritomb out of contention, he hoped it would distract Matthew and Mayvis from the Cubone and Zorua who were edging their way towards them. Jayson sensed what they had in mind and he liked it. </span></div>

&quot;Sounds good to me Jayson,&quot; Krelia said with a small smile, Turning to her pokemon she called out<br />
&quot;<b>Ice Beam, Flamethrower</b> lets go now!&quot;<br />
Arya and Solembum fired off the flames and ice beams, targeting the Venomoth, who had nimbly avoided nearly all of the rocks from the <b>Rock Tomb.</b><br />
The<b> Ice Beam</b> of Solembums hit a wing, freezing part of it, causing it to drag its left wing down<br />
&quot;Again!&quot; Krelia shouted, and this time, thanks to the drag, both moves landed a direct hit, Knocking it unconscious and down to the ground, freezing it into the ground where only a Pokeball's return beam could move it.<br />
&quot;YES, good job Arya and Solembum, now help Pin the Spiritomb so Jayson's pokemon can hit it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Upon that command, Arya took up a stance to fire off a <b>Psywave</b> to move the Spiritomb's rock, should it try to move, while Solembum prepared a <b>Dark Pulse</b> to aid that as well.<br />
Meanwhile, Matthew rocked forward, looking dizzy, Mayvis had to distract herself from the battle to hold him up, giving you the opening you need.<br />
<br />
The Contential Crush Stomping Tantrum was ready, and you released your move,<br />
As your move went to crush the Spiritomb, Arya and Solembum fired their moves to pin the Keystone pokemon in place.<br />
<br />
<i><b>CRUNCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!</b></i><br />
<br />
The pokemon didn't move under the stone, and soon the stone holding it down blew up, in the rubble, the Keystone didn't move, it appeared to have fainted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why you mother Shuckle sucker- <i><b>THWUMMPPPP</b></i><br />
Whatever Mayvis was going to say got cut off as Cubone and Zorua landed on their heads, pushing them into the ground and knocking them out as their pokemon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finally. Now I can take care of these two elsewhere,- Krelia walked over and picked up the Venomoths' and the Spiritomb's pokeballs, and recalled them inside. &quot; I must take them away from the mountain via a portal, as I have enough ingredients to do so. Meanwhile, Zorua here will take you to where you need to be to see what I was protecting. I apologize for not being able to do it myself, but these goons need a memory to erase and I only know of one person strong enough to erase this much.&quot;<br />
Krelia pulled several items out of her pouch purse, and began drawing symbols in the air, Seconds later a portal appeared, glowing blue pulsating light. She then hefted both Mayvis and Matthew on her shoulders and walked through her portal.<br />
Her Delphox and Meowth followed soon after she went through and the portal vanished, leaving you alone in the Chamber with your pokemon and the two babies.<br />
<br />
What are you going to do next?<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
Genghis grew three levels, while Fenrir gained two levels, from this battle<br />

Now I can take care of these two elsewhere,- Krelia walked over and picked up the Venomoths' and the Spiritomb's pokeballs, and recalled them inside. &quot; I must take them away from the mountain via a portal, as I have enough ingredients to do so. Meanwhile, Zorua here will take you to where you need to be to see what I was protecting. I apologize for not being able to do it myself, but these goons need a memory to erase and I only know of one person strong enough to erase this much.&quot;<br />
Krelia pulled several items out of her pouch purse, and began drawing symbols in the air, Seconds later a portal appeared, glowing blue pulsating light. She then hefted both Mayvis and Matthew on her shoulders and walked through her portal.<br />
Her Delphox and Meowth followed soon after she went through and the portal vanished, leaving you alone in the Chamber with your pokemon and the two babies.<br />
<br />
What are you going to do next?<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
Genghis grew three levels, while Fenrir gained two levels, from this battle</span>

Cubone and Zorua pulled off their plan without a touch of elegance, knocking their previous trainers unconscious with two quick strikes. Jayson breathed a sigh of relief, while they had gotten on top of the battle, it was almost impossible to tell what other tricks the Matthew and Mayvis may have had up their sleeves. Krelia mentions something a portal and erasing the pairs memories, before quickly disappearing into said portal, leaving Jayson with the Zorua and Cubone. Genghis rushes towards the Cubone, somewhat concerned about the Cubone's wellbeing. Fenrir shook the dust from his fur before looking towards Jayson for further guidance, what exactly were they to do now? Krelia had said that they were protecting something and that the Zorua and Cubone would take them to see it?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Zorua&quot;, Jayson attempted to get the Dark types attention. &quot;Are you able to take us to this thing Krelia was so keen to protect from your old trainers? It must be pretty interesting for her to go to so much effort to keep you safe. Are you and Cubone alright? Would Cubone like a lift? I know he struggles walking and I'm sure Fenrir wouldn't mind caring him around if it makes our journey a little easier.&quot; Genghis and Fenrir had both fought well. This had been Genghis's first real battle and he had held himself really well considering what they were up against. The Larvitar didn't seem too concerned about the brutal fight it had just been through, he'd already shrugged it off and moved on. If this battle was anything to go by, he'd be quite the handful with a bit more experience under his belt. For all he knew the Larvitar would get another shot at battle before long, there was no telling what they would run into when they followed the Zorua to the mysterious object/place/thing.</span></div>

Zorua looked at you, and for a moment he just stared. Why was he doing that? Hmmph, only the Zorua knows. He got up and shook himself. Stretching while he spoke-<br />
&quot;Sure, but in order to do so, we must travel to the top of the mountain. It will be colder out there than in here. Obviously so. While we walk I will talk about what I know about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cubone, on the other hand, shook his head and began walking towards the exit of the mountain behind.<br />
Zorua looked up back at you and spoke directly to you. &quot;Don't take it personally. He's mute. He prefers to get around on his on for the most part, and he likes to build things. Mayvis, who caught him here, broke all of his toys that he built himself and unique pieces of art. I lived with him before we were caught by those two. -<br />
Zorua looked away towards Cubone who was leading the way while you all walked. -&quot; He's strong in his own way, and he feels bad when people help him. He thinks he's taking advantage of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
You walked forward to the cave exit, with Genghis at your right side, and Fenrir on your left. As you got outside, the temperature dropped dramatically, and you noted that it was darker outside, and snowing. Not good if you were to get separated from Zorua and Cubone. Though, as you looked around, it didn't seem too bad here, there wasn't much snow on the ground, just a light coating.<br />
<br />
&quot;It gets deeper and colder further up, do you have a coat you could use? You'll freeze the further you climb.<br />
Its okay if you don't Krelia set up a base not too far from here, with supplies you could use. We will have to go there anyway because Cuie and I need our booties and gear.&quot; The Zorua spoke as he stopped next to you, Cubone, was looking down the mountain, a lost look on its face like it was remembering something. You wondered what it was, but should you ask about it?<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, let's get going.&quot; Zorua set off at an easy pace eastward on the path that you were standing on. To your right is were Zorua was heading, but to your left is where Cubone was looking down to.<br />
Maybe that was a path down to the base of the mountain. A good thing to note if you needed to pick up and run back down in case of an avalanche.<br />
<br />
What will you do next? Continue onward to see what you helped protect?<br />

Following the Zorua and Cubone, Jayson soon found himself outside once more. However, this wasn't the same way they came in. They sent out to investigate the warm tunnels beneath the mountain, they hadn't planned on trekking to the mountains frozen peak. They weren't equipped for the current weather, the chilling cold would quickly consume them if they didn't find something warmer to wear. The Zorua explained that Krelia had a base not too far away, there would likely be something warmer there for them all to wear, because for some reason the Zorua and Cubone also needed clothes? This pair certainly were odd. A lame and mute Cubone and a telepathic Zorua? An odd couple to say the least. What had brought them together? They had no obvious ties to each other, something past have happened for them to become so close, almost like brothers.<br />

Fenrir shook the snow from his fur, while Genghis continued to surge forward through the snow, care free as always. &quot;Alright Zorua, you better lead us to this cabin before we freeze to death out here. Also can't I just fly us up the mountain? Artemis flew me all the way here, I'm sure she wouldn't mind dropping us off at our destination.&quot; Jayson was beginning to wonder whether the mysterious item Krelia was protecting was truly worth the struggle of finding. He had considered leaving but his curiosity was unwavering, he needed to know what it was. A little snow wasn't about to stop him.</span></div>

Some music to set the mood. ^.^</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>Now for the reply.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: plum"><br />
Zorua looked back at you while leading the way, and shook his head.<br />
&quot; No, you'd get shot down by the temple guardians, that is if you didn't freeze first. The higher you fly, the colder it gets. If we follow this pathway, we are less likely to freeze before we make it there. Unless you brought a Charizard with you?&quot;<br />
Zorua had a smug look about himself, the little shucker. Well, he had a point. You didn't bring Balerion with you, you had wanted to do this with a Rock-type primary team. Oh well.<br />
<br />
You followed Zorua, and Cubone to a cave entrance after walking maybe fifty feet. Was this the base Krelia set up here? Apparently so, as both of the small pokemon walked inside the cave. You looked at Fenrir and Genghis. Both of you pokemon looked weary from the battle, and this cold was starting to get to them, yourself as well as a shiver shook you going down your spine. Damn was it cold out here.<br />
<br />
You and your pokemon walked inside the cold looking cave, and as soon as you walked several feet inside, another illusion broke. What was it with illusions in this mountain? Who was making them, and that they were able to hold this long?<br />
On the inside of this base, it was actually much warmer than it looked. Perhaps it was connected to a magma cavern. You let your eyes roam around the base, and noted how plain it was. Some chairs gathered around a table with maps all over it. Something that appeared to be a hot tube, built around a natural hot spring, and some bins.<br />
<br />
Zorua and Cubone were at these bins and were pulling out small clothing articles for themselves and Genghis. Fenrir was sniffing around in the bins for booties his size and soon found some. He brought them to you so you could help him put them on.<br />
<br />
Your eyes kept looking over at the table, as if something was calling out to you, so you walked over to the table. Spread out all over it were maps of the inside of the mountain. One of them depicted a temple located on the outside and the top of the peak. Scribbled along the side of this one were notes.<br />
You leaned down to take a better look, the writing looked rushed and was smeared in places, making it hard to read, but what you could make out was this.<br />
&quot; inside.... ba... farthest.... left..... two.. th.......&quot;<br />
What was this supposed to mean? Was this Krelia's writing? What was she up to?<br />
<br />
You moved that map aside and looked at the next one. This one clearly showed a path marked down in a Huge room. Hmmm.....<br />
You pocketed this map on an impulse, it may help you later on... perhaps inside this &quot;temple&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There are berries here for us to eat Jayson.&quot; Zorua's voice startled you out of the trance you were in.<br />
Oh, Berries? Well, your pokemon could eat them and replenish their energy. Perhaps you could eat some too, and save some for later use.<br />
<br />
<br />
You walked over to the bins, and after a bit of digging, found some winter gear big enough for yourself, and then you grabbed some berries, there were only Sitrus and Leppa berries, to munch on. After you gave some to Fenrir and Genghis. Cubone and Zorua were already munching on some berries.<br />
<br />
<br />
Zorua, after eating his share of berries said<br />
&quot;Are you ready to head out again?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, Are you?<br />
</span><br />
You now have this

Zorua looked back at you while leading the way, and shook his head.<br />
&quot; No, you'd get shot down by the temple guardians, that is if you didn't freeze first. The higher you fly, the colder it gets. If we follow this pathway, we are less likely to freeze before we make it there. Unless you brought a Charizard with you?&quot;<br />
Zorua had a smug look about himself, the little shucker. Well, he had a point. You didn't bring Balerion with you, you had wanted to do this with a Rock-type primary team. Oh well.<br />

You followed Zorua, and Cubone to a cave entrance after walking maybe fifty feet. Was this the base Krelia set up here? Apparently so, as both of the small pokemon walked inside the cave.

On the inside of this base, it was actually much warmer than it looked. Perhaps it was connected to a magma cavern. You let your eyes roam around the base, and noted how plain it was. Some chairs gathered around a table with maps all over it. Something that appeared to be a hot tube, built around a natural hot spring, and some bins.<br />

Your eyes kept looking over at the table, as if something was calling out to you, so you walked over to the table. Spread out all over it were maps of the inside of the mountain.

What was this supposed to mean? Was this Krelia's writing? What was she up to?<br />

You moved that map aside and looked at the next one. This one clearly showed a path marked down in a Huge room. Hmmm.....<br />
You pocketed this map on an impulse, it may help you later on... perhaps inside this &quot;temple&quot;<br />

The base was surprisingly warm, much to the delight of Jayson and his Pokemon. The Zorua and Cubone did their own thing for the most part, collecting their gear and putting it on. Jayson found it a bit weird for Pokemon to have clothing set aside, it was something he mostly associated with people. Fenrir found some boots, they would help keep his feet warm at least. Genghis kitted himself out as well, slipping into a little jacket and wrapping a scarf around his neck. Jayson thought the Larvitar looked ridiculous, but he seemed happy enough and the clothes would help him from freezing as they went higher up the mountain. <br />
<br />
Some maps of the desk caught Jayson's attention, they always did. He always took the opportunity to look over a map, you never knew when they would come in handy. The first map that caught his eye depicted the temple, located at the peak of the mountain. They really had to go all the way to the top? This was certainly going to be taxing. There was some writing around the map as well, scribbled in a haste and almost impossible to decipher, but maybe it would make more sense later. Moving the map to the side, Jayson found another, he had a hunch this one was a map of the temple itself. He pocketed the map on instinct, he might need it later. Zorua directed him to some berries, some were consumed on the spot but he kept some Sitrus Berries for later, they might be useful. When the Zorua asked if he was ready to head out, he simply nodded. &quot;Sure, lets get going.&quot;</span></div>

<br />
&quot;Good, then let's get going, and the peak isn't that far up the mountain. In fact, We will be there soon.&quot;</span></i><span style="color: plum"><br />
<br />
Zorua turned and walked outside, leading you and your pokemon, along with Cubone, up the mountainside.<br />
The snow, while it was cold and a bit deep, it wasn't hard to track through the snow.<br />
Could any pokemon be out here in this snowy peak? Maybe. Ice types, sure.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;The temple at the top houses a special pokemon that awakens from deep slumbers, for a short time, then it falls back into a coma sleep.<br />
The people here worshiped this pokemon and built this temple to protect its sleeping chamber. For if this pokemon were to get captured or controlled, it would mean the end of the world. Well... not exactly.<br />
But it would be bad enough if it happened.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Zorua spoke to you as you walked, telling you about the history of the temple.<br />
Soon enough, even in the snowy dark, you could make out a large structure getting closer and closer.<br />
This had to be the temple, as there wasn't much else out here.<br />
<i><br />
&quot;Now, you'll want to walk carefully and slowly here, the temple guardians are not only pokemon, but enchanted statues brought to life.<br />
These would have shot you out of the sky if you rode on a pokemon and tried to fly up here.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: plum">So thats why you couldn't fly up here, even if it was quicker, you would have had a hard time trying to land, if you could at all.<br />
<br />
You have reached the temple, what is your plan of action?</span><br />

&quot;Good, then let's get going, and the peak isn't that far up the mountain. In fact, We will be there soon.&quot;</span></i><br />
<span style="color: plum"><br />
Zorua turned and walked outside, leading you and your pokemon, along with Cubone, up the mountainside.<br />
The snow, while it was cold and a bit deep, it wasn't hard to track through the snow.<br />
Could any pokemon be out here in this snowy peak? Maybe. Ice types, sure.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;The temple at the top houses a special pokemon that awakens from deep slumbers, for a short time, then it falls back into a coma sleep.</i><br />
<i>The people here worshiped this pokemon and built this temple to protect its sleeping chamber. For if this pokemon were to get captured or controlled, it would mean the end of the world. Well... not exactly.</i><br />
<i>But it would be bad enough if it happened.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Zorua spoke to you as you walked, telling you about the history of the temple.<br />
Soon enough, even in the snowy dark, you could make out a large structure getting closer and closer.<br />
This had to be the temple, as there wasn't much else out here.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Now, you'll want to walk carefully and slowly here, the temple guardians are not only pokemon, but enchanted statues brought to life.</i><br />
<i>These would have shot you out of the sky if you rode on a pokemon and tried to fly up here.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: plum">So thats why you couldn't fly up here, even if it was quicker, you would have had a hard time trying to land, if you could at all.<br />
<br />
You have reached the temple, what is your plan of action?</span></span>

The trek up the mountain wasn't as rough as Jayson had expected. Sure it was cold but it was nothing he hadn't endured before. He'd endured the freezing cold of Scandia, this was almost like a spa compared to those frigid waters. The temple soon came into sight, it certainly was an impressive structure. The Zorua had given him a run down of the temple's purpose. Turns out it was built around a slumbering Pokemon of immense power, world destroying power. A legendary Pokemon for sure, he knew of plenty of legendary Pokemon that were strong enough to rock the world to its core. It made sense to protect a Pokemon like that from people who would want to abuse its power. Was there any real point in trying to get into the temple now that he knew this? Probably not, but getting a glimpse of the Pokemon would certainly be something to talk about. <br />
<br />
Getting inside the temple seemed like it wasn't going to be too straight forward. According to Zorua, the temple guardians were animated Pokemon statues, certainly something he hadn't had to deal with before. They'd have to tread carefully and hope not to set the guardians off. He wondered what triggered them? Would they attack anyone? It seemed like the Zorua had been here before, perhaps they would recognise it and let them all through? He needed more information....<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Zorua, should we be concerned with the statues attacking us? Also, what are the chances that there are traps waiting for us? This seems like the sort of place that would have traps.&quot; Jayson looked towards Fenrir. &quot;Fenrir, keep alert, use <b>Odor Sleuth </b>to sniff out anything out of the ordinary and keep your ears on alert for any odd noises.&quot; They would proceed with caution, the last thing they needed was to get themselves in more trouble.</span></div>

Before Zorua could answer your question, A portal opened up in front of you, with Krelia walking out of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;That won't be nessicairy, There are no traps on the outside of the temple, none that you could sniff out if there were. It would be more likely wards and spell traps.&quot;<br />
She spoke with purpose, and with a finality that made it seem she had been here before, scouting out the for the same supposed traps.<br />
She turned to Zorua and spoke to him. &quot;Thank you for leading Jayson up here Zorua, &quot;<br />
Zorua nodded and shied back close to Cubone.<br />
<br />
Krelia took a moment to stare at you. You could feel a power within her stare, you could feel as if she was much much older than she appeared. Her stare dug through your soul, making you think of memories, of all sorts. Good, bad, Happy, sad.<br />
Whatever she was doing, well... it was scary, but it didn't hurt you.<br />
<br />
She turned and looked away from you, breaking contact with your eyes, and the sudden flow of memories stopped as suddenly as they had been drawn forward.<br />
&quot;I must thank you for assisting me with dealing with Mayvis and Matthew, I have been having trouble with them for a long while, though it is not my job to protect this temple.<br />
My friend, who is now back in her base that you two stopped in by, is the true guardians of this temple. The job was passed down from parent to child for millennia.<br />
She left her post with me in charge, to go collect supplies and new technology so she is not so stranded in her post.&quot;<br />
<br />
Krelia turned and looked at the temple. &quot;I suppose that if you want, we can go meet the fabled pokemon of the temple. It is one of the few Jirachi left in this world.<br />
However, it is nowhere near awakening its still 10 years off, But you may write a wish on its tags if you want.<br />
Krelia looked back at you<br />
<br />
&quot;You are purer of heart than most who come here, not the purest, but we could trust you enough not to abuse the power of a wish that Jirachi could grant.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cubone and Zorua looked back and forth between you and Krelia, watching you two like a tennis match.<br />
<br />
&quot;Another thing. While I am sure my friend will not mind watching over Zorua and Cubone, I am sure the two would like a chance to see the world. I ask you, Cubone and Zorua, Would you like to travel the world?&quot;<br />
Zorua and Cubone looked back and forth between each other...<br />
Krelia looked at you again and asked softly<br />
&quot; I have bonded with both, but I am sure one would like to go with you, who would you chose?, I will take care of the other, But of course this means visits to keep these two in touch with each other. &quot;<br />
<br />
What are your responses?<br />

Krelia soon appeared again, Jayson wondered how exactly she managed to create her portals. Magic for sure, but could something like that be taught and learnt? That didn't really matter right now, what mattered was the information Krelia was giving. The Pokemon within the temple was a Jirachi, a Pokemon Jayson had heard of but never actually seen. If he chose to venture into the temple, he'd be given the opportunity to write a wish on the legend's tag, an opportunity he surely couldn't pass up? As he was about to give his answer, the familiar buzz of his Pokegear drew Jayson's attention away. <br />
<br />
<i>Emergency, need you home immediately! Valka<br />
</i><br />
&quot;Ahh shit&quot; Jayson mumbled, he had to get going. Before he could go however, it seemed he had a choice to make. He'd bonded with both the Zorua and Cubone, he couldn't take both with him, he'd have to chose between them. Zorua was a rare Pokemon and a telepathic one to boot? A Pokemon of its talents would certainly come in handy. However, he couldn't stop thinking about the Cubone. The poor thing was in need of some real support, Jayson knew with a little time and training, he could help it overcome its issues. Looking into the Ground type's eyes he could see the passion, the desire. His choice was made.<br />
<br />
Jayson pulled out a Pokeball and offered it to the Cubone. &quot;Want to come with me little fella?&quot; Jayson turned to Krelia, &quot;I think I can really help this Cubone out, thank you for the offer to go into the temple but it appears I am needed back home. Will I be right to fly off the mountain?&quot;<br />
<br />
(using 1 Pokeball to capture the Cubone!)</span></div>
