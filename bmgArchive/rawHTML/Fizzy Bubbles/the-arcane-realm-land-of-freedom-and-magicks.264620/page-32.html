<b><span style="color: plum">Slash</span></b><span style="color: plum">:<br />
You came here to train, and despite the considerable setback of losing your only Fishing Rod, it seems you got a nice opportunity to practice after all.<br />
<br />
The fisherman (who despite this title seems inclined to catch anything but) has sent out an impressive-looking Octillery, who looks decidedly unimpressed. It actually looks kind of Moody, now that you think about it.<br />
<br />
David remains silent, with his arms crossed. It seems he's letting you have the first swing, which you gladly accept.<br />
<br />
Timburr throws its most menacing stare at Octillery, hoping it'll have some sort of effect, although the octopus seems largely uninterested in the much smaller combatant – as well as in the fight in general. It isn't until your Yamask creeps up from the other side and sneakily lands a blow that the Water Pokemon finally begins to care - however, it's perhaps too late, as the Ghost is quick to follow up its stealthy strike with a point-blank Energy Ball that Octillery <i>definitely</i> doesn't enjoy!<br />
<br />
It is then that David finally cracks a smile and punches the air, as if he’d been waiting for this opening the entire time.<br />
<br />
&quot;... Now! Wrap it!&quot;<br />
<br />
With a sudden boost of speed, no doubt from its rare Ability, Octillery suddenly turns to Timburr as it lunges for its Power-Up Punch and wraps a heavy tentacle around it, immobilizing the fighter! Then, it brings the trapped Timburr close to its mouth-cannon and stares at you defiantly, as if asking &quot;do you feel lucky, punk?&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, do you?</span>

<br />
The battle started pretty quickly. Timburr and Yamask were more than happy to jump into action. Timburr offered a great distraction while rushed it with an astonishing charge. Then Yamask shot a ball of Grassy energy at the Jet Pokemon but Timburr's attempt at a punch was fruitless, as David had his Octillery grapple the small Fighter. It was clear this had been a plan of David the fishless guy's from the moment he issued the challenge.<br />
<br />
It had been surprisingly speedy in doing so, however, and Darik realised this was had to be due to its ability, Moody. Every so often, in battle, it would sacrifice one aspect of its battling capabilities to massively increase another. It was lucky of him to get that speed increase at the right time, but, odds were, it had lost offensive presence or defensive bulk as a tradeoff.<br />
<br />
Darik sighed. Going for the grapple was such a predictable move, seeming low-hanging fruit, but he had hoped David wouldn't have gone for the obvious grapple. An effective move? Certainly. But if he had expected Darik to not have seen it coming and planned counterplay to it, he'd been wrong. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yamask, go in with another Astonish! Timburr, Pound what little you can against your lumber piece to snag just a little wiggle room when the octopus gets rushed. Just a little will do, so Yamask can follow with a Protect next to you to thwart its grip. Timburr, Power-Up Punch him in the snoot as retaliation.&quot;<br />
<br />
It wasn't guaranteed freedom from the grapple, but that speed boost of Octillery's was a curse as well as a gift, and telegraphed far too soon. Ability characteristics were exclusive, and the Moody nature of the this Octillery meant his grip was far looser than some of his species that were more skilled with their Suction Cups.That should clear it just enough.</span></div>

<span style="color: lemonchiffon"><b>TheKnightsFury</b> - With Grookey and Rookidee returning to your side, you opt to give them the rest they deserve as opposed to forcing them to press on. The decision doesn't even present itself for your Dreepy, though, as the Gardevoir knocks it out before you, reducing your team of viable Pokemon against this fight further. With Toxtricity in rough shape, it's clear that the monster will require backup, which your Blastoise is sent out to provide. As Toxtricity begins to <b>Taunt</b> the Gardevoir to prevent the bag of tricks it has up its sleeve, the clever creature seems to have known this trick was up yours, as a <b>Magic Coat</b> surrounds the humanoid Pokemon. The Taunt bounces off the coating, and you can almost hear the words &quot;I'm rubber and you're glue&quot; in the air as Toxtricity becomes enraged.<br />
<br />
At this moment, your Blastoise takes to the field and cocks its cannons, before dousing the area in a <b>Life Dew</b>, providing much needed healing for Toxtricity. Healing that is only further amped as the Electric Pokemon rushes at the Wigglytuff, delivering a <b>Drain Punch</b> into the balloon. Gardevoir reacts to this with a chiming sound, a familiar <b>Heal Bell</b> ringing through the area and curing Wigglytuff of its paralysis, though not its confusion, which it struggles with for a moment before slapping itself in the face with its ears. Blastoise turns its cannons on the Gardevoir, and a <b>Sludge Bomb</b> volley explodes around the Fairy for some hefty damage, though unfortunately no poison seems to have come from it.<br />
<br />
Toxtricity looks to put some extra hurt on the reeling Wigglytuff, but the balloon seems to have gotten over its confusion for now. And that's all it needs to start glowing a bright white with energy. There's almost no time to react to the coming <b>Self-Destruct</b>, at least, for everyone other than Gardevoir, whose <u>Telepathy</u> gives more than enough forewarning to duck behind some crates, tossing Kojo behind a wall with telekinetic force to get the trainer out of harm's way as well. The resulting explosion is devastating, sending Toxtricity and Blastoise skidding backwards as well as ripping up a fair chunk of the street, the balloon collapsing to the ground, unconscious. Toxtricity and Blastoise are both incredibly unappreciative of the damage, with Toxtricity now looking a bit worse off than prior to the healing received and Blastoise already developing some nasty scrapes from the debris. At least now the fight is two on one, to which Blastoise quickly capitalizes with a <b>Flash Cannon</b>, dealing a bit more damage to the Gardevoir, though the graceful creature shrugs it off well enough. With battling sounds dying down from the alley, it's clear the fighting there is starting to wear down as well.<br />
<br />
<i>Toxtricity gained 1 level.<br />
Grookey gained 1 level.<br />
Rookidee gained 1 level.</i><br />
<br />
Not liking the two versus one situation, Kojo shoots you a quick glare, to which Gardevoir promptly responds with a <b>Psychic</b> wave, tossing Toxtricity aside and leaving the beast in the same unconscious state as your Dreepy. &quot;It's like you don't even want to get to the boss.&quot; The boy chides.</span>

Blastoise and Toxtricity were working well together. The Life Dew was just what Toxtricity needed, the boost of vitality helping to keep him in the fight. Unfortunately their taunting tactics had backfired, thankfully though it didn't interfere with their plans. Toxtricity replenished himself some more by smacking Wigglytuff with a Drain Punch, while Blastoise bombarded Gardevoir with Sludge. The taunt backfire proved costly though. Gardevoir let out a Heal Bell, relieving Wigglytuff of its paralysis and allowing it the opportunity to Self Destruct. Xander was almost as surprised by the careless tactic as Blastoise and Toxtricity were, the pair taking a heavy hit from the explosion. On the plus side, Wigglytuff was down for the count. <br />
<br />
Not liking the numbers advantage turning back to Xander's favour, Kojo looked to Gardevoir, who quickly finished Toxtricity with a Psychic blast. Xander snarled, the bastard Psychic type was starting to get on his nerves, as was Kojo, the boy sneaking in a sly remark. It took every ounce of self control he had not to Mega Evolve then and there. The only thing that stopped him was Kojo's confidence in Ralph being able to handle the cops. &quot;It's like you want me to bash your head in&quot;, Xander snapped back, his temper had reached its peak. He recalled Toxtricity into its Friend Ball. &quot;Blastoise, <b>Rapid Spin into a Hydro Pump!</b>&quot; The Shellfish Pokemon pulled itself into its shell, preparing to spin. The combo would allow Blastoise to increase its speed, making it much harder for Gardevoir to avoid him. &quot;Follow up with another <b>Sludge Bomb!</b>&quot;<br />
<br />
<b>Toxtricity reached lvl 37<br />
Grookey reached lvl 23<br />
Rookidee reached lvl 27</b></span></div>

<span style="color: royalblue"><b>ChrisClark13</b> - With the scoundrel before you more than happy to continue this fight, the Grimer lunges forward with a <b>Poison Jab</b>, striking into Annahime with a solid blow. The Vulpix responds happily to your order to <b>Disable</b> the move, preventing the sludge monster from using the action for a little while going forward. Continuing the assault, Annahime engulfs the monster in a <b>Fire Spin</b>, trapping the Grimer in a fiery vortex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I see how it is.&quot; The thug groans, &quot;Give it your own <b>Disable</b> and <b>Snarl</b>.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Grimer obliges, its own <b>Disable</b> preventing Annahime's next Fire Spin, the fox unable to use the move for a little bit. An angry barking noise looses a dark wave as the Grimer proceeds to <b>Snarl</b> at the fox, dealing a decent bit of damage and reducing Annahime's Special Attack as a result, to which the Vulpix promptly whines.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahaha! Perfect job!&quot; The man laughs at the misfortune that has befallen your fox before barking a couple more orders, &quot;Go with another <b>Venoshock</b> and <b>Headbutt</b>! Get that pathetic fox out of our way already!&quot;<br />
<br />
The old man behind you groans at the ongoing battle, with every passing moment glancing at his cart of flowers. &quot;Oh, please hurry along with this ruffian...&quot; He speaks up softly, poorly attempting at urgency, &quot;These flowers do have an expiration... what ones still remain from the little one's earlier frolic through the cart.&quot;<br />
<br />
At the words 'little one' the Eevee promptly looks up at the old man from the ground, having been intently watching your fun looking battle. &quot;Vee!&quot;</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: RoyalBlue">Curtis grit his teeth as he saw Annahime continue to take a beating. Not good, not good! Why does that thing know Disable too? His plan was now in tatters (and with it a large chunk of his confidence). If his Vulpix goes down then- then he'll just have to fight himself and there's no real way that would work out! Not to mention that Annahime going down is just really bad on its own! How, how does he get out of this? First thing's first, weaken it some more? No, maybe? If only he could buy a moment to use the healing items he brought! Com'on think- what moves does she have, he only makes her run through most of them every other day! <br />
<br />
He spares a glance back to the old man as they call out to him. &quot;J-just a minute!&quot; he barks in return, clearly flustered by how the fight is going. Why, why oh why is he up against a thing that he- that Annahime- has no type advantages against!? <br />
<br />
Hurriedly, he gives his orders in as brave of a voice as he can manage. &quot;Annahime- <b>Confuse Ray</b>! <b>Will-O-Wisp</b>! Fast as you can! You've got this!!&quot; There, that should buy them some time. He flips his backpack over one shoulder, zipping open a pocket- then letting the backpack fall to the ground as soon he's grabbed what's looking for: </span><a href="https://forums.upnetwork.net/showpost.php?p=843449&amp;postcount=167" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fforums.upnetwork.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D843449%26postcount%3D167&amp;hash=73b1917d459c98aedb73ed3dce1931b4" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="color: RoyalBlue"><u>a Super Potion (1/3) and an Antidote (1/4)</u></span></a><span style="color: RoyalBlue">. He stuffs the Antidote in his pocket and starts running over to this Pokemon as he preps the Super Potion with both hands.<br />
<br />
Annahime lets out an angry whine that turns into a growl as her gaze drifts to the pile-of-goop's Trainer- how- how dare he laugh at her pain like this! This is totally unlike the practice matches she's had against the other members of her Trainer's family and their Pokemon- no respect for each other at all! She starts bracing for the attacks coming her way- but then she hears her name and a series of orders. Acting on her training, she digs her paws into the ground and summons up balls of ghosty light and flings them right at her opponent's eyes- trying to throw off their attack!<br />
<br />
Coming up just behind her after all that (and whatever state she ends up in) is Curtis. As soon as he reaches Annahime he <b>sprays the Super Potion </b>on her, making her yip and snap at him in surprise as the medicine stings against her injuries. &quot;Hold still, it's a potion. It'll feel better in a moment I promise!&quot; he says as he sprays the rest of it on her as quickly as he can. There, that should keep them in the fight just a little longer- now only if he can apply the Antidote too...</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: royalblue"><b>Mask</b>: The scale of the palace slowly begins to properly dawn as you ascend the stairs. You feel tiny in comparison, the fleeting moment of insignificance chased away as you reaffirm your intent. Your gaze quickly adjust to the glaring white sheen of marble, and you continue to drink in the awe-striking architecture. Finally, you reach the gate, a cavernous yet minutely detailed spectacle. You saunter through - but as you do, you are stopped by two guards. <br />
<br />
Their armour is far less flashy than you may have otherwise expected. A fairly muted affair; practical, tempered leather covers their bodies from head to toe, The black leather is accented in places with a brown tan for various straps, while polished pauklrons guard each shoulder. Their somewhat more ornate helms covered all but their eyes and lower face - though there was little emotion to be read there, a professional steeliness stuck hard. The one flourish of colour lays with a darkly intense blue scarf, a clear indication of their employ. After a few cursory glances, the pair nod in approval, ushering you into the main foyer. <br />
<br />
To be sure, where the entrance impressed, the interior floored. The royal insignia stretches out before you, the image emblazoned as first impression on the mind of any visitors. The circular room opened at the opposite end to a corridor which thrust further into the castle, the beckoning doors inviting you - and any other casual guests. However, you had a specific goal, rather than simple sightseeing. Observing the situation, it became evident you had a number of options. <br />
<br />
You could simply ask the guards for audience with the king, or you could attempt something clandestine and try happen upon him yourself. Of course, exploring the public areas of the palace was also an option - there was nothing guaranteeing another avenue wouldn't present itself to you.</span></div>

</blockquote>Alice nodded. A revolt would be the easiest way to go because they would have the support of sheer numbers, but as Sera went on, her explanation proved exactly why a revolt and the quantity on their side would mean that this was less simple than it could sound. &quot;I have very powerful Pokemon, too, and I've fought and held my ground and won some big battles.&quot; She replied, but she also knew she had lost some, too. She might have even died after them if the ominous gaps in her memory were anything to go by: burned by ghosts after vengeance, shot to death by a gangster at Bedlam Ridge... Now wasn't the time to contemplate her mortality or dodgy memories, and besides, mulling over it just gave Alice a headache. &quot;The more people who know, the harder it is to keep the secret but I think we're going to need them. Besides, if they want their freedom too it'd be easier to get everyone out at the same time. It'd be harder for them going forward if they're just left behind to suffer the fallout.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked over at her Pokemon. Eridian was helping to soothe the Mime Jr but they were both on board. Alice thought over her team at hand. Fiona the Trapinch wasn't going to be suited for a big blowout but she could certainly dig tunnels or bite off appendages if the need arose. Eridian, Farren, Blaze and Mimi were all more than capable in this kind of situation and Jasper too had proven himself on the battlefield and in emergencies. In fact, Jasper might be key. Better him than her Honedge, whose solution absolutely would have been cold, bloody murder. &quot;Between my psychic and ghost Pokemon we could easily create chaos to get you out if need be and Eri and Blaze are absolute brute forces. What was your original plan? Wait until everyone was asleep and run? Do they ever have people looking out for that sort of thing? Jasper can probably steal the money no problem, but I want to hear about what you were intending to do. I need to know their Pokemon and usual styles as well so I have an idea what we're going up against.&quot;</span></div>

<b>Meetan- </b>You reassure Sera that you also have some very powerful Pokemon on hand, but not knowing what you're up against, you can't be certain they're strong enough. You'd met your match before and while it was unlikely a simple ring master would be able to overpower you, it wasn't impossible. You question Sera about her original plan and ask for a run down of the troupe's Pokemon. <br />
<br />
&quot;Once we got to the Inn I was going to wait for Mo and then we'd just have to head off on foot, maybe find a traveller who'd be willing to transport us. As I said before, we'd likely have to leave without our Pokemon and the extra money. You see, I don't know how he does it, but Jean Pierre has control of our Pokeballs. Of a night we have to recall our Pokemon and hand the balls over to him, but even during the day, its like we can only get so far from him before the balls refuse to move. I first discovered it almost a year ago, Bambi and I were exploring a forest while the others set up camp. Suddenly, Bambi was drawn back into his ball and try as I might, I couldn't move the ball any further. None of my Pokeballs would move. If I took them off I was free to move, but otherwise it was like we'd hit some mysterious barrier. I made my way back to camp and didn't say anything to anyone except Mo.&quot; This new piece of information was odd indeed. How was the Ring Master controlling the Pokeballs? Had he hacked them somehow? Or perhaps there was something else at work here?<br />
<br />
&quot;As for Pokemon on hand. Bouffalant belongs to Mo, while Eeny, Meeny, Miny own a Simisear, Simipour and Simisage respectively. Herakles has Camerupt and Copperajah, as well as a Machamp. Jean Pierre's Rapidash are nothing but transport Pokemon, but his other Pokemon are skilled and experienced. He takes great pride in his Pyroar, the beast is magnificent. Mr. Rime is Jean Pierre's right hand man, don't let its jolly nature fool you, its got a heart as cold as ice. They're the only two Pokemon I've seen Jean Pierre use, but I know he's got at least two others, I've seen their balls on his belt but he's never revealed them to any of us.&quot;</span></div>

<span style="color: seagreen"><b>Missingno. Master</b> - With the Golurk threatening to bring the very cave down upon all of your heads, you clearly need to end this before it gets any worse. Twisting your cap on your head, you pitch a Dusk Ball like you were in the major leagues, the ball sailing towards the hulking behemoth of a roadblock in front of you. Just as it's looking like the ball will connect, the Goluck holds out one arm, catching the Dusk Ball in its hand. Energy pulsing through the golem, its massive fingers wrap around the ball before it proceeds to crush the orb, causing it to splinter and shatter in its grip, leaving naught but dust of the capturing device.<br />
<br />
As if the insult of destroying your ball wasn't bad enough, the Golurk's other arm reaches back to the wall behind it, large mechanical fingers digging into the stone work to wrap around a crystal in the wall. Ripping the crystal from the earth a bright glow envelops the fist of the Golurk before it comes crashing down to the ground, a massive shockwave erupting forward, ripping up the ground in a massive <b>Tectonic Rage</b> that barrels through the earth and into Aster, the resulting spikes from the floor sending the Toxapex flying through the cave to land at your feet, unconscious.<br />
<br />
Anion's companion now out of the battle, the Minun looses an <b>Ice Beam</b> as per your orders, more out of desperation than anything else, the cold beam lancing into the Golurk's chest and causing a large frozen patch across the cracked clay. The Golurk reels for a moment from the attack, before the glow of energy from its core fades and its form shatters into mere shards of Z-Crystals to scatter across the floor, leaving your path now unblocked thanks to the large hole in the far wall the construct just created for you in preparation for its final attack.</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: SeAgreen">Realistically, Keith wasn't sure what to expect in these next few seconds. Maybe he'd catch the Golurk. Maybe the ball would wobble a few times before Golurk broke free. Maybe Golurk would even break free before the ball could land on the ground. That said, as realistic as Keith tried to keep his expectations, even he wasn't prepared to see Golurk grab the Dusk Ball out of the air and crush it into a fine powder. Keith's eyes bulged almost comically, and Meowth made a funny squeaking noise.<br />
<br />
But that wasn't enough for Golurk- with its other arm, it grabbed one of the Z-Crystals out of the wall- along with the surrounding wall- and tapped into its power to unleash the Ground-type Z-Move- Tectonic Rage! The super effective Ground-type Z-Move sent Aster flying backwards, and the Shiny Toxapex came to rest at Keith's feet. &quot;Toxaaaaa,&quot; she groaned, completely knocked out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, man,&quot; Keith groaned, holding out Aster's Poison Ball. &quot;Aster, return now!&quot; he said, withdrawing the Poison/Water-type. &quot;Rest up- you were great,&quot; he murmured.<br />
<br />
It all rested on Anion now, and the Minun wasn't messing around. &quot;Mai maiiii... MINUUUUUUN!&quot; Anion exclaimed, letting fly an Ice Beam at Golurk. And thankfully, this was all it took- Golurk shattered before their eyes, into naught but Z-Crystal shards. In hindsight, as Keith observed this, perhaps it was foolish to try and catch the Golurk- it probably wasn't an actual Golurk in the first place. But before Keith could dwell on this too much, he heard Anion cry out. &quot;Mai mai! Mai mai!&quot; the Electric-type was exclaiming, pointing to where Golurk had dug out the Groundium Z. &quot;Aha!&quot; Keith grinned. &quot;Of course- we have our opening!&quot; He scooped up his Minun in his arms and took off towards the hole in the wall. They were getting closer, and with the way no longer obstructed, there was no time to lose.</span><br />

<span style="color: plum">With your brief meeting with Haley over with, you ponder over what direction to take now that the mystery of the boat was solved. As soon as you mentioned it, the horde immediately start to fight within itself. Ear pulling, punching, kicking, you name it. These Pichus wanted their voices heard and they would do anything to make sure theirs was the right one. Seeing it devolving into a mess, you decide to hold a democratic vote. Two of your Pichu vote to stay within the Land of Cups, and three of them decide to venture off to the City of Pentacles.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: royalblue">Taking the road you used to get here, you end up back onto the Fool's Path. It was the main road through the Arcane Realm, and branched off towards every major area before ending at the World Tree. Heading towards the city, you end up passing by multiple trainers and travelers as they head towards the various attractions of the Arcane Realm. <br />
<br />
Of course, the scenery wasn't changing much now. This was a huge place, and exploring the entirety of the Arcane Realm could very easily take months. Some people even stated they've experienced a strange phenomena that they felt there were locked in one place for a year, even so no time seemed to have passed while they were there. <br />
<br />
After what felt like a few hours, probably was as the sun was starting to cross the sky and set, you notice a peculiar sight on the road. A young trainer, no more than about the age of ten, was sitting on the side of the road. Was a common enough sight, but the appearance was what caught your eye. <br />
<br />
They were wearing a brown hoodie that had a zigzagging cream pattern on the bottom part of the jacket. The other thing was that the hood itself had two brown, cream tipped ears jutting out. It looked like someone took an Eevee and made it into clothing. Surrounding this trainer were five Eevees, who seemed to have noticed the Pichu horde accompanying you. They all bark in happiness and eagerly jump up to play with your Pichu.<br />
<br />
At this rate the trainer notices what was going on and runs after them, but they were too late. The Eevees barrel into you, causing your horde to become loose. At this rate its was just udder chaos.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I'm sorry sir. They don't like to be in their balls and they just want to play. They're all very young and I'm new to this whole thing I'm sorry.&quot; The trainer explains, apologizing profusely. At this point you're able to tell that this was a young boy. Seemed like he needed some help with managing five of the same species at once.<br />
<br />
What do you do?</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: royalblue">After easily hours of walking back along the Fool's Path toward the City of Pentacles, Michael was starting to get a bit bored of the barely changing scenery, and even the faces that passed him by from time to time seemed to blend together like unimportant silhouettes of the side characters of his life. At least, up until he spotted a younger trainer to the side of the road, dressed in a hoodie designed after another Pokemon. Michael wasn't about to judge, his horned hood still hanging back behind his neck to allow sleeping space for the Pichu as they took turns walking and napping, tuckering themselves out fairly easily along the path.<br />
<br />
Of course, it wasn't about to be his choice whether or not to simply pass by the boy, a small pack of Eevee pepping up and barking before barreling into him and nearly knocking him off his feet, the collection of sleeping Pichu jostled by the knock and sent tumbling to the ground to awaken, most immediately jumping into play while Angela instead stared about groggily before attempting to hide behind her trainer's legs.<br />
<br />
The young boy apologized profusely and then some for the interference, noting that the kits were all young in and of themselves and that he was rather inexperienced. Rubbing the back of his neck, Michael wondered who would allow such a young trainer to watch over five young and excitable Pokemon with no supervision. It was disaster waiting to happen, really.<br />
<br />
Scooping Angela up and holding her in one arm, the man figured he'd give some form of advice on the situation. &quot;Well, yeah, it can be tricky to get a hang of watching after a group of Pokemon.&quot; Shifting Angela into his hood he continues, &quot;But even the most excitable group has its share of differences. It's about finding out what makes each one tick so you know how they'll react to certain things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding to Angela he clarifies, &quot;For example this one here loves playing but is probably just a bit worried your Eevee might get her fur dirty. Not usually a problem but we're quite a ways away from town and a proper washroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pointing around at the group, his point is made a bit more cleanly, &quot;I've got show-offs and trouble makers, ones who want to play and ones who want to scrap. Even they way they react to a brand new Pokemon to them like Eevee is completely different for each of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, knowing what my Pichu want from their little play time, what is it your Eevee care about so much that they'd nearly knock me off my feet?&quot;</span></div>

<article class="message-body js-selectToQuote">
<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: royalblue"><b>Liltwick</b> – The Blissey cocks her head at your initial inquiry, clearly perplexed for a moment.<br />
<br />
<i>“‘BB’? Ah, you must mean this meatsack.”</i> Her face lights up in understanding as she giggles. <i>“I don’t know why that man continues to call her such, but as for myself… I’ve gone by many names according to your kind, but for now you may call me ‘Aisa’.”</i><br />
<br />
She curtsies in a courteous manner to make your acquaintance, before moving on to the next query.<br />
<br />
<i>“Dear me, I believe you’re mistaken.”</i> Her hand moves to her mouth in horror at the mere suggestion of such a gruesome method of execution. <i>“Chopping to bits would be sooo messy, don’t you think? No no, all I intend to do is <b>this</b>.”</i><br />
<br />
A snap, and suddenly a string of spun scarlet seems to materialize in front of you, leading from your pulsating heart to her pink paw, which she winds tightly around like cotton candy floss as if to further prevent escape. Bringing the shears ever closer, they hover a hair’s width over the red thread before pausing at your last desperate plea, offering to sell your special secret recipe in exchange for freedom.<br />
<br />
<i>“Silly, I have no use for Malasadas.”</i> She smoothly rejects the bid without batting an eye, gesturing to the symbol blooming beneath your feet as it begins to glow seemingly brighter, hungry for nourishment. <i>“All I seek is your soul to serve as the final ingredient. Once the required seven sacrifices are gathered, then the gateway will open. Now then, this won’t hurt a bit~”</i> She smiles serenely as the blades slowly inch together, putting pressure on the cord that – despite her promise of zero pain – seems to travel straight up to your sternum, suffocating as the first fine strand of fiber starts to sever and fray…<br />
<br />
<b>BOOM.</b><br />
<br />
Without warning, the floor above suddenly shakes violently, and the Blissey halts her proceedings as she blinks and glances up in confusion.<br />
<br />
<i>“What in the world…?”</i><br />
<br />
You can hear Lucius yelling, followed by a mighty <b>CRASH</b> as the boards creak and give way, resulting in a giant mass of blue blubber landing directly before you with a thud. Pie roars triumphantly as Carrot and Custard hover down after him through the hole in the ceiling, the latter carrying your bag with a grin. Carrot swiftly floats over to your side and uses its <b>SHARPEN</b>ed edge to slice cleanly through the ropes, releasing you before your flabbergasted captor can even react.<br />
<br />
<i>“Wh- what the-“</i> She sputters in indignation at her plans unraveling in the span of a second. <i>“How did you all get here?! Did that idiot let one of you escape?”</i><br />
<br />
Just then, the last member of the rescue party leaps down: the Kadabra from earlier, as it casts a look towards Blissey that is equal parts plaintive and pitying.<br />
<br />
<i>“Enough, sister.” </i>A surprisingly distinct female tone of voice emits from its mind; one that feels not quite fitting if not for image alone, but rather the host’s whole demeanor seems to have shifted since you saw it last.<i> “You know this isn’t the way.”</i><br />
<br />
To your added astonishment, it flicks its finger, and the dreamlike lifeline still tying you to Blissey seems to loosen and reel back towards Kadabra, before dissolving into invisibility again. The Blissey hisses in response, almost seeming to throw a tantrum.<br />
<br />
<i>“It’s <b>their</b> fault she’s dead!”</i> she cries, eyes aflame like burning rubies. <i>“Without her, this world is doomed anyway. So why allow it to live longer? Let it perish I say, and let’s start fresh again, with just the three of us.”</i><br />
<br />
She extends her paw – pleadingly – but the Kadabra shakes its head, lifting a spoon instead.<br />
<br />
<i>“Not yet. There’s still time. Which is why, we’ll be taking our leave now.”</i><br />
<br />
At that moment, a burst of radiance erupts from the silver, engulfing you and your Pokémon in its hemisphere. Just before you’re blinded completely by white, you catch sight of Lucius arriving down the stairs, as he locks gaze with you and nods slightly. Unable to respond in time, your stomach lurches as you find yourself abruptly swept away, <b>TELEPORT</b>ing to…</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: seagreen"><b><u><span style="font-family: 'times new roman'">Fortune’s Woods</span></u></b><br />
<br />
You come to in a quiet copse of trees, with Kadabra and the rest of your team still beside you, the latter crowding around you in relief and concern over your wellbeing. As you eventually manage to reassure them that your body at least hasn’t been physically harmed in any way, you meet Kadabra’s stare while it seems to await the inevitable mountain of questions you must have.<br />
<br />
What do you say?</span></div>

You give your orders to Lucifer, making sure that he was primed and ready from when the Gabite would strike. You could feel the earth tremble beneath your feet as it was churned by the land shark. They were known for two things: how quickly they were able to dig through the ground and how much they loved gems. Nothing here really shone as brightly as a gem, but the taste of blood seemed to trigger the Gabite as much as gemstones normally would.<br />
<br />
A loud cracking noise could be heard as the Gabite burst through the ground directly underneath Lucifer. Foreseeing this, and with a little help from your orders, he channeled as a burst of speed into his hind legs and used his Quick Attack to getaway. The Gabite was caught off guard by the Absol dodging, but in the end, it didn't matter. The Gabite stabs the ground with both of its claws, preparing a powerful move. From its maw comes a fiery blue wyrm, channeling its draconic rage. This looked to be its desperation attack, and it landed perfectly. Lucifer cries out in pain as he's wreathed in the flames.<br />
<br />
But, by some stroke of luck, Lucifer was left standing. His fur was singed, and he was barely holding on. You could hear his labored breaths, staring the Gabite straight in the eye. Once more, he coats his horn in dark energy and lunged forwards. The horn connects with the Gabite, but it is not enough to fell your foe. The Gabite is knocked back by the attack and starts circling the area. It seemed poised to finish at any second. Yet there was a glimmer in the sky. The Future Sight. It would strike within a moment's notice... All you had to do was stall long enough for it to go off. <br />
<br />
What do you do? <br />
<br />
<span style="color: seagreen">Kadota-<br />
<br />
You call out to the Nuzleaf in a sing-song fashion. You were curious about why it approached you and what its intentions were. Your Galarian Ponyta was also confused about what its intentions were and wanted to follow it. With both of you agreeing on following it, you head deeper within the woods.<br />
<br />
Your humming began to draw in the various creatures of the woods. You could see a few Caterpies wriggling about tree branches, as well as Taillows following with curious eyes. A few Skwovets and Pachirisus climbed atop trees to see what was going on. Poking out of a few bushes were various other forest creatures, such as Bunearies and Deerlings. But none of them were the Nuzleaf that you were after. It was quite strange, being honest, that something that sought you out was now avoiding you. <br />
<br />
You, do notice, though, that you seem to be circling now. The path forwards has turned into a circle, as you can start seeing the same trees that you had previously. But, there were no other paths within sight. It was just the same loop, over and over again. You felt like you were on a roulette wheel, spinning round and round until you found a slot that you'd fall into. And that you did. <br />
<br />
After what seemed like four or five loops, you once again spot the Nuzleaf watching you. It was peering at you from within a bush you hadn't seen before, and as soon as you noticed it let out a surprised shriek. If it was watching you, then why did it seem so surprised to see you looking back at it? Wandering a little closer, the Pokemon runs down a darkened path that you hadn't seen before. It seemed this is where the wheel landed for you and looking back the path was no longer there. <br />
<br />
What do you do? <br />
<br />
<span style="color: royalblue">Sneaze-<br />
<br />
Seeing that the boy really had no control over his Eevees, you let your horde play with the other horde. Hordes within hordes within hordes. Well, this was really beginning to become a giant mess, wasn't it? At least everyone besides Angela was ready and willing to play. You do explain, though, that she's primarily hesitant that the only reason why is that she likes to be clean. You then ask him why his Eevees would knock you off of your feet. <br />
<br />
&quot;I-I don't really know being honest. Ever since I got them they've overall been rambunctious. Let's see here...&quot; he starts looking through the crowd and picks up one of the Eevees. You could see a heart-shaped pattern on its tail, and it was wearing a pink collar.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Nara. She's the first one I got, and well she's the one closest to me. SHe's kind and motherly, and seems to have this sort of radiance to her, like the morning sun,&quot; he states and then sets her down. You can see her go over to Annie and start to gently play with the Pichu. Seems Nara could tell Annie was a little easily spooked, and worked to assuage the little Pichu when she did. <br />
<br />
He then grabs another one, this one with a blue collar. you could tell be the star-pattern on the tail that this was a male Eevee. &quot;T-this is, uh, Aquarius. Or, Aqua for sure. I don't know why but he likes to get wet a lot and tends to be very, uh, naughty nature,&quot; the boy states with a tinge of embarrassment. The Eevee rocked its bod as it jumped out of the boy's arms and immediately tackled down Asher. You could tell the two of them being together was going to be a disaster.<br />
<br />
The third one had a yellow color and had a mohawk on his head. It was weird, to say the least. &quot;He's Spike. He seems really into hardcore music and generally rocking out,&quot; the younger trainer states as the Eevee flops over. Seems he was also quite lazy. This intrigued Andrew, who was confused about why the Eevee was so different and not really moving. The Pichu went to go fidget with the mohawk, while the Eevee cared not.<br />
<br />
And then there was another in his arms. This one had a light blue collar, and their fur was really shiny looking. You could tell this Eevee liked to be well-groomed and present themselves in a beautiful manner. &quot;This is Forrest! He likes to be groomed up and fancy!&quot; The boy exclaims as he sets this one down. Immediately he walks pompously towards Angela and starts to help her clean up to play. Seemed that nothing dirty would happen with him around.<br />
<br />
And the final Eevee had a green collar with a heart-shaped tail. Seemed this was his other girl. &quot;And last, but certainly not least, is Celty. She likes to just chill out and enjoy the surroundings around her.&quot; And with that last introduction, she carefully jumps from his arms and goes towards Axel. The two of them start playing at a casual place, but you could see the Eevee glare at the other two trouble makers every so often. <br />
<br />
&quot;And for me, my name is Shawn. I just want to become a good trainer and eventually own every eeveelution. I heard first-timers tend to follow this path, but I still really haven't found a direction that interests me. If you could, uh, give me pointers on how to keep a group of Pokemon more well behaved, I'd appreciate it, sir!&quot; He stammers out, a little embarrassed after the long list of introductions. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, um, sorry to be rude, but I never got your name did I?&quot; <br />
<br />
How do you respond?</span></span></span></div>

The Land of Cups<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Named for the small valleys and tall hills and mountains native to the region, forming almost natural cups, this is an almost verdant and fertile land. Despite the desert in the very north and the mountains nestled in, a large variety of life can be found here. The Land of Cups is the jewel of the Arcane Realm, and without it, the realm would be a lot more desolate. Luckily, there are preservation efforts to make sure this jewel doesn’t lose its shine. (Please respond in Plum<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
XVII. Desert of Stars - A small, arid desert at the northern tip of the Land of Cups, the Desert of Stars is named for the various meteorites found within this region. While more a dry, mountainous desert than a sandy one, sandstorms are still a common occurence here. Though, despite these conditions, explorers and treasure hunters flock to this region for the meteorites found here, and the rare Pokemon attracted to them. Some have even stated they’ve had some otherworldly experiences here.

</blockquote><span style="color: plum">Sweeney scowled behind his visor. He had known that his dress code was incompatible with the arid environment of a desert, but he had yet again found himself being playfully bullied into decision he was initially largely opposed to. Julia delighted in the surroundings, the young Larvitar bounding merrily from rock to rock. investigating with a childlike glee. Atlantis, perched on his trainers helmet, watched with an uncharacteristic alacrity, the living fossil finding vicarious enjoyment in the unbridled awe Julia was experiencing. <br />
<br />
Pausing for a moment, Sweeney had to admit the trip was worth the suffocating atmosphere. When he had first expressed interest in adventuring to the Arcane Realm, there had been a twinge of instant regret. Julia had boisterously taken command of the discussion - managing to box out even Marco, a feat impressive in it's own right - and voiced a staunch determination to visit the Desert of Stars. Her gusto caught the trainer off guard, and he ended up swept along in the pace of his Pokemon, as was all too often the case. No matter his protestations or stern words from Sophie, Julia would not be dissuaded. Worse still, Atlantis poked the hornets nest, coyly egging the Larvitar on in her crusade. Eventually, Sweeney had to relent, much to his chagrin. Fortunately, the abject exhilaration of Julia was going a long way to justifying the concession. <br />
<br />
Julia, now digging through the earth, turns towards her trainer, eyes wide with uncertainty due to his stopping. With a sigh from the Bartender, and a knowing snicker from Atlantis, they continue on their way. While their wandering was certainly aimless at the present, there was no doubt trouble would fine them. It always seemed to. </span><br />

<span style="color: royalblue"><b>Liltwick</b> – The Blissey cocks her head at your initial inquiry, clearly perplexed for a moment.<br />
<br />
<i>“‘BB’? Ah, you must mean this meatsack.”</i> Her face lights up in understanding as she giggles. <i>“I don’t know why that man continues to call her such, but as for myself… I’ve gone by many names according to your kind, but for now you may call me ‘Aisa’.”</i><br />
<br />
She curtsies in a courteous manner to make your acquaintance, before moving on to the next query.<br />
<br />
<i>“Dear me, I believe you’re mistaken.”</i> Her hand moves to her mouth in horror at the mere suggestion of such a gruesome method of execution. <i>“Chopping to bits would be sooo messy, don’t you think? No no, all I intend to do is <b>this</b>.”</i><br />
<br />
A snap, and suddenly a string of spun scarlet seems to materialize in front of you, leading from your pulsating heart to her pink paw, which she winds tightly around like cotton candy floss as if to further prevent escape. Bringing the shears ever closer, they hover a hair’s width over the red thread before pausing at your last desperate plea, offering to sell your special secret recipe in exchange for freedom.<br />
<br />
<i>“Silly, I have no use for Malasadas.”</i> She smoothly rejects the bid without batting an eye, gesturing to the symbol blooming beneath your feet as it begins to glow seemingly brighter, hungry for nourishment. <i>“All I seek is your soul to serve as the final ingredient. Once the required seven sacrifices are gathered, then the gateway will open. Now then, this won’t hurt a bit~”</i> She smiles serenely as the blades slowly inch together, putting pressure on the cord that – despite her promise of zero pain – seems to travel straight up to your sternum, suffocating as the first fine strand of fiber starts to sever and fray…<br />
<br />
<b>BOOM.</b><br />
<br />
Without warning, the floor above suddenly shakes violently, and the Blissey halts her proceedings as she blinks and glances up in confusion.<br />
<br />
<i>“What in the world…?”</i><br />
<br />
You can hear Lucius yelling, followed by a mighty <b>CRASH</b> as the boards creak and give way, resulting in a giant mass of blue blubber landing directly before you with a thud. Pie roars triumphantly as Carrot and Custard hover down after him through the hole in the ceiling, the latter carrying your bag with a grin. Carrot swiftly floats over to your side and uses its <b>SHARPEN</b>ed edge to slice cleanly through the ropes, releasing you before your flabbergasted captor can even react.<br />
<br />
<i>“Wh- What the-“</i> She sputters in indignation at her plans unraveling in the span of a second. <i>“How did you all get here?! Did that idiot let one of you escape?”</i><br />
<br />
Just then, the last member of the rescue party leaps down: the Kadabra from earlier, as it casts a look towards Blissey that is equal parts plaintive and pitying.<br />
<br />
<i>“Enough, sister.” </i>A surprisingly distinct female tone of voice emits from its mind; one that feels not quite fitting if not for image alone, but rather the host’s whole demeanor seems to have shifted since you saw it last.<i> “You know this isn’t the way.”</i><br />
<br />
To your added astonishment, it flicks its finger, and the dreamlike lifeline still tying you to Blissey seems to loosen and reel back towards Kadabra, before dissolving into invisibility again. The Blissey hisses in response, almost seeming to throw a tantrum.<br />
<br />
<i>“It’s <b>their</b> fault she’s dead!”</i> she cries, eyes aflame like burning rubies. <i>“Without her, this world is doomed anyway. So why allow it to live longer? Let it perish I say, and let’s start fresh again, with just the three of us.”</i><br />
<br />
She extends her paw – pleadingly – but the Kadabra shakes its head, lifting a spoon instead.<br />
<br />
<i>“Not yet. There’s still time. Which is why, we’ll be taking our leave now.”</i><br />
<br />
At that moment, a burst of radiance erupts from the silver, engulfing you and your Pokémon in its hemisphere. Just before you’re blinded completely by white, you catch sight of Lucius arriving down the stairs, as he locks gaze with you and nods slightly. Unable to respond in time, your stomach lurches as you find yourself abruptly swept away, <b>TELEPORT</b>ing to…</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: seagreen"><b><u><span style="font-family: 'times new roman'">Fortune’s Woods</span></u></b><br />
<br />
You come to in a quiet copse of trees, with Kadabra and the rest of your team still beside you, the latter crowding around you in relief and concern over your wellbeing. As you eventually manage to reassure them that your body at least hasn’t been physically harmed in any way, you meet Kadabra’s stare while it seems to await the inevitable mountain of questions you must have.<br />
<br />
<b>What do you say?</b></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: royalblue">Everything around him happened in a flash. The devil wasn't interested in bargaining. Well, that wouldn't make them a devil now, would it? A demon. Yes, a true demon. It seemed he was resigned to his fate as a sacrifice. Gritting his teeth, Leo could only look forwards as the Blissey inched closer on closer. Her so-called promise of it being painless was an obvious lie. He could feel the cord sear through his entire body as she continued her approach. <br />
<br />
&quot;Guess this is it...&quot; he sighed out. His voice was almost a whisper, and his eyes were filled with despair. <br />
<br />
That was until a loud boom filled his ears. His eyes suddenly perked up, his head looking around wondering what was going on. He heard Lucius yelling from above and then heard the floorboards break with a loud crash. THat's when his eyes were filled with blue, as Pie descended into the room. At this point, it seemed like pure chaos. He was glad he decided on keeping the Snorlax around. <br />
<br />
He then saw Custard and Carrot descend down with Pie, the Togetic happy to see his trainer. The Carbink quickly cut through the ropes, reeing Leo. He jumped up and gave Custard a hug. He was worried about what happened to the Pokemon, but now not seemed to be the time. Looking further up, he could see the Kadabra float down. The look on its face as it stared at the Blissey confused him. How could a random Pokemon have a connection to this demon?<br />
<br />
But, there turned out to be one. He listened, somehow, to the conversation at hand. Resetting the world? But why? Sure there were bad things, but there were bad things everywhere. There was so much beauty and joy here, to the point it felt shocking that someone wanted to get rid of it. But, he felt he was freed all the same. As if that demon's hold on him was gone. <br />
<br />
Leo could tell, though, that something had happened. What exactly happened, he did not know, but it was enough to cause sacrifices to be made. It was truly unforgivable. No matter what happened, it was right to play with other's lives to undo it. <br />
<br />
&quot;The past is the past for a reason!&quot; He shouted. He noticed Lucius heading down the stairs and giving him a quick, understanding nod. Was he too a prisoner to the Blissey? He didn't have time to ask questions, as he was soon teleported away from this entire situation.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: seagreen">When he came to, he was in the woods. Getting up, he could see his Pokemon were with him still, as well as the Kadabra. That was good at the very least, but he was a bit worried about the situation he had left behind. But, his Pokemon were worried about him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Guys, I'm fine. See,&quot; he stated as he began to show them nothing bad had actually happened to his body. <br />
<br />
With his group relieved, he saw the Kadabra looking at him. She? It? Was waiting for him. To open his mouth and ask away. He had been confused about the entirety of this situation, after all. <br />
<br />
&quot;Where are we? This has to be the Forest of Wands, right?&quot; He immediately questioned. He wasn't planning on having to come here, but it might not be a bad thing. The entire forest was filled with magic, according to the guide. That could end up protecting them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyways, what the hell is going on? I just came here for an apprenticeship. I don't want to have to deal with angels or demons or any of that. I just want to be a baker. Make cakes and pastries. You know, simple things? I've had a fair share of trouble in my past, and now,&quot; he said looking at his team.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, who are you? What is that monster in pink? And why are people being killed?&quot; He asked, his voice a little distraught at this point. He didn't want to have to go through any of this.</span></span></div>

<span style="color: seagreen"><b>Meetan- </b>You reassure Sera that you also have some very powerful Pokemon on hand, but not knowing what you're up against, you can't be certain they're strong enough. You'd met your match before and while it was unlikely a simple ring master would be able to overpower you, it wasn't impossible. You question Sera about her original plan and ask for a run down of the troupe's Pokemon. <br />
<br />
&quot;Once we got to the Inn I was going to wait for Mo and then we'd just have to head off on foot, maybe find a traveller who'd be willing to transport us. As I said before, we'd likely have to leave without our Pokemon and the extra money. You see, I don't know how he does it, but Jean Pierre has control of our Pokeballs. Of a night we have to recall our Pokemon and hand the balls over to him, but even during the day, its like we can only get so far from him before the balls refuse to move. I first discovered it almost a year ago, Bambi and I were exploring a forest while the others set up camp. Suddenly, Bambi was drawn back into his ball and try as I might, I couldn't move the ball any further. None of my Pokeballs would move. If I took them off I was free to move, but otherwise it was like we'd hit some mysterious barrier. I made my way back to camp and didn't say anything to anyone except Mo.&quot; This new piece of information was odd indeed. How was the Ring Master controlling the Pokeballs? Had he hacked them somehow? Or perhaps there was something else at work here?<br />
<br />
&quot;As for Pokemon on hand. Bouffalant belongs to Mo, while Eeny, Meeny, Miny own a Simisear, Simipour and Simisage respectively. Herakles has Camerupt and Copperajah, as well as a Machamp. Jean Pierre's Rapidash are nothing but transport Pokemon, but his other Pokemon are skilled and experienced. He takes great pride in his Pyroar, the beast is magnificent. Mr. Rime is Jean Pierre's right hand man, don't let its jolly nature fool you, its got a heart as cold as ice. They're the only two Pokemon I've seen Jean Pierre use, but I know he's got at least two others, I've seen their balls on his belt but he's never revealed them to any of us.&quot;</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: seagreen">Alice hummed, interjecting with a word here and there just to let Sera know that she was actively listening and not just drifting off in thought. The Poke Ball thing was a problem, but that didn't mean said problem couldn't be solved. Jasper was going to be key here in stealing back the balls, but she also wanted to know if he or any of her other Pokemon could detect what was wrong with them. It was a shame that Mimi was so young and sweet. A dark part of her felt that inducing a psychotic break in this abuser would be a just punishment and quick solve to more than half of these problems. Nina might not agree, though.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mimi, come over here a sec.&quot; She summoned the Mime Jr and as she did she also released the Sableye. Eridian gave the ghost immediate stink eye for which he only recieved an eere, unmoing grin of gnashers in return. The dragon snorted and heavily swung his head away to give Jasper his cold shoulder and that was the end of that. &quot;Sera, show me your Poke Balls. I want to see if these two can figure out what's wrong with them and let me know. Whatever it is-- if you suss it, don't break them yet. There might be some kind of alarm system and I don't want the boss to know we're onto him yet.&quot; At Jasper's questioning look, Alice added, &quot;We're rescuing Sera and Mo and starting a revolt with the travelling circus.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jasper smiled half an inch wider. He was clearly on board.<br />
<br />
&quot;As for the potential of battle...&quot; Alice trailed off. &quot;Blaze might be able to take on the Pyroar but it's hard to know. I'll obviously need to keep Eri from the Rime.&quot; Herakles' Pokemon were mostly slow, but Alice wouldn't be surprised if the Machamp was able to move incredibly quickly. Farren's typing wasn't going to be helpful at all here and Fiona was so young, those two would need to be kept from the battlefield. That left her only with the others for the moment, but maybe she could swap Farren out at the inn. She could think of a few Pokemon here who would do be better substitutes for the sleepy bagworm. &quot;I'll figure it out when we get there, anyway. I'm going to have Jasper help us steal the balls if he can. Are you able to 'release' your own Pokemon? I have a bunch of Poke Balls that we could use and swap them all over if we can do that. At least then if he has trackers or something on the balls we could just scatter them to waste his time and get clear.&quot;</span></div>

The trio heads down the stairs, much to Kanna's chagrin. The passageway was dark, damp, and smelled like something died. It was unpleasant, and despite the gleams of the necklace, extremely hard to navigate due to the darkness of the passageway. It didn't help that Yufi would go ahead every so often, which caused a conflict on interest in Kanna staying next to Kief out of comfort, and trying to reign in the Zigzagoon. <br />
<br />
As the trio ventured further down the stairs, they also manage to trigger a variety of traps along the way. A few trip wires that caused poisoned darts, pressure plates causing swinging axes and more similar traps were being triggered. Of course, with everyone's small, lithe frames it was actually impossible to be hit by these traps. They felt more made for humans than Pokemon. Of course, that doesn't mean there wasn't a trap that would be bad for all of you. <br />
<br />
The one confusing thing was that the stairwell felt like it just kept going down and down and down. There were no twists or turns. It felt like it just kept going on forever and ever. As if you were going deep within to the very heart of the temple. The perception of time was lost, and the trio didn't know if they were climbing down the stairs for minutes or hours. That was until Yufi pressed on one specific pressure plate.<br />
<br />
A large rumbling noise happened, and the stairwell sudden filled with light. Torches hanging on the walls were lit by some unseen force, and the three of you could hear a large thud behind you. Turning around, the trio notice a giant boulder starting to roll towards them. There was only one choice here. RUN. <br />
<br />
Running down the stairs, Kanna realized that the stairs were still, in fact, trapped, as she saw darts flying out and axes coming down as Yufi ran as fast as she could. This was just great. If they weren't squished, then some other terrible fate was going to befall them. That was when Kief noticed a light at the end of the tunnel, and barreled forwards with Kanna and Yufi in tow. The three formed a furry wheel as they ended up bouncing down the stairs and going straight into a room. They heard a loud thud, and the boulder blocked their entryway. They were trapped now, great. <br />
<br />
Though, looking around the room, there noticed three exits. Two were on the sides of the room, and the last one was adjacent to them. The exits were connected by three stone bridges, and the room itself was more of a square with four circular points. Each point had a little alcove, as well as a different color. In the center of the room was a pedestal. Looking up, you could see a white, ovular rock resting on the pedestal. It was a white and gray rock with dark circles on the top at peculiar positions. What was this rock for?<br />
<br />
What does the group do?</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: LemonChiffon">As they descended deeper and deeper into foreboding darkness, Kanna grew increasingly anxious from the seeming lack of any finish to the flight, paws padding nervously on each cold and clammy step as she wrinkled her nose from the overwhelming stench. To make matters even more difficult, Yufi kept daring to charge heedlessly ahead despite Kanna's calls to stay close.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Yufi, don't go too far! Stay where I can see you!&quot;</i><br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Don't worry, Mama! Look, it's okay~&quot;</i><br />
<br />
...She said, just as her foot slipped onto a slightly raised tile, as once again all three heard a <i>*click*</i> from sort of switch being activated. A glint in the shadows alerted Kief, who immediately dove to grab the oblivious Zigzagoon by the scruff and avoid a hail of arrows abruptly raining down through the hallway. Kanna shrieked as she scurried after them, in her panic pressing another plate that sent sharp blades swinging side to side in her path. With her wiry frame she managed to dodge fairly easily, but was still shaken as she stumbled dizzily next to Kief, nearly collapsing onto him for support. He set his bundle down briefly in order to attend to the frightened Furret, as Yufi wagged her tail, hopping up and down in excitement over the thrilling experience.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Whee! That was fun~&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Of course, as soon as she exclaimed this, her bum landed on another button - as all of a sudden torches illuminated above, extending all the way forward and back the way they came. While at first Kanna was relieved to finally have some light to guide by (besides the humble brightness of her necklace), the Furret froze as she heard a dull thump from behind, like the heavy weight of stone contacting concrete. Sisyphus must have been slacking, as all three turned to the sound and saw an enormous sphere slowly starting to roll towards them, swiftly picking up speed and fury as it slanted steeper down the slope.<br />
<br />
Kanna squeaked in terror as Kief once more snatched up Yufi, and the trio began racing for their dear lives down the incline, adrenaline fueling acrobatics as they danced nimbly between more darts and other dangers, narrowly escaping each shish kabob attempt. Still, if they weren't sliced to striped sashimi bits, they'd be flattened brown pancakes soon enough as their energy levels were fading fast from fleeing nonstop.<br />
<br />
Just then, a beam of salvation blinked ahead, and Kief barked as he put on an extra burst of <b>EXTREME SPEED</b>, dragging the exhausted Kanna after him as he tucked his body protectively around his partners, the three forming a fuzzy ball as they bounced down the last few feet of stairs and into a lit chamber. There was a loud crash following them as the pursuant globe lodged itself in the doorway; having failed to make flapjacks, it thus chose to entomb rather than consume its prey by preventing a return path.<br />
<br />
Yufi popped her head out first from the pile, once again grinning in exhilaration.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;That was so cool! Can we go again? Please?&quot;</i><br />
<br />
As Kief gently disentangled himself from a quivering Kanna, whose fur was still standing on end as she mumbled to herself in a daze, he scratched and shook his head.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;I think Mama needs a rest for now.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Aw...&quot;</i><br />
<br />
While they waited patiently for the Furret to recover her wits, the Linoone and Zigzagoon began to look around their current surroundings (investigating intently for signs of anything sparkly or shiny). There appeared to be three other outlets linked by bridges, so they weren't completely confined at least. Curiously, the corners of the room seemed to each contain a differently colored alcove, and in the center stood a pedestal which displayed a pearl-like orb with grey patches; clearly meant to tantalize any would-be treasure hunters despite its dreary appearance. Mesmerized by the monochrome marble, Yufi was about to eagerly approach when the Furret suddenly snapped out of her funk, maternal instinct outweighing her horror to take over instead.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Hold it, young lady. You're not going anywhere <b>near</b> that thing until Kief and I have properly checked for traps this time.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Yufi's ears drooped as she pouted, but obediently waited by the obstructed entrance as Kief and Kanna crept forward cautiously, exploring every inch of the area to scope out its safety; the former using his <b>ODOR SLEUTH</b> to sniff out any potential perils as the latter simultaneously scanned with intense <b>FORESIGHT</b>.</span></span></span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: lemonchiffon"><b>TheKnightsFury</b> - With Kojo and his blue haired Gardevoir both proving to be nuisances of the highest degree, it takes a bit of willpower to avoid snapping back at him or Mega Evolving you Blastoise, instead opting to close in in such a way that it'll be hard for the annoying Psychic type to avoid your attacks. A quick <b>Rapid Spin</b> sees Blastoise close the gap with ease inside his shell, slamming into the Gardevoir and putting him in good position for some follow up attacks. It's clear the Gardevoir is about as fed up with this fight as you are, though, as it raises both hands above its head in preparation for a massive attack.<br />
<br />
Then, out of the corner of your eye, a grey blur darts through the street, a sharp stabbing motion finding its way into the Gardevoir's side. The <b>Fake Out</b> does its job, effectively flinching the Psychic type, a small feline Pokemon with long claws made of steel and fur atop its head hardened into a natural helmet doing a quick flip off of your foe and landing atop Blastoise's still spinning shell, out of the way of the wide area covered by the <b>Hydro Pump</b> that erupts from the shell, the deluge blasting the Gardevoir into the building's wall as well as forcing Kojo to take cover behind a crate.<br />
<br />
The source of the new combatant can be seen heading down the street, the same guard you left behind earlier, now accompanied by three others as well as a woman that appears to be the medic requested by the captain. Pointing to the back alley and the flare still circling above it, the man makes a swift motion, the three other guards rushing down the alley in obedience, leaving just this guard and the nurse as your backup.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent work Perrserker, now finish it!&quot; The guard shouts, the feline happily obliging, producing a Steel Gem from its beard which promptly shatters as a massive amounts of energy surge from around the cat's body, a <b>Steel Beam</b> erupting from the Pokemon that looks capable of taking down the building itself. The Gardevoir takes the brunt of the blow, slumping to its knees for a moment from the absolutely incredible amount of damage before slowly attempting to stand, panic in its eyes as it looks around for its trainer, bursting into a sprint towards Kojo in an attempt to escape.<br />
<br />
&quot;It... it's still conscious? HOW?!&quot; The guardsman shouts in frustration, clearly never having had to have dealt with a foe of this caliber. Luckily, Blastoise is still in motion, as his cannons emerge from his body and loose a volley of <b>Sludge Bomb</b> around the attempted escapees. The concussive blasts land between Pokemon and trainer, sending Gardevoir and Kojo through the air in opposite directions, Gardevoir landing in the street, now properly unconscious, while Kojo slams against the nearby wall before collapsing to the floor in a heap.<br />
<br />
<i>Blastoise gained 1 level.</i><br />
<br />
The medic immediately rushes across the street, grabbing the ball out of Kojo's tight grasp and recalling the Gardevoir before examining the boy, &quot;He'll be okay... but he hit his head pretty hard. He might have a concussion.&quot;<br />
<br />
The guardsman laughs back for a moment, &quot;I'm sure he'll shake it off, a young buck like him,&quot; and then turns to you. &quot;Good work holding your ground here. Now let's get that bastard Ralph.&quot;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: royalblue"><b>ChrisClark13</b> - With Annahime poisoned you opt to stall your opponent for a moment while you heal the fox up, a flash of a <b>Confuse Ray</b> leaving the Grimer befuddled. Just befuddled enough that the pile of sludge can't seem to manage its orders well, slapping itself in the face for a moment. Sneaking up behind the fox, you spray her with the Super Potion, eliciting a yipping sound out of her as he spray does its work. It takes a moment of soothing, but she does manage to calm down for a moment to allow the healing process to take hold. Meanwhile, the Grimer is having difficulties still, smacking itself around a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; the ruffian shouts at you, &quot;Healing items are cheating!&quot;<br />
<br />
The old man blinks for a moment at the shout, &quot;...and how is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I don't have any!&quot;<br />
<br />
Between the small laughs of the old man, Annahime turns her attention back to her foe, loosing a <b>Will-O-Wisp</b> at the Grimer, the small flames leaving similar sized burns on the sludge. In this moment, the Grimer finally manages an attack, a <b>Headbutt</b> giving Annahime a good knock, though it's dampened a fair bit by the Grimer's inability to move much without hurting itself in any real capacity. Just then, the burns take hold, causing the Grimer to wince before collapsing, unconscious.<br />
<br />
<i>Annahime gained 1 level.</i><br />
<br />
Recalling the Grimer, the man sulks away in a huff. &quot;Fine. I'll just have to get some flowers in town...&quot;<br />
<br />
Climbing out from below the cart, the Eevee yips as the man in celebration, running happily around Annahime, who continues to suffer from her poisoned condition.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.&quot; The old man chuckles once more, &quot;That sure was something. Would never have guessed that he actually wanted to buy some of my flowers!&quot; The chuckle turns momentarily to true laughter before he pauses to catch his breath. &quot;But as I said, these aren't for sale. I've got a special purpose for this cart.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Eevee runs over to the old man once more, yipping out a quick &quot;Vee!&quot; which prompts him to lean down and allow the Eevee back onto his shoulder. &quot;Yes, yes, we should get going if we're going to find a good place to camp before we reach our next destination.&quot; Turning to you he motions towards the road. &quot;Why don't you heal up a bit and we'll get going? It's not too far away now from where I plan to stop for a rest.&quot;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: seagreen"><b>Missingno. Master</b> - Shocked by the ball being crushed to dust, shock turns to horror as the room shakes thanks to a Tectonic Rage that knocks Aster clean out, leaving Anion to finish off the Golurk, a job the Minun manages thanks to the low health of the golem. Shaking off the encounter you spy the hole that has been cleared by the Pokemon's powerful Z Move, leading directly into another room further into the cave. The Mage accompanying you seems to have the same idea, climbing through the hole and waving you in to progress. In here is another room familiar to you, this one lined with Mega Stones from wall to wall instead of Z Crystals.<br />
<br />
The Mage doesn't even have to do the busy work of grabbing you the necessary items this time, as four Mega Stones roll about the room lazily, with only two obvious divots for the stones to fit into, one on either end of the room to your left and right.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh great. Another puzzle.&quot; The Mage complains, &quot;It's always something with this cave. Tests and more tests.&quot;<br />
<br />
The four stones here all appear different in coloration, with one being of a yellow marble with a cream and grey swirl inside. The second one is a bright blue with the inner swirl predominantly pink and yellow with a slight twinge of orange. The third stone takes a brighter yellow color than the first, with an inner swirl of red and dark blue. Finally, the fourth is a pale blue that appears almost white in color, with the inner swirl taking on a color of pale green and two shades of pink. But which of these four are to fit in the two slots available?</span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: royalblue">Curtis watches, somewhat in awe, as the Grimer just gets completely wrecked by the combination of Confusion and Burn. He'd have to remember to start with that combo more often.<br />
<br />
At the old man's comment about the ruffian wanting flowers, Curtis comments. &quot;Huh, he could've just said so- but I guess he wanted a battle more than he wanted the flowers. You know, maybe he was trying to get them for free? Could be that he's broke- but this wasn't an official battle or anything so I wouldn't have given him any money anyways.&quot; Curtis stands up fully just so he can pound his right fist into his left palm, &quot;and even then I would've had to get back at him for beating up Annahime!&quot;<br />
<br />
Speaking of Annahime, he then realizes that she's still poisoned when she can't even half-heartedly bat at the Eevee without stumbling. &quot;Ah, yeah. Lemme just check her over and I'll be right along!&quot; Curtis grabs the Antidote from his pocket and starts spraying it over his poor, poor fox. Luckily, this one doesn't sting as bad when it touches her injuries since it's just neutralizing the poison. Once the bottle is empty, Curtis stuffs it back into his pocket (pack your waste with you and all that) and picks his fussy fox like a baby so he can get a good look at her belly. Okay, doesn't seem like any injuries there... he flips her over onto his shoulder and runs a hand carefully through her fur to check for bruises and injuries. Maybe it's just due to the Super Potion, but she's a lot less hurt than she seemed in the end- giving how much she was barking and whining during the fight. &quot;It's okay, it's okay, you're fine now... who's a good girl, you're a good girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Annahime lets out a small (and unfortunately cute) grumble as her idiot trainer pokes and prods and fusses over her like she's some kind of baby. She nips at his gloved fingers and growls louder, but he just grabs her snout and wiggles it like he's playing with her! Finally, he puts her back on his shoulder- though given how exhausted she feels from walking earlier and that fight just now she elects to instead just drape herself over his neck.<br />
<br />
Curtis continues on with the baby talk as he gives the Vulpix a few scritches behind the ears, &quot;Aww, she's all tucked out.&quot; He goes back over to his backpack, cleaning out his pockets before putting it back on. Speaking more normally now, he feeds her a couple of treats from his pocket, &quot;You did great out there Annahime. I thought we might actually lose there, but you pulled through!&quot; It seems she enjoys the praise gives Curtis a little lick on the cheek before resuming acting like a floppy scarf.<br />
<br />
With a chuckle, he walks back over to the old man, &quot;Sorry if I took too long, had to make sure she's okay and all that. Ready to go now...&quot; Curtis trails off as he reaches into his pockets once more and pulls out a couple of fox treats before offering them to the Eevee, &quot;...and before we get going, these are for our little friend here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Annahime groans weakly in protest when she realizes <i><b>her treats</b></i> are being <b><i>shared</i></b>. Oh whatever, fine. Take them you little lazy brown thing. Didn't even help at all in the fight. Annahime does her best to ignore this scene and doze off.<br />
<br />
And with a sleepy six-tailed fox on his shoulders, Curtis set off with the old man.</span><br />

<span style="color: royalblue"><b>Mask</b>: The scale of the palace slowly begins to properly dawn as you ascend the stairs. You feel tiny in comparison, the fleeting moment of insignificance chased away as you reaffirm your intent. Your gaze quickly adjust to the glaring white sheen of marble, and you continue to drink in the awe-striking architecture. Finally, you reach the gate, a cavernous yet minutely detailed spectacle. You saunter through - but as you do, you are stopped by two guards. <br />
<br />
Their armour is far less flashy than you may have otherwise expected. A fairly muted affair; practical, tempered leather covers their bodies from head to toe, The black leather is accented in places with a brown tan for various straps, while polished pauklrons guard each shoulder. Their somewhat more ornate helms covered all but their eyes and lower face - though there was little emotion to be read there, a professional steeliness stuck hard. The one flourish of colour lays with a darkly intense blue scarf, a clear indication of their employ. After a few cursory glances, the pair nod in approval, ushering you into the main foyer. <br />
<br />
To be sure, where the entrance impressed, the interior floored. The royal insignia stretches out before you, the image emblazoned as first impression on the mind of any visitors. The circular room opened at the opposite end to a corridor which thrust further into the castle, the beckoning doors inviting you - and any other casual guests. However, you had a specific goal, rather than simple sightseeing. Observing the situation, it became evident you had a number of options. <br />
<br />
You could simply ask the guards for audience with the king, or you could attempt something clandestine and try happen upon him yourself. Of course, exploring the public areas of the palace was also an option - there was nothing guaranteeing another avenue wouldn't present itself to you.</span>

<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: royalblue">The castle - or at the very least, the hall he was allowed to see - was nothing short of imposing. It was the first time in his journey that Kou had witnessed such grandeur; most settlements of the world had moved on from castles and kings, and none of the Gyms he'd visited in his travels even attempted to emulate such magnificent construction either.<br />
<br />
Kou was very particular about his path as a Trainer. His entire way of thinking was particular. He had to do things &quot;right&quot;, as he had been taught - there was a proper way of doing them, after all. It was the reason why, despite seven years of journeying, he only had three Pokemon companions thus far. It was also the reason why the local Gym was always the first place he visited in any new location or, failing that, the authority figure of the settlement.<br />
<br />
Compelled as he felt to wander off on his own and discover this magnificent imperial castle, an overwhelming sense of duty guided his steps. Shifting his attention to the nearby guards, he cleared his throat and addressed them as he bowed respectfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings. I am Kou, a Trainer from Celadon City, in Kanto. I would like to offer my services to the ruling authority of this land; what should I do to be granted an audience?&quot;<br />
<br />
It felt admittedly silly, asking things this way. Why should a random foreigner be granted an audience with the single most important person in this kingdom at the drop of a proverbial hat?<br />
<br />
“You see, I… It was how I was taught. <i>Always be ready to prove your worth</i>, so said my father.”<br />
<br />
Kou fell silent. He wasn’t sure he was doing himself any favors with this line of argument.</span></div>

((Sorry if I misinterpreted your orders, took me a bit to get around the wording))<br />
<br />
Moody is a powerful Ability, but it's also unpredictable. Not without its drawbacks, you reason that the increased speed must have come the cost of either strength or bulk, and therein might lie the opening you need to turn the situation around.<br />
<br />
Your orders are methodical, sequential as if part of a finely tuned clockwork mechanism that can't be disrupted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren't you a tad bit overconfident?&quot; casually asks David while Octillery, faster than before, shifts its gaze from the trapped Timburr to the rushing Yamask. &quot;We've seen that trick before!&quot;<br />
<br />
A green, spherical shield envelops the octopus, stopping your ghost's Astonish dead in its tracks. Stunned, Yamask has no time to react as Octillery retaliates with a near point-blank Octazooka! The force of the blast sends Yamask flying back several feet, although fortunately it manages to retain consciousness.<br />
<br />
Despite this setback, your instinct ultimately proves correct - the lack of superior suction cups, the distraction provided by Yamask and the constant struggle by Timburr cause the Wrap's gap to weaken just enough for the Fighting-Type to free itself and land a straight punch on David's powerhouse!<br />
<br />
The force of the blow causes Octillery to release its grasp on Timburr completely; it falls to the ground, panting from the tremendous effort to break free, while Yamask begins to float in midair again, still rattled from the attack, with noticeably wobbly movements.<br />
<br />
Your team seems worse for wear than David's single Pokemon. You know some new change must have already occurred in its attributes, swayed by its mood, but you can't quite tell what it was - the fact it wasn't particularly fazed by the punch but couldn't knock out Yamask with such a close range Octazooka suggests its defense remains solid but its power might have decreased...<br />
<br />
Wrap, Octazooka and Protect - you have already seen three fourths of Octillery's arsenal. David seems to be waiting for you to make a new move, his style apparently based around counter-attacking rather than rushing head-on in preemptive offense...<br />
<br />
What will you do now?<br />

Despite its hesitation to strike, there is no way you'll lower your guard in the face of a wild Mightyena baring its fangs at one of your closest companions. The beast growls ominously at Stryke, who in turn stands at attention with its blades extended. Embers start to escape Gazza's feathers. All in all, it's a tense moment that seems to go on forever...<br />
<br />
Then, suddenly, another loud noise echoes through the clearing - another howl, for certain, but this one is filled with a deep tone of anguish that even you, a human, can easily sense. The wild Mightyena's ears perk up and it turns its back to you with a quick jump. Concerned, it dashes deep into the mist, vanishing from sight, and it rushes off toward the source of the noise.<br />
<br />
Then, after a brief moment, everything goes quiet. The pink mist clears up slightly despite not clearing completely, at least where you're standing. As it does, you notice several bones scattered across the forest ground, all quite small and chewed clean - probably leftovers from that Mightyena's last meal. But there are way too many of them...<br />
<br />
*&quot;Too much death.&quot;*<br />
<br />
A voice echoes in your head. Booming, powerful. Looking around, you simply can't tell where it is coming from. And judging by your Pokemon’s lack of reaction, you’re the only one who heard it.<br />
<br />
*&quot;There is imbalance. They kill too much. Will you be my Champion?&quot;*<br />
<br />
Then, silence once more. You feel as if the voice is waiting for an answer.<br />
<br />
With so little to go on, what will you say?<br />
