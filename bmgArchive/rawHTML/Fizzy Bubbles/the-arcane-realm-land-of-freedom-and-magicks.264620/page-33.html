<span style="color: seagreen"><b>Missingno. Master</b> - Shocked by the ball being crushed to dust, shock turns to horror as the room shakes thanks to a Tectonic Rage that knocks Aster clean out, leaving Anion to finish off the Golurk, a job the Minun manages thanks to the low health of the golem. Shaking off the encounter you spy the hole that has been cleared by the Pokemon's powerful Z Move, leading directly into another room further into the cave. The Mage accompanying you seems to have the same idea, climbing through the hole and waving you in to progress. In here is another room familiar to you, this one lined with Mega Stones from wall to wall instead of Z Crystals.<br />
<br />
The Mage doesn't even have to do the busy work of grabbing you the necessary items this time, as four Mega Stones roll about the room lazily, with only two obvious divots for the stones to fit into, one on either end of the room to your left and right.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh great. Another puzzle.&quot; The Mage complains, &quot;It's always something with this cave. Tests and more tests.&quot;<br />
<br />
The four stones here all appear different in coloration, with one being of a yellow marble with a cream and grey swirl inside. The second one is a bright blue with the inner swirl predominantly pink and yellow with a slight twinge of orange. The third stone takes a brighter yellow color than the first, with an inner swirl of red and dark blue. Finally, the fourth is a pale blue that appears almost white in color, with the inner swirl taking on a color of pale green and two shades of pink. But which of these four are to fit in the two slots available?</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: SeAgReEn">The battle against Golurk could have easily gone a lot smoother, but it also could have gone worse. And right now, it left them with a way forward, and Keith would gladly take that. Except, as it turned out, this led them straight into another puzzle. &quot;Not another one!&quot; Meowth exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, no time to complain about it now,&quot; Keith stated, already scooping up the Mega Stones. &quot;Four Mega Stones, two slots. OK... Meowth, you wanna help with this?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dey's Mega Stones. Dey're shiny. Dat's all I got,&quot; Meowth snarked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, worked that much out for myself, as it happens,&quot; Keith retorted. &quot;Look, my hands are full with these things- dig my Pokédex outta my pocket, see if we can identify these Mega Stones, get an idea what we're working with here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gotcha,&quot; Meowth replied, nimbly climbing down Keith, fishing his Pokédex out of his pants pocket, and returning to his usual spot on the man's shoulder. &quot;Alright, hold 'em up,&quot; he said, opening the device and working the buttons with the precision of a skilled Technician. Keith did as instructed, and Meowth started to scan the Mega Stones. &quot;Alright, contestant numba one... dat's a Kangaskhanite,&quot; Meowth stated, pointing to the yellow Mega Stone with the cream and grey swirl. &quot;And lessee here... Second one's a Medichamite,&quot; he declared, pointing to the bright blue Mega Stone with the pink, yellow, and very slightly orange swirl. &quot;And behind door numba tree... yep, dis one's a Gyaradosite,&quot; he reported, now gesturing to the bright yellow one with the red and dark blue swirl. &quot;And last but not least... dat's a Gardevoirite,&quot; he finished, with a glance at the pale blue Mega Stone with a swirl combining pale green with varying shades of pink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kangaskhanite, Medichamite, Gyaradosite, Gardevoirite,&quot; Keith murmured, deep in thought. &quot;And only two slots... so which Mega Stones to go with? If it's got to do with type matchups...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wat if it's just types in common?&quot; Meowth wondered out loud. &quot;Medicham and Gardevoir are both Psychic-types, ain't nuttin' else outta dese four wat dat shares a type.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... yeah, that's true,&quot; Keith nodded. &quot;Y'know what, Meowth? Best theory we got, so let's roll with it.&quot; With that, he strolled over to the left side of the room and placed the Gardevoirite in that divot, then over to the right side, and into that divot went the Medichamite. And back Keith went, keeping a wary eye out. &quot;Meowth, Anion, be ready for anything,&quot; he instructed his Meowth and Minun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gotcha,&quot; Meowth nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mai mai,&quot; agreed Anion. After that Golurk, Anion wasn't about to underestimate anything else this place was prepared to throw their way.</span></div>

<span style="color: lemonchiffon"><b>TheKnightsFury</b> - With Kojo and his blue haired Gardevoir both proving to be nuisances of the highest degree, it takes a bit of willpower to avoid snapping back at him or Mega Evolving you Blastoise, instead opting to close in in such a way that it'll be hard for the annoying Psychic type to avoid your attacks. A quick <b>Rapid Spin</b> sees Blastoise close the gap with ease inside his shell, slamming into the Gardevoir and putting him in good position for some follow up attacks. It's clear the Gardevoir is about as fed up with this fight as you are, though, as it raises both hands above its head in preparation for a massive attack.<br />
<br />
Then, out of the corner of your eye, a grey blur darts through the street, a sharp stabbing motion finding its way into the Gardevoir's side. The <b>Fake Out</b> does its job, effectively flinching the Psychic type, a small feline Pokemon with long claws made of steel and fur atop its head hardened into a natural helmet doing a quick flip off of your foe and landing atop Blastoise's still spinning shell, out of the way of the wide area covered by the <b>Hydro Pump</b> that erupts from the shell, the deluge blasting the Gardevoir into the building's wall as well as forcing Kojo to take cover behind a crate.<br />
<br />
The source of the new combatant can be seen heading down the street, the same guard you left behind earlier, now accompanied by three others as well as a woman that appears to be the medic requested by the captain. Pointing to the back alley and the flare still circling above it, the man makes a swift motion, the three other guards rushing down the alley in obedience, leaving just this guard and the nurse as your backup.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent work Perrserker, now finish it!&quot; The guard shouts, the feline happily obliging, producing a Steel Gem from its beard which promptly shatters as a massive amounts of energy surge from around the cat's body, a <b>Steel Beam</b> erupting from the Pokemon that looks capable of taking down the building itself. The Gardevoir takes the brunt of the blow, slumping to its knees for a moment from the absolutely incredible amount of damage before slowly attempting to stand, panic in its eyes as it looks around for its trainer, bursting into a sprint towards Kojo in an attempt to escape.<br />
<br />
&quot;It... it's still conscious? HOW?!&quot; The guardsman shouts in frustration, clearly never having had to have dealt with a foe of this caliber. Luckily, Blastoise is still in motion, as his cannons emerge from his body and loose a volley of <b>Sludge Bomb</b> around the attempted escapees. The concussive blasts land between Pokemon and trainer, sending Gardevoir and Kojo through the air in opposite directions, Gardevoir landing in the street, now properly unconscious, while Kojo slams against the nearby wall before collapsing to the floor in a heap.<br />
<br />
<i>Blastoise gained 1 level.</i><br />
<br />
The medic immediately rushes across the street, grabbing the ball out of Kojo's tight grasp and recalling the Gardevoir before examining the boy, &quot;He'll be okay... but he hit his head pretty hard. He might have a concussion.&quot;<br />
<br />
The guardsman laughs back for a moment, &quot;I'm sure he'll shake it off, a young buck like him,&quot; and then turns to you. &quot;Good work holding your ground here. Now let's get that bastard Ralph.&quot;</span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: lemonchiffon">Just when it looked like Gardevoir was gearing up for a finishing blow, the cavalry arrived. In the chaos it took Xander a moment to identify their saviour, but as his muddled mind began to process, he realised it was a Perrserker. The steel cat was impressive, Faking out the Psychic type, giving them an opening. A Hydro Pump and a Steel Beam weren't enough to put the Gardevoir down, but thankfully Sludge Bomb finished the job. Kojo was knocked out in the chaos, but thankfully he wasn't too hurt. As much as Xander now hated the boy, he now had quite a few experiences with head knocks and knew how they boy would likely be feeling once he came to......</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #fffacd">One of the guardsman snapped him back onto task, Ralph still needed to be brought to justice. After what Kojo had thrown at him, Xander wasn't about to underestimate Ralph. That said, his Pokemon were in rather bad condition. Rookidee was sporting a burn, Dreepy and Toxtricity were unconscious. Blastoise and Grookey were his best options. Xander released the Grass Starter from his Friend Ball, before promptly ordering Blastoise to heal them all with a </span><b><span style="color: lemonchiffon">Life Dew. </span></b><span style="color: #fffacd">&quot;I don't know if that Life Dew will be enough&quot;, Xander commented to the medic, &quot;that kid managed to knock out two of my Pokemon and another is badly burned, can you offer any assistance?&quot; Xander waited for the medic's reply. He looked up above the building, where Delphox's signal flare still twisted in the air. Was Ralph actually fighting around the back of the building, or was he just keeping the commander busy while Kojo softened up Xander and his Pokemon. He had a feeling the crook would reveal himself soon. Xander also remember he still had Ralph's Zigzagoon in his possession, perhaps he could offload it to on of the guardsman now?</span><br />

Annahime isn't exactly happy about the fact that you offer up <i>her</i> precious treats so willingly towards the other vulpine, but begrudgingly accepts it for now, lazily draping herself around your neck as you walk further along the road with the old man.<br />
<br />
The old man is quiet for the majority of the walk, solemnly watching over his cart full of flowers as though the lot of them could wilt and die at any moment. He only perks up when he spies a bit of a turn in the road as the sun begins going down, just off the road lying a large area with naught but dirt, clearly used as a regular camping ground in the walk between the Hamlet and the City of Pentacles.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can camp here for the night,&quot; he sighs as he wheels his cart over to the area, taking off his pack and pulling out a couple thin blankets, laying them atop each other for a place to rest on. The Eevee gladly makes itself cozy in the fabric, looking around for any predators before lying down for a bit. As the old man begins to get comfortable, a realization dawns on him. &quot;Oh dear. I was expecting others to have set up camp here already, but it looks like we won't be having any other guests with us tonight.&quot; Searching through his pack for a moment he turns to you, &quot;And I neglected to bring anything usable for kindling, let alone a proper campfire.&quot;<br />
<br />
The area you've walked along the road so far has largely been fields, without much in the ways of trees to use for wood. Surely there must be a way to sustain a fire for most of the night?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: seagreen"><b>Missingno. Master</b> - Scooping up the Mega Stones and getting to work instead of complaining the the Mage you brought here for... some reason, you hold up each stone while Meowth pages through your Pokedex, attempting to identify each by sight. Listing off the group as a Kangaskhanite, Medichamite, Gyaradosite, and Gardevoirite, a brief discussion is in order to determine what goes where. With precious few clues from the walls here aside from only being given two slots to work with, it's decided that this still has something to do with types as the last set of indentations did. Meowth's theory of types in common is picked up on, and soon enough the Medichamite and Gardevoirite are selected and placed carefully in the two slots available to you.<br />
<br />
For a moment, nothing seems to occur, but soon and sure enough the remaining Mega Stones you hold begin glowing brightly as the walls themselves light up with the stones set throughout them. The remaining two stones become hot with energy, too hot to hold in fact, causing them to clatter to the ground before rolling towards the back wall and giving a similar reaction to the Z Crystal in the previous room. Shattering and expanding in a cascade of lights, two forms begin to take shape before you. The first is that of a Kangaskhan, which promptly erupts in further light, its joey jumping from its pouch as the Pokemon Mega Evolves before your eyes. The second, however, is not the expected Gyarados that the stone would have seemed to be. Instead, a small, hunched, humanoid form takes shape, that of a Sableye. Like the Kangaskhan, this Pokemon also erupts in light, a gem from its body springing forth and growing massive in size, clutched by the Sableye as it takes on its Mega Evolved form.<br />
<br />
The Mega Pokemon stand between you and the far wall, watching you expectantly, quite unlike the Golurk in the previous room. It would seem they are more than content in letting you take your time as they bar you from progressing further.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: lemonchiffon"><b>TheKnightsFury</b> - Opting to stay outside for a moment in preparation to confront Ralph if he still remains inside, your release Grookey from his Friend Ball once more as Blastoise releases a <b>Life Dew</b> over the area, effectively pepping itself and Grookey back up a bit. Noting that it might not be enough to get you up and running, you ask the medic for any assistance she can provide as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, of course, of course!&quot; The medic jumps to her feet for a moment after examining Kojo, releasing a Blissey from a Friend Ball of its own. The Blissey rushes over to your team, covering your team in a <b>Life Dew</b> of its own without even needing prompting as it notices the still somewhat sorry state of your squad. At least now they look pretty well off and ready for combat again. The woman, setting Kojo carefully on the ground and elevating his head, walks over to you. &quot;Alright, let's have a look at you as well,&quot; presenting a first aid kit from her pack she begins prodding along your arms and back before a sharp poke to the back of your head elicits a fair bit of pain. &quot;Yikes. And I thought the kid took a nasty blow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Digging into the first aid kit she produces a <b>Nevermeltice</b> and hands it to you, &quot;Keep that on for a while to keep the swelling down,&quot; she chimes nicely, as if you were a child even younger than the one now laying on the ground out cold, before realizing you are in fact not that young and snapping at you for a moment, &quot;And go sit down! You've already done more than enough!&quot;<br />
<br />
The sudden shout elicits a laugh from the guard still remaining with you, who attempts to take the Zigzagoon from you only for the Pokemon to bark out a quick yip and jump from his arms and run back to you, clearly concerned for your well being. But before any rest can be had the commotion out back comes to a full stop, only for a loud crash to be heard inside, followed by quick shouting.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're under arrest you son of a-&quot;<br />
<br />
And then silence.<br />
<br />
Moments later, the guard captain emerges through the curtain covering the front entrance, looks around at the state of things calmly, and promptly loses it, ripping the curtain clean off the doorway. &quot;Dammit!&quot; Taking a moment to compose himself, he sighs dejectedly and walks back into the building, signaling for the lot of you to follow. &quot;A whole slew of lackeys to keep us busy and the boss is nowhere to be seen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Inside the guards that went around back are ransacking the room, with a fair bit of commotion from the back room signaling similar discourse. The entire place is quickly becoming a mess as items are ripped from the walls and out of drawers and strewn about the room as they are discarded by guards finding them useless. But two things near the table catch your attention, thanks to the Zigzagoon running over to the before yipping at you. The map Ralph showed you earlier, rolled up neatly and tied with lace, as well as a familiar looking Premier Ball. Or at least, what's left of it, mere shards of metal smashed to pieces and strewn around the table, the sad source of Zigzagoon's attention to the items.</span></div>

<article class="message-body js-selectToQuote">
<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: seagreen"><b>Liltwick</b> – Your mind reels are you rant off questions and complaints in rapid-fire, and the Kadabra takes them all in with calm. It then begins simply enough by confirming your first suspicion.<br />
<br />
<i>“Indeed, this is the ‘Forest of Wands’, as so named by your species. Unfortunately, this host’s power has been significantly drained by my sister’s machinations, so I was not able to take us far. However, the magic here runs deep, and will shield us from my sister’s eyes for a while as this vessel recovers its mana reserves in the meantime.”</i><br />
<br />
Seeing you raise an eyebrow at the third person expression, it continues on in a detached manner.<br />
<br />
<i>“As you may have surmised, the spirit with whom you are currently communicating is not Kadabra’s. My sister and I at the moment are but projecting our souls, whilst our original forms still sleep safely beneath the water’s surface. As for our identities… You may perhaps know us best by our modern monikers: I am Uxie, Keeper of Knowledge, and the one you saw before was Mesprit, Bringer of Emotion.”</i><br />
<br />
It bows before you in civil introduction, as your jaw drops upon realizing you are in fact faced with an ancient creature of myth; albeit as a mere shadow, like a mirror’s misted reflection. But if they were only two members of the Legendary Lake Trio, that meant the third…?<br />
<br />
<i>“Not long ago, poachers came to disturb our bed of rest. Only their intent was not to capture, but hunt us for sport and claim our jewels as trophies. My sister Azelf was awakened first from her slumber and tried to flee, but ultimately perished at the poacher’s hands. Hence why my other sister and I have taken measures to prevent physical harm to our own bodies through this indirect method of interaction.”</i><br />
<br />
Though it still speaks with an eerily dispassionate and impartial tone – cold and concise, like succinctly summarizing a scientific proof – “Kadabra” closes its eyes as it recounts the tale, thus resembling its true persona upon recalling what is surely a painful memory.<br />
<br />
<i>“You may be aware of how our existence serves to maintain control over the rulers of Time and Space, Dialga and Palkia. With one link of the Red Chain broken, the beasts have already begun to run rampant. You’ve no doubt heard of the rift that has opened near the place you call ‘New Fizz City’, allowing travelers to pass through its gate to eras memoriam. While an issue in itself, it is not one of pressing concern for the time being. The rip is small and can be easily repaired. Rather, my sister’s grief and rage-fueled rampage may result in this universe’s unraveling even before the tear has a chance to grow.”</i><br />
<br />
It then points up at the sky, which even through the filtered treetop canopy you can tell is much darker than before, as if the sun is slowly being consumed by shade.<br />
<br />
<i>“If Mesprit is able to complete her mourning ritual, then the ‘dragon who swallows the sun’ shall arise and wreak its vengeance for being sealed away. The only way to defeat it is by gathering three sacred relics: the Mirror, the Sword, and the Stone. …As luck would have it, the Sword is said to lie somewhere within these very woods.” </i><br />
<br />
It then lowers its gaze back towards you, wearing a sympathetic but solemn countenance.<br />
<br />
<i>“I apologize for getting you involved in all this. For myself, I bear no particular hatred towards humans. However, my sister has allowed Emotion to cloud her judgment. Without Willpower, she knows naught but to throw a tantrum like a child. She forgets her duty and wishes death upon this world before its appointed time. …For you see, our roles perform another purpose.”</i><br />
<br />
To illustrate its point, it snaps its fingers, and the thin crimson wire from before appears again in the air, faint but thankfully intact as it hums and hangs from the heart still beating strong behind your breast.<br />
<br />
<i>“All beings possess a lifeline which was spun by Azelf before birth. I measure the thread to determine the length allotted, and Mesprit cuts the cord when that creature’s time is up. This world too, has a lifeline of its own. That is how I know it is not yet destined to die. Though she is unable to terminate it alone at this time, if the serpent is successfully summoned then all is lost.”</i><br />
<br />
It flicks once more, and the strand dispels.<br />
<br />
<i>“What you choose to do now is up to you. As I’ve stated, I have no personal quarrel with your kind as a whole, and recognize as an individual you share zero responsibility in instigating or resolving any wrongdoing; so you may leave at any time if you so desire. …However, it pains me to admit this, but with this weakened state I doubt I will be able to sense the Sword’s presence on my own, let alone fend off an attack if she finds out what I’m up to. Since she herself has been feeding off the abundant magic in this realm by harnessing its ley lines, it’s only a matter of time before she is able to track my energy trail. Truth be told, I could use some assistance.”</i><br />
<br />
How do you reply?</span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: royalblue">Curtis himself starts taking his camping gear out of his backpack, pulling out a small tent, a sleeping bag, an inflatable sleeping mat, a portable gas stove, a gas can for the said stove, and a mess kit- pretty much everything a modern camper (or Trainer) would bring along. He lets the sleeping gear sit on the ground for now as he eagerly pours some water into a tea kettle and sets it to boil. He sits down and picking through a small selection of dehydrated camping foods as he waits. Trying to figure out what he and Annahime would like best.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the Vulpix in question slinks off of her Trainer's shoulders and lays down to rest until the tent is set up. She lazily watches the blue fire of the camping stove, staring into the tiny flames and watching how they flicker. This day had been... interesting. Her and her trainer's first time going out adventuring and all that. She didn't expect there to be quite so much walking though... and especially not for her trainer to try and force her to do so much of it. And now, here she is sitting in the dirt, why couldn't they have just stayed home...?<br />
<br />
Curtis similarly, is lost in thought for a moment- though instead, he's still trying to think about what tasty meal he wants the most. He's got it narrowed down to the Sweet and Sour Pork or the Rice and Alolan-cooked Chicken. When the old man speaks up, Curtis looks over and realizes that he doesn't have much of anything to rest on or even eat. Where's his tent, his traveling food? Oh... he doesn't have much, does he?<br />
<br />
Curtis looks down to his selection of premium camping foods his parents paid then grabs the lot as he stands up to go sit down next to the man, &quot;Well, I don't have anything for a campfire either- but I do have that stove over there and these here,&quot; Curtis holds up the camping food bags, &quot;I also have a small cooking pot if you wanna make something... Oh, and if you're worried about getting cold you can just use my sleeping bag I guess. Between Annahime over there and this fursuit, I usually just end up sleeping on top of it anyways.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, what do we need a campfire for anyways?&quot; Curtis jokes.</span></div>

((Sorry if I misinterpreted your orders, took me a bit to get around the wording))<br />
<br />
Moody is a powerful Ability, but it's also unpredictable. Not without its drawbacks, you reason that the increased speed must have come the cost of either strength or bulk, and therein might lie the opening you need to turn the situation around.<br />
<br />
Your orders are methodical, sequential as if part of a finely tuned clockwork mechanism that can't be disrupted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren't you a tad bit overconfident?&quot; casually asks David while Octillery, faster than before, shifts its gaze from the trapped Timburr to the rushing Yamask. &quot;We've seen that trick before!&quot;<br />
<br />
A green, spherical shield envelops the octopus, stopping your ghost's Astonish dead in its tracks. Stunned, Yamask has no time to react as Octillery retaliates with a near point-blank Octazooka! The force of the blast sends Yamask flying back several feet, although fortunately it manages to retain consciousness.<br />
<br />
Despite this setback, your instinct ultimately proves correct - the lack of superior suction cups, the distraction provided by Yamask and the constant struggle by Timburr cause the Wrap's gap to weaken just enough for the Fighting-Type to free itself and land a straight punch on David's powerhouse!<br />
<br />
The force of the blow causes Octillery to release its grasp on Timburr completely; it falls to the ground, panting from the tremendous effort to break free, while Yamask begins to float in midair again, still rattled from the attack, with noticeably wobbly movements.<br />
<br />
Your team seems worse for wear than David's single Pokemon. You know some new change must have already occurred in its attributes, swayed by its mood, but you can't quite tell what it was - the fact it wasn't particularly fazed by the punch but couldn't knock out Yamask with such a close range Octazooka suggests its defense remains solid but its power might have decreased...<br />
<br />
Wrap, Octazooka and Protect - you have already seen three fourths of Octillery's arsenal. David seems to be waiting for you to make a new move, his style apparently based around counter-attacking rather than rushing head-on in preemptive offense...<br />
<br />
What will you do now?</span>

<br />
<span style="color: plum">Darik's tactic working as planned, even if the entire exchange didn't, and the duo's ability to pull it off seemed to ignite something new within both the Pokemon, some new confidence surging in both of them. Despite Yamask getting battered and Timburr having recently been a victim of the Octillery's tentacles, they both had a new twinkle in their eyes. an important belief in themselves that was a necessary piece of being a good combatant. But that was only half of it, Darik had to do his part as well, and he was running low on tricks with the more shallow movepools the pair currently had to offer.<br />
<br />
What did he have going for him currently? The Octillery's innate ability was a glaring one, of course. That inky beam of his should have been more powerful than it ended up being, and Timburr's retaliatory strike seemed to likewise not have had much of an effect. They had a Snorunt back at the preserve, with the same ability trait, and she was notoriously difficult to work with, the sheer unreliability of the trait making it impossible to maintain a consistent fighting style. An all-out offensive could be crippled at a moment's notice, a defensive stance could find itself broken through by sheer chance.<br />
<br />
He had it. It wasn't about tricks now. They say that the definition of insanity is trying the same thing over and over, expecting different results, but when random chance was a factor, sometimes that's the smartest, sanest thing to do. This Octillery was clearly trained defensively, reacting instead of acting, but that ability of his made it very likely he'd miss vital timing, or leave an opening slightly too wide, to be taken advantage of given time. Darik had to be rigid, consistent, and if his Pokemon could maintain it long enough, they'd be able to break through.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yamask, keep distance and throw out two Energy Balls. Timburr, keep forward and deal two Power-Up Punches. Y'all already know what to do if it tries to intercept you with its tentacles.&quot;</span></div>

<span style="color: lemonchiffon"><b>TheKnightsFury</b> - Opting to stay outside for a moment in preparation to confront Ralph if he still remains inside, your release Grookey from his Friend Ball once more as Blastoise releases a <b>Life Dew</b> over the area, effectively pepping itself and Grookey back up a bit. Noting that it might not be enough to get you up and running, you ask the medic for any assistance she can provide as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, of course, of course!&quot; The medic jumps to her feet for a moment after examining Kojo, releasing a Blissey from a Friend Ball of its own. The Blissey rushes over to your team, covering your team in a <b>Life Dew</b> of its own without even needing prompting as it notices the still somewhat sorry state of your squad. At least now they look pretty well off and ready for combat again. The woman, setting Kojo carefully on the ground and elevating his head, walks over to you. &quot;Alright, let's have a look at you as well,&quot; presenting a first aid kit from her pack she begins prodding along your arms and back before a sharp poke to the back of your head elicits a fair bit of pain. &quot;Yikes. And I thought the kid took a nasty blow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Digging into the first aid kit she produces a <b>Nevermeltice</b> and hands it to you, &quot;Keep that on for a while to keep the swelling down,&quot; she chimes nicely, as if you were a child even younger than the one now laying on the ground out cold, before realizing you are in fact not that young and snapping at you for a moment, &quot;And go sit down! You've already done more than enough!&quot;<br />
<br />
The sudden shout elicits a laugh from the guard still remaining with you, who attempts to take the Zigzagoon from you only for the Pokemon to bark out a quick yip and jump from his arms and run back to you, clearly concerned for your well being. But before any rest can be had the commotion out back comes to a full stop, only for a loud crash to be heard inside, followed by quick shouting.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're under arrest you son of a-&quot;<br />
<br />
And then silence.<br />
<br />
Moments later, the guard captain emerges through the curtain covering the front entrance, looks around at the state of things calmly, and promptly loses it, ripping the curtain clean off the doorway. &quot;Dammit!&quot; Taking a moment to compose himself, he sighs dejectedly and walks back into the building, signaling for the lot of you to follow. &quot;A whole slew of lackeys to keep us busy and the boss is nowhere to be seen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Inside the guards that went around back are ransacking the room, with a fair bit of commotion from the back room signaling similar discourse. The entire place is quickly becoming a mess as items are ripped from the walls and out of drawers and strewn about the room as they are discarded by guards finding them useless. But two things near the table catch your attention, thanks to the Zigzagoon running over to the before yipping at you. The map Ralph showed you earlier, rolled up neatly and tied with lace, as well as a familiar looking Premier Ball. Or at least, what's left of it, mere shards of metal smashed to pieces and strewn around the table, the sad source of Zigzagoon's attention to the items.</span>

Xander was pleased as the medic quickly jumped to his aid. Her Blissey's Life Dew supplements Blastoise's, helping to restore his team. The medic then made her way over to give him a once over. Her poking and prodding was rather painless, until she poked at the back of his head. &quot;Fuck&quot;, Xander spat, two blows to the back of the head would do that! She handed Xander a Nevermeltice, which he happily accepted and held to the back of his head. She also requested that he go sit down, but that certainly wasn't going to happen. Speaking of things that weren't happening, Zigzagoon refused to go with the guardsman. The little thief seemed intent on staying with Xander. Such a response puzzled the young trainer. Why would it want to stay with him? He'd blindsided it and used it against its master, it owed him no allegiance.....<br />
<br />
Everything happened so quickly. They watched with eyes fixed on the front entrance, only for the captain to rip through the curtain empty handed. It seemed Ralph had managed to slip away. How had he managed such a feat? He'd told Xander that there was only one way in and one way out of the building, but perhaps he had a secret getaway passage? Xander made his way inside. The guards were tearing the place apart for any sign of Ralph. Zigzagoon quickly brought his attention to two items. The map that Ralph had shown him, as well as Zigzagoon's Premier Ball which was now smashed to pieces. That was certainly one way to release a Pokemon. Did Ralph blame Zigzagoon for the raid? Perhaps he didn't overly care about the little thief? Motive aside, Zigzagoon looked devastated. Xander crouched down to comfort the distraught Pokemon. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there little one&quot;, Xander reached out to pet the Zigzagoon. &quot;That was certainly a hectic hour hey?&quot; Xander chuckled, trying to mask his disappointment, he was really hoping to bring Ralph to justice. &quot;He was a bad guy and bad guys do bad things for bad reasons. I'm not saying I always do the right thing, but I like to think I normally have a good reason. It's my fault he left you, so why don't you come with me? I know it might be a bit awkward at first, but I think you'd really get along with my Pokemon and myself, what do you think?&quot; Xander pulled a <a href="http://forums.upnetwork.net/showpost.php?p=844293&amp;postcount=1921" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.upnetwork.net%2Fshowpost.php%3Fp%3D844293%26postcount%3D1921&amp;hash=ceb99ea871f72c96554691b597e14206" rel="nofollow noopener">Luxury Ball</a> out of his bag and presented it to the Zigzagoon. &quot;Also I doubt Ralph will be coming back here any time soon and you know this place better than most. Any idea where he might have stuff stashed?&quot; Xander figured if the little thief was as good as Ralph said, he'd either know where Ralph stashed stuff or would be capable of finding it. Xander also unrolled the map, it was strange how it had just been left out. Perhaps there was something that he missed there?</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: royalblue"><b>ChrisClark13</b> - Setting up your own personal camp with almost every possible piece of equipment imaginable for the modern day camper, you set forward to getting down right cozy as you and Annahime prepare for the oncoming night. Meanwhile, your fox makes herself as comfortable as she can laying on the ground for the time being, watching as you work at selecting a good meal, staring back and forth between the Sweet and Sour Pork in one hand an the Rice and Alolan-cooked Chicken in the other. That is, of course, until the old man makes mention of the lack of fire.<br />
<br />
Looking around at his lack of proper preparation, you offer up your sleeping back in the event that he is worried about warmth, a thought that he promptly shakes off, waving away the idea. &quot;No, no, it's about more than just being warm. Though I suppose that is always a nice part of having a fire.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pointing along the road to either end he continues, &quot;It's quite a way away from any settlement here, so we need the fire ward off any would-be predators in the night.&quot;<br />
<br />
The mention of the word &quot;predators&quot; causes the Eevee to startle for a moment, tucking itself firmly in between the man's two blankets and poking just its nose out to sniff the area. The old man calmly pets the top of the blanket, stroking it softly to calm down the Pokemon, &quot;Now now, don't fret little one. I'm sure we'll think of something to keep us safe tonight.&quot;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: lemonchiffon"><b>TheKnightsFury</b> - Heading into the building after discovering that the captain had come up empty handed, your attention is drawn to two items amongst the clutter thanks to the Zigzagoon running up to them under the table. The sad face of the Pokemon examining the crushed shards of what used to be its home is devastating, enough so to draw your attention purely to it for a moment, offering it a home among your team as you produce a Luxury Ball for the Galarian variant of the species. The Zigzagoon stares at the ball you hold in your hand for a time, and back to the crushed shards of the Premier Ball it was last in, before your question of where Ralph might have stashed any goodies breaks it from its distraught state, proceeding to sniff around the area instead.<br />
<br />
Picking up and unfurling the map while the Zigzagoon searched, it becomes obvious why this was left out in the open, a message scrawled on the back of the parchment intended for you...<br />
<br />
<i>I'm not angry. I'm just disappointed.<br />
<br />
A man shows up at my doorstep holding a silver card meaning he's been marked to be taken off the board by another major player, and I offer him a job instead of leaving his corpse in the sewers as professional courtesy would dictate. You would think that would be grounds for doing as asked, but apparently not?<br />
<br />
But I suppose it doesn't matter. Your little betrayal led the guards right where I wanted them in full force, and I still got the keys I wanted off the captain in the process. He really should be more careful who he shoves in the street.<br />
<br />
It is something of a shame to have to lose the Zigzagoon I sent with you, as he did have quite a bit of promise, but I can't have any machines scanning the little rascal and providing the force with my identification. Do with him what you will, I suppose. It's a lot harder to spring a Pokemon from custody than it is the cronies that held you at my doors, after all. Especially as I imagine it will take some time to change the locks.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I know I had told you only one entrance and one exit. But alas, a good player keeps cards up his sleeve... or below the table.</i><br />
<br />
Upon getting to this part of the letter, the Zigzagoon notes a small button built into the leg of the table, giving it a light jab. This causes the dresser along the wall to slide away, revealing a hole with a ladder straight down into the sewer system below the city. Yipping happily, the Zigzagoon then runs into the back room to continue its search.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dammit!&quot; the Captain shouts out once more upon noticing this new escape route. &quot;These sewers stretch all over the city! That bastard could be anywhere by now, and one of his filthy cutpurses took my keys clean off me when we were rushing in!&quot; Rubbing his hand along the back of his neck, he sighs, kicking the wall in frustration, &quot;He could have hit any storeroom in the city by now with enough preparation.&quot;<br />
<br />
The letter doesn't end there, though.<br />
<br />
<i>P.S.: Just so there's no hard feelings, I'll still give you the information you came here for. Our mutual friend has been running a scam as old as time itself. He has his own men steal the goods and hide them away, then claims insurance from the merchants that were selling to him for the failed delivery.<br />
<br />
Have your new guard friends check the warehouse on the west side. On fourth by the city entrance. They'll find all they need to put old Wolfgang away.<br />
<br />
- &quot;Ralph&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Returning from the back room after happily completing its search of the area, the Zigzagoon stops to look down the hole to the sewers before returning to your side, staring at the map in your hand and the crushed Premier Ball shards on the ground once more. The Pokemon then happily elicits a small bark of excitement to get your attention, jabbing its paw into the Luxury Ball you had offered it. The orb opens, sucking the Zigzagoon in with a flash of light, before shaking only for a moment and letting out a small click.<br />
<br />
<b>You have captured a level 8 male Galarian Zigzagoon! It knows Egg Move Knock Off!</b><br />
<br />
It would seem your job here is just about done. With the medic having ordered rest and your throbbing head agreeing with the idea, the only question now is whether to let the guards know of the intel on Wolfgang, or to let them continue trying to chase Ralph down his getaway tunnel.</span></div>

<span style="color: seagreen"><b>Missingno. Master</b> - Scooping up the Mega Stones and getting to work instead of complaining the the Mage you brought here for... some reason, you hold up each stone while Meowth pages through your Pokedex, attempting to identify each by sight. Listing off the group as a Kangaskhanite, Medichamite, Gyaradosite, and Gardevoirite, a brief discussion is in order to determine what goes where. With precious few clues from the walls here aside from only being given two slots to work with, it's decided that this still has something to do with types as the last set of indentations did. Meowth's theory of types in common is picked up on, and soon enough the Medichamite and Gardevoirite are selected and placed carefully in the two slots available to you.<br />
<br />
For a moment, nothing seems to occur, but soon and sure enough the remaining Mega Stones you hold begin glowing brightly as the walls themselves light up with the stones set throughout them. The remaining two stones become hot with energy, too hot to hold in fact, causing them to clatter to the ground before rolling towards the back wall and giving a similar reaction to the Z Crystal in the previous room. Shattering and expanding in a cascade of lights, two forms begin to take shape before you. The first is that of a Kangaskhan, which promptly erupts in further light, its joey jumping from its pouch as the Pokemon Mega Evolves before your eyes. The second, however, is not the expected Gyarados that the stone would have seemed to be. Instead, a small, hunched, humanoid form takes shape, that of a Sableye. Like the Kangaskhan, this Pokemon also erupts in light, a gem from its body springing forth and growing massive in size, clutched by the Sableye as it takes on its Mega Evolved form.<br />
<br />
The Mega Pokemon stand between you and the far wall, watching you expectantly, quite unlike the Golurk in the previous room. It would seem they are more than content in letting you take your time as they bar you from progressing further.</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: seagreen">Keith expected something to happen with the unused Mega Stones. And sure enough, when they grew too hot to hold, he let them fall to the ground without any resistance- bring on the Mega Kangaskhan and the Mega Gyarados, he figured. The previous room gave a pretty clear indicator that this was the sort of thing to expect.<br />
<br />
Except, he was only half-right. The Kangaskhanite took the form of a Kangaskhan, but the other Mega Stone took a considerably smaller form than either Keith or Meowth had been expecting- that of the Darkness Pokémon, Sableye.<br />
<br />
Keith glanced at Meowth. &quot;Gyaradosite, huh?&quot; he remarked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, a lotta dese tings look similar,&quot; Meowth complained. &quot;Do you know how close I came ta tinkin' dat Gardevoirite was a Venusaurite?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, well, either way, seems like we ended up on the right track regardless, so whatever works,&quot; Keith stated, turning his attention back to the Kangaskhan and Sableye, both of which were already Mega Evolving. &quot;We gotta fight these things, and they're not gonna make it easy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right!&quot; Meowth exclaimed, jumping down to the ground, claws extended and ready for action.<br />
<br />
Anion ran up alongside Meowth as well. &quot;Mai mai!&quot; she declared, her cheek pouches sparking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then here we go!&quot; declared Keith. &quot;Meowth, use <b>Nasty Plot,</b> then hit them both with <b>Swift</b> and <b>Shadow Wave</b>! Anion, use <b>Nuzzle</b> on the Sableye, hit them both with <b>Growl</b>, and power up Meowth's <b>Shadow Wave</b> with your <b>Helping Hand</b>!&quot; This spurred the pair of Pokémon into action at once. And Meowth made sure to not lose sight of the baby Kangaskhan as well- the Mega Evolution energy had affected it more than the mother, it was sure to be just as much a threat by now.</span></div>

<span style="color: royalblue"><b>ChrisClark13</b> - Setting up your own personal camp with almost every possible piece of equipment imaginable for the modern day camper, you set forward to getting down right cozy as you and Annahime prepare for the oncoming night. Meanwhile, your fox makes herself as comfortable as she can laying on the ground for the time being, watching as you work at selecting a good meal, staring back and forth between the Sweet and Sour Pork in one hand an the Rice and Alolan-cooked Chicken in the other. That is, of course, until the old man makes mention of the lack of fire.<br />
<br />
Looking around at his lack of proper preparation, you offer up your sleeping back in the event that he is worried about warmth, a thought that he promptly shakes off, waving away the idea. &quot;No, no, it's about more than just being warm. Though I suppose that is always a nice part of having a fire.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pointing along the road to either end he continues, &quot;It's quite a way away from any settlement here, so we need the fire ward off any would-be predators in the night.&quot;<br />
<br />
The mention of the word &quot;predators&quot; causes the Eevee to startle for a moment, tucking itself firmly in between the man's two blankets and poking just its nose out to sniff the area. The old man calmly pets the top of the blanket, stroking it softly to calm down the Pokemon, &quot;Now now, don't fret little one. I'm sure we'll think of something to keep us safe tonight.&quot;</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: royalblue">&quot;Oh,&quot; Curtis replied. He'd never really had to deal with wild Pokemon getting into his stuff or even just attacking him and Annahime during the night. Though part of it could be that he has a tent, part of it a Pokemon that can spit fire, and the other last part of it is... well, he's pretty sure he's never been this far out from modern civilization before. &quot;Um...&quot; he trails off as he thinks.<br />
<br />
So, he could try to cram everyone in his tent? But that'd be a really tight fit and the cart would be left completely unprotected so that's out. <br />
<br />
He could look for firewood? But where though? <br />
<br />
Maybe take shifts standing to look out for trouble? But... without a fire wouldn't things just sneak up on and around you anyways?<br />
<br />
He looks over to Annahime, she can create fire- but for how long through.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure we don't have anything that we can use for a fire? Because, well, the only idea I've got is to see how long me and my Vulpix can stay awake while she puts up Will-o-Wisps to scare things off.&quot; Curtis continues to ramble, &quot;I'm pretty sure I've got an energy drink or something in my bag somewhere so I might be able to function in the morning... but she's too small for that much caffeine so we're not going to have her firepower if we run into any trouble. And that's assuming that we even can stay awake that long. That's uh, the best idea I've got.&quot; Curtis winces, &quot;maaaybe you can think of something better?&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then, the camping kettle starts going off. &quot;Just a moment!&quot; Curtis runs over to it and takes it off the fire just before the whistling would've reached its peak shrillness. He rips open the bag of Sweet and Sour Pork and fills it up with hot water before sealing it up again and giving it a good shake. Curtis calls over to the old man if he wants hot water for anything and if so, puts more hot water on to boil instead of just putting the camping stove away.<br />
<br />
As Curtis makes his way back to the old man with the food bag in one and his mess kit in the other (which has a Pokemon food dish), Annahime somehow finds the energy to get annoyingly underfoot.<br />
<br />
She got a good whiff of the food and has now realized just how hungry she is. &quot;Hey, hey, calm down it's still cooking&quot; Curtis chides as he sits back down. But the hungry, fat fox will not be swayed. She wants her food and she wants it now. She's even considering just ripping into the bag with Psychic- though that might spill her food all over the dirt so she holds off for now.<br />
<br />
He keeps the food bag away from Annahime's hungry jaws as he continues where his conversation left off, &quot;So yeah, staying up all night on watch with Annahime- no, that wasn't the signal that it was ready- here to look out for trouble. Please tell me you can think of a better idea? Maybe there's a place I could find some firewood that's not too far away?&quot;</span></div>

<span style="color: lemonchiffon"><b>TheKnightsFury</b> - Heading into the building after discovering that the captain had come up empty handed, your attention is drawn to two items amongst the clutter thanks to the Zigzagoon running up to them under the table. The sad face of the Pokemon examining the crushed shards of what used to be its home is devastating, enough so to draw your attention purely to it for a moment, offering it a home among your team as you produce a Luxury Ball for the Galarian variant of the species. The Zigzagoon stares at the ball you hold in your hand for a time, and back to the crushed shards of the Premier Ball it was last in, before your question of where Ralph might have stashed any goodies breaks it from its distraught state, proceeding to sniff around the area instead.<br />
<br />
Picking up and unfurling the map while the Zigzagoon searched, it becomes obvious why this was left out in the open, a message scrawled on the back of the parchment intended for you...<br />
<br />
<i>I'm not angry. I'm just disappointed.<br />
<br />
A man shows up at my doorstep holding a silver card meaning he's been marked to be taken off the board by another major player, and I offer him a job instead of leaving his corpse in the sewers as professional courtesy would dictate. You would think that would be grounds for doing as asked, but apparently not?<br />
<br />
But I suppose it doesn't matter. Your little betrayal led the guards right where I wanted them in full force, and I still got the keys I wanted off the captain in the process. He really should be more careful who he shoves in the street.<br />
<br />
It is something of a shame to have to lose the Zigzagoon I sent with you, as he did have quite a bit of promise, but I can't have any machines scanning the little rascal and providing the force with my identification. Do with him what you will, I suppose. It's a lot harder to spring a Pokemon from custody than it is the cronies that held you at my doors, after all. Especially as I imagine it will take some time to change the locks.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I know I had told you only one entrance and one exit. But alas, a good player keeps cards up his sleeve... or below the table.</i><br />
<br />
Upon getting to this part of the letter, the Zigzagoon notes a small button built into the leg of the table, giving it a light jab. This causes the dresser along the wall to slide away, revealing a hole with a ladder straight down into the sewer system below the city. Yipping happily, the Zigzagoon then runs into the back room to continue its search.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dammit!&quot; the Captain shouts out once more upon noticing this new escape route. &quot;These sewers stretch all over the city! That bastard could be anywhere by now, and one of his filthy cutpurses took my keys clean off me when we were rushing in!&quot; Rubbing his hand along the back of his neck, he sighs, kicking the wall in frustration, &quot;He could have hit any storeroom in the city by now with enough preparation.&quot;<br />
<br />
The letter doesn't end there, though.<br />
<br />
<i>P.S.: Just so there's no hard feelings, I'll still give you the information you came here for. Our mutual friend has been running a scam as old as time itself. He has his own men steal the goods and hide them away, then claims insurance from the merchants that were selling to him for the failed delivery.<br />
<br />
Have your new guard friends check the warehouse on the west side. On fourth by the city entrance. They'll find all they need to put old Wolfgang away.<br />
<br />
- &quot;Ralph&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Returning from the back room after happily completing its search of the area, the Zigzagoon stops to look down the hole to the sewers before returning to your side, staring at the map in your hand and the crushed Premier Ball shards on the ground once more. The Pokemon then happily elicits a small bark of excitement to get your attention, jabbing its paw into the Luxury Ball you had offered it. The orb opens, sucking the Zigzagoon in with a flash of light, before shaking only for a moment and letting out a small click.<br />
<br />
<b>You have captured a level 8 male Galarian Zigzagoon! It knows Egg Move Knock Off!</b><br />
<br />
It would seem your job here is just about done. With the medic having ordered rest and your throbbing head agreeing with the idea, the only question now is whether to let the guards know of the intel on Wolfgang, or to let them continue trying to chase Ralph down his getaway tunnel.</span>

Xander unfurled the map to find a rather long note scrawled on it by Ralph. Did he really have that much time up his bloody sleeve? Xander read through the note, which was filled with interesting pieces of information. Turns out Ralph had gotten exactly what he wanted, with one of his goons managing to relieve the captain of his keys during the chaos. What Ralph was planning to do with them was unknown, but Xander knew it likely wouldn't be be. He could easily use the keys to release his goons as quick as they were locked up. It also seemed that Wolfgang had marked him to be silenced, permanently. Xander was shocked by this revelation, he knew the merchant was slimy, but he never expected this! Whether he blamed Wolfgang for bringing Xander into his life or that he just felt like eliminating another player from the board, Ralph had also provided information to help bring the merchant to justice. It wasn't the fish they were after, but perhaps it would help appease the now raging guard captain? <br />
<br />
Zigzagoon returned from its search and after a moment of thought, it happily taps the ball, drawing itself inside. The ball shakes for a moment before coming to a rest with a resounding click. The capture was successful!<br />
<br />
<b>Xander caught Zigzagoon! Declaring his ability to be Quick Feet! </b><br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me captain, I think I might have some information that will help&quot;, Xander presented the map to the captain, &quot;Wolfgang was the one that sent me into the Playground to start with. If what Ralph is said is true, then there is a tonne of merchandise and all the evidence you need in that warehouse to take Wolfgang down. I know it's not Ralph, but at least its something? Also I was wondering if you could afford someone to escort me to a Pokemon Centre? All the adrenaline is starting to where off and I'm not feeling the best.</span></div>

<span style="color: seagreen"><span style="color: lemonchiffon"><b>Faiyaa- </b>It was certainly an unfortunate turn of events. Dragalge had used its strange powers to turn Marina into a mindless puppet, a living shield! The Primarina was a friend, someone you didn't want to harm, if you could avoid doing so. After calming muse, you instruct Triton to try and shake Marina from her hypnotised state. The bait ball sends sound waves rippling through the water, creating an Uproar. The addled Marina shakes violently, the attack didn't seem to cause a lot of physical pain, but mentally what she was enduring seemed rather unpleasant. It does create an opening for Triton, who is able to get passed the Primarina and strike Dragalge with a Feint Attack! The Dragon replies this time, choosing to engage in the fight! It strikes Triton with a flick of its Poisonous Tail, knocking a few of the fish out of the bait ball in the process. Triton pushes on, the mass of trembling bodies slam into the Dragalge at full force, the impact driving it into the rock. </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: seagreen"><span style="color: lemonchiffon">Marina jets in to defend her temporary master, driving Triton off of him with a powerful Play Rough. It seems the Uproar was unable to overcome the potent poison. Perhaps if you could relieve the effects of the poison, you'd have a better chance of snapping Marina out of it? You'd have to work fast though, because the Dragalge is looking rather angry. It fires a powerful Dragon Pulse at Triton, the Wishiwashi lets out a pained roar, the Dragon sure could pack a punch!</span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: lemonchiffon">Things were not looking great for Triton. Gary had hoped that the Wishiwashi could break through the illusions on Marina as well as subdue the Dragalge through the strength in numbers of the school of fish, but it didn’t seem to be working all too well. It was time to change tactics, and fortunately for Gary, he had the perfect Pokemon for the current situation. He had been relying on her a lot on this adventure, but Gary knew that he could count on Pickle when he was, well, in a pickle. Triton was not done yet, however, and Gary was determined to keep the momentum of battle on his side.<br />
<br />
“Alright, Triton,” Gary called out to his Wishiwashi, “Hit that Dragalge with an <b>Endeavor</b> and then get out of there as fast as you can with a speedy <b>U-Turn</b>! You’ve done great so far, thanks for all of the hard work!” The massive shark-shaped bait ball collectively smiled a false toothy grin and prepared themselves for one last burst. As they did so, Gary pulled out a familiar Luxury Ball and held it up closely to his mouthpiece.<br />
<br />
“I’m going to need to count on you one more time, Pickle,” Gary spoke to it softly. “Once you switch back out, I’m going to need you to <b>Purify</b> Marina’s toxins right away! I believe you can do it!” Gary smiled softly and hoped for the best in his new strategy. Once all of this was finally over and the scientist was dealt with, Gary would definitely have to reward this pair with a big treat.</span></div>

<span style="color: RoyalBlue">Following your partner, you continue to notice a variety of paths branching here and there broken up by a combination of trees, clearings filled with an abundance of wild pokemon, and other young trainers looking to improve their skills through the time-honored tradition of battle. But as you continue down the path before you Hailstone seems to begin slowing down, becoming less interested in the area and more confused than anything else, turning his head towards you and giving you a questioning glance before once again running off on his own.<br />
<br />
Curious about his behavior, you start paying more attention to the areas you've been passing through, only to notice that they seem to be the same ones over and over again. You see the same trainers and pokemon repeating their actions each time you pass them by. Having tired from his hasty pace Hailstone opts to remain by your side as you two try to wrap your brains around the odd happenings of the area.<br />
<br />
Strangely as you two travel together progress seems to be being made. The familiar sites you had been encountering stopped repeating. You finally reach bizarre crossroads of sorts with 2 different options laying before you: One appears to be a dusty path that fades as it goes off into the distance. You can giant mountain's peak jutting out on the horizon, and from the looks of it is a giant volcano. The other path is one that keeps along the cobblestone you've been walking on. You can see two landmarks on the horizon, one being a series of massive cathedral towers reaching for the sky. They are enshrouding a nearby hamlet, which according to the guide, is home to a series of master craftsmen under a variety of different crafts.</span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: rgb(65, 105, 225)">As the two wandered along the road, they took note of the many different paths that branched off of the main cobblestone one, each one separated from the others by groves of trees or open spaces where wild Pokémon ran about and other budding trainers tested and honed their skills in battle. Sil entertained the notion of stopping and joining them, but ultimately decided against it when she noticed that Hailstone had slowed his brisk pace, squeaking quizzically and looking about nervously as he scanned his surroundings. It seemed that he was confused by… something, and he gave his trainer a puzzled glance before he darted ahead again. <br />
<br />
Sil watched him run off, feeling a knot of worry in her stomach as she paid more heed to her surroundings to determine what was bothering the Sandshrew. As she looked around, Sil realized that the areas seemed to be similar, no, <i>identical</i>, to the ones previously passed. But it wasn’t as though the two were just looping around on a circular track. Like a tape on repeat, they saw the same trainers and Pokémon, performing the same actions they had done the last two... three... four times they had passed by. Something was clearly off here. <br />
<br />
Having tired from his rapid pace, Hailstone returned to Sil’s side, staying protectively close to her as the two attempted to figure out what was going on. The two made careful note of every detail in each clearing, trying to see if anything had changed every time they passed by, but dimly realized that nothing was changing no matter how many times they went by. <br />
<br />
However, bizarrely, even though the clearings appeared to be unchanged, the two did seem to make progress as the strange repeating areas faded away to an odd-looking crossroads. Two paths branched out from the fork, each one intriguing in their own way. One was a dusty dirt road that faded to a tall, snow speckled mountain with sloped sides that, rather than ending in a pointed peak, appeared to top off flatly like a volcano. The other path was a continuation of the cobblestone road that Sil and Hailstone were traveling on, leading to several large gothic cathedral towers that scraped the belly of the sky. Beneath the hill where the towers were was a small village where, as Sil vaguely recalled from the guide, expert craftsmen and magicians made their home. <br />
<br />
Sil tapped her foot absently mindedly as she mulled over which direction to go. She was wary of continuing on the cobblestone path considering their recent troubles with it--she’d rather avoid getting into any more suspiciously magical hijinks--but taking an Ice/Steel type to a volcano may not be the best choice. Though, she did have a Rock/Water type on hand who could deal with more fiery monsters, and the volcano appeared to be snow-capped, which the Alolan Sandshrew would most definitely enjoy. But then again...<br />
<br />
Sil turned to Hailstone to ask him what he thought about this fork in the road, only to find that he wasn’t at her feet anymore. Spinning around in a frantic circle, she spotted him racing down one of the two paths, his strength clearly back and his mind clearly made up.<br />
<br />
With an exasperated sigh, she jogged after him,</span> <span style="color: rgb(91, 114, 224)">coughing</span> <span style="color: rgb(117, 123, 224)">as</span> <span style="color: rgb(143, 133, 223)">she </span><span style="color: rgb(169, 142, 222)">kicked </span><span style="color: rgb(195, 151, 222)">up </span><span style="color: rgb(221, 160, 221)">dust from the dirt road, the volcano looming ominously in the distance.</span></div>

<span style="color: seagreen"><b>Zelphon</b>: &quot;L-Lover's ... Grove?&quot;<br />
<br />
The wisps respond violently. Intensifying, the otherworldly flames begin to spit embers onto the desiccated ground, where they sink slowly through the dusty surface layer. Where they previously burned with an intense blue, now they were overcome by a striking and furious crimson, a dull pain throbbing through your head as screams echoed within your mind. After a few moments of this, during which time you consider fleeing, the barking of Naula only ever growing more desperate, a calmness falls over the apparition. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lover's Grove ... Take ... me there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shifting back to the eerie but comparatively less terrifying shade of blue, the wisps fade into the surrounding undergrowth, and for a moment you think this strange encounter may be nothing but a dream. Despite this, some part of you is left aware of the reality, Naula remaining on high alert with her fur standing on end. The foliage eventually parts once more, and this time rather than some trickery, it is a significantly more tangible being that replaces them. <br />
<br />
A Mimikyu gingerly emerges, shielding itself from view using it's shadowy claws. It is clear that this particular Mimikyu has found itself upon tough times. It's cloak was tattered - torn in a number of places. Regardless of the circumstances, there was something decidedly pitiable about the Pokemon, the sense emphasised by it's uncertain behaviour. In spite of it's shyness, Mimikyu edges further into the clearing, gradually coming to a halt after finally emerging fully. Without warning, the wisps appear again, instinctively putting you on edge. However, the voices are this time much more considered and calm. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have ... unfinished business. Lover's Grove is ..</span>. im<span style="color: seagreen">portant. I am ... no harm to you. Provided you are .. no harm to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Any suspicions you may have had were emphatically confirmed - Mimikyu was the one conjuring the voices. </span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: rgb(65, 168, 95)">Rylie attempts to stammer out a confirmation to the wisps but the words never leave his mouth. The fear caused by the increased aggression of the dancing lights before evokes is terror. The crimson hue causes him to worry the worst was about to come. With the screams of his apparent aggressor and the barks of his partner pelleting his mind and ears; he winces in pain before it all just suddenly stops.<br />
<br />
Rylie reopens his eyes and regains his composure. He then nods slightly at the questioning spirit, giving it some trust. He intently watches the descent of the lights into the foliage, before taking a somewhat defensive stance as they are replaced by the shuffling of the leaves. But just as he mentally prepares to start issuing orders to Naula, Rylie's face turns to a look of concern and curiosity. Seeing the Mimikyu's emergence from the bushes quells his worries, the Pokemon's torn visage and shy demeanor inciting a sense of calm within.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Naula, let's give them a chance,&quot; Rylie says while maintaining his gaze on the pokemon before him.<br />
<br />
Rylie listens to the Mimikyu's plea, giving a small nod of agreement to the purposed truce. &quot;U-um, yeah sure l-let's go there together then... But, um before we do how's about we take a breather? This entire encounter has left me kind of winded... and I feel it's probably best Naula here get used to your scent before we continue forward. It's the last of what I got but if you'd like I can offer you a Haban Berry if ya want me to. Though they've always been a little too bitter for us,&quot; he stammers out. Even after being reassured it was just a Pokemon, the situation had riddled him with anxiety.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Rylie by the way, what do you go by?&quot;</span></div>

You give your orders to Lucifer, making sure that he was primed and ready from when the Gabite would strike. You could feel the earth tremble beneath your feet as it was churned by the land shark. They were known for two things: how quickly they were able to dig through the ground and how much they loved gems. Nothing here really shone as brightly as a gem, but the taste of blood seemed to trigger the Gabite as much as gemstones normally would.<br />
<br />
A loud cracking noise could be heard as the Gabite burst through the ground directly underneath Lucifer. Foreseeing this, and with a little help from your orders, he channeled as a burst of speed into his hind legs and used his Quick Attack to getaway. The Gabite was caught off guard by the Absol dodging, but in the end, it didn't matter. The Gabite stabs the ground with both of its claws, preparing a powerful move. From its maw comes a fiery blue wyrm, channeling its draconic rage. This looked to be its desperation attack, and it landed perfectly. Lucifer cries out in pain as he's wreathed in the flames.<br />
<br />
But, by some stroke of luck, Lucifer was left standing. His fur was singed, and he was barely holding on. You could hear his labored breaths, staring the Gabite straight in the eye. Once more, he coats his horn in dark energy and lunged forwards. The horn connects with the Gabite, but it is not enough to fell your foe. The Gabite is knocked back by the attack and starts circling the area. It seemed poised to finish at any second. Yet there was a glimmer in the sky. The Future Sight. It would strike within a moment's notice... All you had to do was stall long enough for it to go off. <br />
<br />
What do you do? </span>

</blockquote><span style="color: rgb(221, 160, 221)">Zain watched as the Gabite burst through the stone beneath them, tossing stones and other debris into the air as it lunged towards Lucifer in a vicious attack; The dragon type Pokemon seemed driven into a wild frenzy, unabated by the quick attack and wreathing the Absol in draconic flames with a powerful attack.<br />
<br />
He winced as the Pokemon cried out in pain, burnt and bruised by the onslaught. He had made an oversight, and Lucifer had been the one to pay the price for his mistake - he wanted to get down on his knees and offer an apology for the companion, but he couldn't at the moment. The Gabite began circling them, in a manner similar to a vulture, waiting for its prey to expire, poised to strike with those razor sharp claws, the growling noises it made mingling with Lucifer's shuddering breaths.<br />
<br />
Taking a split second weigh the variables, glimmering future sight included, Zain flicked his hands forward, using the same simple hand signals as before. (<b>Razor Wind </b>followed by <b>Quick Attack</b>)</span></div>

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: royalblue"><b>Maskerade</b>: Your remarks seem to amuse one of the two guards, the telltale curl of a smirk beginning to appear on his face. This reaction is swiftly curtailed by his partner, who immediately shoots him the sort of smouldering gaze that can only come with natural instinct, the hardened steel and fire behind the momentary rebuke more than enough to wilt the impolite break in character. With this resolved, the second solider approaches you formally, giving a deep bow as he addresses you. <br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings, traveller. My name is Umberto. Unfortunately, the process for coming into my lord's employ tends to be a lengthy one, under normal circumstances.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he rises, he has a small smile on his face, a glint in his eye. <br />
<br />
&quot;However, you are in luck. It would happen that the Palace Guard are depleted in number as of late, and so we have devised a rudimentary assessment in order to recruit adventurers such as yourself into a short term occupation. If you would please walk this way.&quot;<br />
<br />
At his invitation, you follow Umberto through the castle. The breathtaking splendour of the foyer does not abate as you wind your way eastward, the ornate architecture matched only by the decadent fancies on display - ceiling high paintings flanked by marble sculptures so lifelike you half expect them to salute to attention. Finally, the dull clanging ring of metal clashing against metal indicates that you are approaching your destination, and you step out into the harsh bake of the overhead sun. The barracks lay before you, the large training yard occupied by trainers running young recruits through sparring drills. You are led towards a far corner, where a makeshift pen had been constructed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your test will take place here.&quot;<br />
<br />
With no further warning, Umberto produces a Poke Ball, the metallic clasp splitting in twain to reveal a narrow eyed Charmeleon, the Fire type promptly adopting a well practised fighting stance, claws brandished at the ready. <br />
<br />
===</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: seagreen"><b>Zelphon</b>: &quot;Name? I...&quot;<br />
<br />
Mimikyu trailed off, the fabric of her disguise shifting uneasily, the Fairy type pausing for a few moments to focus on her thoughts. <br />
<br />
&quot;I... have no... name. None that I... remember.&quot;<br />
<br />
Where the stuttering speech pattern had once seemed ominous, now it felt tragic and pitiful, the trembling resort of a being struggling to maintain their grasp on their self of sense. The foreboding surroundings only emphasised this pained moment, and Naula briefly bristled - until it became obvious that no danger would be posed. As Naula settles, you offer a Haban Berry - and Mimikyu accepts with an uncertain gratitude. After eating, the Ghost type waits patiently for you to regulate your breathing - a far from simple task considering the circumstances - and you finally begin to move towards the Grove. <br />
<br />
It does not take long for you to realise that something was wrong. No matter how much distance you covered, no matter how much your legs began to succumb to a persistent tiring, it appeared like you were stuck in a repeating loop. You notice that Mimikyu becomes visibly more deflated with every cursed repetition, and eventually the Pokemon stops in her tracks entirely. <br />
<br />
&quot;I knew.. this would happen. I am.. unable to leave... this place. Neither can you... if you stay near me...&quot;<br />
<br />
This dejected sight seems to resonate with Naula. Puffing her cheeks out, the Eevee rushes you, determinedly barking, her intent clear as day. Mimikyu was suffering a horrible fate, and regardless of their inadvertently involving you both, now that you were involved Naula was overcome by an obligation to help. Unfortunately, you were ill prepared to handle an oddity of this inclination. Above all else, information was vital when dealing with the supernatural, and currently there was little to work from. </span></div>

<b>Meetan- </b>As you continue to gather information in hopes of overthrowing the Ring Leader, you bring Jasper out to work alongside Mimi. After a brief exchange with Eridian, Jasper is delighted to hear about your plan. You request the pair of Pokemon look over Sera's Pokeballs, hoping Jasper's eye for detail might pick up signs of tampering, while Mimi might be able to sense whether there is the work of another Psychic Pokemon causing the problem. Both Pokemon spend some time going over the balls, but neither of them come up with anything. Whatever had been done to these Pokeballs, it had been done so meticulously. It would require an expert hand to pull off something like this. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, we've tried to release our Pokemon before. Every time we attempt to do so, the balls automatically recall them, its like they've been coded to keep our Pokemon imprisoned.&quot; You had Sera her Pokeballs back. Looking up the road, you can see the Inn coming into view. &quot;We're nearly at the Inn&quot;, Sera points out. &quot;Once we get there, Jean-Pierre will have us recall our Pokemon and hand in our Pokeballs. Try not to let on that you know about the whole thing, okay? When we pull up, make yourself scarce, maybe head into the Inn and get a drink. I'll find you once I've talked to Mo and his brothers.&quot; Sera seemed more settled now that she knew you'd do everything you could to help her. That said, you could still see how nervous she was. Her entire future, her child's future, depended on you pulling off this revolt. <br />
<br />
The caravan comes to a stop out the front of the inn. The large wooden building seemed to be quite busy, music and banter blending into a cacophony that poured from the establishment. &quot;Go on, I'll see you soon&quot;, Sera motions for you to hop off as she prepares to recall Bambi and Hatenna. <br />

<b>Faiyaa- </b>Triton was not fairing well and it was no wonder. Every time he got a shot at the Dragalge, Marina rushed in to protect it. Triton couldn't handle both of them, if you were going to have any chance at success, you needed to get Marina back on the right side! You encourage the wounded Triton to continue. The bait ball's endeavours see it wear the Dragalge down, before it slams into the poisonous dragon one final time before U-Turning back into his ball. You take aim carefully now. If you cure Marina of Dragalge's poison, surely its control over her would fade. You launch Pickle from her ball, the Pyukumuku surges through the water, sticking directly onto Marina's chest! The sea cucumber gets to work quickly, drawing the poison from the Selkie, purifying her. <br />
<br />
Marina comes to with a shake of her head. She lets out a screeching Sparkling Aria, forcing the Dragalge to a halt. &quot;Enough!&quot; Marina shouts, her voice flowing harmoniously through the water. &quot;We're not here to hurt you, we need your help. We just need some of the sea weed to help us protect the reef.&quot; <br />
<br />
Dragalge trumpets back, before sinking back into the bed of seaweed. Marina rips a chunk of the weed away with her teeth before swimming over to you. &quot;It was just protecting itself, thanks for breaking its hold on me. It messed with my head, it had me convinced that you were trying to hurt it and I had to protect it from you. It seems to possess the same power as the seaweed, which I can certainly vouch for as potent.&quot; Marina passes the chunk of seaweed across to you. &quot;We need to split up for a bit, I'll go scout and see if I can find Cedric's ship, I need you to head back to the city and prepare the seaweed. You'll need to dry it out and then grind it into a powder, be careful not to inhale any yourself. I'll meet you in the port at sun down, we'll want the cover of darkness after all.&quot; <br />

</blockquote><span style="color: lemonchiffon">Triton was having a tough time keeping up in battle when he was outnumbered two against one. The Dragalge was formidable enough to deal with, but on top of that Marina in her confused state was defending it as well. It was time to change tactics, so after a parting shot from the shiny Wishiwashi, Gary sent out Pickle, the shiny Pyukumuku. Pickle was able to do what she does best, and soon enough, Marina was cured of her affliction. With Marina back to her senses, the shiny Primarina bellowed an operatic command at the Dragalge who promptly backed down. Gary and Muse both let out a collective sigh of relieve as the conflict was finally over, for now.<br />
<br />
Marina handed some of the seaweed over to Gary and instructed that it was time to split up once again. Gary needed to go back to town and dry out the seaweed so that he could grind it up into a powder. Gary knew his Pokemon were tired as well, so taking them back to town to rest would probably be a good idea. After agreeing to meet Marina up at the port at sundown, Gary called Pickle back into her Luxury Ball and exited the cave. With Muse following closely behind, the pair swam back up to the surface where he removed the mouthpiece and took in a deep breath of air. &quot;One last task for you, buddy, can you get us back to town quickly, please?” Gary asked as he sent Triton back out. The Wishiwashi was tired, but he understood the urgency of the situation. The miniscule sardine summoned his school of buddies and the cluster of fish packed together tightly to form a giant shark-shaped raft on the surface of the water. Gary climbed on top of the fishy raft and pulled Muse up next to him, who smiled as she enjoyed the ocean breeze. Triton rode the <b>Surf</b> as quickly as he could, taking them back to town.<br />
<br />
Once they were back at the City of Pentacles, Gary called Triton and Muse back into their Pokeballs and thanked them once again for their hard work. Gary would need to get to work on drying and grinding the seaweed, but having a rested team of Pokemon would be required for whatever challenges they faced ahead as well. With that in mind, Gary sought out the nearest Pokemon Center first, so he could rest and swap out his team members.</span></div>

<b>Faiyaa- </b>It was a long way back to the city. By the time you pulled in at the docks, Triton was absolutely gassed, his school dissipating as soon as you hop off of him. You recall him and Muse, all of your Pokemon would benefit from a quick visit to the Pokemon Center. If things didn't go to plan, tonight could have its fair share of conflict involved and you needed to be prepared. You make your way along the docks, noting that Cedric's ship wasn't at port, meaning it was likely still out on the water. Hopefully Marina wouldn't have too much trouble locating it without your help. Since this morning a market seems to have started up along the oceanfront, a number of colour stands lined the edge of the road. You give the stalls a quick glance as you make your way towards the Pokemon Center. <br />
<br />
Most of the stalls seemed to be selling food, however there was also a number of craftsman scattered among them. One store had racks full of jewellery constructed from shells and bits of broken coral, another had boxes of dusty old TM's piled up, bright red signs indicated they were priced to go. A few boutique clothes stalls seemed to be gathering quite a bit of interest from the passersby, but of most interest to you is the very last stall. An old woman carefully arranges her collections of herbal remedies, while it didn't look like she was getting a lot of business, she looked like she was an experienced herbalist. Looking ahead, you're pleased to find the Pokemon Center sitting at the end of the street. Picking up the pace, you soon fly through the automatic doors, a smiling nurse stands behind the counter ready to serve you, while a PC sits to the right of the counter as well.</span></div>

<span style="color: royalblue"><b>Maskerade</b>: Your remarks seem to amuse one of the two guards, the telltale curl of a smirk beginning to appear on his face. This reaction is swiftly curtailed by his partner, who immediately shoots him the sort of smouldering gaze that can only come with natural instinct, the hardened steel and fire behind the momentary rebuke more than enough to wilt the impolite break in character. With this resolved, the second solider approaches you formally, giving a deep bow as he addresses you. <br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings, traveller. My name is Umberto. Unfortunately, the process for coming into my lord's employ tends to be a lengthy one, under normal circumstances.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he rises, he has a small smile on his face, a glint in his eye. <br />
<br />
&quot;However, you are in luck. It would happen that the Palace Guard are depleted in number as of late, and so we have devised a rudimentary assessment in order to recruit adventurers such as yourself into a short term occupation. If you would please walk this way.&quot;<br />
<br />
At his invitation, you follow Umberto through the castle. The breathtaking splendour of the foyer does not abate as you wind your way eastward, the ornate architecture matched only by the decadent fancies on display - ceiling high paintings flanked by marble sculptures so lifelike you half expect them to salute to attention. Finally, the dull clanging ring of metal clashing against metal indicates that you are approaching your destination, and you step out into the harsh bake of the overhead sun. The barracks lay before you, the large training yard occupied by trainers running young recruits through sparring drills. You are led towards a far corner, where a makeshift pen had been constructed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your test will take place here.&quot;<br />
<br />
With no further warning, Umberto produces a Poke Ball, the metallic clasp splitting in twain to reveal a narrow eyed Charmeleon, the Fire type promptly adopting a well practised fighting stance, claws brandished at the ready. <br />

</blockquote><span style="color: royalblue">Kou was well aware his mannerisms weren’t to everyone’s taste – he’d been travelling for seven years, after all. But he would not stray from his path; the road to mastery was never going to be easy, or easily understood. Mercifully, some were more receptive to his pleas than others, as proven by the honourable Umberto’s intervention.<br />
<br />
“You have my gratitude, sir. I seek only to better myself; I thank you for the opportunity to do so.”<br />
<br />
As he followed the guard, his eyes were naturally drawn to his sumptuous surroundings. Far too decadent for his modest tastes, the Castle was unique in its decoration, from the intricacy of its designs to the likely obscene value of its materials. The temples where he’d studied and trained at in his home region were austere, “boring” even in the eyes of many, but Kou had always reveled in their simplicity and the humility of their purpose. This… well, it was another culture. He should not judge.<br />
<br />
He welcomed the sunlight once it finally came. Kou was much happier out in the sun than he was inside any building; furthermore, the sight of so many young Trainers sparring in the yard ahead lifted his spirits – there was nothing purer than the search for self-betterment.<br />
<br />
Having led Kou to a relatively quiet part of the training yard, Umberto laid down an unexpected challenge – the guard himself would be his opponent in a sparring match. Kou’s smile widened at the sight of the man’s Charmeleon… it was finally time to show what he could do!<br />
<br />
But first, the formalities. Kou retrieved his Dex from the inside of his vest and aimed it at the fire lizard; despite coming from his native region, Kou had yet to face this particular form of the Kanto starter in his travels.<br />
<br />
<b><i>*Charmeleon’s data was added to the PokéDex!*</i></b><br />
<br />
“I accept this battle, Sir Umberto,” Kou replied. <i>Always meet a fair challenge unflinchingly</i>, so said his father. But who would he choose to fight with?<br />
<br />
<i>Atlas could compensate for its Fire weakness with its Ground offense, but his attacks are widespread; we would disrupt everyone’s training, and that is unacceptable. Levias is likely the better match, but much too large to use here without damaging either the training grounds or injuring someone unwillingly. It leaves but one option.</i><br />
<br />
In a flash of silver light, a large Snorlax materialized from his Ball. Gigas was Kou’s oldest companion, and years of strict training had done away with the species’ characteristic sloth, giving rise to a dependable powerhouse. Gigas was unquestionably Kou’s strongest Pokemon, molded by the Trainer’s will and passion into a formidable warrior. It was perhaps unwise to rely on his ace so soon into his adventure on this land, but circumstances dictated it was the best – or perhaps only – choice.<br />
<br />
“In the interest of fairness, Sir Umberto, I should warn you my Snorlax’s Ability is <i>Thick Fat</i>. Now, we begin!”<br />
<br />
<i>Gigas is exceptional at close range, but it’s too risky to move in without knowing what Charmeleon can do. Besides… our moves aren’t ideal against a Fire Pokemon. Flamethrower and Ice Punch aren’t a good match, which leaves Crunch and Hyper Voice. So if we want to keep our distance…</i><br />
<br />
“Gigas, Hyper Voice! If they get in close, counter with a Crunch!”<br />
<br />
<i>If only we could have perfected his High Horsepower already… we need to train harder!</i></span></div>
