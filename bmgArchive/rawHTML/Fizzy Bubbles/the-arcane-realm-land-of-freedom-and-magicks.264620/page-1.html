<div class="bbWrapper"><div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-family: 'TimesNewRoman'"><b><u><span style="font-size: 26px">THE ARCANE REALM</span></u></b></span>&#8203;</div><br />
<span style="font-family: 'TimesNewRoman'">&quot;The moment man devoured the fruit of knowledge, he sealed his fate... Entrusting his future to the cards, man clings to a dim hope. Yes, the Arcana is the means by which all is revealed...&quot; Nyx Avatar (Persona 3)<br />
<br />
Once a simple place where new trainers were sent to learn the basics of adventuring, with the vast changes to Fizzytopia the Arcane Realm seemed to have faded from existence. Though gone, it was never forgotten by the bitter trainers who were forced into spending what felt like years in that simplistic place. A place where no growth was truly given, and only stagnation existed. Yet, when the realm disappeared, all were freed from their restraints and truly allowed to begin anew. <br />
<br />
Now, it seems that the Arcane Realm has resurfaced in Fizzytopia. Showing up where the old Arcane Realm use to be, this new one is vastly different then the one that the denizens of Fizzytopia are used to. Now truly a place of magic and mystery, it says the very land itself is influenced by the “cards”/ What these cards are, and what they refer to nobody particularly knows. The only thing that is certain, though, is that this Arcane Realm is teeming with life, and has infinite possibilities for adventure.</span><br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-family: 'TimesNewRoman'"><b><span style="font-size: 26px">The Kingdom of Swords</span></b></span>&#8203;</div><br />
<span style="font-family: 'TimesNewRoman'"><span style="color: RoyalBlue">Encompassing the entirety of the Arcane Realm, the Kingdom of Swords rules over those who make their residence in this mystical place. Though, the main part of the Kingdom is the castle of its ruler, and the small castle town and vast plains that surround it. It is also rumored an ancient tomb of the emperor that founded the Kingdom, which use to be a vast empire, is hidden deep within the castle. <i>(Please respond in RoyalBlue)</i><br />
<br />
<b><u>0. Fool’s Path</u></b> - The main road through out the Arcane Realm, it symbolizes the beginning of a journey and has many branching paths that are meant to symbolize life’s many paths. Many new trainers have tread this road, looking to see what adventure would unfold for them.<br />
<br />
<b><u>I. Magician’s Hamlet</u></b> - The Castle Town, named for the power Court Magicians that made their workshops here, where it is said that all of its inhabitants are master craftsman and well known through the realm. Those that live here have been loyal to the Kingdom for Generations, and the beautiful buildings and rich populace show that even in it’s twilight years, the Kingdom is still prosperous. <br />
<br />
<b><u>II. High Priestess’s Cathedral</u></b> - A large, gothic cathedral sitting atop a hill overlooking the Hamlet, it was said this place was built by a holy maiden with her bare hands to offer a place of refuge and respite for the poor and damned. Her charity and kindness has created a devout sect of nuns to her teachings, who look after and take care of her cathedral. Pilgrims from all over visit this place, looking for the sacred knowledge hidden in the texts and relics within the Cathedral.<br />
<br />
<b><u>III. Empress’s Garden</u></b> - Within the castle walls lies a beautiful garden, said to be planted by the first Empress and continues to this day be tended by the queen and her servants. A variety of flora and fauna make their home here, and many of the kingdom’s artists and writers come here as a means for inspiration, and a small amphitheatre where plays are held is within the garden. <br />
<br />
<b><u>IV. Emperor’s Castle</u></b> - The main castle itself, made of beautiful marble stone with blue spinnerets atop the towers. Despite its majesty, the Castle itself feels like a labyrinth for those unacquainted with it. After all, only the foyer, ballroom, and throne room are open to the general public, and the research labs, soldier and servant quarters, and even the royal family’s private quarters are often off limits. What secrets this castle has for the years it’s stood, it’s said only the King knows. <br />
<br />
<b><u>V. Hierophant's Crypt</u></b> - The ancient resting place of the royal family, buried deep within the castle with an entrance for visitors to see from the Cathedral. While the Cathedral’s entrance is a tunnel with a statue of the great Sage-King known as the Hierophant, who turned the empire into the kingdom it is now today, it is said that there is an entrance in the Castle itself, revealing a vast catacomb of the royal dead, and royal riches. There are rumors among thieves that the statue at the Cathedral can also provide an entrance, but the information that lies here contains the history of the Arcane Realm as a whole, and is something only a brave few can learn. </span></span><br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-family: 'TimesNewRoman'"><b><span style="font-size: 26px">The Forest of Wands</span></b></span>&#8203;</div><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'TimesNewRoman'"><span style="color: SeaGreen">Once monikered the Forest of Adventure, the Forest of Wands has been changed and twisted by the surplus of magical energy flowing through the Arcane Realm. THe once simplistic woods are now a labyrinth where magic flows through the roots of the trees and a sense of dread and whimsy encompass all who enter. Though, it was possible that this was here the entire time, like everything else, and the deep magic that flows through these woods caused trainers to dream of the much more simplistic Arcane Realm. <i>(Please reply in SeaGreen)</i><br />
<br />
<b><u>VI. Lover’s Grove</u></b> - Named for the two giant oaks twisted around each other, said to be the eternal form of a princess and her commoner lover. Couples can commonly be seen coming here, sitting under the oaks and gazing into the small pond next to it. Various berries and flowers grow under these oaks, said to be the fruits of love. Yet, important life decisions are made here, and for a simplistic place there is often danger lurking about for the couples who venture here. <br />
<br />
<b><u>VII. Chariot Inn</u></b> - An inn and tavern for travelers located at the mouth of the woods, named for being a common resting spot for knights on their patrols through the kingdom. Travelers from far and wide make their stop here, either preparing to brave the forest or just to experience the Arcane Realm in full. A variety a favors can be done here for those staying here, or it can serve as a stepping stone to travel into the woods. Though, it is ill-advised to leave the inn during the night. Grim things are said to happen. <br />
<br />
<b><u>VIII. Cave of Strength</u></b> - Deep within the woods is a cave rumored to be filled with dangerous beasts. While the knights stay clear of this place, thieves, adventurers, and foolish children explore this place in hopes of trying to find treasure or just prove their mettle. Though, while the strong certainly prevail, there have been more than a few people who have gone missing within the cave. Some say a religious cult is to blame, others a demon. What really lurks there, though, is unknown. <br />
<br />
<b><u>IX. Hermit’s Mire</u></b> - A swampy portion of the Forest, the mire his home to various hermits, lunatics, and other outcasts of society. A thick miasma hangs in the air, making it hard to breath and visibility not the best. What lurks within the putrid waters further cements this is a place people do not want to visit. However, it is said that those who embrace this place find enlightenment. <br />
<br />
<b><u>X. Fortune’s Woods</u></b> - A place in the forest where the magical energy is at its most potent, forming a sort of myst that permeates the air. Everything from the trees to the wildlife here seem a bit out of this world, and it’s hard to predict what exactly will happen here. Some state that these woods even spin like a wheel, and depending on where the wheel is travelers will experience either good luck or bad luck. Whatever it is, this portion of the forest is filled with fun and whimsy.<br />
<br />
<b><u>XI. Grounds of Justice</u></b> - A barren field, charred and stained in blood. Here war criminals were executed, heretics burned, and those affected by plague said to waste away. A statue of an angelic figure watches over these sacred grounds, guiding the dead towards enlightenment. Whether their deaths were just or not, they have tainted this land within the forest. The only thing that awaits here is grim fate, with scales in her left, and sword in her right, ready to guide the lost.</span></span><br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-family: 'TimesNewRoman'"><b><span style="font-size: 26px">The City of Pentacles</span></b></span>&#8203;</div><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'TimesNewRoman'"><span style="color: LemonChiffon">A marvelous, extravagant city on the coast that serves as the Kingdom’s main mercantile capital. While the master craftsmen of the hamlet visit here to sell their wares, there are more than one way to make a quick buck in this city of money. Greed drives the people, and those seeking to become rich come here. Those these ambitions have not lead to good results. A dark underworld resides in this place, where the filth and muck are the last of a person’s worries. Striking gold is easy, losing your life is even easier. <i>(Please Reply in LemonChiffon)</i><br />
<br />
<b><u>XII. The Hanged Man’s Plaza</u></b> - A statue of a famed monk sits directly in the middle of the city’s main plaza, trying to remind the residents to practice restraint in terms of their greed. Flower beds and benches accompany this statue, and the poor and unlucky help tend to this place. In a place of greed, it feels off that a reminder to let go of things and make sacrifices for the better good is in place, but more happens at this tourist attraction then what meets the eye.<br />
<br />
<b><u>XIII. Death’s Yard</u></b> - A vast graveyard on the outskirts of the city, where the dead are laid to rest. Those who have lost their lives to greed, disease, or misfortune make up the majority of those who now reside in this land of the end. Though, it can also symbolize a new beginning, and the small church presiding over the yard helps people restart their lives. Though, sometimes, the ghosts do it for them.<br />
<br />
<b><u>XIV. Island of Temperance</u></b> - An island off the coast of the city, another tourist attraction for visitors to the city and the patrons to make money off of. It was once a temple where monks practiced their beliefs in order, and those that have defiled this sacred land are said to meet with a grisly fate. Though, the temple remains intact, even if it is slightly submerged now. Spelunkers try to find the treasure still hidden in the temple, and the treasure that has been lost under the waves. Weather land or sea, there is something for everyone at this island.<br />
<br />
<b><u>XV. The Devil’s Playground</u></b> - The city’s slums, where the law doesn’t exist and drugs and crime run rampant all in the name of money. Addiction to money, drugs, and even bodily pleasure are common within the inhabitants, and the seedy dealings here are seen as a sort of wonderland for those who like that kind of lifestyle. Though even through the filth and muck, a beautiful lotus can bloom. Even here can some of the most valuable treasures be found.<br />
<br />
<b><u>XVI. The Tower</u></b> - An ancient tower that has been in existence before the city was even built, it was an attempt to reach the heavens. Even if it’s now destroyed, it still towers over the city, and can be seen anywhere on the horizon in the Arcane Realm. Places like the Cloud Garden and New Fizz City can be seen from the top of this tower, and the halls within hold the history of the city and not only the shady dealings within this city, but also of the magic in world around it. It’s said, however, that the wisdom here is guarded by creatures of eld, and an elevator system is in place for tourists that want to see the view from the top.</span></span><br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-family: 'TimesNewRoman'"><b><span style="font-size: 26px">The Land of Cups</span></b></span>&#8203;</div><br />
<span style="font-family: 'TimesNewRoman'"><span style="color: Plum">Named for the small valleys and tall hills and mountains native to the region, forming almost natural cups, this is an almost verdant and fertile land. Despite the desert in the very north and the mountains nestled in, a large variety of life can be found here. The Land of Cups is the jewel of the Arcane Realm, and without it, the realm would be a lot more desolate. Luckily, there are preservation efforts to make sure this jewel doesn’t lose its shine. <i>(Please respond in Plum</i><br />
<br />
<b><u>XVII. Desert of Stars</u></b> - A small, arid desert at the northern tip of the Land of Cups, the Desert of Stars is named for the various meteorites found within this region. While more a dry, mountainous desert than a sandy one, sandstorms are still a common occurance here. Though, despite these conditions, explorers and treasure hunters flock to this region for the meteorites found here, and the rare Pokemon attracted to them. Some have even stated they’ve had some otherworldly experiences here. <br />
<br />
<b><u>XVIII. Lake of the Moon</u></b> - The largest lake in the Land of Cups, this place is rich in aquatic life and is a very popular place for fishers. It’s said that this lake wanes and waxes with the phases of the moon, and that the lake acts strangely the closer it is to a full moon and a new moon. Some say during a New Moon, an ancient temple can be seen floating in the lake, but it is hard to verify if it exists there and the lake is too deep to safely explore. During a full moon, the aquatic life becomes incredibly hostile, and the legendary “King of the Lake” has been said to awaken and surface during this time.<br />
<br />
<b><u>XIX. Chalice of the Sun</u></b> - The largest mountain in the Land of Cups, the Chalice of the Sun is famed for its snow-capped peak and magma chamber deep within. A dormant volcano that hasn’t erupted in eons, the Chalice is a symbol of life to the people. Mountain Climbers and Skiers enjoy the difficult trails and wonderful slopes that are on the mountain, and there is even a ski lift to the summit. At the summit is a small temple dedicated to the sun, built in the middle of a small caldera that was created when the Chalice first erupted. Meanwhile, at the base of the mountain is a deep tunnel system that allows explorers to reach the magma chamber of the Chalice. Across these walls are cave paintings, and relics of ages long past .<br />
<br />
<b><u>XX. Meadow of Judgement</u></b> - Named for being one of the places where heretics and traitors were tried, the meadow has now grown out from that purpose and is a large place of life for small critters and flowers. The beautiful flowers provide food and shelter for a variety of Pokemon living there, and the feeling of magic is strong here. Mages can often be found here practicing their craft due to the large, powerful leyline within the Meadow. It is also said by the religious sect of the Arcane Realm is that this is where Judgement Day will commence, and all of the flowers here symbolize a soul that will be saved. <br />
<br />
<b><u>XXI. The World Tree</u></b> - The supposed source of all magic in the Arcane Realm, the World Tree’s roots extend throughout the entire realm. Some believe it is the very thing binding the Arcane Realm together, and what allowed it to go through a such rapid change compared to when it last graced Fizzytopia. The locals often leave gifts for the tree at its base, where the creatures that call it home feast on and use. Though, the health of the tree has proven vital to the ecosystem of the Land of Cups, and that when the tree is in danger the desert grows and crops and life start to die. If not for the world tree, then the Arcane Realm itself will cease to exist. </span></span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: plum">They'd been soaring over the Arcane Realm since daybreak. Thankfully their destination had always been visible, that was the advantage of mountains, they were never too hard to find. Artemis was enjoying stretching her wings on her first long journey, the Aerodactyl was used to patrolling around the valley but this was the first time Jayson had taken her on an adventure. She occasionally let out a terrifying screech at Pokemon and people below them, announcing her arrival to all in the Arcane Realm. Genghis was nestled in his arms, the young Larvitar was also on his first adventure. Jayson had brought a specialised team on this outing, all Rock type Pokemon. He'd become fond of the typing of late and had developed a nice little team that deserved some experience in the field. The Chalice of the Sun was a suitable destination, travelling down through the tunnels to the magma chamber would be an enjoyable experience. <br />
<br />
Artemis landed at the entrance to the tunnels, at the base of the mountain. Jayson placed Genghis on the ground and released two more Pokemon from their Pokeballs. Ares the Aggron had recently evolved, the hulking horned Steel and Rock type looked eager to explore. The other Pokemon was much larger, Gjoll, Jayson's strange Onix that seemed to be made of Black Diamond. Jayson mounted the monolithic Onix and urging the rock snake forward into the tunnels. Ares followed closely with Genghis nipping at his heels, while Artemis trailed behind, opting to travel on all fours for now. There was no telling what the Chalice of the Sun had in store for them, but hopefully it wasn't as painful as Jayson's last venture into tunnels....</span></div>

Once a simple place where new trainers were sent to learn the basics of adventuring, with the vast changes to Fizzytopia the Arcane Realm seemed to have faded from existence. Though gone, it was never forgotten by the bitter trainers who were forced into spending what felt like years in that simplistic place. A place where no growth was truly given, and only stagnation existed. Yet, when the realm disappeared, all were freed from their restraints and truly allowed to begin anew. <br />
<br />
Now, it seems that the Arcane Realm has resurfaced in Fizzytopia. Showing up where the old Arcane Realm use to be, this new one is vastly different then the one that the denizens of Fizzytopia are use to. Now truly a place of magic and mystery, it says the very land itself is influenced by the “cards”/ What these cards are, and what they refer to nobody particularly knows. The only thing that is certain, though, is that this Arcane Realm is teeming with life, and has infinite possibilities for adventure.<br />

<br />
Once monikered the Forest of Adventure, the Forest of Wands has been changed and twisted by the surplus of magical energy flowing through the Arcane Realm. THe once simplistic woods are now a labyrinth where magic flows through the roots of the trees and a sense of dread and whimsy encompass all who enter. Though, it was possible that this was here the entire time, like everything else, and the deep magic that flows through these woods caused trainers to dream of the much more simplistic Arcane Realm. <i>(Please reply in SeaGreen)</i><br />
<br />
<b><u>VI. Lover’s Grove</u></b> - Named for the two giant oaks twisted around each other, said to be the eternal form of a princess and her commoner lover. Couples can commonly be seen coming here, sitting under the oaks and gazing into the small pond next to it. Various berries and flowers grow under these oaks, said to be the fruits of love. Yet, important life decisions are made here, and for a simplistic place there is often danger lurking about for the couples who venture here.</span> </span>

</blockquote><span style="color: SeaGreen">The Arcane Realm. Once spoken of with an undertone of resentment by the Pokémon Trainers of Fizzytopia, but now, resurfaced anew, practically a different place, free of the arbitrary restrictions enforced by the old Elite Four now that the region itself was also free of said Elite Four. Undoubtedly, those Trainers who have long been adventuring in the region would appreciate this change, this new and improved Arcane Realm.<br />
<br />
But not the couple entering the Forest of Wands. The drama and resentment inherent to the Arcane Realm's history was before their time.<br />
<br />
They walked together, for lack of a better term- one of them, you see, lacked legs and feet, and was reliant on her kind's natural hovering capabilities to move about. But the Trainer whose hand she was holding most certainly could walk, as she was currently proving capable of doing. The one who was hovering was a Froslass, who answered to the name Laugh. And the Trainer whose hand she was holding was Terri Alph. Technically speaking, Laugh was Terri's Pokémon, but the way the two treated their relationship was decidedly not like the standard Trainer-Pokémon relationship. In the interest of not mincing words, they were in love.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've heard this place is supposed to be beautiful,&quot; Terri was saying to Laugh. &quot;The oaks are supposedly the eternal forms of a princess and the commoner she loved.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>It certainly sounds beautiful,</i>&quot; agreed Laugh. &quot;<i>Though I'm certain I'll love the place. After all, I... I know for a fact there'll be at least one beautiful sight there,</i>&quot; she added, blushing slightly as she smiled at Terri.<br />
<br />
Terri smiled back. &quot;There certainly will be,&quot; she agreed. &quot;In fact, I think I see her now.&quot; Following this, Terri leaned in, which was Laugh's cue to follow suit, and a quick kiss was exchanged, and as was usual, Laugh's Ice typing did nothing to spoil such moments for Terri. As a Froslass, Laugh was naturally cold, but only in terms of temperature. As far as her heart and soul went, there was definite warmth, a warmth Terri seemed quite capable of picking up on, a warmth that let them hold hands, exchange kisses, even hold each other, without Terri feeling the discomfort one would expect when one's girlfriend's species was said to originate as a possessed icicle. Thus, the couple remained hand in hand as they continued onward, intent on being the next couple to sit beneath the oaks, to gaze into the pond, and to just enjoy each other's company.</span></div>

</blockquote><span style="font-size: 12px"><span style="color: lemonchiffon">A shady slum in a shady city, nothing Isaac hadn't seen before. As he walked through the slums, he couldn't help but glance over the people laying in alleyways --- slumped over and quivering in the crisp light of the day. He had heard of these slums, he knew full well about the wells of addiction that lay before him... but he couldn't help but be drawn to that kind of thing. There was a void in his soul, a void that he hadn't felt in a long time. Like an itch that you couldn't quite scratch, the feeling kept returning... and he couldn't help but crave some sort of fulfillment. <br />
<br />
He hands shook with anticipation at seeing the grimy alleys. He hadn't felt this kind of need since before his overdose, the need to escape, to forget everyone and everything --- simply becoming overtaken by the blissful highs that would blanket him. He could almost hear Kyle's voice condemning him for being so easily tempted. Not that that mattered anymore... Not that anything really mattered anymore. <br />
<br />
He glanced at some of patrons of addiction laid out before him, sprung out and draped over thin blankets. He remembered what that was like, he remembered how hard it was to fight that kind of thing, how hard he had to fight to overtake his addiction. He sighed deeply, contemplating if coming here was actually a good idea --- especially in his current state. He rubbed his face anxiously, putting a hand on his hip and staring down at the Leafeon that had stopped in front of him. Her brown eyes had pleading look in them, a looked that was of sheer concern for her master. There was a clear fear there, a fear of returning to how things had been... a fear of returning to her life on the street.<br />
<br />
And for once... Isaac wasn't concerned about what Vinny thought. He needed this for <i>him</i>. It didn't matter what anyone else thought of him at this point, the world was shit anyways. He nervously brought a cigarette to his lips and glanced down at Vinny once again. <br />
<br />
<i>Sorry Vin.</i> Rang through his head. But he could never apologize enough to his beloved Leafeon if he decided to go through with this.</span></span></div>

<span style="color: royalblue">Hugo wouldn’t really consider himself “poor” and he only sometimes felt “damned”, but it was hard not to gravitate toward the High Priestess’s Cathedral. It loomed imposingly from its hill, almost in opposition to the castle. The castle may be home to the king, but the cathedral was home of the people.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: royalblue">Religion always fascinated Hugo. He never really considered himself a religious person, but he definitely understood its purpose. It gave people hope. It gave people reason to feel like all of this mattered, that all of their toil and pain would one day lead to a greater reward. It gave people meaning.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: royalblue">And for those at the top, it provided a means of social control. Follow these rules! Do this or the gods will punish you! Perhaps he was a pessimist or a nihilist, but this is the side of religion Hugo tended see most often, and it disgusted him and kept him away.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: royalblue">Like most deities, the High Priestess was highly venerated for her grace and generosity, and she had developed an impassioned group of followers as a result. He was skeptical as usual. Yet something seemed different. As Hugo approached the massive doors of the church, something seemed to be calling to him. He put his hand to the door handle and stopped and looked up. The walls were massive, the spire reaching high into the clouds. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: royalblue">“What is it about this place?”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: royalblue">He was filled with sudden rush of hope and mystery. He immediately tried to stifle those emotions. He sighed heavily, opened the door, and entered.</span></div>

&quot;The moment man devoured the fruit of knowledge, he sealed his fate... Entrusting his future to the cards, man clings to a dim hope. Yes, the Arcana is the means by which all is revealed...&quot; Nyx Avatar (Persona 3)<br />
<br />
Once a simple place where new trainers were sent to learn the basics of adventuring, with the vast changes to Fizzytopia the Arcane Realm seemed to have faded from existence. Though gone, it was never forgotten by the bitter trainers who were forced into spending what felt like years in that simplistic place. A place where no growth was truly given, and only stagnation existed. Yet, when the realm disappeared, all were freed from their restraints and truly allowed to begin anew. <br />
<br />
Now, it seems that the Arcane Realm has resurfaced in Fizzytopia. Showing up where the old Arcane Realm use to be, this new one is vastly different then the one that the denizens of Fizzytopia are use to. Now truly a place of magic and mystery, it says the very land itself is influenced by the “cards”/ What these cards are, and what they refer to nobody particularly knows. The only thing that is certain, though, is that this Arcane Realm is teeming with life, and has infinite possibilities for adventure.<br />
</span><br />
<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-family: 'TimesNewRoman'"><b><span style="font-size: 26px">The Kingdom of Swords</span></b></span>&#8203;</div><span style="font-family: 'TimesNewRoman'"><span style="color: RoyalBlue"><br />
Encompassing the entirety of the Arcane Realm, the Kingdom of Swords rules over those who make their residence in this mystical place. Though, the main part of the Kingdom is the castle of its ruler, and the small castle town and vast plains that surround it. It is also rumored an ancient tomb of the emperor that founded the Kingdom, which use to be a vast empire, is hidden deep within the castle. <i>(Please respond in RoyalBlue)</i><br />

Pilgrims from all over visit this place, looking for the sacred knowledge hidden in the texts and relics within the Cathedral.</span></span>

<i>This is... adequate.</i><br />
</span>&#8203;</div><div style="text-align: left"><span style="color: royalblue">Althea ran a hand through her silver hair as she stopped to contemplate the Cathedral from a distance. A Trainer of her caliber felt much more inclined to visit the Emperor's Castle, naturally, but she took pride in being objective and not wasting her time wandering aimlessly.<br />
<br />
<i>There are few people I loathe more than those who dedicate their worthless lives to following religious persuasions, but I'm not here for these nuns' charity. They have priceless texts in there that I <b>must </b>read. Ancient knowledge which will guide me on my next hunt.</i><br />
<br />
They called Althea Lynn, among many other names, &quot;The Huntress&quot;. She had made a career - and a very profitable one at that - out of hunting down and defeating Legendary Pokemon all over the world... but these mythical beasts were often almost impossible to track down.<br />
<br />
<i>Finding them is often a bigger nuisance than actually fighting them. It's been months since I managed to pinpoint the location of a single one.</i><br />
<br />
She knew that the hunt was about more than just the actual battle, but the downtime annoyed her. She deeply believed herself to be the best Trainer in the world, but how could she remain so if she never put her skills to the test? Not that <i>other people</i> were an option - human Trainers were meaningless trash compared to the wondrous beasts she hunted. They were as easy to find as Wurmple, but also just as easy to squash, so she didn't even bother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough wasting time. We've come this far; let's get in there and find those texts, whatever it takes.&quot;<br />
<br />
She hastened her pace. Behind her, following silently and obediently, was the harbinger of disaster: Althea's Absol, <span style="font-family: 'Courier New'">X - FORTUNE</span>, who found the Arcane Realm and its ties to Destiny ironically appealing for a woman of Althea's beliefs. Not that the Lady in White would ever stop to smell the roses along the way...</span>&#8203;</div></div>

Your relationship with religion was a double-edged sword. You saw its purpose and the hope it gave to so many in need... but your eyes were also not blind to the exploitable nature of this hope. And yet, despite your conflicting thoughts on the matter, you could not stay away from the High Priestess's Cathedral, drawn to it by some strange, intangible feeling...<br />
<br />
They say the Church's doors are always open. This, of course, is entirely metaphorical - as you quickly find out, the massive wooden doors of the Cathedral are very much closed, and it takes considerable force to push them open and step inside. Once you do, however, you find yourself overwhelmed by the strangest sensation.<br />
<br />
Music fills your ears and your soul - note after note delivered by a perfectly synchronized choir of female voices. The melody itself is foreign to you, but the way it resonates across the entire church produces an almost hypnotic effect; you feel all worries and concerns begin to vanish from your mind, your heart feels light and full at the same time. It's beautiful.<br />
<br />
The song had caught you so off guard that it took you a moment to properly see the Cathedral's inside. The church itself is immense, with rows upon rows of wooden benches stretching along the full length of the ceremonial hall, and a sumptuous altar at the very end, lined on each side by giant mahogany statues of Dialga and Palkia, adorned with golden paint. So much for those vows of poverty.<br />
<br />
There is no priest that you can see behind the altar, but to the right and left of it, lined directly in front of the statues, are several nuns in white robes, covered from head to feet, showing only their raised hands in adoration as they sing. <i>They</i> are the heavenly, bewitching choir...<br />
<br />
This seems to be a solemn moment. Will you set out to explore the Cathedral in greater detail, or stay a while longer until the nuns finish their ritual?</span></div>

<span style="color: royalblue">The beautiful, melodic singing rang through Hugo’s ears. It gave him a sense great peace, but somewhere in the back of his mind, he also felt a sense of great alarm. Like a security blanket, he instinctively grasped one of the Pokeballs hanging from his waist. Knowing that he could call out his Pokemon to fight seemed to subdue the qualms of his sub-conscious, and he allowed himself to be entranced by the song.<br />
<br />
<br />
Remember Odysseus. Tied to the mast of the ship to prevent falling under the Siren spell. However, there was no mast to be tied to. Poor Hugo surrendered himself.<br />
<br />
<br />
Almost as if he was no longer in control of his own movement, he found himself slowly walking toward the choir. The creators of time and space grew closer as Hugo moved toward them, the shockingly intricate detail dazzling beneath their golden finish. Despite keeping himself closed off from such thoughts for so long, he found himself being drawn in closely, both literally and metaphorically.<br />
<br />
<br />
The nuns bright white ceremonial garments were a shocking contrast to the centuries-old cathedral’s stone and wooden interior. A beacon of light amongst the drab earthliness. What were they saying? To whom were they offering praise and worship? And why was it having such a significant effect on Hugo? It was so lovely, so emotionally stirring, that Hugo could feel himself being brought nearly to tears.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hugo seated himself in one of the rows of wooden pews several rows back. Despite the vastness of the cathedral, the wooden bench felt warm, almost comfortable. The smell of rich incense filled the air. Hugo’s eyes were firmly locked on the signing nuns. What was happening to him?</span></div>

For some reason, the singing prayer resonates with you, even though you can't actually understand anything that is being sung.

The nuns resemble wingless angels, dressed in their spotless white robes. They sing in perfect unison, a picture of absolute synchronicity that has likely been rehearsed a million times over.

One of the nuns is completely motionless, and completely silent.<br />

It is almost impossible to spot her in the sea of white that surrounds the altar, but sure enough, there she is. While the other nuns keep their hands raised and sway their bodies gently to the rhythm of the chants, that one is absolutely static, like a lifeless statue of white marble. But when the singing finally stops and the ceremony ends, you realize you weren't the only one to notice her - the two nuns adjacent to her grab the silent one by each of her arms and hurriedly walk away, disappearing through a small wooden door behind the altar.<br />

For some reason, the singing prayer resonates with you, even though you can't actually understand anything that is being sung. You find yourself simply sitting down and absorbing the whole atmosphere, even though you hadn't exactly come here to offer prayers of your own.<br />

<span style="color: royalblue">The silent nun’s demeanor, along with the way she was hurriedly rushed off, was very distressing to Hugo. Something clearly was off. Maybe she was new and didn’t know the cadence or the words of the ceremony? That was unlikely, however, given the response of the other nuns. It seemed as if she was surely headed for admonishment and punishment.<br />
<br />
<br />
The spell of the choir was beginning to wear off, at least for now. All of the skeptical questions Hugo had about religion came rushing back to him. History was chock full of stories where religious “missionaries” invaded foreign lands and forcibly instituted the wills of their various gods on the natives. Someone being coerced into a religion was hardly a novel idea. Was that what was happening here? Could it be that the silent nun was being forced to be here against her will? Was her lack of participation not a sign of ignorance, but rather defiance? It was all starting to add up, and Hugo’s rage was building. For years, he himself had been forced to hear his own religion’s teachings of kindness and purity, meanwhile the clerics espousing these messages were themselves conducting wicked and abhorrent behavior, often at the expense of the most innocent of their parishioners. The abuse and the hypocrisy disgusted and infuriated Hugo, and it appeared he was witnessing something similar before his own eyes.<br />
<br />
<br />
He rose from the pew and began stomping toward the altar. He no longer tried to hide his presence, but rather welcomed any challenges from those present. Storming past the idols of Dialga and Palkia, they suddenly did not seem so magnificent, but rather symbolized greed and falsehood. The solid marble seemed to tremble beneath Hugo’s angry feet. He reached the small door and violently sent it swinging back on its hinges as he flung it open. Without even giving time to see who or what was in front of him, he greeted his opponents with an echoing<br />

<span style="color: #4169e1">The Church's hypocrisy triggers an unquenchable fury within you that drives to storm off after the nuns, ready to enact whatever revenge you can, despite in essence knowing nothing of the actual crime. Your steps echo like thunder across the Cathedral, as if you had suddenly transformed into your own Rhyperior. With no reserves whatsoever, you force open the small wooden door behind the altar and burst inside, channeling your inner Old Spice Essence Guy as you do.<br />
<br />
The room you enter is minuscule and completely barren, except for a small painting on the far wall depicting the Creation Trio and their Master, along with two burning candles on the floor which fill the division with a faint orange glow.<br />
<br />
Four figures clad in white turn to you - the silent one, the two holding her, and a fourth one sitting down on the floor in front of them. You cannot possibly tell if they look shocked, or disgusted, or even mildly surprised - the robes, pure as snow and adorned with delicate golden embroidery, cover their faces entirely, as well as every other part of their bodies. If the cloth had not been neatly tailored to fit each person impeccably, they may as well have been ghosts in blankets.<br />
<br />
&quot;How may we help you, child?&quot;<br />
<br />
The question, asked in an eerily soothing and peaceful tone, comes from the sitting nun. You get a distinctly different vibe from her... something you can't quite identify, some intangible power the others simply do not radiate.<br />

<span style="color: royalblue">”I…uh….”<br />
<br />
<br />
Hugo’s words escaped him. He was caught somewhere between extreme fury and complete confusion. The faceless, apparition-like appearance of the nuns certainly caught him off guard, and his brain hadn’t yet caught up with his mouth. But unable to read their expressions or even recognize that they were human made them difficult to converse with. It was like talking to the furniture.<br />
<br />
<br />
“..What? Confess?...No I--…what exactly is going on here?”<br />
<br />
<br />
He was beginning to get his words back. Clumsily, but still.<br />
<br />
<br />
“I’ve got nothing to confess, but I’d like an explanation. I was watching you. Watching the singing. But what’s going on with…her….?”<br />
<br />
<br />
He pointed to the silent nun. He assumed it was a her. Without any sort of actual distinguishable characteristics, he couldn’t confirm. Hell, he couldn’t even confirm that these were even <i>people</i>.<br />
<br />
<br />
“She wasn’t singing. She wasn’t participating in the worship. What’s worse, it looked like she didn’t want to be here. And then Dingus and Dongus here scooped her up and carried her away.”<br />
<br />
<br />
He was getting cocky. Instinctively, he clutched one of the Pokeballs hanging from his belt again. It gave him confidence.<br />
<br />
<br />
“What exactly is going on back here? And who are <i>you</i>?”<br />
<br />
<br />
While the “you” was intended for all of them, it was pretty clear he was directing his questions toward the sitting nun.<br />
<br />
<br />
“You <i>do</i> realize it’s illegal to hold someone against their will, right? If that’s what’s happening here, I certainly am not going to tolerate it. I’ve seen enough corruption by you church types in m day.”</span></div>

<span style="color: #4169e1">&quot;You assume a <i>lot</i>, child - including that brute force would do you any good in here. We should talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a gentle wave of hand, the sitting nun dismisses the other three. The two holding the silent nun hesitate briefly, but soon bow and carry the one you believe to be a helpless victim back out of the room. You know you could have stopped them as they walked past you, but something compels you to stand still...<br />
<br />
Once they exit, the only remaining nun rises to her feet and walks closer to you. A gentle scent of lavender fills your nostrils as she approaches. She takes the hand you had resting on your belt and calmly moves it away from the PokéBall; you can't tell what her touch feels like, as her own hand is wrapped in the tunic's cloth, whose sleeves extended well beyond the length of her arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;You... mean well, do you not? But you should be careful with your accusations, child.&quot; There is no tone of admonishment in her words, but rather one of cautious advice. &quot;Your righteous impulses are misplaced inside this holy Cathedral. Seek to understand before you can judge.&quot;<br />
<br />
She turns her back to you and faces the small painting of the Creation Trio, offering a quick silent prayer before continuing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Mother Superior of the High Priestess's Cathedral. But to you, who do not share in our beliefs... You may simply call me Madeleine.&quot; The nun sighs and lowers her head slightly; her composure is beginning to waver. &quot;I allowed the silent one to live among us, but the others do not know of this. If they did, they would never accept it - the silent one does not embrace our faith either, much like you; I merely... extended the kindness of providing shelter where none could be found. But that kindness of mine is also a sin, and this problem is my responsibility alone to handle, as Mother Superior.&quot;<br />
<br />
She walks over to the door and opens it, inviting you to leave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look no further into this matter; it does not concern you. Arceus be with you.&quot;</span></div>

<span style="color: plum">They'd been soaring over the Arcane Realm since daybreak. Thankfully their destination had always been visible, that was the advantage of mountains, they were never too hard to find. Artemis was enjoying stretching her wings on her first long journey, the Aerodactyl was used to patrolling around the valley but this was the first time Jayson had taken her on an adventure. She occasionally let out a terrifying screech at Pokemon and people below them, announcing her arrival to all in the Arcane Realm. Genghis was nestled in his arms, the young Larvitar was also on his first adventure. Jayson had brought a specialised team on this outing, all Rock type Pokemon. He'd become fond of the typing of late and had developed a nice little team that deserved some experience in the field. The Chalice of the Sun was a suitable destination, travelling down through the tunnels to the magma chamber would be an enjoyable experience. <br />
<br />
Artemis landed at the entrance to the tunnels, at the base of the mountain. Jayson placed Genghis on the ground and released two more Pokemon from their Pokeballs. Ares the Aggron had recently evolved, the hulking horned Steel and Rock type looked eager to explore. The other Pokemon was much larger, Gjoll, Jayson's strange Onix that seemed to be made of Black Diamond. Jayson mounted the monolithic Onix and urging the rock snake forward into the tunnels. Ares followed closely with Genghis nipping at his heels, while Artemis trailed behind, opting to travel on all fours for now. There was no telling what the Chalice of the Sun had in store for them, but hopefully it wasn't as painful as Jayson's last venture into tunnels....</span>

</blockquote>( OOC:, The knights Fury shall be my updatee for a while... and I hope you like this story line. I do not yet know of your previous history with all of your pokemon, but I can guess on a few. also I do not yet know if you can commune with your pokemon either in their language or telepathy or something along those lines, so please excuse me if I over looked that or not )<br />
<span style="color: plum"><br />
You entered the tunnel with Gjoll, the first thing you noticed was that while the cavern got darker the farther they went in, it also seemed to glow more. You took a look around from the back your black Onix, and you saw the source of the glow, lichen. But wait, no,..... there also appeared to be Morelull spread out within the mosses. <br />
Content with the source of the lighting, you continue farther deeper into the cavern. Your Onix, making a grumble sliding noise as it slithered along. <br />
<br />
The cavern then splits into three separate paths. Which one to choose, which one to choose. <br />
<br />
As you stop your Onix and hop down to decide, your pokemon gather around you while you decide.<br />
The smallest of your group, Genghis the Larvitar heats a sound coming from the far left cave. Curious, it sounds so curious to him. Genghis wondered what this sound could be, it almost sounded like another pokemon crying. Genghis looked up and over to You. However, you were conferencing with your other pokemon on what tunnel to choose. The little Larvitar thought that he would be back real quick, as the crying noise didn't sound far.<br />
He turns and piddle paddles across the tunnel to the left cavern, then disappears down the dark tunnel.<br />
However, Genghis's little escapade didn't go unnoticed. Ares turns to you and taps your shoulder to get your attention.<br />
&quot;What?&quot; You ask, looking at the Aggron,<br />
Ares makes a small motion with his hands as if he was holding something small, and points to his feet where Genghis was just a moment ago, then points down the left cavern to where he went.<br />
<br />
Curious as to why Genghis would go off like that piqued your interest in the left cavern, you decide to travel on foot this time, with the other pokemon follow beside and behind you.<br />
<br />
As you continue down the cavern, you hear a pokemon crying, You wonder if it is Genghis crying, but as you get closer you actually see a little Cubone rubbing its eyes, while Genghis comforts it by telling it a story of some sort.<br />
<br />
You stop and look farther down where the cavern should lead, but you see a mountain of rocks blocking the way.<br />
<br />
Should you try and get through the cavern that is blocked?<br />
Should you take the Cubone back with you to the other caverns and try to find a way around it?<br />
<br />
What will you do?<br />

With a gentle wave of hand, the sitting nun dismisses the other three. The two holding the silent nun hesitate briefly, but soon bow and carry the one you believe to be a helpless victim back out of the room. You know you could have stopped them as they walked past you, but something compels you to stand still...<br />
<br />
Once they exit, the only remaining nun rises to her feet and walks closer to you. A gentle scent of lavender fills your nostrils as she approaches. She takes the hand you had resting on your belt and calmly moves it away from the PokéBall; you can't tell what her touch feels like, as her own hand is wrapped in the tunic's cloth, whose sleeves extended well beyond the length of her arms.<br />

Hugo didn’t know what to think. Perhaps he had overreacted and leapt before he looked. Rushing to conclusions was one of his greatest talents. And yet, despite what the HNIC – head nun in charge – had explained, something still seemed amiss. If she was the boss, what did it matter if others disagreed? Couldn’t she prevent any retaliation against the silent nun from the others?<br />
<br />
“I apologize if I’ve offended you, but much like I would assume you would find in your teachings, I try to defend the weak and downtrodden. So you’ll have to excuse my behavior.<br />
<br />
But I’m still not satisfied. Please, Madeline, explain to me who this person needs refuge from, and why it is so problematic that you have taken them in. Even if this person is a non-believer, what kind of church turns away somebody in need and would punish the person helping? It’s not adding up.<br />
<br />
And look. If this person needs help, perhaps I can assist you. It sounds like you’ve got a lot to lose here. But me? What do I have to lose? Getting excommunicated from a church that I’m not a part of?<br />
<br />
If you’re telling me the truth about this situation I don’t see why you wouldn’t let me help you. It seems to me that you are confident that you can handle it all on your own. Perhaps maybe even a little…prideful? And you wouldn’t want to be acting out of pride, would you? Seems to be something a church would look down on.”</span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: Plum">Jayson made his way through the tunnel, to his surprise visibility wasn't an issue courtesy of a mix of glowing lichen and morelull. Venturing further through the tunnels, they come to a stop as the path splits into three, leaving them with an always difficult decision to make. This often happened on adventures, multiple paths in front of you, each leading to somewhere and something, the choice was always a hard one. While Jayson deliberated with most of his team, Genghis picked up on the cries of a Pokemon, coming from one of the tunnels. Perhaps he heard it before everyone else because he was only really a baby himself? That didn't really matter as curiosity quickly took hold of the Larvitar and led him into pursuing the source of the cry. Thankfully Ares saw him slip away, otherwise they'd probably end up wasting time trying to locate the rogue rock type. <br />
<br />

Jayson dropped to a knee beside Genghis, the Larvitar was doing his best to calm the Cubone. &quot;Good work Genghis, who is your little friend?&quot; Jayson turned to the Cubone, &quot;hey there little one, are you okay?

<span style="color: Plum">Jayson made his way through the tunnel, to his surprise visibility wasn't an issue courtesy of a mix of glowing lichen and morelull. Venturing further through the tunnels, they come to a stop as the path splits into three, leaving them with an always difficult decision to make. This often happened on adventures, multiple paths in front of you, each leading to somewhere and something, the choice was always a hard one. While Jayson deliberated with most of his team, Genghis picked up on the cries of a Pokemon, coming from one of the tunnels. Perhaps he heard it before everyone else because he was only really a baby himself? That didn't really matter as curiosity quickly took hold of the Larvitar and led him into pursuing the source of the cry. Thankfully Ares saw him slip away, otherwise they'd probably end up wasting time trying to locate the rogue rock type. <br />
<br />
Following the Aggron's directions, it wasn't long before Jayson and the rest of his Pokemon picked up on the crying as well. Following the tunnel, they eventually reunited with Genghis, who seemed to have found a friend. A lone Cubone, crying without falter, despite Genghis's best efforts to calm it. Inspecting the tunnel ahead, it was clearly blocked, was this the reason for the Cubone's tears? Had it perhaps been cut off from its family? Or maybe it was caught in the cave in and injured. Jayson quickly recalled Artemis, the Aerodactyl was a scary sight to small Pokemon and likely wouldn't help quell the Cubone's cries. &quot;Gjoll, Ares, get to work on clearing the tunnel ahead, with your strength and size that shouldn't be a problem.&quot; The two large Rock types nodded to their trainer before moving ahead to clear the path. Jayson hoped that it would help stop the Cubone's cries. Jayson dropped to a knee beside Genghis, the Larvitar was doing his best to calm the Cubone. &quot;Good work Genghis, who is your little friend?&quot; Jayson turned to the Cubone, &quot;hey there little one, are you okay? If you are hurt you need to show me where so I can help you.&quot; </span>

</blockquote>I am a nice guy, soon you'll find out why. But, I will have you working hard.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: plum"><br />
The Cubone you were trying to help took one look at you, yelped and dove behind some moss covered rocks. It seemed to have a fear of humans, or maybe, you thought you looked like someone it knew that it didn't like.<br />
You aren't sure yet what the exact cause is, but you are certain that the little pokemon was hurt, as it was favoring its right leg, and almost not using its left if it could help it.<br />
You rubbed your chin in confusion. It's obvious that this Cubone doesn't like or is terrified by you or humans, but its hurt and you feel the need to help it.<br />
You got up off your knees and turned to your other pokemon working on clearing the tunnel blockage. Ares and Gjoll were nearly done, maybe another minute or two and you could get farther down this tunnel. Both of your pokemon were careful in clearing the rocks, as you didn't know if there was other pokemon on the other side of the collapsed part.<br />
<br />
A sudden movement caught your eyes from above, a shadow of a... pokemon? It moved to fast for you to see what exactly it was. But.... you wondered if it was the Cubone's mother or father, or perhaps a sibling.<br />
Looking around to see if you can climb up, you find several handholds in the wall, and you scale up them relatively quick. Peeking your head over the edge, you see that it is a small alcove, and there is a hole peeking outside, for sunlight is pouring through. How curious though, because the light pouring through the hole, should've light up the cavern below, even if only a little, but looking back down, you see no sunlight in the cavern, just moss glow.<br />
<br />
You figured you may come back and explore this later because you thought the Cubone needs more help.<br />
As you jump down, crouching to absorbing the impact. You don't notice that the hole sighs, and shivers. Dropping its illusion, the Zorua peers over the edge, watching its friend Cubone and you.<br />
<br />
The tunnel was finally clear, Gjoll and Ares stepping back from the clearing they made. Good, you thought, Now you can find out where the Cubone wants to go here.<br />
You turn to look at the pokemon in question and find it staring at you from its hiding spot, its eyes looking not as afraid as they were, in fact there looked to be a little wonder there.<br />
You smile to yourself and look away to not scare the Cubone any more.<br />
You try to think up of a way to help it, as it was hurt, somehow, and since you cannot get close enough to inspect it yourself you figure one of your pokemon may be able to do it.<br />
Genghis was... close enough for the cubone so he may be able to help... but he couldn't carry the cubone if need be. Gjoll obviously has no arms, and is quite big, Ares,... wait, Ares might work. It seems that in a tunnel like this Aggron, could be found here.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Ares!&quot; you called out to him, and he lumbered over to you. &quot; I need you to help Genghis take care of this Cubone, I want to make sure it's not too hurt, but it won't let me near him, could you carry him and Genghis?&quot;<br />
Ares nodded and went over to both the little pokemon, picking them both up. The cubone freaked a little but soon calmed as it noticed that it could jump out at any time.<br />
<br />
Now what?<br />
What do you do?<br />
<br />

He also had to do something for the Cubone's injuries. Digging into his bag, Jayson retrieved a <b>Sitrus Berry</b>, which he hands to Genghis. &quot;Try and get Cubone to eat this, it will make it feel better.&quot;</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: plum"><br />
The Zorua jumped and avoided the blast from the screech, and as it jumped down from the ledge you noticed it had a pack on it, woven from grass. You thought how odd it was, but as soon as the pokemon landed, it took off back from where you had just come. Why was that?<br />
Maybe you just scared it off, but you remained alert in case it was just another illusion. And if it was, it was a darn good illusion.<br />
Meanwhile, the Cubone in Ares' arms ate the sitrus berry Ares handed it, But it started crying again. Why?<br />
Was it still in pain... or something else?<br />
These thoughts rolled over and over in your head as you and your pokemon ran down the corridor.<br />
<br />
However, you were forced to stop again, as you came upon a split in the path, two options this time.<br />
Down the left corridor, you heard the sounds of voices, maybe other trainers exploring the same caverns as you?<br />
Down the right corridor, it seemed to give off heat, as if there was magma down that tunnel or a magma pool. You could carry the cubone in your arms and have Artemis fly you over the pool.<br />
<br />
What should you do? Is it an illusion by the trickster fox? Or, are they both real paths? Only one way to find out unless you choose to backtrack.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, while you are at the next split, the Zorua ran back to the previous split and came out of the same left cavern you had entered, but instead of it choosing a path, it seemed to walk through a wall in between the middle and right cavern. Disappearing from anyone's sight.<br />

&quot;The moment man devoured the fruit of knowledge, he sealed his fate... Entrusting his future to the cards, man clings to a dim hope. Yes, the Arcana is the means by which all is revealed...&quot; Nyx Avatar (Persona 3)<br />
<br />
Once a simple place where new trainers were sent to learn the basics of adventuring, with the vast changes to Fizzytopia the Arcane Realm seemed to have faded from existence. Though gone, it was never forgotten by the bitter trainers who were forced into spending what felt like years in that simplistic place. A place where no growth was truly given, and only stagnation existed. Yet, when the realm disappeared, all were freed from their restraints and truly allowed to begin anew. <br />
<br />
Now, it seems that the Arcane Realm has resurfaced in Fizzytopia. Showing up where the old Arcane Realm use to be, this new one is vastly different then the one that the denizens of Fizzytopia are use to. Now truly a place of magic and mystery, it says the very land itself is influenced by the “cards”/ What these cards are, and what they refer to nobody particularly knows. The only thing that is certain, though, is that this Arcane Realm is teeming with life, and has infinite possibilities for adventure.<br />
</span><br />
<div style="text-align: center"><span style="font-family: 'TimesNewRoman'"><b><span style="font-size: 26px">The Kingdom of Swords</span></b></span>&#8203;</div><span style="font-family: 'TimesNewRoman'"><span style="color: RoyalBlue"><br />
Encompassing the entirety of the Arcane Realm, the Kingdom of Swords rules over those who make their residence in this mystical place. Though, the main part of the Kingdom is the castle of its ruler, and the small castle town and vast plains that surround it. It is also rumored an ancient tomb of the emperor that founded the Kingdom, which use to be a vast empire, is hidden deep within the castle. <i>(Please respond in RoyalBlue)</i></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'TimesNewRoman'"><span style="color: RoyalBlue"><b><u>I. Magician’s Hamlet</u></b> - The Castle Town, named for the power Court Magicians that made their workshops here, where it is said that all of its inhabitants are master craftsman and well known through the realm. Those that live here have been loyal to the Kingdom for Generations, and the beautiful buildings and rich populace show that even in it’s twilight years, the Kingdom is still prosperous. </span></span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: RoyalBlue"> The cobblestone streets of the Hamlet felt familiar to Leo, similar to the feel of the streets in Po Town. It was a bit nostalgic, considering this place reminded him of Po Town before Team Skull took over. All of the buildings had a charm to them, a mixture of stone and brick creating the elegant setting as the castle walls loomed over the Hamlet. Shops lined the streets, from smithies to boutiques. Apparently everyone here were masters of their craft, and while the Hamlet was small it was certainly wealthy. Much like how Po Town use to be before Team Skull took over.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yet, those days were long gone now. It was time to focus on the present, and focus on one of his main goals of his journey. He wanted to be a patissier. He always loved to make the little pastries and confections for his fellow grunts, and if this place had the best of the best, then maybe he could get an apprenticeship. Or, at the very least, some sort of training. Even if it meant gathering ingredients or a Pokemon Battle, he was going to do what it took!<br />
<br />
<br />
Continuing his stroll through the Hamlet, he eventually found the patisserie. Home of a supposedly world famous razz berry tart, the pastry chef here was called a genius. Weird to think about, since this version of the Arcane Realm just resurfaced, or was it more that the memories involving this place were simply... sealed away? That it's true nature was here the entire time and no one really chose to believe it existed. Whatever the case, the boy was here to bake, not solve ancient mysteries. </span></div>
