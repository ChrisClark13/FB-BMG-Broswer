A forest where anyone's luck can change at any given time... The idea itself sounds absurd, as does, one could argue, the very notion of someone, or something, controlling said luck from afar, like an invisible puppeteer. And yet, the stories about Fortune's Woods were so widespread, you can't help but wonder if there isn't some truth to them...<br />
<br />
Accompanied by your partners outside of their Balls, you venture out into the lush green landscape up ahead. For someone who specialized on Bird Pokemon, it takes a special kind of bravery to set foot in this kind of wilderness – flying from above will only reveal foliage to your winged companions, but fortunately you aren’t exclusively a Bird Keeper, judging by the presence of a menacing little Pawniard at your side.<br />
<br />
As you go along, you can’t help but think that what these Woods lack in any conventional waypoints or other means of man-made guidance, they certainly make up for in natural beauty, but still...<br />
<br />
Which way were you going again?<br />
<br />
Your Noctowl is the first one to notice, and it calls your attention to the alarming fact: you already passed the oddly-shaped tree to your right twice now. Worse still, a thick blanket of mist is creeping up all around you; not the usual, dull-colored grey fog you'd perhaps expect, but one with a curious light-pink hue... Either way, it obscures your path, further compounding your predicament.<br />
<br />
Somewhere up ahead, you hear a very distinct howl, bone-chilling and much too close for comfort. You can't tell if the cry is a warning or a call for help, but do you even want to risk finding out? Maybe you'll take some other, safer approach to finding your way instead...</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: seagreen">&quot;Alright, so we'll just get past this next tree, hopefully there's a clearing.&quot; Ritchie said. He hated the amount of trees just everywhere, his birds did too, but Stryke was okay for sure, he could just cut down anything in his way. &quot;Wait a second...&quot; Ritchie turned around and looked behind him. &quot;Haven't we passed that weird twisty tree like twice by now?&quot; Gazza was already staring the tree down, and nodded. &quot;Didn't the brochure say..&quot; Ritchie trailed off, the exact excerpt loud in his mind. Some say the forest spins like a wheel. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that wasn't an expression.&quot; Ritchie grunted heavily, and then things only got weirder, as a thick mist set in, soon blanketing Ritchie's surroundings. But this mist was pink? &quot;Huh?&quot; Ritchie asked. &quot;Shouldn't the fog be grey and-&quot; Ritchie was cut off by a loud, shrill howl, the noise shaking him to his very core, rattling his bones. &quot;What was that?&quot; Ritchie gasped, and his eyes darted around, given the intensity of the noise, the noise was dangerously close. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck. Well, we've got work to do guys.&quot; Ritchie remarked, and turned to Gazza. &quot;Gazza, you, fly up, and see if you can find a passageway or path we can follow that isn't a dumb circle.&quot; Gazza spread his wings and prepared to fly upwards. &quot;Shayd, you stay down here and start up a Gust and try and get rid of this blinding mist.&quot; Shayd, who was dozing off, woke up sharply and prepared the winds. &quot;Lastly, you, Stryke, head in the direction of that noise and come back and tell me what made it, and if it's hurt.&quot;</span></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: rgb(65, 105, 225)">Sil wandered down Fool’s Path, enjoying the sights of the strange new land she had just arrived in. Trailing a ways behind her was her partner Hailstone, an Alolan Sandshrew, who was darting between the dappled shade on the path, avoiding the glowing patches of sunlight that would quickly melt the ice off of his frozen back. The two passed various branches of the Fool’s Path, some clean cobblestone roads with signs indicating their destination, others dirt paths choked with shrubbery leading into the unknown. Sil stared down each and every one, lost in thought, feeling a sense of both nervousness and excitement slowly building up inside her.<br />
<br />
She and Hailstone had come from Sinnoh to adventure in Fizzytopia in order to grow and strengthen themselves, landing first in the Arcane Realm after a long boat ride from Canalave City. An old woman in the port town they arrived in told the two about Fool’s Path, recommending that such budding youngins’ should travel it first as new trainers wander the route due to its many open roads and possibilities. Sil had hoped that--<br />
<br />
“Squeak!”<br />

She was jolted from her musings by the cry of Hailstone, who had dashed ahead of her while she was lost in thought. She looked down at the Alolan Sandshrew, who was staring intensely at her. Satisfied that he got her attention, he waited for a bit as she fast-walked up to him, but quickly grew impatient and darted ahead again. It seemed he was excited to explore this new place too.</span></div>

Whatever's going here, there's no doubt it's unnatural. Forests don't just transform into mazes as you traverse them, and regular old fog most definitely isn't supposed to be pink. Ironically, the most &quot;normal&quot; thing in this whole scenario is the ominous howling in the distance, which doesn't feel that out of place, all things considered.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, you believe yourself to be well-equipped to handle this predicament. Gazza dutifully takes to the skies, trying its best not to get stuck in any branches on the way up, and soon vanishes behind the treetops. Meanwhile, Shayd lazily gets to work as well, taking its sweet time do so, but before long, its wing flaps generate a mild gust that causes the dense mist to disperse...<br />
<br />
... for half a minute.<br />
<br />
Before long, no matter how intensely Shayd keeps flapping, more mist just seems to pile up around you, like tidal waves of cotton candy, which definitely sounds much more pleasant than it actually is. Either Gust isn't the right move to clear up fog, or this strange substance just isn't susceptible to being blown away so easily...<br />
<br />
Braving the mist, Stryke rushes ahead straight towards the origin of the howling. Just like you did Gazza, you quickly lose sight of your Pawniard. But whereas Noctowl returns soon afterwards, Stryke doesn't come back out, no matter how long you wait. The howling has since stopped, but this unsettling silence isn't much better... is your Pokemon alright?<br />
<br />
Gazza, having just returned from its surveillance flight, shakes off the leaves stuck in its feathers, then motions with its head repeatedly, telling you it found a viable path through the fog if you head south. Problem is... Stryke went north.<br />
<br />
What now?!</span></div>

Whatever's going here, there's no doubt it's unnatural. Forests don't just transform into mazes as you traverse them, and regular old fog most definitely isn't supposed to be pink. Ironically, the most &quot;normal&quot; thing in this whole scenario is the ominous howling in the distance, which doesn't feel that out of place, all things considered.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, you believe yourself to be well-equipped to handle this predicament. Gazza dutifully takes to the skies, trying its best not to get stuck in any branches on the way up, and soon vanishes behind the treetops. Meanwhile, Shayd lazily gets to work as well, taking its sweet time do so, but before long, its wing flaps generate a mild gust that causes the dense mist to disperse...<br />
<br />
... for half a minute.<br />
<br />
Before long, no matter how intensely Shayd keeps flapping, more mist just seems to pile up around you, like tidal waves of cotton candy, which definitely sounds much more pleasant than it actually is. Either Gust isn't the right move to clear up fog, or this strange substance just isn't susceptible to being blown away so easily...<br />
<br />
Braving the mist, Stryke rushes ahead straight towards the origin of the howling. Just like you did Gazza, you quickly lose sight of your Pawniard. But whereas Noctowl returns soon afterwards, Stryke doesn't come back out, no matter how long you wait. The howling has since stopped, but this unsettling silence isn't much better... is your Pokemon alright?<br />
<br />
Gazza, having just returned from its surveillance flight, shakes off the leaves stuck in its feathers, then motions with its head repeatedly, telling you it found a viable path through the fog if you head south. Problem is... Stryke went north.<br />
<br />
What now?!</span>
</div>
<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote><span style="color: seagreen"> &quot;Great, Gazza! Sight it out!&quot; Ritchie cheered as Gazza flew upwards. &quot;I don't have forever, Shayd.&quot; Ritchie snapped, as Shayd got ready and started up the Gust, which was working! &quot;Great! Now we can s- uh, what the heck?&quot; Ritchie asked out loud, and watched the mist Shayd had just worked to dissipate set in once more, seemingly thicker, now it looked like cotton candy, smelt like it too. As pink set into his eyes, Ritchie needed to think quickly, but wait.... where was Stryke?<br />
<br />
&quot;Stryke! Stryke?.... Where are ya buddy?&quot; Ritchie yelled out, shattering the rather, serene, silence, his voice piercing the air and echoing through out the forest. There was no answer back, neither an incoming short figure, a sign that Stryke was coming back. &quot;Where was he? He should be back by now.&quot; Ritchie thought, but he was interrupted by the rustling of leaves as Gazza returned from the sky. &quot;What did you find buddy?&quot; Ritchie asked his Noctowl, who turned his flexible head southwards, bobbing it back and forth, showing that yes, there was a path that wasn't fucked up, and it was that way.<br />
<br />
....but Stryke went in the other direction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Change of plans, guys.&quot; Ritchie said to the two birds. &quot;We're heading in that direction-&quot;, Ritchie pointed at the direction Stryke went, &quot;and we are finding out why Stryke hasn't returned, what was making that noise, and bringing Stryke back with us. Got it?&quot; The two birds nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;But first.&quot; Ritchie turned to Shayd. &quot;Shayd, use Dark Pulse. That should clear the gas if its magical in any way, since it would be a dark aura, opposed to this sweet and nice one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shayd nodded, and prepared the attack, already filled with bad, vile thoughts on what she'd do to whatever is holding Stryke back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's head out.&quot;</span></div>

Zain- <br />
<br />
(OOC: As a heads up Pokemon on average can use two attacks per round in a battle! You can have your Pokemon use three attacks once per battle as well.)<br />
<br />
Seeing the immediate threat of the Gabite, you command your Absol to go for the throat, quite literally. Channeling malicious intend into his horn, Lucifer leaps forwards towards the small dragonoid. The Gabite quickly takes notice of the Absol headed towards it, but isn't able to react in time as it gets hit in the throat by Lucifer's horn. The Gabite coughs as it kneels on the groud, reeling from the attack and trying to gasp for some air. <br />
<br />
Amara takes notice of this, and run towards you. A few blood splatters form along the way, but the Gabite is too enraged by the Absol to give chase. After all, he did prevent the Cave Pokemon from getting its prey. And if there's anything a dragon is disdainful towards, its those who prevent them from collecting what's rightfully theirs. <br />
<br />
At this point, the Gabite retaliates. Channeling draconic power into its claws, the Gabite swipes in two rapid hits towards Lucifer. The Dual Chop knocks the Absol back, but the Disaster Pokemon is able to quickly land on it feet. The Gabite then keeps up the offensive, and goes for a Take Down. Using its body, the blue dragon slams into your Absol. Using its weight, the Gabite is able to pin down the dark-type, causing limited mobility for the Absol.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to be more offensive... The Gabites around here can be very vicious if they manage to smell blood,&quot; Amara remarks, clutching her wound. It seemed like her condition was worsening, so it was best to hurry.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: lemonchiffon"><br />
Yuki-<br />
<br />
The trio heads down the stairs, much to Kanna's chagrin. The passageway was dark, damp, and smelled like something died. It was unpleasant, and despite the gleams of the necklace, extremely hard to navigate due to the darkness of the passageway. It didn't help that Yufi would go ahead every so often, which caused a conflict on interest in Kanna staying next to Kief out of comfort, and trying to reign in the Zigzagoon. <br />
<br />
As the trio ventured further down the stairs, they also manage to trigger a variety of traps along the way. A few trip wires that caused poisoned darts, pressure plates causing swinging axes and more similar traps were being triggered. Of course, with everyone's small, lithe frames it was actually impossible to be hit by these traps. They felt more made for humans than Pokemon. Of course, that doesn't mean there wasn't a trap that would be bad for all of you. <br />
<br />
The one confusing thing was that the stairwell felt like it just kept going down and down and down. There were no twists or turns. It felt like it just kept going on forever and ever. As if you were going deep within to the very heart of the temple. The perception of time was lost, and the trio didn't know if they were climbing down the stairs for minutes or hours. That was until Yufi pressed on one specific pressure plate.<br />
<br />
A large rumbling noise happened, and the stairwell sudden filled with light. Torches hanging on the walls were lit by some unseen force, and the three of you could hear a large thud behind you. Turning around, the trio notice a giant boulder starting to roll towards them. There was only one choice here. RUN. <br />
<br />
Running down the stairs, Kanna realized that the stairs were still, in fact, trapped, as she saw darts flying out and axes coming down as Yufi ran as fast as she could. This was just great. If they weren't squished, then some other terrible fate was going to befall them. That was when Kief noticed a light at the end of the tunnel, and barreled forwards with Kanna and Yufi in tow. The three formed a furry wheel as they ended up bouncing down the stairs and going straight into a room. They heard a loud thud, and the boulder blocked their entryway. They were trapped now, great. <br />
<br />
Though, looking around the room, there noticed three exits. Two were on the sides of the room, and the last one was adjacent to them. The exits were connected by three stone bridges, and the room itself was more of a square with four circular points. Each point had a little alcove, as well as a different color. In the center of the room was a pedestal. Looking up, you could see a white, ovular rock resting on the pedestal. It was a white and gray rock with dark circles on the top at peculiar positions. What was this rock for?<br />
<br />
What does the group do?</span></div>

Zain watched as his companion staggered and was pinned to the ground by the vicious dragon-type Pokemon. He winced at the audible impact and turned to Amara, nodding in understanding. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #dda0dd">&quot;Just stay back. Don't strain yourself...&quot; Zain murmured, then quickly ordered Lucifer to attack the still slightly winded Gabite with a series of simple hand-signals. He'd developed them out of the necessity of the element of surprise in battle, noting that in the space of yelling out the command often gave an opponent time to counter. <b>[GROWL, FUTURE SIGHT]</b></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgb(221, 160, 221)">Lucifer gazed back at his attacker, unleashing a savage, unsettling growl that put the Gabite of guard, then managing to deftly weasel out of its grasp and channeling a burst of psychic energy that would take effect in the near future.</span></div>

This is a new start for you; you've heard much about the Arcane Realm, not every tale a favourable one, but it seems the very region itself is prone to cycles of death an rebirth - this current incarnation, you realize, doesn't seem so bad. At the very least, the sight of the Lake of the Moon is certainly unique.<br />
<br />
But you remember not to lose focus: you are first and foremost a Trainer, and that's what you're here to do: train. Calling upon two young companions (&quot;young&quot; being most definitely a figure of speech in Yamask's case) you prepare for a good old-fashioned grinding session by retrieving your trusty Fishing Rod and priming your partners to engage the first creature that pops up.<br />
<br />
With impressive style for a casual, you cast your line as far as you can, and watch as the lure vanishes from sight into the depths of the Lake. But patience is a fisherman's greatest virtue, of course, and so you mentally prepare yourself to wait.<br />
<br />
As it turns out, waiting isn't required here.<br />
<br />
Mere seconds after the water settles, you feel a violent tug on the line; then, literally out of the blue, a gigantic Seaking leaps out of the water and, with a second overwhelming pull, yanks the entire Fishing Rod straight from your hands! The line breaks and your rod goes flying into the lake, before Seaking resurfaces and, clutching the wooden instrument in its jaws, drags it into the depths!<br />
<br />
&quot;That's, uh... equal parts unlikely and upsetting&quot;, says a voice behind you.<br />
<br />
You turn around; a bearded man in his thirties, dressed in full fisherman gear, complete with a hat adorned with colorful hooks, contemplates the scenario with his arms crossed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess nobody warned you the fish here are a bit, err, temperamental. Unnaturally big, too, as you could tell.&quot; The man tries to smile, but gives up rather quickly, realizing losing your only Fishing Rod is no laughing matter. &quot;I'm, uh... Just a guy who likes to fish. David, nice to meet ya.&quot;<br />
<br />
He holds out his hand in a friendly greeting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess you're gonna need that rod back, right? Only way is to dive in. I guess I could help with that, if you want... although, I'm not sure you're good enough to face what's down there,&quot; he casually says while glancing at your small Yamask and TImburr.<br />
<br />
An awkward silence sets in while David's eyes turn absent-mindedly to the Lake, before realizing what he just said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! I-I meant no disrespect! It's just... Well, pretty big, angry fish down there, like I said. Think you, uh... think you <i>could </i>handle it?&quot;</span><br />

<br />
It happened in a flash, nearly as soon as the line sunk. A giant Seaking erupted from the water, breaking his line and throwing his rod into the lake. Almost as if taunting him, the Seaking snapped up the rod, and dove, taking it down into the lake's depths. Timburr and Yamask were shocked by the spectacle as well, unable to react.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's, uh... equal parts unlikely and upsetting&quot; Darik heard from behind him. He turned. A bearded angler stood behind him, arms crossed. &quot;Guess nobody warned you the fish here are a bit, err, temperamental. Unnaturally big, too, as you could tell.&quot; A ghost of a smile briefly crosses his lips. &quot;I'm, uh... Just a guy who likes to fish. David, nice to meet ya.&quot; He held out a hand in greeting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess you're gonna need that rod back, right? Only way is to dive in. I guess I could help with that, if you want... although, I'm not sure you're good enough to face what's down there,&quot; He eyed the duo Darik had brought along, noting their weakness. Timburr and Yamask looked down in shame.<br />
<br />
Darik crossed his own arms sternly. &quot;Well, I wasn't exactly looking for a big challenge,&quot; he confessed. &quot;I was mostly looking to test these two's capacity for teamwork and get some training in. They're quite low in level. They've got the potential, but they're far from the dream team. For now,&quot; He knelt down and patted the pair lightly, reassuringly.<br />
<br />
He sighed, rose, and swore. &quot;But my rod's gone. Never been a fish I couldn't land before. One time, was a Sharpedo, 8 feet long, fought it for an hour before I reeled it in. Never expected a goldfish of all things to best me.&quot; He closed his eyes for a moment. &quot;Well, I didn't come here for nothing. Name's Darik. And David, I will take you up on that offer. I've a score to settle now, and I know this pair is up to the challenge,&quot; He shook David the Fish Guy's outstretched hand.</span></div>

<span style="color: seagreen"><b>Meetan- </b>Things hadn't gone your way. You'd thought Herakles was an absolute sure thing, but nope, turns out he just really cared about his Copperajah! And the letter was gone?! Who could have taken it? When could have they taken it? If it was Sera who was pregnant, surely it was another member of the troupe, not just some random stranger? You had to get more information! You take your position on the wagon next to Sera and before to long the caravan is on the move again. Once the collection of wagons is moving at a steady pace again, you start to work your magic. You had much more to go off of this time, allowing you to really focus the conversation, even going as far as to use air quotes like some sort of weirdo.....<br />
<br />
&quot;Hahahaha&quot;, Sera chuckles nervously, &quot;it kind of does feel like that with the troupe, had to imagine a life outside of it sometimes. But to answer your question, there are strict rules against that, especially after last time. You see a couple of years back, a pair of performers fell in love and decided to run away together. They stole anything they could and slipped away in the night, never to be seen or heard from again. After that, the Ring Master made us all sign contracts, tying us to the the troupe for a certain time. I've still got 5 years on my contract, no early exit. Didn't really worry me at the time, but I was young and dumb, 10 years didn't seem like a long time then. The contract also has strict rules about relationships with other troupe members. You see a portion of our pay is set aside for when we leave, if we break our contracts, we lose that money, we also lose our Pokemon, which we're forced to put up as collateral. So yeah, no in-troupe relationships, no early exits, no real choice......&quot; Sera fades off, the conversation seems to have hit a bit of a nerve. </span>

</blockquote><span style="color: seagreen">The nervous chuckle only contributed to the forgone conclusion of Sera's pregnancy, but where she might have taunted more familiar friends, Alice merely remained silent and listened. The story explained why a pregnancy might be so dangerous for them. It was always a noisy minority who ruined things for the majority, but still, in a better world Alice would have thought such things to be illegal. Maybe it still was, but the Arcane Realm felt like a more old fashioned area in general. The whole thing felt icky, reminding her of those ten year slave contracts idols would be forced to sign, waiving other rights like pay and basic human decency in the process just for a vague chance at fame and glory. Alice doubted that the circus offered anything close to stardom for that sacrifice.<br />
<br />
&quot;It sounds like an idol contract to me, just with a lot less going for it.&quot; She replied, shuffling back a bit to lean against the wooden walls of the cabin. &quot;I can understand how your hands might be tied, but that's gross. I was just wondering, because if someone happened to be in that kind of bind, I'd be more than happy to help 'em out. I don't know how I could go about sorting pay, but if anyone needed help getting away with their Pokemon scot-free, it would be a no brainer in that kind of situation.&quot; Alice explained, &quot;I bet anyone who'd get away from it could sell that story for a good price to journalists, too, or at least tell it online for a lot of attention. It makes the ring leader sound like a paranoid scum bag when it's like this. Besides, if he had the power to uphold these things he should've gone after the original thieves who left, not came down like a wrecking ball on everyone else. At least where I'm from, contracts like this wouldn't stand up in court. Only crazy wota tend to agree with contracts like that, and appealing to that kind of demographic... It can be lucrative, but it creates a lot of problems.&quot;<br />
<br />
She would know, after all. Now it was just to see if Sera would bite...</span></div>

Giving your orders, Lucifer tries his best to execute them while being pinned down by the Gabite. He let's out a loud <b>growl</b> directly in the Gabite's face, but the dragon-type is unfazed despite the attack drop. The Gabite, knowing it can't meet the verbal assault in kind, instead raises its claw. It channels draconic power into it, and the claw starts glowing a vibrant blue. Lucifer uses his litheness to roll out of the way, having just enough room to get unpinned by the Gabite. <br />
<br />
The dragon type then slams its <b>Dragon Claw</b> attack into the ground, not realizing that its mark had already gotten away. At this point the Gabite was pissed off, and realized a head on assault wouldn't necessarily work. After all, if the Absol was able to escape its pin, then it would probably be able to dodge a full on physical assault. It waits, wanting to know what the next attack would be. The two stared each other down before Lucifer made the next move.<br />
<br />
Channeling psychic energy, the Absol looked skyward. Using its connection with foretelling disaster, the dark-type gains a insight into the future. Foreseeing the Gabite getting hit with a powerful psychic blast from the sky, Lucifer determines that would be the future events. The <b>Future Sight</b> was set in place, and it would strike soon. <br />
<br />
Gabite, realizing the Absol was acting like a sitting duck, determined that it utilize this to unleash a powerful attack. The Gabite looks towards the ground, and starts to <b>dig</b>. Using its claws and mouth, the Gabite swiftly digs underneath the surface. It was lurking, waiting for the best opportunity to strike. You couldn't tell where it was, or when it was going to strike, but it was going to be soon. <br />
<br />

<span style="color: RoyalBlue"><b>Liltwick</b> – With the sorry excuse of a magician’s departure, you find yourself suddenly saddled with a new companion, whom you promise to help find a new home in exchange for its assistance in tracking down your friend – to which the Kadabra readily agrees. To aid the search party, you send for your Snorlax from his edible vessel, whom you also tempt with an assurance he would finally get to consume the container upon locating Custard. Easily swayed by such sweet nothings, Pie starts to sniff the air for the Togetic’s scent, before toddling off in a seemingly random direction, with Kadabra dubiously following the giant’s footsteps as he parts effortlessly through the sea of people like a snow plow.<br />
<br />
That settled, you glance at the sun overheard as you notice the sky seems to be getting strangely… dark all of sudden. Odd, you didn’t think that much time had passed, but regardless you’d better be getting back to the shop soon before you lose your apprenticeship on the very first day. Keeping Carrot by your side just in case, you hurry back towards where you vaguely recall the bakery being, hoping you’ll be able to find your way there without a guide this time.<br />
<br />
With your Carbink acting as a makeshift magnetic compass to navigate instead, eventually you manage to stumble back to your destination. Opening the door, you come upon Lucius standing alone behind the counter, and he glances up abruptly at the bell’s chime, seeming almost surprised to see you there. He then composes himself, and smiles.<br />
<br />
“Ah, you’ve returned… And you found the eggs, I see.”<br />
<br />
He nods approvingly at the carton you’re carrying, though something about his expression appears a bit… off. It’s then that you notice the Blissey from before is nowhere to be seen, and Carrot’s ears perk as it too senses something fishy about the whole situation. Before you can react though, a wave of wooziness washes over you, and for some reason your legs feel weak and weighted like lead, unable to run or even move an inch as he approaches.<br />
<br />
“I suppose we should begin our first lesson then…” His warm, melting voice weaves in and out like static, fading fast from your consciousness. “…Which is, don’t just blindly accept food from strangers.” He watches with calm as your lids grow heavy, hands shoved casually in his coat pockets – yet a flash of genuine sympathy seems to cross his eyes as your own gradually succumb to slumber.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, kid,” you distantly hear him sigh. “I tried to warn you, but.... You <i>really</i> shouldn’t have come back here.”<br />
<br />
…<br />
<br />
You wake some time later to discover yourself trapped in a dim, dank room – perhaps the basement? Your limbs have been bound to a chair, and beneath it inscribed on the floor in red paint (or more likely blood) appears to be some kind of bizarre symbol: an ornate pentagram within a circle, like one might use in a satanic summoning ritual to call upon a demon. Lines extend out from the center of the star and crawl up the walls like spiderwebs, glowing faintly as energy seems to travel along them from above ground, leading back to the source.<br />
<br />
You haven’t much time to admire the morbid décor though, as you realize both your bag and Poké Balls have all been taken from you, and Carrot is missing as well. …However, you do hear humming off to the side, and scan slowly to see BB the Blissey singing cheerfully to herself as she sharpens a pair of shears on a grindstone. She catches your gaze, and turns with a grin as she shockingly speaks inside your still muddled mind:<br />
<br />
<i>“Ah, you’re awake!”</i> She beams with pure delight as she clasps her winged paws together, the angelic image utterly at odds with the current chilling surroundings. <i>“Now then, we can finally begin the ceremony~”</i><br />
<br />
How do you respond?</span>

He was warned, after all. This was the expected result. But, he still held out hope. So why, why did he still feel betrayed? He put trust in a total stranger, and paid for it. He was so use to being able to fall back on people. If you pulled this shit in Team Skull you got your ass handed to you. So why did he think it would be the same as it always had been. <br />
<br />
Of course, he wasn't exactly proficient in demonic rituals. Well, even proficient is a strong term. He was total lost, but he could at least ascertain he was the sacrifice here. If this way his fate, then may it be so. This was, after all, his first real time exploring a place that was outside of Alola. And this is how it ended up. He'd become a sacrifice. But, in a weird way, wasn't <br />
that how things always would end up?<br />
<br />
Looking around, he noticed the Blissey sharpening shears on a whetstone. Great. He was going to be cut up and ground into paste. Or something along those lines. He had nothing on him, his bag and Carbink both being gone. There was nothing he could do but sit and wait. That's when he felt his mind being probed, and the angelic figure of the Blissey turning hiding a devil in disguise. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, this is my 'just desserts' isn't it?&quot; he muttered, not caring to really look at the morbid scenery around him. &quot;I guess the saying the devil's in the details applies literally here, huh? Tell me, what does BB stand for? Black Blossom? Bottom black? Big Bertha?&quot; He questioned jokingly. If he was going to die, he'd at least going out optimistically. <br />
<br />
&quot;But I digress, your name isn't important. All that matters is that I'm getting chopped to bits by a Pokemon, correct?&quot; He said with a half-smile, eyes cast downward. There was a sense of serenity here. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh well, guess I wont be able to make my special recipe for Malasadas anymore. At least, unless I make a deal. You things are all about contracts, right? Then let's make one. My freedom for that recipe.&quot;</span></div>

&quot;You're a fisherman alright! Oh, that reminds me of that one time when I reeled in that one Wailo... No, wait, there's no time for that,&quot; he says, shaking his head. Perhaps it's for the best - shows of one-upmanship between two fishermen are known to go on for a while, and you really do have to get back the matter about that Fishing Rod of yours…<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, here's the thing. I got a way to help you reach the bottom of the Lake of Moon, but I don't wanna be the one responsible for you never making it back out. Like I said, the fish down there are abnormally large, and many of them unusually violent for their species – trust me on that, if this was your run-of-the-mill fishing spot I wouldn’t be wasting my time here. So, here's the deal...&quot;<br />
<br />
David retrieves a Lure Ball from his utility belt and tosses it to the ground. An Octillery, considerably large by its species standards, stares at Yamask and Timburr nonchalantly before yawning lazily in apparent disinterest.<br />
<br />
&quot;You said you wanted to train, and I gotta gauge your strength before I decide to help you anyway; I'd say there's only one way we can settle this,&quot; he says with a grin. &quot;Let's see how well your two friends can work together! Knock out my Octillery and I'll give you what you need to go after your Fishing Rod. How's that sound?&quot;<br />
<br />
Well Darik, are you on board?<br />

<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: seagreen">DannyDrawsaLot</span></b><span style="color: seagreen">:<br />
Despite now knowing there is a viable path through the pink mist, you refuse to leave anyone behind - what kind of Trainer would, anyway?!<br />
<br />
But in order for you to find Stryke, you need to find a way through this strange veil. Guessing it must be of some sort of magical origin, you decide to counter with the exact opposite - evil energy. Shayd gets to work, firing off blast after blast of Dark Pulses.<br />
<br />
It seems to work! At least to some extent. The dark power pushes the pink mist back just long enough for you to see the way ahead for a few steps, before the substance surrounds you and blocks your path again. This goes on for quite a while, Shayd pushing itself to the limit with Pulse after Pulse, and it's only thanks to its tremendous effort that you're able to make any progress.<br />
<br />
*Shayd gained 2 Levels!*<br />
<br />
After a while, you reach a clearing where the mist is thinner. And sure enough, you also finally track down Stryke! The Pawniard has its back to you and its blades extended; it's staring at something across the clearing, body tensed up...<br />
<br />
<i>*Awooooooo!*</i><br />
<br />
The bone-chilling howl echoes across the forest once more, this time much closer than before. In fact, you can spot the origin with your own eyes: across the clearing from Stryke's position is a lone Mightyena, baring its fangs.<br />
<br />
The beast, despite its ferocious appearance, seems to not have hurt Stryke yet in the time it took you to catch up. In fact, it seems they haven't started fighting at all, but merely sizing each other up. The hound is clearly restless, but it hasn't pounced yet, despite your Pawniard being much smaller...<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span></div>

<b><u>IV. Emperor’s Castle</u></b> - The main castle itself, made of beautiful marble stone with blue spinnerets atop the towers. Despite its majesty, the Castle itself feels like a labyrinth for those unacquainted with it. After all, only the foyer, ballroom, and throne room are open to the general public, and the research labs, soldier and servant quarters, and even the royal family’s private quarters are often off limits. What secrets this castle has for the years it’s stood, it’s said only the King knows. </span></span>

</blockquote><span style="color: royalblue">Kou stood at the bottom of the grand marble steps that led to the Emperor's Castle higher up. The palace itself was an architectural marvel, but Kou wasn't here simply to take in the sights.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well,&quot; he whispered to himself as he adjusted his hometown's traditional red vest. &quot;Upon reaching a new land, one would be wise to introduce himself to its ruler. So said my father.&quot;<br />
<br />
He had intended to take the regional Gym Challenge upon reaching Fizzytopia, but soon he discovered this was a land different from any other. Gyms existed, indeed, but in a much different capacity. How, then, was he supposed to follow the Trainer's Path as had been customary in his family for generations?<br />
<br />
&quot;The road to Master takes many forms... So said my grandfather. I should make myself known to the Lord of this kingdom and offer my services; perhaps doing so will earn me comparable recognition to conquering a Gym.&quot;<br />
<br />
Next to Kou, a massive Snorlax nodded quietly. Gigas was a unique specimen - his Trainer's unflinching discipline molding the bear from a young age, not into the slothful beast one would expect, but instead into a dedicated, level-headed warrior. However, he was still a Snorlax.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm afraid the Castle guard might not take kindly to your presence, old friend. I regret I must recall you now...&quot;<br />
<br />
The colossus nodded again; Kou knew he was disappointed, but there would be other chances for Gigas to join him, certainly. For now, in the interest of a peaceful introduction, Kou would proceed alone.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, the Kanto-native looked ahead, and took his first steps along the marble steps towards the Emperor's Castle...</span></div>

<span style="color: plum"><br />
To secure this fish man's help, he'd have to fight his Octillery with this newbie team. Well, he'd started to talk about a Wailord, and had an Octillery, neither of which were fish, so maybe he wasn't quite a fish man, after all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give me a moment,&quot; Darik said, closing his eyes briefly to think about how to move forward.<br />
<br />
Darik's mind went to strategy. He'd have to do some thinking if he was going to overcome this challenge. His pair of Mightyena could easily make short work of this fight, but that would ruin the point, wouldn't it? He'd have to make all the use he could of the limited abilities his Pokemon had at their disposal right now.<br />
<br />
An Octillery was definitely a challenge at normal size, let alone one so big. But that size might actually be able to be a benefit. As a species, they were instinctively driven to hide in tight spaces, being agoraphobic by nature. Larger tentacles also means more space between the suckers, so a harder time keeping a grip on small Pokemon. He really liked Octillery as a Pokemon, thankfully, so he'd put some real thought on how they'd fight. His Pokemon were smaller, but still not terribly quick, so one of Octillery's main weaknesses, its low mobility on land, was not as big a shortcoming in this situation. They had a small agility advantage, but that was a small grace here. He'd have to focus more on the numbers advantage he had.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right,&quot; he said, opening his eyes. &quot;I'm ready. Are you two?&quot; The Timburr and Yamask didn't look terribly confident, but they weren't about to disobey, and he could tell they trusted his leadership. That was good. They nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
He cracked his neck right, then left. &quot;TImburr, start off with a <b>Leer</b>! Yamask, flank with <b>Astonish</b>! Then drift backwards as Timburr charges it from the other side with a <b>Power-Up Punch</b>, and throw an <b>Energy Ball</b> at the big octopus!&quot;<br />

<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: seagreen"><b> Meetan- </b>You were much more familiar with Sera's situation than the acrobat would have expected. The unethical contract was quite similar to those that idols were forced to sign. You expressed your thoughts on the contract, adding in how someone willing to leak such information to a media outlet could surely make a nice bit of coin for their story. You do everything you can to make Sera feel like she has to make a play for your help and finally it works!<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, don't you?&quot; Sera gave you a serious, yet hopeful look. &quot;Yes I'm pregnant, its only early on but I'm certain of it. I managed to slip off to a doctor while we were performing in the Hamlet. I don't know what to do Alice, we need the money and our Pokemon if we're going to have any chance at a happy life. You really think that the contract wouldn't hold up in court? If we stole the money that was rightfully ours, do you think the Ring Leader would risk going to the authorities? I don't want to be running from the law, we won't be able to when I'm heavily pregnant and it would be even worse once I have the baby. I just don't know what to do!&quot; Sera begins to sob, tears streaming down her face as she throws her arms around you. Sera had finally opened up to you, which was probably a good thing, it seemed she had been keeping all of this emotion bottled up inside. Perhaps that's why Hatenna had been trying to avoid her? Sera still hadn't confirmed who the father was either, perhaps he could be of help?</span></div>

You came here to train, and despite the considerable setback of losing your only Fishing Rod, it seems you got a nice opportunity to practice after all.<br />
<br />
The fisherman (who despite this title seems inclined to catch anything but) has sent out an impressive-looking Octillery, who looks decidedly unimpressed. It actually looks kind of Moody, now that you think about it.<br />
<br />
David remains silent, with his arms crossed. It seems he's letting you have the first swing, which you gladly accept.<br />
<br />
Timburr throws its most menacing stare at Octillery, hoping it'll have some sort of effect, although the octopus seems largely uninterested in the much smaller combatant – as well as in the fight in general. It isn't until your Yamask creeps up from the other side and sneakily lands a blow that the Water Pokemon finally begins to care - however, it's perhaps too late, as the Ghost is quick to follow up its stealthy strike with a point-blank Energy Ball that Octillery <i>definitely</i> doesn't enjoy!<br />
<br />
It is then that David finally cracks a smile and punches the air, as if he’d been waiting for this opening the entire time.<br />
<br />
&quot;... Now! Wrap it!&quot;<br />
<br />
With a sudden boost of speed, no doubt from its rare Ability, Octillery suddenly turns to Timburr as it lunges for its Power-Up Punch and wraps a heavy tentacle around it, immobilizing the fighter! Then, it brings the trapped Timburr close to its mouth-cannon and stares at you defiantly, as if asking &quot;do you feel lucky, punk?&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, do you?<br />

Giving your orders, Lucifer tries his best to execute them while being pinned down by the Gabite. He let's out a loud <b>growl</b> directly in the Gabite's face, but the dragon-type is unfazed despite the attack drop. The Gabite, knowing it can't meet the verbal assault in kind, instead raises its claw. It channels draconic power into it, and the claw starts glowing a vibrant blue. Lucifer uses his litheness to roll out of the way, having just enough room to get unpinned by the Gabite. <br />
<br />
The dragon type then slams its <b>Dragon Claw</b> attack into the ground, not realizing that its mark had already gotten away. At this point the Gabite was pissed off, and realized a head on assault wouldn't necessarily work. After all, if the Absol was able to escape its pin, then it would probably be able to dodge a full on physical assault. It waits, wanting to know what the next attack would be. The two stared each other down before Lucifer made the next move.<br />
<br />
Channeling psychic energy, the Absol looked skyward. Using its connection with foretelling disaster, the dark-type gains a insight into the future. Foreseeing the Gabite getting hit with a powerful psychic blast from the sky, Lucifer determines that would be the future events. The <b>Future Sight</b> was set in place, and it would strike soon. <br />
<br />
Gabite, realizing the Absol was acting like a sitting duck, determined that it utilize this to unleash a powerful attack. The Gabite looks towards the ground, and starts to <b>dig</b>. Using its claws and mouth, the Gabite swiftly digs underneath the surface. It was lurking, waiting for the best opportunity to strike. You couldn't tell where it was, or when it was going to strike, but it was going to be soon. <br />
<br />
What do you do?</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: rgb(221, 160, 221)">Zain observed as the Gabite burrowed under the ground. &quot;It's quite tenacious,&quot; he muttered. He'd have to make a spur of the moment decision, let alone one made from a precarious position.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm fairly certain it'll come up at any sign of movement or vibration...&quot; He continued, standing his ground and holding a hand in front of Amara lest she provoke the Gabite. <i>If that's the case...I'll have to improvise.</i> He carefully picked up a stone the size of a fruit that laid on the ground, then tossing it at the ground, the stone clacking against the bridge. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lucifer, start with a <b>Quick Attack </b>and please do follow up with a <b>Throat Chop </b>if it comes up.&quot; He ordered, steeling his resolve as Lucifer nodded, the disciplined Pokemon staunchly holding his position.</span></div>

Despite now knowing there is a viable path through the pink mist, you refuse to leave anyone behind - what kind of Trainer would, anyway?!<br />
<br />
But in order for you to find Stryke, you need to find a way through this strange veil. Guessing it must be of some sort of magical origin, you decide to counter with the exact opposite - evil energy. Shayd gets to work, firing off blast after blast of Dark Pulses.<br />
<br />
It seems to work! At least to some extent. The dark power pushes the pink mist back just long enough for you to see the way ahead for a few steps, before the substance surrounds you and blocks your path again. This goes on for quite a while, Shayd pushing itself to the limit with Pulse after Pulse, and it's only thanks to its tremendous effort that you're able to make any progress.<br />
<br />
*Shayd gained 2 Levels!*<br />
<br />
After a while, you reach a clearing where the mist is thinner. And sure enough, you also finally track down Stryke! The Pawniard has its back to you and its blades extended; it's staring at something across the clearing, body tensed up...<br />
<br />
<i>*Awooooooo!*</i><br />
<br />
The bone-chilling howl echoes across the forest once more, this time much closer than before. In fact, you can spot the origin with your own eyes: across the clearing from Stryke's position is a lone Mightyena, baring its fangs.<br />
<br />
The beast, despite its ferocious appearance, seems to not have hurt Stryke yet in the time it took you to catch up. In fact, it seems they haven't started fighting at all, but merely sizing each other up. The hound is clearly restless, but it hasn't pounced yet, despite your Pawniard being much smaller...<br />
<br />
What will you do?</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: seagreen">Ritchie's plan had worked, luckily. &quot;Yeah! That's the stuff Shayd!' Ritchie cheered on his Pokemon, as she shot repeated dark pulses, the dark energy pushing back the thick pink mist for just long enough so Ritchie could move a bit, as the mist set back in, only for it to be hit by another dark pulse, so yes, this system was working.<br />
<br />
After some walking, they reached a clearing, an opening in the thick forest where the mist was much thinner than everywhere else, perhaps this was a sign of some sort? Nonetheless, they had found Stryke! Rushing towards him, Ritchie asked Stryke multiple questions, exasperated. &quot;Stryke, buddy! Are you okay?&quot; Ritchie trailed off. Something was off. Stryke was tensed, blades out, legs spread, in a battle-ready stance, his eyes fixed ahead.<br />
<br />
Ritchie began to follow his gaze, but it was an exercise in futility - whatever Stryke was staring out let out another deep, bone chilling howl, this time, the howl was close this time around. Turning, Ritchie spotted the origin of the howl. Across, at the other side of the clearing, was a lone Mightyena, its fangs bared, it giving off a low growl.<br />
<br />
The Mightyena hadn't pounced on Stryke yet, despite being much bigger than Stryke was, perhaps it was a nice Pokemon, maybe Ritchie could try befriending it? Ritchie took a step forward, only for Gazza to put a wing in front of him, stopping him and cawed, telling him to look closer.<br />
<br />
And look closer Ritchie did, seeing that no, this Mightyena was not friendly, or afraid. It was simply sizing up Stryke, waiting to pounce. &quot;Well, lets not give it the chance to.&quot; Ritchie thought aloud, then turned to Gazza. &quot;If that Mightyena tries anything, be ready to blast it back with a Heat Wave.&quot;</span></div>

<span style="color: seagreen"><b> Meetan- </b>You were much more familiar with Sera's situation than the acrobat would have expected. The unethical contract was quite similar to those that idols were forced to sign. You expressed your thoughts on the contract, adding in how someone willing to leak such information to a media outlet could surely make a nice bit of coin for their story. You do everything you can to make Sera feel like she has to make a play for your help and finally it works!<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, don't you?&quot; Sera gave you a serious, yet hopeful look. &quot;Yes I'm pregnant, its only early on but I'm certain of it. I managed to slip off to a doctor while we were performing in the Hamlet. I don't know what to do Alice, we need the money and our Pokemon if we're going to have any chance at a happy life. You really think that the contract wouldn't hold up in court? If we stole the money that was rightfully ours, do you think the Ring Leader would risk going to the authorities? I don't want to be running from the law, we won't be able to when I'm heavily pregnant and it would be even worse once I have the baby. I just don't know what to do!&quot; Sera begins to sob, tears streaming down her face as she throws her arms around you. Sera had finally opened up to you, which was probably a good thing, it seemed she had been keeping all of this emotion bottled up inside. Perhaps that's why Hatenna had been trying to avoid her? Sera still hadn't confirmed who the father was either, perhaps he could be of help?</span>

</blockquote><span style="color: seagreen">It was a relief to hear Sera confessing to everything. It was a lot easier than having to dance around the subject and walk on eggshells, so Alice nodded her head to confirm that she was indeed in the know. Her Pokemon looked up then, too, curious as to where this would lead. The performer's distress bothered them, particularly Mimi. The little mime's eyes also glazed over with tears, little body quivering, and Alice gave the Pokemon an apologetic look over Sera's shoulder. She was fine to let the woman cry, patting her back a few times soothingly, grip firm but comfortable. Alice wasn't going anywhere while she was needed here, but the fact that Trapinch's parents were moving further and further away with every second also weighed on the trainer's mind and heart...<br />
<br />
&quot;Stealing the money that should be yours after signing a contract might not work out. It's the Pokemon thing that I feel won't hold up so well, and if he's running a carnival of fear and intimidation it's never going to look good. Basic human rights and all that.&quot; Alice explained. &quot;But I also know the Arcane Realm runs a bit more old school. He could end up dragged out of his trailer by the masses and their pitchforks or people could tell you to get over it...&quot; She knew this possibly wasn't helping, and Eridian's scolding expression from across the way confirmed that, but Alice also wanted to be honest. &quot;How many friends do you have here? And who's the father? I'll totally stand up for you, and I probably have enough connections and followers to make an impact in the long term, but at this immediate moment whoever you can rely on here is really important. Do you know if anyone else has had problems with the leader or how the place is run? If everyone bands together and revolts it'll make things a lot harder for him, full stop. The law usually has bigger things to worry about than some bully and people trying to live their lives.&quot; Or, so it was in this magical world. Justice usually won out here, but not always - it was why Alice was running every possibility and option through her mind as it came to her.</span></div>

<span style="color: rgb(65, 105, 225)">Sil wandered down Fool’s Path, enjoying the sights of the strange new land she had just arrived in. Trailing a ways behind her was her partner Hailstone, an Alolan Sandshrew, who was darting between the dappled shade on the path, avoiding the glowing patches of sunlight that would quickly melt the ice off of his frozen back. The two passed various branches of the Fool’s Path, some clean cobblestone roads with signs indicating their destination, others dirt paths choked with shrubbery leading into the unknown. Sil stared down each and every one, lost in thought, feeling a sense of both nervousness and excitement slowly building up inside her.<br />
<br />
She and Hailstone had come from Sinnoh to adventure in Fizzytopia in order to grow and strengthen themselves, landing first in the Arcane Realm after a long boat ride from Canalave City. An old woman in the port town they arrived in told the two about Fool’s Path, recommending that such budding youngins’ should travel it first as new trainers wander the route due to its many open roads and possibilities. Sil had hoped that--<br />
<br />
“Squeak!”<br />
<br />
She was jolted from her musings by the cry of Hailstone, who had dashed ahead of her while she was lost in thought. She looked down at the Alolan Sandshrew, who was staring intensely at her. Satisfied that he got her attention, he waited for a bit as she fast-walked up to him, but quickly grew impatient and darted ahead again. It seemed he was excited to explore this new place too.</span>

<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>

</blockquote><span style="color: RoyalBlue">Following your partner, you continue to notice a variety of paths branching here and there broken up by a combination of trees, clearings filled with an abundance of wild pokemon, and other young trainers looking to improve their skills through the time-honored tradition of battle. But as you continue down the path before you Hailstone seems to begin slowing down, becoming less interested in the area and more confused than anything else, turning his head towards you and giving you a questioning glance before once again running off on his own.<br />
<br />
Curious about his behavior, you start paying more attention to the areas you've been passing through, only to notice that they seem to be the same ones over and over again. You see the same trainers and pokemon repeating their actions each time you pass them by. Having tired from his hasty pace Hailstone opts to remain by your side as you two try to wrap your brains around the odd happenings of the area.<br />
<br />
Strangely as you two travel together progress seems to be being made. The familiar sites you had been encountering stopped repeating. You finally reach bizarre crossroads of sorts with 2 different options laying before you: One appears to be a dusty path that fades as it goes off into the distance. You can giant mountain's peak jutting out on the horizon, and from the looks of it is a giant volcano. The other path is one that keeps along the cobblestone you've been walking on. You can see two landmarks on the horizon, one being a series of massive cathedral towers reaching for the sky. They are enshrouding a nearby hamlet, which according to the guide, is home to a series of master craftsmen under a variety of different crafts.</span></div>

<article class="message-body js-selectToQuote">
<div class="bbWrapper"><span style="color: seagreen"><b>Missingno. Master</b> - With the Golurk threatening to bring the very cave down upon all of your heads, you clearly need to end this before it gets any worse. Twisting your cap on your head, you pitch a Dusk Ball like you were in the major leagues, the ball sailing towards the hulking behemoth of a roadblock in front of you. Just as it's looking like the ball will connect, the Goluck holds out one arm, catching the Dusk Ball in its hand. Energy pulsing through the golem, its massive fingers wrap around the ball before it proceeds to crush the orb, causing it to splinter and shatter in its grip, leaving naught but dust of the capturing device.<br />
<br />
As if the insult of destroying your ball wasn't bad enough, the Golurk's other arm reaches back to the wall behind it, large mechanical fingers digging into the stone work to wrap around a crystal in the wall. Ripping the crystal from the earth a bright glow envelops the fist of the Golurk before it comes crashing down to the ground, a massive shockwave erupting forward, ripping up the ground in a massive <b>Tectonic Rage</b> that barrels through the earth and into Aster, the resulting spikes from the floor sending the Toxapex flying through the cave to land at your feet, unconscious.<br />
<br />
Anion's companion now out of the battle, the Minun looses an <b>Ice Beam</b> as per your orders, more out of desperation than anything else, the cold beam lancing into the Golurk's chest and causing a large frozen patch across the cracked clay. The Golurk reels for a moment from the attack, before the glow of energy from its core fades and its form shatters into mere shards of Z-Crystals to scatter across the floor, leaving your path now unblocked thanks to the large hole in the far wall the construct just created for you in preparation for its final attack.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: lemonchiffon"><b>TheKnightsFury</b> - With Grookey and Rookidee returning to your side, you opt to give them the rest they deserve as opposed to forcing them to press on. The decision doesn't even present itself for your Dreepy, though, as the Gardevoir knocks it out before you, reducing your team of viable Pokemon against this fight further. With Toxtricity in rough shape, it's clear that the monster will require backup, which your Blastoise is sent out to provide. As Toxtricity begins to <b>Taunt</b> the Gardevoir to prevent the bag of tricks it has up its sleeve, the clever creature seems to have known this trick was up yours, as a <b>Magic Coat</b> surrounds the humanoid Pokemon. The Taunt bounces off the coating, and you can almost hear the words &quot;I'm rubber and you're glue&quot; in the air as Toxtricity becomes enraged.<br />
<br />
At this moment, your Blastoise takes to the field and cocks its cannons, before dousing the area in a <b>Life Dew</b>, providing much needed healing for Toxtricity. Healing that is only further amped as the Electric Pokemon rushes at the Wigglytuff, delivering a <b>Drain Punch</b> into the balloon. Gardevoir reacts to this with a chiming sound, a familiar <b>Heal Bell</b> ringing through the area and curing Wigglytuff of its paralysis, though not its confusion, which it struggles with for a moment before slapping itself in the face with its ears. Blastoise turns its cannons on the Gardevoir, and a <b>Sludge Bomb</b> volley explodes around the Fairy for some hefty damage, though unfortunately no poison seems to have come from it.<br />
<br />
Toxtricity looks to put some extra hurt on the reeling Wigglytuff, but the balloon seems to have gotten over its confusion for now. And that's all it needs to start glowing a bright white with energy. There's almost no time to react to the coming <b>Self-Destruct</b>, at least, for everyone other than Gardevoir, whose <u>Telepathy</u> gives more than enough forewarning to duck behind some crates, tossing Kojo behind a wall with telekinetic force to get the trainer out of harm's way as well. The resulting explosion is devastating, sending Toxtricity and Blastoise skidding backwards as well as ripping up a fair chunk of the street, the balloon collapsing to the ground, unconscious. Toxtricity and Blastoise are both incredibly unappreciative of the damage, with Toxtricity now looking a bit worse off than prior to the healing received and Blastoise already developing some nasty scrapes from the debris. At least now the fight is two on one, to which Blastoise quickly capitalizes with a <b>Flash Cannon</b>, dealing a bit more damage to the Gardevoir, though the graceful creature shrugs it off well enough. With battling sounds dying down from the alley, it's clear the fighting there is starting to wear down as well.<br />
<br />
<i>Toxtricity gained 1 level.<br />
Grookey gained 1 level.<br />
Rookidee gained 1 level.</i><br />
<br />
Not liking the two versus one situation, Kojo shoots you a quick glare, to which Gardevoir promptly responds with a <b>Psychic</b> wave, tossing Toxtricity aside and leaving the beast in the same unconscious state as your Dreepy. &quot;It's like you don't even want to get to the boss.&quot; The boy chides.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: royalblue"><b>ChrisClark13</b> - With the scoundrel before you more than happy to continue this fight, the Grimer lunges forward with a <b>Poison Jab</b>, striking into Annahime with a solid blow. The Vulpix responds happily to your order to <b>Disable</b> the move, preventing the sludge monster from using the action for a little while going forward. Continuing the assault, Annahime engulfs the monster in a <b>Fire Spin</b>, trapping the Grimer in a fiery vortex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I see how it is.&quot; The thug groans, &quot;Give it your own <b>Disable</b> and <b>Snarl</b>.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Grimer obliges, its own <b>Disable</b> preventing Annahime's next Fire Spin, the fox unable to use the move for a little bit. An angry barking noise looses a dark wave as the Grimer proceeds to <b>Snarl</b> at the fox, dealing a decent bit of damage and reducing Annahime's Special Attack as a result, to which the Vulpix promptly whines.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahaha! Perfect job!&quot; The man laughs at the misfortune that has befallen your fox before barking a couple more orders, &quot;Go with another <b>Venoshock</b> and <b>Headbutt</b>! Get that pathetic fox out of our way already!&quot;<br />
<br />
The old man behind you groans at the ongoing battle, with every passing moment glancing at his cart of flowers. &quot;Oh, please hurry along with this ruffian...&quot; He speaks up softly, poorly attempting at urgency, &quot;These flowers do have an expiration... what ones still remain from the little one's earlier frolic through the cart.&quot;<br />
<br />
At the words 'little one' the Eevee promptly looks up at the old man from the ground, having been intently watching your fun looking battle. &quot;Vee!&quot;</span></div>
